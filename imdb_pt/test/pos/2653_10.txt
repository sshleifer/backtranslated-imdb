There's really no way to compare this movie to any other movie because no one has ever done anything like it and no one will ever. And this really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At a minimum, it deserves to be seen with a great sound system. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science fiction and wanted to see a "space" movie. Remember that this movie was made before the first landing on the Moon. <br /> <br /> There we sat, waiting for him to begin. But, SURPRISE! There were no cartoons, no attractions nearby. The theater owner at Cooper Theater, for some reason, chose to play "The Star-Spangled Banner" with the lights still on, so we all stood, never did that in a movie before or after and then sat down again when it was over . Then the theater became completely DARK and the strange opening began with the almost invisible blank screen. <br /> <br /> The opening ended and my seat began to VIBRATE when the blue screen with MGM's lion appeared, along with the first depth. serious notes, and then my senses were crushed, listening to "Also Sprach Zarathustra" for the first time in my life. The ride was just beginning. <br /> <br /> (I recommend you watch this opening, this movie, in a DARK room with your subwoofer as high as possible to get the effect I felt in that theater.) Of course, it took a while before we get to outer space and the film that followed was anything but a science fiction movie. INTERMISSION has come (a good thing, highly underrated and unused nowadays) and we all looked at each other in wonder, we caught our breath, and then the ride resumed, wilder than before. <br /> <br /> I've seen 7 more times next year, always in a real theater, like all theaters before the multiplexes. I could have been "high" once, but I did not go to see it again and again because I was "stumbling". I went because I knew I was seeing a work of art. It was so DONN BEAUTIFUL; the sound you can feel in your bones followed by a terrifying silence; the unimaginable and unimaginable tourist spots; the affection for HAL turning into terror. And, of course, WTF was Kubrick really trying to pass on to me? Years and years and many other exhibitions later, I also understand, as I always imagine. Read someone else's comments, if you are looking for someone to explain to you or search the web, you will find "explanations", that is not my goal in writing these comments. <br /> <br /> What I expect What to do is encourage you to patiently watch it, enjoy its beauty the way you would like to watch a sunset while listening to the most beautiful song you know (for example, Gayne Ballet Suite or Blue Danube); taste like a wonderful meal, drink like a good wine; look and listen to the hidden clues and symbols that are there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick wanted to share some things with you that he found handsome and he wanted you to think about where you are. a human, came and where you're going. <br /> <br /> If this is too much work for your brain, and you can not see and hear and reflect on the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's film, then forgive my frankness, but your life is so significant as of a tapir or a pre-monolithic monkey. If you want stupid escape, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries and sensuality and can have an open mind, this movie will add something to your life.
