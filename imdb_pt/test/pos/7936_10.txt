I loved this movie from the first time I saw it many years ago. I'm not sure how many times I've seen, maybe 10, maybe 20. The last time I watched I was struck by a detail that I had not noticed before. <br /> <br /> End of the picture, the dead heroes are transported back to the city via sled. There are some closes of the dead. What struck me most was a shot of the young blonde. All you see on the screen is his profile from head to toe. His hands are holding a flickering candle. The wind is blowing and her thick blond hair is dancing in the wind, attuned to the glow of the candle flame. The contrast between death and the life he lost is incredibly powerful. The moving hair and candle flame remind us of the life force that once inhabited your body. <br /> <br /> Every time I revisit this movie I see something new.
