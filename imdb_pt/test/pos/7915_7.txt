Eisenstein's first sound film recounts the ice battle of 1242 when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated the Livonian knights, eager to bring Russia under Roman Catholicism. Made in 1938, Nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda: Germanic knights, with their sinister (and somewhat pathetic) helmets, are obvious substitutes for the Nazis. The carnage by the knights when they enter a Russian city seems a prophetic warning of the massacres of World War II. The film ends with a warning: those who came to Russia with the sword will die by the sword. Made in delicate black and white (somewhat reminiscent of a daguerreotype), it also marked Eisenstein's return to official favor. In the late 1920s, Stalin wanted Soviet filmmakers to stop experimenting and make films that would be more populist and palatable to the Russian public. That stopped Eisenstein's career in Russia for a decade, and in Nevsky he came back with his most accessible film. Nevsky's strength is in his second half, which presents the battle itself, and is seen as a milestone in film history: never before (and probably never after) would a battle be so vivid on the screen. Another strong point is Prokofiev's beautiful and haunting soundtrack (using a composer to score a movie was completely unusual at the time). One of its weaknesses: comic relief (in the form of two simple-minded Russian warriors trying to attract a handsome Russian peasant) is really shocking.
