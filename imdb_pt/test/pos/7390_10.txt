"It's funny your worst nightmare always seems so far away!" <br /> <br /> The characters of Dark Habour, a couple (Alan Rickman & Polly Hunter) and a hobo (Norman Reedus) are entering a game full of hidden sexual energy and betrayal. Tempting breaks from time to time increase tensions and give plenty of room for interpretation. Good acting and a story that, if it is not using the brain, will leave you in confusion. You have to watch it at least twice. The force itself is in its unconventionality and in Alan Rickman, of course. Those who love him will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's not a typical movie in prime time, but Well Done!
