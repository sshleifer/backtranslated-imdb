It's by far the most definitive movie about the police force I've seen. Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it has all the elements of an RGV film. Uninterrupted direct dialogues, blunt handling of the subject, brilliant direction and superb performances (even for those with little work to do in the film). The chemistry between Nana and the Don, even if they are professional rivals, is incredible. And so are the small events as an insider not giving information to Imtiaz, even when he is being beaten in the closet, but only to Nana when he is away. The change in working conditions with the elderly change is treated wonderfully. The first half keeps one absolutely absorbed, moving like a documentary with Nana acting as a mentor to Jatin, explaining to him the complexities and philosophy of the work. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the brightest movies about cops in India. movie theater. Definitely not to be missed.
