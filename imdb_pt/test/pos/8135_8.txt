Whenever an idea succeeds during the "Golden Days" of the Silent Movies, you can bet your last dollar that this would be repeated; although "Rework" is the term used. Of course we could argue that this reworking business never left us, because success in film or TV always leads to a trend; with all parties competing to create their own version of that hit movie or TV show. <br /> <br /> To this last premise, we strongly disagree; because this is copying or plagiarism, pure and simple. <br /> <br /> THIS, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, certainly must have been very well received; for ANGORA LOVE (Hal Roach / MGM, 1929) was reworked on Roach Lot, not once, but twice over the next three years. We were presented with LAUGHING GRAVY (Roach / MGM, 1931), in which the goat was replaced by a cute little dog. In addition, the climate is transformed into the death of winter, in the middle of a blizzard. They also made other changes in the lineup, replacing landlord Edgar Kennedy with landlord Charlie Hall. The second reformulation of the hidden animal premise is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP (Roach / MGM, 1932), which replaced a female monkey from an extinct and extinct circus, to which Stan and Babe were former employees . The circus paid its employees with their goods and the boys received the chimpanzee as their final payment. <br /> BACK to our original 'victim', the subject of today, ANGORA LOVE. Recommend? The short begins simply enough. The boys find the goat on the street and the nanny in return follows them back to their lodging house; after Stan feeds a donut for her. The following comic moments are generated with the interaction between L & H and the slow burning exponent, Edgar Kennedy, his Landlord. The impact of the incident is amplified when the interaction occurs at night. And how lucky would that be; your room is situated directly above the lordship's chambers. <br /> <br /> Beyond the noise, the goat bath, the odor and the suspicion of landlord Edgar that Laurel and Hardy had someone else illegally in the room; We had a lot of fun with a little gag, which may well have been lost by the Censors. As he warned the boys about the noise they were making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person being there at night regardless of their sex. <br /> <br /> Your camera shot is made from inside the boy. bedroom, over the shoulder. With Edgar in the hallway and facing them, he warns; "Remember, this is a reputable establishment!" Just as he says so, a lady dressed in evening clothes passes behind the Landlord; followed by a uniformed sailor, who leans his hat forward as they pass by! POODLE SCHNITZ !!
