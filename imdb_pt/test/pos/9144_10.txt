As a big fan of horror, I had given up the subgenre of vampires due to the fact that in most vampire films the vampire became feminine and not threatening, benign and basically weak. That's the attitude I brought to a Soul Night View and I'm happy to say that the vampires in this movie at least have the hunger to kill old ladies and sacrifice babies! Armand Assante, one of my favorite actors of all time, was born to play the charming vampire with savage intensity. <br /> <br /> Another thing that interests me is that the central location is the Borgo Hotel. This is cool because (and I went back to my high school copy to look for it) in Dracula, the Borgo Pass is where Jonathan Harker must pass to get to Dracula's castle. <br /> <br /> Finally, my hats for those who made the decision to make the creature a real effect and not a damn CGI! That's the great thing about many low budget movies, they can not afford the junk computer effects that haunt many Hollywood monstrosities. <br /> <br /> Bottom line ... this is better than Underworld for sure, especially if you're a purer vampire. Congratulations, JA
