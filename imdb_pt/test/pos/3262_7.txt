This Aussie movie filmed in 1999 does a good job of portraying a band of bandits in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the situation of a young life-threatening candidate who is in danger after ruining a job for his future boss. Very well represented by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is reasonably credible with some humorous moments in a scene that revolves around a bank robbery. The creation of several central themes for the story is very well done. For example. When a crim is looking for bullets for his gun. I personally have a dislike for gratuitous violence in films, and in that regard, the film did not offend. He tried and showed us the human side of the bad guys like Bryan Brown. The rest of the cast did a good job, with no real highlight that I can remember. The direction was very good in getting a convincing movie that provided good entertainment. The main primal feature that makes this a good movie is the acting and directing of Heath Ledger and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who commits stupid mistakes for short-term gratification, thinking that he is indestructible and not realizing that there are sinister people waiting to attack any error. The director, Gregor Jordan, deserves a special mention. Evaluation in my book - 7 (out of 10).
