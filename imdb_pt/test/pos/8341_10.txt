Many Christian films center around the fear of judgment and, as a result, are patronizing and indelibly cheesy. "Second Glance" hits. This is an almost perfect evangelical tool; deals with the real reason why so many young people want nothing with Christianity. It assures viewers that one has to give up sin - not fun - to succeed in the Christian lifestyle. "Second Glance" even works as a piece of film. The filmmakers were obviously working on a very low budget but were able to write a script that was dynamic enough to divert viewers from this obvious fact. This film brought me to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and thanks to the Christian seasons everywhere that show this, it certainly impacted more people than just me.
