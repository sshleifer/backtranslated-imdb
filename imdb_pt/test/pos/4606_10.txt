This is the end, and I mean the ULTIMATE, AVENTURE CLASSIC! Plot is good against evil. There have always been an abundance of films portraying gray areas, not enough about the basic good against evil to explain the actual cases of good against evil in the real world. Only recently have the filmmakers tried to balance the odds. In real life, well over half of the situations are in black and white, but only a fraction of the movies makes it look like this. This film is the best example of a back and white look. It is best viewed in black and white. The hero is in the worst situation. He is in the territory of a man who wants to assassinate him and among several enemies. The film gives the impression that he is at a numerical disadvantage and can not count on help. Your enemy (the count) has numerous resources. The earl's wife has been forced to marry him, and from his past knows that sooner or later he will kill her like all his wives. She and the hero become allies and fall in love, which could win anyone who was watching (unless that person just wants to be a brat otherwise). Anyone who helps them is dead. They can not escape. The situation is hopeless. So will they survive in the end? You will not guess unless you have read spoilers. The film also has a lot of atmosphere, adventure and intrigue, along with Lon Chaney as a bad guy and Boris Karloff in his best role ever, as a decent guy. Usually cast as a bad guy, Karloff was at his best when presented with more complex roles like this. Chaney rarely received a complex role, although he exhibited his things in some films like "Of rats and men". This is little more than a tip for him. Still, the tension never stops. There is suspense and danger everywhere. Perfectly written, perfectly cast and perfectly directed. This is what a movie should be pure escape, pure adventure.
