This is the fourth movie in the Karate Kid series. However, it has nothing to do with the previous one. The only character left is Mr. Myagi. This time, Mr. Myagi finds troubled teenager Julie Pierce (Hliary Swank before she is famous) Julie having all kinds of trouble including being bullied at school by a guy belonging to a pseudo military club on campus. Of course, she is trained how to fight. Everywhere, through Myagi, Julie learns Karate and becomes a better person spiritually and learns to respect herself and, in the end, regains her respect. I like the unique idea that the antagonist is a female and having a male as his enemy. There are also some fight scenes that are done very well, very low violence and minimal violence. the fight is graphic. The ending is also good and somewhat surprising. It is predictable, but not a typical ending to this type of film. The film obviously has echoes of the original, especially the spiritual aspect and the lessons learned. as good as the 1st mov ie and certainly not as good as the 2nd.it is nevertheless a giant leap forward compared to the 3rd entry underwhelming.this is a very fun dog movie under what is suitable for all the family. 8/10
