Personally, I can only agree with Stephen-12: enter. There's really no point in trying to "catch" this movie. I like movies where nothing (explicitly) happens. Herzog's "Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes" has the same nothingness, although the film is less convincing, since the climaxes are at the beginning of the story, so Herzog had to focus on nature versus Kinski. Death to Venezia is totally different, since it has several climaxes, curves, etc. In fact, from the point where Aschenbach's luggage is lost, the film almost "runs" to his grand finale (his final grains of sand begin to run through the hourglass after the moment of happiness where he fantasizes about warning the Polish family and caress Tadzio's hair. <br /> <br /> You can, if you want, look for some real clues / symbols in this (he's trying to get out) behind your luggage from the moment you arrive, the Tadzio sharpener at the end, the fact that throughout the movie content and form are completely in sync), but there is no point in doing this: it will not make the movie better or worse, since its strength lies in the hangover of the plot, which is never explicit. Tons of history, decadent Europe, the end of the "romantic era" as we come to know it, which proved to be just the beginning of it (individual emotions and expression are more important now than ever were). But wait, now I'm starting to develop the smallest (small) flaw of the movie: the parts "let's talk about art". Now there is one thing to never do. I myself believe it could have been expressed by other means. Besides, I think it's already clear in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not like explicit movies. I can read books, so I do not want a plot that speaks only about my reasoning. I prefer movies that you can not explain in words, but only in the movie (Lynch's Lost Highway, Weir Picknick at Hanging Rock and Roeg's Man Who fell to Earth also belong to this category), because then, and only, does he have a reason to exists as a film and not just as a book. So, what about Thomas Mann's novel? I never read it, but forget it! The film gives a different point of view: it says things you can never say in a book. He uses cinematic art to make you feel, through images and music, the same thing that Mann made you feel, using text. Equally brilliant, but different worlds.
