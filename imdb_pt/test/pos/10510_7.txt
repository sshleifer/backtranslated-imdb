Now, I've seen a lot of B-level movies in my 15 years of life, and I must say this was one of the best. I personally enjoyed the real estate market and plot, but suffered from amateur acting (although Adrienne Barbeau has performed a decent performance like Lisa Grant). Joseph Bottoms could not hold his part well enough to be considered good. The other performance that really fit the film was that of Barry Hope (Barney Resnick). It starts with an eager real estate agent taking an Asian couple to a house, and discovers that there is a dead girl in the shower of the showhome. He progresses with detective speculation and introduces the main characters with reasonable grace. I think for anyone who has a giggle in the exaggerated drama that the victim brokerage firms offer during the bloody scenes, this is really a precious thing ... XD Who am I kidding? Not so good, but worth watching if you're insanely bored.
