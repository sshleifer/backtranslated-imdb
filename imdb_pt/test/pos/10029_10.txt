I first saw "They Died With There Boots," circa 1970, and although it's been many years since then, this film and its impression remain. The cast was good to great and the protagonist was truly heroic. When I first saw this movie I knew the wisest and the only real position to have was to enjoy this movie as an exciting diversion and then something like that. I felt then how I even now feel that the Silver Screen does not offer, as such, a true representation of much of everything much less the life of George Armstrong Custer, however, the director Raoul Walsh was to contribute to the actual value represented in this film when I watched a semi-documentary with other great directors such as Vincent Mennelli in which these central figures spoke there achievements with valuable comments providing a glimpse of Hollywood mentality. This is what I considered something of interest and where all this became terribly interesting and very enjoyable. However, there has been a lot done of all pr oblems with the silver screen and its story telling ability that some of the pleasure was lost and maybe you thought it to be true here too.Custer ranked 34 in a graduation class of. 34. Much was made of Custer's final class rank, but of the 68 cadets who entered the Military Academy with him in 1857, half of them had already been dismissed or dropped on graduation day, June 24, 1881. It is suggested in film that the various instructors are determining if a soldier is prepared for command and then they discover the name of George Armstrong Custer and there needs to be a switch between the two sides and this is where the sergeant on duty says in almost low pitch, even to suggest that he came by accident "his squadron would follow him to hell," in his attention Sargeant, reproves Tape.If I am not mistaken when Flynn appears on an initial battlefield, acknowledged that Custer did not see action right away and in fact he was doing the job as a reliable attach√© to not only Sheridan, but Hancocks also also forces only to wipe out the Army of the Potomac under General George McClellan. There is some truth in the audacity attributed to the heroism of Custer's battlefield, as it was illustrated when in a counterattack, "Young Custer spurred his horse to the lead and boldly plunged among the stunned Confederates.As a single Union Soldier surrounded by rebels, Custer's audacity shone.He accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers, including a rebel captain.He personally captured the first Confederate battle flag taken by the Army of the Potomac.This remarkable act of courage marked him as an officer of great promise on the battlefield. "Robert L. Bateman - General Armchair. There's a problem here and that's the story of the story and the truth about George Armstrong Custer, the story is good Hollywood entertainment, maybe even great entertainment, but for whatever reason, all that could be said was change. d For entertainment purposes. Although he may be jumping the gun, it might be good to know that Tom Custer would lose his life in the "Little Big Horn" a few yards from where George Custer was about to die as well. They were brothers and Tom Custer to this day has an honorable distinction of being among a very small group, perhaps only three others to have been awarded the Medal of Honor twice in his military career. The list of appointments that the film shows indicate that Custers really was a young and active officer. He was not with Union forces in Chancellorsville or Fredericksburg, but he was with them at the Battle of Antietam, and at the time he was promoted to Captain by General McClellan, but that would not last long. McClellan would soon be replaced because of the historical fact that the Potomac Army had the means, and the information (discoveries wrapped around some cigars were General Lee's plans to split his forces) and yet he could be speculated that the war could have ended and that it occurred, but when McClellan failed to act, President Lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost as a result. Custer's biggest win may come from Gettysburg, PA. His forces, which occupied an area called the cemetery at the Gettysburg camp in the summer of 1863, succeeded in defeating a Jeb Stuart Rider of about 6,000 rebels with a force of. I think the heroics at Gettysburg by Custer deserve some discussion. There is speculation in the film that Custers' appointment was a mistake, well, you'd better guess again, because not only did Custer have men in his corner, but he made a petition for the Governor of Michigan State present that by the way was relatively new to Union Cause and where he was preparing to form Cavalry regiments. Although Custer was severely admonished by this kind of shenanigan when he appeared in all that golden braid, it was not. You would be led to believe. The truth is that Custer's Gettysburg defense barred Jeb Stuart from lunching at Union stores and vitally protected that flank. It has occurred and has been programmed to match Picketts Charge so as to make for the greater likelihood of success. It was a critical victory and Custer was at his most courageous and best.His men followed him to hell and lived to tell about it.
