Strange but acceptable mafia comedy that has an undercover FBI agent (Matthew Modine) flirting with a mobster's widow (Michelle Pfeffier) ​​to tie two murders to a mafia boss (Dean Stockwell). <br /> <br /> The film shows that it does not have to go over just to be funny and director Jonathan Demme ("The Silence of the Lambs", "Philadelphia") keeps the film looking like it was contained. This is good and avoids being predictable as well.
