While HOUSE OF WAX will never be mistaken for the Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN, it tries and finally manages to be a worthy addition to quality horror movies. There is enough tension and enough implied gore here to please the young audience today and there is also the enough explicit gore to please some of the purists of yesterday. Overall, it is a well made movie that should look good on DVD. <br /> <br /> Six children on their way to a football game get stuck in a DELIVERANCE scenario and what happens seems to have been pulled out a discarded Deilverance sequence and the hinterland backwoods seem to insult the group. Eventually the group has to separate and half of them head to the deserted city to get some car parts. The other half of the group stays behind in the camp and this sets up the second half of the movie. <br /> <br /> House of Wax has many strengths. The first is that he is blessed with a very nice cast. Paris Hilton is fine in her role, but she is far from the focal point. Chad Michael Murray, Elisabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt are three very charismatic actors and their presence in the film adds some pride, some credibility and some talent. I had never heard of Chad Michael Murray, except he was a pin-up teenage heartthrob. But he has a presence for him. He imbues an intangible to him that seems to translate into his performance. He is instantly friendly and has a strong character trait. I really enjoyed his performance than I imagined he would and when he was on screen, the movie flowed. <br /> <br /> The question now is: "Is this movie a worthy horror movie?" And the answer to that is a resounding YES. As I mentioned above, there is not a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, or even THE RING, but it is relatively tense, quite explicit and there are some very inventive death scenes. This is not CASA da CERA that his parents told him. Vincent Price is nowhere to be seen and when you start to see the fingers being cut and the hot wax covering the comatose bodies, you realize that this film is a bit on the edge. <br /> <br /> I would like to see an uncut movie. rated version of Director X. I bet there is one somewhere that would be a lot more violent than this one. Anyway, this is a good entry for the horror genre and it's head and shoulders above weak films as I know what you did last summer and dark water and a few others. Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> 8/10
