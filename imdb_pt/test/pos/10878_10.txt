Two years after its initial release, Goldeneye is still at the top of first-person shooters for the Nintendo 64. Even the Quake and Turok series did not have the combination of graphic detail, sound quality, enemy intelligence, challenge and general fun they bring . me back to this game over and over again. Each of the missions has specific goals that lead you to think like Bond, not only to shoot down all the movies that appear on screen, but also to avoid cameras, disable security systems, rescue hostages, protect Bond girl, and so on. Q devices abound in this game, including the famous clock. The game is loosely based on the plot of the film, including all the main characters and the best scenes of the film, from the bungee-jump of the dam to the escape of the propeller airplane for the persecution of tanks by Saint Petersburg. Even the layout is preserved when possible, so you will recognize various situations if you have already seen the movie. Other levels are added to challenge the player and join the scenes a bit more. With each level of difficulty, mission objectives are tougher, smarter enemies, and more lethal bullets. I still have not been able to get through the levels of 00-Agent. Cheats can be opened by not entering codes or pressing buttons but completing certain levels within a certain time period, and additional characters can be opened for multiplayer. Multiplayer is still the best among first-person shooters. It is not as clear as Turok, but it does not diminish as much ... many options give your friends reasons to explode again and again, and again just for fun. There are better games for the N64 like Zelda and all things Star Wars but Rare has continued its series of exceptional games with a first person shooter that was not and will not be surpassed until they outgrow in 2000 with Perfect Dark.
