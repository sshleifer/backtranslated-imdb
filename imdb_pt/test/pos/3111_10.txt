I loved this movie because of the dialogue and excellent acting of Candace and Jacqueline. However, I never knew until now, watching a marathon Bette David on TNT that this movie is a remake of a 1943 classic Bette Davis called Old Acquaintance. Bette co-starred with Miriam Hopkins who she was in a terrible fight with during the making of the film because Bette had an affair with Miriam's husband who directed her in a movie before making Old Acquaintance. <br /> <br /> Either way, both are worth every minute spent watching. I highly recommend this movie if you like a lot of dialogue and drama. It is a study in the psychology of women and their relationships with each other, in my opinion.
