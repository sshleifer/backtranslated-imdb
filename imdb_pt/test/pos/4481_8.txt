I recently stumbled on a TV show of "Passion ...." (having missed the opening scenes). Ms Currier to be praised for having the vision and the courage to bring a balzac tale so strange to the screen. I am grateful to the entire cast and staff for their part in producing such a complete film. It must have been hard to shoot so many scenes in the desert. And I can not understand how her trainer got such a good performance from the leopard Simoon. (This ad calls attention to another suspense adventure, "Naked Prey"). Why is not this movie better known? I hope I can find it on video.
