Great piece of the period that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, attractive stars, big lines ("Miss Bender, I do not care if you hit a native drum!" Says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she should read a resume a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you saw this movie in panning and scanned on TV and not in the letterbox version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics), you did not really see it. Hopefully, this guilty pleasure of a movie will soon be available on DVD in a letterbox version and with its original 4-track stereo soundtrack. Great opening title sequence that really catches the mood of 1959 in New York, while Johnny Mathis sings the theme song "Best of Everything" in an echo chamber surrounded by a choir of violins and another chorus of background screams. Abortions! Insanity! Office romance! Cold-hearted and malicious bosses! Frustrated love! It's all here to enjoy.
