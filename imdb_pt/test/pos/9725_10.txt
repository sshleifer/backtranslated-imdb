This is the best television series for children (and adults) of all time. John Hurt is a great actor, with many excellent performances over many years, but he was born to play the storyteller. The scripts of almost every episode are excellent pieces of craftsmanship, and the productions run through the range of emotions, being alternately funny, sad, happy, exciting and always incredibly beautiful. It's hard to choose a better episode from so many excellent candidates, but "The Soldier and Death", with its eternal pathos, is unbeatable. It's a series to watch with your kids over and over again.
