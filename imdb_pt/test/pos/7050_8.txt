Fortunately for Bill Murray this is such a lightweight project, since he pretty much has to carry it. Meatballs is the story of the Northstar Camp, low-income, and how its counselors deal with campers as well as with each other. Then there are plenty of their rich rivals across the lake called Camp Mohawk, which culminates in a two-day Olympics competition. Above all, Bill Murray does antics and makes a memorable movie debut. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of medium-sized laughter, laughter and a few more laughter on the way. The biggest laugh comes from the jokes played by the director of the nerd camp. Three of them involve the counselors moving their bed out in various places while he is sleeping. Morty, or "Micky," as everyone calls him, wakes up along the edge of a road, hanging from some trees several feet above the ground and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also a few funny moments involving the counselors hitting each other, but this is a PG rated movie with little in terms of grudge. <br /> <br /> The film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace. Of course it's up to Murray to teach the boy to open up and give him the confidence to run a marathon during the Olympics. The sentimentality of Rudy's situation looks to a great extent. Notice how when Murray first sees the kid sitting alone on the grass after getting off the bus, he says, "You must be the depressed boy we asked for." Makes you wonder if that line was actually in the script or if Murray was just improvising while the cameras were rolling. In other words, Murray might very well have told Makepeace, "You must be the actor we hired to play the lonely stereotypical kid you see in most summer camp movies that do not fit." But before it all ends, Murray's performance makes this plot device more than bearable. He really does seem to have good chemistry with Makepeace. <br /> <br /> The film culminates with games between the two rival camps. Very little of the events that are shown to us is even a little believable, but "it does not matter." This is a very good movie on many levels. Do not let the absurd 5.6 rating that this movie is receiving scares you. Murray will keep him laughing everywhere. Just be warned ..... avoid the sequels !!!! Especially the one with Corey Feldman !! 8 out of 10 stars. The Dog.
