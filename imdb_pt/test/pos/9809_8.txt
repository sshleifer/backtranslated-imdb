I started watching this very tense movie because I heard so many different things about it. Somewhere I read, it was a drama about child abuse and classified as PG-13 for violence. Another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure for children (and I thought it was also for the kids to watch). Well, now I've seen this so many times and still do not know in which category to put it. It's extremely funny at times, but terribly sad and depressing the next moment. Because of the good relationship and the adventures, I would recommend this movie to all the young people I know, but I fear that the dark atmosphere is not suitable for children. Because of the perfect performances and the magic of the movie, I must say this, however: Watch, especially children! The last thing I have to say is that I hate the screenwriter for letting poor Bobby never see his family again after running away from The King (who did not even come back to terrorize the survivors, Mary and Mikey). It's great that this movie does not have a perfect happy ending with everyone being happy - and I did not expect that - but this solution made me very, very sad!
