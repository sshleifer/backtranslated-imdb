I watched many shorts in my day. Many times I find them very compressed (throwing a lot of information to the viewer in the short time they have to run), very "artistic", or without a clear vision. I can not say anything about Starcrossed. In this review, I will do my best to avoid any dramatic spoilers, but I will also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is fraternal incest. <br /> <br /> As with any short film, the story is quite simple, direct and easy to digest. Of course the film tries to illuminate a deeper taboo of modern society. This movie is successful in every way. In the fifteen minutes of race time, I found myself feeling a range of emotions. With just a little dialogue, the viewer is quickly pulled into the most personal moments and thoughts of these star-crossed brothers. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene set in their infancy, one can see the very close relationship the brothers have. As the film progresses to the present day in the next scene, excellent acting and sincere and heartfelt performances remind the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and harsh way. As the relationship progresses, any repulsion the viewer may initially feel is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress as the viewer suddenly realizes that there can be only one possible solution. And the aftermath of that resolution is to cut the heart. <br /> <br /> Anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this movie and absorb its message. If nothing else, boldly and honestly challenges the viewer to reexamine some of our deepest beliefs about the taboo of incest full of shame and full of shame. Although the film is only fifteen minutes long, it resonates in the viewer long after the credits. This is perhaps my favorite short film I've seen. I can not recommend it enough.
