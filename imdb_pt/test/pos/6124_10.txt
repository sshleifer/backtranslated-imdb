Do you know the saying "Curiosity Killed The Cat"? Well, I've heard a lot about this movie, from a magazine that called this movie the most shocking of all time, my 1001 movies you should see before you die, my sister who saw this at a film festival, and I love the movie. show of the 70's in VH1. I just had to watch this movie since it was named the grossest movie ever, and well, after watching this movie last night, I have to say it really lived up to its title. My God, this movie was so weird! I thought I actually saw all this with some of the worst movies and TV shows I've ever seen, some things that I think will always seem like a shock. <br /> <br /> Well, Babs Johnson, also known as Divine, was named the most filthy living person and a jealous couple named The Marbles is competing for that title. They want to take Divine and be named the nastiest couple alive for kidnapping women, raping them, getting them pregnant and selling their babies to lesbian couples. But it seems that Divine and her family of well ... I do not know, it seems to keep the title having sex with chickens, doing lip sync, eating dog feces, filling the skirts of meat, incest, and only gets Coarser and coarser . Pink flamingos are terribly represented, horribly made, and well, just horrible. The reason for the 10 note that I'm going to give is due to the fact, well, how could you rate this movie? I always rate, so I just think the heck? Through the rudeness of this movie, you have to give John Waters some credit, who the hell would think about this movie more than 35 years later? For the cast and crew who worked on this movie, you're just plain nasty! <br /> <br /> 10/10
