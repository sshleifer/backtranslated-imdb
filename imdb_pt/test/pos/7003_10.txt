As a fan of zombies, I really love these kinds of plots, where people end up in strange places surrounded by evil monsters! PB is also an excellent connection with Chronicles of Riddick (COR). The class has to run as fast as they can from the darkness. There are so many metaphors in the story! Riddick is this bad guy, but he is also the hero who tries to save the slow people. The Muslim guy, Imam, relies on the positions of the sun for the prayers five times a day, but he is trapped in a land where the darkness will rule. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to any fan of science fiction. You will not be disappointed.
