Flipping the channels, I was fortunate to come across the beginning of this movie. I must admit that this caught my eye almost immediately. I love old movies and this is or should be considered a classic! One of the most wonderful rarities of this film is that the main character was not only feminine but also a bad girl. I recommend this movie!
