But Oyama was the most successful karate master of the late twentieth century. He rejected the "training" of the karate clubs of the time, focusing on an intense form of training. He ended up building his system in a huge business empire with hundreds of schools around the world without compromising his teachings. The tests at Kyokushin schools are still some of the most physically challenging tests that any martial arts school requires. One non-physical difficulty that Oyama faced was prejudice because of his Korean ancestry and he spent some time proving that loyalties were to Japan and Japanese Karate. This series of films was part of this effort, although anyone who had the chance to meet Oyama (I did) would never question his allegiance to Japan. In this series, Oyama's most famous student Sonny Chiba is called to portray his master . <br /> <br /> Oyama arrives from the countryside where he has trained himself. He challenges and does a short work from the karate schools he meets. Disgusted by the state of karate, Oyama returns to his solitary training. He eventually catches a student, falls in love and gets in the way of gangsters who are allied with established karate schools. In the middle of it is the legendary bullfight with a mad bull. How much of the movie is true is questionable. <br /> <br /> That Oyama could kill a bull with his own hands is true. He was called to repeat this done numerous times. There are filmed cases of Oyama actually doing this, though sometimes the bulls seemed to be trapped like Oyama was giving in years. Sonny Chiba portrays his master with conviction and karate is very good. Chiba may not have been the best karate practitioner, but right now he was certainly above average. <br /> <br /> As a whole, the movie is good, much better than most martial arts movies in the theater department. I've always wondered why it's no longer known. Possibly, very realistic representations of martial arts. People are shown getting tired and hurt, as opposed to 99% of action movies in which the hero is an unlimited source of energy and each hit instantly dispatches an opponent to death. Chiba looks so exhausted at a point it hurts to watch. Spectators may not have their entertainment reflecting reality so closely. <br /> <br /> Specially recommended for martial artists.
