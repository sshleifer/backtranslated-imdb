The subject is banal, even in 1942. It is propaganda of war. The fascists are among us and are doing all they can to sabotage the war effort and prepare its victory and its seizure of power and establish an effective totalitarian state. But Hitchcock has to make a real suspense. Then he invents a first sabotage that succeeds, but one of the victims, the friend of the one who dies in it, becomes the main suspect and escapes to sabotage. This allows him, so to speak, to visit the country and discover the delicate organization of the local Nazis who know and support the most benevolent society and use the dissatisfied little whites to do the dirty work. The pursuit of the real saboteur takes our young fake suspect from Los Angeles to New York and the top of the organization. He meets a blind pianist who believes that his senses know that the subject is not guilty, his niece who is a publicity billboard star but also a frenetic, fanatical patriot who only thinks about going to the police. Then the rich farmer and his nest of conspirators. Then on the road, a friendly and friendly trucker, the long caravan of a circling circus and its dwarf, bearded woman, Siamese sisters and a few other such grotesque. And he discovers the target in a Soda City, an electric dam that provides Los Angeles and its war industry with the energy they need. He participates as a boulder in the organization in sabotaging an Alaskan military ship when it is launched. And finally, with some creativity, creativity and elbow, he and the pianist's niece can clear the whole lot, most of them arrested and the first saboteur, a certain Fry, falls from the torch of the Statue of Liberty. That one will not fry in the old electric chair. But Hitchcock is not in the habit of making a personal appearance in his own films, so do not look for him. It's well built and well executed, but it's just an advertising flick with an extra style. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris University 1 Sorbonne Pantheon and Versailles Saint Quentin University in Yvelines
