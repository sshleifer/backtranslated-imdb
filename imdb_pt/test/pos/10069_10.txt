I love this movie!! Of course I love this because of Madonna, but who cares - it's very funny !!! * ALANiS Rocks *. When I first saw this movie in theaters in 1987, I thought it was all hilarious! Madonna is so funny and I love her dubbed nickname and crazy / funky look. The funniest part of all time is when Madonna (Nikki) yells at a man about to get into a taxi. And also when Griffin Dunne (Louden) stumbles and falls on the scene of the apartment interview. ** ALANiS Rocks **. Madonna's character, Nikki, steals, shops and deceives people throughout the film - her hilarious antics are enough to keep him on the floor all the time. "Do not steal anything, when you steal a store, you take the box. We get some tapes, there's a difference." I love it !!! It's classic. *** ALANiS Rocks ***. I do not know why this movie was hit the way it happened. I do not see anything wrong with that - of course, if you're a big fan of Madonna, what she does is just great. Anyone out there who wants to see some fun and classic entertainment watches "Who's That Girl?" And another very important fact that must be known to all men or at least to all that exist, ALANiS will always "shake you" through to the end! The same goes for Madonna in this movie, and only entirely! Your performance is superb!
