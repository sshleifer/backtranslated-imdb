The biggest problem that the TV show Key West faced was that it was advertised wrong. If you saw the ads, you would think it was a jerk and you would be very disappointed. It was a much more complex show than that. <br /> <br /> It turned out that I was in Key West just before Hurricane Andrew, and I think I actually saw myself taking a drink or two with some of the cast of Rum Runners. Of course, that was before the show happened. I saw the sailboat that was in the opening pass a few times, and talked to the guy you see hacking coconuts in the gap as well. It was a real spot. Yes, I would love to see it on DVD.
