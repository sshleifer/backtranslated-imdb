This is one more of John Travolta's "comeback" movies, and if he continues with characters and movies like this, his return will take over. <br /> <br /> That's so sweet ... naively, so if you're not in the romance comedy scene. If you are, this is an innovative RomCom. Each performance (including that of Skippy the Dog) was beautiful, with little more than a trace of the irreverence found in "Dogma." (Although, like movies, I loved Dogma!) Travolta is not as bold in his performance as the previous ones would lead him to believe. He is an angel and if you consider yourself well read then you understand that the angels were far from perfect. You will not, therefore, be insulted by this movie. Even those who are overly sensitive to such things should not be insulted by this work, as Nora made a great effort to make it as abrasive as possible given the subject. <br /> <br /> I love it and love it more every time I watch. It is beautiful and sweet, engaging and captivating. <br /> <br /> The price is 7.3 / 10 of ... <br /> The Devil :.
