"Thriller" is brilliant. It's a long, but simply brilliant video, though. The song itself is ... great ... add Michael JAckson dancing and you will have a golden phenomenon. Of all the videos I've seen, this is the best. If you have not yet seen the video, then I recommend that you ... <br /> <br /> The special effects are incredible for your time ... everything from transforming wearwolf to the idea that these scary zombies they rise slowly. their graves are grandiose ... frighteningly large. Vicent Price has his segment of creepy lines ... known simply as "rap" Ola Ray is good as Michael's girl, and Michael JAckson himself ... dancing and singing (although not during the video itself) is unequaled ... <br /> <br /> 10/10.
