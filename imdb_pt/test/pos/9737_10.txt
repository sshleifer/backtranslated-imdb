I loved "Flash Gordon" as a child and watching the series again on DVD brings back those good memories. Each 15-minute episode features the adventures of our Flash hero, the adorable Dale Arden and the intrepid Dr. Zarkov on the planet Mongo, with Flash escaping death at every turn: the Shark Men almost drown him, he faces the Fire Monster in the Tunnel of Terror, and he is in mortal danger in the Static Room! <br /> <br /> The characters are still fun: Buster Crabbe is the blond hero of dreams and Jean Rogers is a delicate and handsome Dale Arden. Princess Aura still plans to steal Flash for herself, Hawkman Vultan King still has her laughter and angel wings, and Ming the Ruthless Emperor of the Universe is still giving all evil eyes and shivers. <br /> <br /> This series probably would not interest kids today with their liar effects - oh, that spaceship! - but it's a bit of fun nostalgia for the first time. The actors interpret this directly and do not minimize the children. I appreciate that the young viewers should read the synopses of the chapters that had very large words in them. <br /> <br /> I'm glad this came out on DVD. It's so much fun to review this classic science fiction series.
