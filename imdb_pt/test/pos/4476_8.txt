An excellent story well told by the filmmaker. The interactions between the man and the leopard brought many questions for viewers to care about who was being human. Humans just killed animals just to survive. At the end of the movie you wondered who the real "hero" was. A story well told. The human actor did a great job, but the leopard stole every scene he was in.
