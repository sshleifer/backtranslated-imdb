The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways, from more or less traditional visions, such as dealing with art, to more modern approaches that like to dissect the piece along postcolonial, feminist, gender, or deconstructionist lines. The reason Jarman's version made me rather cold was that I had no idea what he was talking about. What is the underlying vision / idea / concept behind this interpretation of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not go far beyond the tragedy of revenge, show punk, but sure enough there is more, is not it? This is not to say that there is no vision here, only that I was difficult to discover. Anyway, there are still things to enjoy. The punk flavor is refreshing and fun. Toyah Wilcox as Miranda and Jack Birkett as Caliban are wonderful. I do not care much about Williams like Prospero ... it's not magic enough, I suppose. The switches between the old monastery / castle and the (very English) outside world can be a little disturbing at times, but I think it is intentional. All in all, interesting, but not exactly the success I expected it to be (particularly after seeing Jarman's Caravaggio).
