There have been many (well, more than a few in any case) attempts in the last 30 years to create a movie that has a "supernatural" appearance. Assuming this is a Film Director's desire to distance himself from other films, or simply to cover up the poor, low-budget look, "Begotten" is at the top of the pile. <br /> <br /> In addition to Merhige's meticulous process of artificially degrading his film completely changes its structure (imagine how that film would have stayed in the glorious Technicolor standard) - can almost be imagined as an artifact of another unknown culture. Some images are so far removed from what we expect to see on the screen that they disturb them especially when they are displaced. This is not a disturbance of the "House on the Left," more like a disturbance to leave your cave for the first time and see the sun. <br /> <br /> Watch this dream of the fever. if you have the chance and treat yourself. Remember, they make other more standardized movies every day. They can wait.
