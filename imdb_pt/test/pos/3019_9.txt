*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** THE CELL / (2000) **** (of four) <br /> <br /> "Do you believe that there is a part of yourself, deep down in your mind, with things you do not want other people to see? During a session, when I'm in, I see these things. "-Catherine Deane <br /> And we also. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, "The Cell" is a love / hate movie - you love or hate it. I can understand the reasons why some people do not like this production. With a story that combines disturbing serial killers with polls, "The Cell" is too much for some viewers; others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film. I think it's one of the most interesting films of the year. <br /> <br /> Making his debut as a screenwriter, Mark Protosevich creates an imaginative world of rich, colorful images and provocative characters. Filmmakers enjoy every shot. Protosevich conceived ideas for "The Cell" in 1993, when he decided to combine two of his main interests, sounding the mind and serial killers. He would have been influenced by directors like Wes Craven, George Romero and David Cronenberg. They would probably be proud of such an imagination. <br /> <br /> The film combines two main narratives, one about scientific exploration of the human mind and the other about a psychopath who kills young women for their own sexual pleasure. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), a child therapist, is part of a neurological study at the Campbell Center, a research clinic. Because of his empathic personality, the scientists chose Deane to enter the mind of a catatonic pre-adolescent hoping to relive his brain upon awakening. <br /> <br /> A sick and demented serial killer wanders the streets. Inside an abandoned rural house, Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) locks innocent female victims in a large glass cell, where he drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies. The killer escapes the FBI every time he approaches, until now. A violent apprehension leaves him in a coma. The FBI captures his body forever unconscious. Unfortunately, he has already prepared the cell with his last victim. In forty hours the cell will be filled with water, and Stargher is the only man who knows the location of his victim. The FBI takes this situation to Campbell Center, where Catherine enters Stargher's mind, hoping to discover the location of her last victim before the cell fills with water, sending the woman to a grave aquatic. <br /> <br /> The parts of the history of science fiction were based on both real science and theoretical fiction in creation. the Neurological Cartography and the Synaptic Transfer System. The premise takes a long time to develop, but it's worth the wait. It's very unlikely, but it does not matter. The movie makes us believe. Even if you do not suspend disbelief, however, the visual attraction provides an engaging environment to enjoy. According to the film's production notes, Mark Protosevich was thrilled to be working with the director, Tarsem, because they both think visually. Tarsem Singh is known for his attention to detail, stunning art direction and highly developed skills to tell a story. "When I wrote 'The Cell'," Protosevich explains, "I surrounded myself with postcards or colored copies of paintings or photographs of painters while I was working." So I am thinking visually, and Tarsem is a highly visual director. similar to visual references that contributed to a very smooth collaboration. "Vincent D'Onofrio provides the film with a backbone, and no actor could have accomplished his character better. It offers a mysterious, disturbing and engaging performance. "I think my character is, in a way, stuck in himself," ponders D'Onofrio. He also researched the psychology of serial killers to help him stay below the surface of the character. Their in-depth preparation for performance pays off beautifully. While the actors, the writer and the director do wonders with their material, the true honor goes to the backstage talent of the film. Director of photography Paul Laufer, production designer Tom Foden, costume designer April Napier, special effects coordinator Clay Pinney, and visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug. They bring the world of "The Cell" to life. It is an extraordinary world worthy of various visions. Some movies you watch, others you experience. "The Cell" falls into the next category. <br /> <br />
