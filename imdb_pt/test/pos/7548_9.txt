So, Udo Kier earned nine dollars and free food for it, which is a victory in itself. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, this film tells a very interesting story about a group of rescuers who came across Demeter. I must warn you, I'm going to take a look at this review pretty fast. First things first. Coolio plays a guy named 187. 187 Likes drugs. Finds a bunch of coffins on board and ... now I know nothing about the future, but maybe they'll smuggle drugs into coffins. I will not say that was the craziest thing in the movie. Later, the vampire comes out of his casket filled with mist and then begins the real hilarity. First, although this movie has the word Dracula, it is not in this movie. I have a theory though. Out of nowhere, you see the ship of the rescue team leaving without them. My theory is that Dracula was on board with his retarded brother Orlock. Dracula told Orlock that he would be back. Dracula took off from this film before he could be seen leaving Orlock to play the vampire for the six or more minutes he's in the movie. The best part of this movie, and for those of you who have seen it, you know what I say, it's after 187 is generated, embraced whatever. He has this huge monologue about ejaculating in various parts of Erik Elaniak's body and ... other super cool things. Coolio, seriously you're the best thing ever. <br /> <br /> Some other things happen in this movie too. How Casper Van Dean gets some work. Orlock screams a lot and loses his arm and then we sort of lost track of him FOR THE MOVIE REST. And thank God really. We found out that Erika's character is a police bot. When the movie comes to an end, we find that the ship is on a course to attack the sun. The police bot and another surviving character are doomed. Instead of avoiding certain death, the Erika police robot reveals that she is also a prostitute and they decide to fuck and die. Before they die in the sun, they die for no reason, yes, that's right ... the ship explodes for no real reason. <br /> <br /> This movie received the incredible rating for a reason, Coolio. God, if they gave prizes at the gym for black rappers, he'd be the first to get one. The only reason this was not perfect is because there was a fall of nudity. Now I know what you are thinking, how you can judge a movie whether women show their wares or not. Very easy. A film like that pretty much requires that. Your part of the process. Gore, gore, monsters, nudity, blood, end the final shock of the movie at the end. It's the formula. This had some blood, the monster was amazing because it sucked so much that he really did us the favor of getting off camera. That was considered by him and I respect that. Nudity, not a drop, though there was a long talk about ... well see the above statement and as for the shock / twist ... I certainly did not see the end coming. That counts. <br /> <br /> I hope that Hollywood does not think that Coolio gave him all of himself and has nothing left. He deserves more work. Well, up to Dracula 4000, I'm out.
