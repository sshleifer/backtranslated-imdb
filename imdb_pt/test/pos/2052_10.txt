I thought this was a great action movie. A very good role for Geena Davis. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favs next to Angelina Jolie. I actually watched The Long Kiss Goodnight soon after seeing the new Tomb Raider movie. Did that make me think, Charlie or Lara? Which one would win in a fight ??? Either way, both women are very strong and intelligent characters who are fun to watch. Especially when they're kicking their butt. I just hope to see Geena in another movie soon. It looks like she's out of the limelight a bit too much. It would be especially good to see her in another film with Samuel L. Jackson. Now they make a great pair. Watch this movie if you have not. You will not be disappointed.
