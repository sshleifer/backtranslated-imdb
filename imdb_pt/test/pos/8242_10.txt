As a child in Sydney in the 1950s, I can readily identify with the content of this film. Every week I visited the Wynyard Newsreel Cinema on George Street to watch the Cinesound shorts (and usually 3 Stooges). There has never been a better blend of B / W and color in a film. Flawless production values ​​complete an unforgettable cinematic experience.
