It's a shame that this movie is no longer successful in theaters. It's a rich, textured love story with believable and overly human characters who are too busy playing and protecting their hearts to recognize The Real Thing when they experience it. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is its setting in Chicago, among middle-class, artistic, literate African-Americans, who discuss poetry, music, and literature. Another is his Real Finesse, Larenz Tate - and if you're even half his fan, YOU NEED to see this movie! His boyish arrogance and vulnerability are perfect for the role of Darius. Nia Long also shines like Nina, who wants to tell Darius that she loves him, but is afraid of breaking "the rules". A great movie to watch curled up on the couch with your love!
