Basically, this is a very good movie. It's very different from the other Seagal movies, which unfortunately can turn off some of your fans. Unlike some of the other films, this does not look like a 'Seagal vehicle'. You can see many other characters too and all of Mr. Seagal's actions are not the same ones we saw earlier. The concept of him being an 'intellectual' in something other than bombs and other guns is a nice change. While there are some unrealistic parts to the film (some more obvious than others), you can generally let them slide as long as the film is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> It all comes down to this: if you are looking for a classic Seagal action movie, sorry but you will be disappointed. Watch anyway for the fun. If you are open to see Seagal without the action, it's worth a look. I personally believe it is one of the best jobs he has done in a long time. <br /> <br />
