I was part of the Space Odyssey cast, playing FIDO in control of the mission. I just want to say that none of us, especially those in control of the mission who had to react to a green screen most of the time, had some idea of ​​how incredible it would become. I knew it was going to be good, if only for the camaraderie and professionalism that the production team at Impossible Pictures provided to everyone involved. but when we all saw it for the first time on display at the Curzon Mayfair, well, I felt very proud. I was so happy that none of us looked like we were on Star Trek. Joe Aherne, the screenwriter and director, is the most incredible man to work with. He pretty much gets a good team together and then trusts them implicitly to freely do what they do best. I'm very lucky to have been part of this show. Who knew that something so epic and complicated to understand would become so appealing to watch. And my god is a beautiful universe out there.
