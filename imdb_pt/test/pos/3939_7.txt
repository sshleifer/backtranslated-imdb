Richard Schickel's 1991 documentary on Gary Cooper - "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend" takes a look at the tremendous American star through his films and his life. Narrated by Clint Eastwood, the theme is definitely "Gary Coooper, American," as we are taken through fast clips of his many western appearances, and scenes from "Meet John Doe," "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," and "Sgt York. "The best part of the documentary is the home movies of Cooper and his family, as well as his childhood photos, showing him as a handsome blond boy with the sunny smile he would have in his entire life.There is also a hilarious clip from Cooper on "The Jack Benny Show", making the return on the number "Bird Dog" - and Benny loses.The documentary also takes us briefly through his tumultuous case with Patricia Neal, who almost ruined both their lives. There is a certain lacking cohesion of this bio / retrospective - she skips a lot and has no footage of Cooper being interviewed, which would have added a lot.In addition, Clint Eastwood's narration was described as non-intrusive. that Cooper himself tended to be the strong, silent type on the screen, we could have used a little animation. On a personal note, Gary Cooper was one of the most handsome men who ever lived - there were a few glances for him in his first fil mes, but not enough for this fan. That smile, those lips, that bony structure - he was handsome throughout life, but in films like "Morocco" and "Desire" he is devastating. Instead of sitting in a scene from one of his worst performances, such as Howard Roark in "The Fountainhead," giving a speech he admitted to the author, he did not understand - a young, gentle Cooper in a tuxedo would have been a nice touch. This documentary, unfortunately, was definitely produced by a man.
