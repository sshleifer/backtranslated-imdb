I agree with many of the other reviewers here. This was a great film and an even better novel by Robert Fish. Unfortunately, I believe the author died before he could see this movie made. The performances are all top-notch, with three principles (John Glover, Ben Cross and Veronica Hamel) seemingly made for their roles. The exteriors, both in Europe and in Israel, seem very authentic, and the duration of the 4-hour miniseries was perfect to tell this story. Fortunately, I recorded it when I was on television and I have enjoyed watching it ever since. I can say without hesitation that this holds to this day. I gave a 10 note. If you did not read the book, you really should find a copy. This would be an excellent movie to be released on DVD with extras that could easily include cast interviews.
