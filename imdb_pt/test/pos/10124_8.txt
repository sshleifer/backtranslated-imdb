Inspired by True events, Radio is one of the best dramas I've seen widely released at some point. It's definitely one of the best films of the year 2003. <br /> <br /> Radio star Ed Harris, who still deserves the Oscar in this film, such as football coach Harold Jones. Coach Jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game. However, Coach Jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter, played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. One day, Radio, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., in his best performance since Men of Honor, comes on the soccer field while the coaching team is practicing for the game. Some members of the team then tie the radio and throw it into a building. They then hit the building and finally Coach Jones suspects that something is wrong. He comes and helps Radio, who is scared, and since then Coach Jones and Radio share a very special bond. Radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in football games and school events. He also becomes Coach Jones' main interest in football life, which was initially his top priority before his family and Radio. <br /> <br /> The film deals with all sorts of real-life problems, including their priorities, accepting people for whom they are, even if they are different, death and family relationships. The film addresses all of these issues and more and is extremely well done and director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this film. The thing I liked most about Radio was just how real it was. The performances were like watching something in real life happen before your eyes. The radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. Some parts were pretty funny, but other parts were very serious and sad. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I feel that Radio was largely neglected by Critics, receiving only average reviews. They must have heads up there because its amazing how this movie can only get 2 star reviews and something like rock school can get 3 or 4 stars, it does not make any sense to me. Also the performances as I mentioned before are top notch and Oscar worthy. In my opinion, both Ed Harris, who I think is underestimated as an actor, and Cuba Gooding Jr. should get some kind of nomination for this movie. Radio is one of my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the great Hollywood movies. My final rating for Radio is 9/10.
