A brilliant Sherlock Holmes adventure starring the brilliant Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Although many other actors brilliantly play Holmes and Watson and do a great job - Rathbone and Bruce will always be the two best. <br /> <br /> Holmes takes Professor Tobell from Switzerland to London. Tobell is wanted by the Nazis. He has a vision of a bomb that could win World War II. His bomb site was divided into four parts, each one hidden in books. Tobell agrees to hand over his bomb site to the British government. On the night of his arrival, Tobell goes to his girlfriend's house. He drew some figures of men, if Tobell disappeared, the lady should hand the drawings to Holmes. On his journey home he is attacked, but a police officer stops and the attacker runs away. Tobell is happy that the British government uses his site bomb, but refuses to give them, Tobell wants to take care of him. The pump site is divided into four parts, each part completely useless without the other. He gives one part of each of these bombs to one of his scientist friends. Then the greatest fear of Holmes happens, Tobell disappears. Holmes visits the young woman Tobell was on the night he was attacked. She talks about the drawings. The drawings were stolen. She says only one man came in during the time Tobell left to fix the lamp. The man she describes is Professor Moriarty. He's working for the Nazis. Seen as he has the drawings, Holmes is finished. But he finds the notebook he used and uses Science, he can see what Tobell drew by looking at the next page on the block. He sees the code. He sees that it is the name of four scientists. The first three he works out the code, but he can not work the room. The three scientists he worked on were murdered and the bomb site was taken. Holmes can not solve the fourth scientist, but Moriarty can not either. Disguised as a sailor, Holmes manages to enter Moriarty's office. Moriarty soon sees Holmes, puts him in a box and throws him into the sea. But Watson and Lestrade insist they look for the box and find Holmes in it. Now it is obvious that Moriarty is outlawed. Holmes manages to craft the fourth code, a Frederick Hoffner. Holmes immediately approaches his house and takes Hoffner and the decisive quarter for security. Holmes now needs to convince Moriarty to work with the Nazis. He pretends to be Hoffner. Moriarty elaborates the fourth code and makes two men turn around and pick up Hoffner. They take him back and he comes face to face with Moriarty. Meanwhile, Tobell is not on a good path, he was tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist. Moriarty already had it with Holmes now, he got it and his death should be long for Holmes. The idea is to put him in his hospital, put a needle in the vein and watch him die of blood loss drop by drop. Watson comes in and saves the day. Moriarty flees, but Holmes was only careless enough to leave the Moriarty trapdoor open. Moriarty dives 60 feet. <br /> <br /> Then Moriarty died. No. He makes his final installment in the movie 'The Woman in Green', but in 'Green' he is definitely dead, a suicide, he jumps off his roof. It was Moriarty's second of three appearances in the Rathbone series, a different actor playing him every time. His first appearance in 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' was played by George Zucco, his second in this film in which he was played by Lionell Atwill and Henry Daniels plays him in his last performance in 'The Woman in Green'. by Universal were defined in the war as Holmes triumphs over the Nazis. 'The Voice of Terror' was the first, then this film and then 'Sherlock Holmes In Washington'. So it was in Victorian times, with definite relationships with the Edwardian and Georgian times (George, the fifth and sixth). This film had a close connection to the Sherlock Holmes short story 'The Dancing Men', which can be found in 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes'. One great movie, despite obvious propaganda, was a brilliant walk from Holmes.
