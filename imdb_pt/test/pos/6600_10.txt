In fact, I have one more question than one comment. I loved Z-Boys and The Lords of Dogtown. I saw Lords first, then the doctor, and while I loved the story, I'm curious to know why in the movie, Sid was an important character, but in the documentary he was not part of the team, and merely merely mentioned as Just a Boy They knew. Does anyone know the story about this? The story of these boys was incredible. I've never experienced the skateboard craze where I grew up, but my kids liked it. What I've seen at the local skate parks is what these boys invented. I never knew that. When the film showed the competition, and Z-Boys did what they wanted, they embarrassed others in the competition.
