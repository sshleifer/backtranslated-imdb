This is a great movie, a must have. I really enjoyed every aspect, from the sword fight, the novel, the costumes were very well made and put together. The setting is absolutely beautiful. I also loved the mystery and the magic. Also the message of the power of love, this love is the greatest power that exists. I really like the king's heart in the sense that he desires peace instead of the shedding of blood and hatred. I wish I could live in a world like that with flying ships, for castles in the sky. I also think it was very good as they brought the animals to the movie. I also thought the cook was very funny. I've watched it many times in a day and still can not get enough of it. I just wanted them to bring it to a DVD.
