I loved. I had just passed the middle of "The Glass House" (turned off ... god, what a heap of predictable plot and bad acting) and then I saw this movie. I thought it was great. I loved both Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster in it. I enjoyed the escapism of the whole scene, traveling through Europe in the 60's - but they have become more realistic, showing the dark side and all the bad things that could happen. It caught my attention completely, even though I thought the parts were unbelievable.
