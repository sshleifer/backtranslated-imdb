"The Gig" is a touching, funny and poignant little movie about a group of friends who have gathered on a regular basis to play Dixieland for fun. The group unexpectedly gets a really paid job, in the musician's language; A show". <br /> <br /> They travel to northern NY for a two-week show at a summer resort minus one member, who bends over due to cancer. At the last minute, they hire a professional to take their place. Things get complicated when Frankie Valli tries to recover at the resort and tries to use the band as his band. <br /> <br /> The attitude the professional bassist gave the guys seemed true. By signing up to play the two-week show, they were taking bread from someone who needed the job to feed their family. While pop stars, rock, rap, country and western and r & b make money with albums. Jazz musicians need to travel abroad for a living. Almost nobody gets rich. The guys who live their dreams also cost the others a needed income. <br /> <br /> I believe that almost everyone who can play a musical instrument with some dreams of proficiency in playing a "pay-per-view" show at one time or another, Woody Allen and Kevin Bacon are two popular examples of this amateur- professional. I especially recommend this movie to anyone who has ever played music professionally. My mother, who was a musician, LOVED it.
