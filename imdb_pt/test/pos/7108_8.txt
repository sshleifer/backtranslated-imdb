"House of Dracula" is a good sequel to "House of Frankenstein". There is not much action, but the acting is so good. Onslow Stevens is the benevolent doctor who gets sick after receiving Dracula blood through a transfusion (Dracula was actually getting the transfusion to overcome his "affliction" but he puts a spell on a hunchback nurse and then transfuses his blood into the Doctor .). It turns out that Dracula did not really come in for a cure, but drained the blood of a beautiful nurse. Dracula is destroyed and the Wolf Man is next in line for a cure (which is successful). Meanwhile, the Frankenstein monster is discovered and revived briefly before it burns to death (do not worry, the same trio came back in "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"). John Carradine again plays a sinister Dracula (Baron Latos is his pseudonym at the beginning of the film and in "House of Frankenstein"). Lon Chaney is the nice Wolf Man and Glenn Strange returns as Frankenstein's monster. Lionel Atwill again plays an inspector, which he often does in the Universal Studios monster movies. A guardian for your collection.
