I saw this movie on late night TV in Buffalo 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before ... well ... you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) "capturing" their prey (Anne Jackson) in a failed attempt at abduction is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrait of a neurotic university rector (?) Or department head is invaluable. How many movies can you name that are able to illuminate mankind's struggle for meaning and satisfaction, making you laugh from beginning to end? This movie reminds us that we are all in this same fight, regardless of class, race, sex or religion. And who can forget the scene of the suburban owner on their hands and knees attacking those few tiny herbs that dared to appear at night on their lawn perfectly manicure!
