After my 6 year old daughter started taking riding lessons I started looking for horse movies for her. I've always heard of National Velvet, but I've never seen it. Boy am I glad I bought it! It has become one of my favorites, my 6 year old son and 2 year old son. It's a shame that movies like this are no longer made.
