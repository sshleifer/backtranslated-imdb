This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while. A mysterious house of abandonment, interesting characters, gore and a distorted plot. Who could ask for more in a horror movie? It's fairly predictable mostly, but again, most of the horrors you can discover in the first 10 minutes, so I will not hold it. Music, camera angles and so on are excellent. The sets are well made and very convincing. There was virtually no subplot, however, being a horror movie, many alternative scenarios only take away what you were looking for from a horror anyway ... To be afraid ... This keeps everything very simple and does just that. If I were to compare with any other film, I would say I remembered the remake of the Saw Massacre. Definitely a lover of horror movies must see.
