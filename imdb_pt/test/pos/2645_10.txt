This was a great movie. It was made with such a beautiful design, such symmetry. I love the way classical music connects to the classic art of earth, space, and beyond. It was such a fluent and thought-provoking masterpiece. I loved the way the monoliths never changed, though primates, earth and space did. I loved how it was a question of "Do you need me / us now"? The film expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, subtlety, gentleness, courage and innocence. What more could you ask for from a simple movie? Maybe a companion movie. Any fan of 2001: A Space Odyssey will discover that the 2010 film is the 2001 feature film. 2010 is more history-oriented than it was in 2001.
