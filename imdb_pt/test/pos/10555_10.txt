I think it's a great and a very funny movie. The story is so funny. The daughter Nicole brings her father Andrew in some very embarrassing situations In an effort to impress the boy of his dreams, the daughter pretends that his father is his lover. You just have to see !! Heigl is adorable as Nicole, maybe too adorable; Do not know why she would have to lie to arrest someone? Gerard Depardieu Acts very well in this comedy film, it is so much fun to watch. If you like comedy and romantic movie you just have to see it !!! I think you can see this movie many times, and you're still going to have a good laugh. <br /> <br /> In an effort to impress the boy of his dreams, the girl pretends her father is her lover.
