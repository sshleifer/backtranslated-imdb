I found parts of this film quite slow, especially the first part; the second part seemed to go much faster, but it is not entirely clear to me why one part was faster than the other. Somehow I managed to find it enjoyable. The acting was good, the writing was good (but vulgar). There was also another good side: it was easier to understand than the godfather's movies. You knew who was on whose side, and so on. In short, the movie was not half bad.
