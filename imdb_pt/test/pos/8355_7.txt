Well, first of all, it's not a bad movie. It's good and I like the characters presented. I also like the voices of Lady and Tramp in this. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to see Lady And Tramp more. I know it says 'Scamp's Adventure', and I love Scamp And Angel to bits, but it's a continuation of the original, where in my opinion they should just launch as 'Scamp's Adventure', not 'Lady And The Tramp II' a big role, but he did not have much time with Lady. <br /> <br /> But, anyway, the songs are very good, and Scamp and Angel are sweet. I've seen better sequences, but hey, it's not a failure. <br /> I give 7/10. Very good, but still had flaws.
