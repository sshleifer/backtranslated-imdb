It's bad for Ya really shows more of George Carlin's talent. He really is still as sharp as a fight. It's a shame we lost him last year, but his comedy will live forever. This particular stand-up is literally one of the funniest I've ever heard a comedian perform. Even though he's making fun of little kids, it just makes you laugh the way he says some of the things. It's true that Carlin can literally do something that looks bland and turn it into one of the funniest things you've ever heard. I really enjoyed this stand-up particularly from Carlin and recommend that those who liked this checkout over stand-up George Carlin.
