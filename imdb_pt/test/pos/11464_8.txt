Night of the Demons is a great movie and an excellent example of how good low budget can be. Of course, a lot of that is pretty predictable, but somehow it's still a lot nicer than the crap we see these days being passed on as "Horror." I give gore a solid 9, and Demons' one-liners are really funny. I'm still scared of "Stop looking at me!" The soundtrack is well made, I was surprised to hear "Stigmata Martyr" from the Bauhaus! There are also some very good T & A on display as well as some good make-up effects. The second film in the series is also very good, but avoid the lower third. The Night of the Demons may be dated, dark and low, but it still has a lot of potential. Definitely worth renting at least. Take a chance tonight, stay away from any old makeup! (you'll understand when you see it!)
