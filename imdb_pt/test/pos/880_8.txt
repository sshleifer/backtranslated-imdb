Jewel Thief is Bollywood's thriller, and why should it not be? It is directed by the greatest exponent of the art of crime thriller in Indian cinema Vijay Anand ('Johny Mera Naam' and 'Teesri Manzil.') I could watch this movie by any of the following reasons (in order of importance) > 1 direction of Vijay Anand 2 music from RD Burman 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri <br /> <br /> Even if Jewel Thief is not a Bond movie, it definitely has bonus girls. Helen, Tanuja, and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos). But our sauvé Vinay (Dev Anand) is anything but Bond. He is out of control for most of history and goes where history takes him almost always as confused as we do. He even flirts with Anju (Tanuja) trying to hit his romantic nerve, just so he can get employed in his father's shop. <br /> <br /> Dev Anand may be in a double role - well, I do not want to ruin your movie or else I would have told you. This is what most of the mystery is about. Dev Anand works at a jewelry store and there is a robbery when he should be at work - although he is not, or at least has a perfect alibi. We ask ourselves who did it, it's Dev Anand as 'Vijay' the person he claims to be or is 'Love' someone we have not yet seen, but many people claim he is similar. Comes "Shalu" (Vyjayanthimala), who even claims that he is her fiancé, in a tense situation Dev Anand has to prove that he is Vinay and not Amar. While everyone wonders if Dev Anand is Vinay or Amar he is asked to remove his socks. Loving tell us you have 6 digits on one of your feet. As we watch the events that are about to happen, Dev Anand even finds time to play. The real-life brothers, director Vijay Anand and actor Dev Anand, have many movies among them, but this is not the best of them, but definitely the best in Crime Thriller. <br /> <br /> There are moments from Hitchcock's North By Northwest, but the films are very different. Except for the confusion about who is who, a treacherous female leadership and many trips, there is not much similarity. Dev Anand could very well be Loving beyond being Vijay. People have seen him, they identify him wherever he goes. There are many of these people for this to be a scam. Finally Vinay thinks it best to take Amar with him to find out what the truth is, and it is a sad mistake. He goes too deep, only to be saved by Cinema's twists and turns. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie as a child, I definitely did not enjoy myself, the end confused me completely. Even now there are parts on the end that I do not like, but I recommend this movie anyway. <br /> <br /> Even as a child, I liked the songs that this movie has to offer. 'Yeh dil ...' - a definitive song in the voice of Kishor Kumar. I could hear 'Rulake gaya ...' all day. The same goes for "Aasmaan ke neeche", which is defined "under the skies" of Gangtok (at least the story line suggests this). 'Raat akeli hai' among the sexiest songs of Hindu cinema, featuring Tanuja as the seducer. 'Meri taraf dekho' - Helen's cabaret and we 'look at her'. 'Hothon pe ...' - now, there might be a better suspense of a song than that. As the music progresses, we are more tense than ever and the words "hidden in the lips of Shalu" add to that.
