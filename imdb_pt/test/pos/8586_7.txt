It is always good to see a film that teaches us about history in Africa, as they are definitely very few. However, the film portrays Lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist ..., I felt it was difficult to sympathize with this kind of leadership, but the film is as a tribute to the man . There was very little content, explaining how the man got up first, and the whole context of Belgium "letting them go." So it's certainly worth seeing how great acting and photography are, especially Mobutu himself. I would just like to have a better political analysis.
