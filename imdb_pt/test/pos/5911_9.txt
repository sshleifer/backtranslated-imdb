Stewart's age did not bother me at all in this movie, although he was portraying a much younger person. I still remember my fascination with Lindbergh's story and while I was completely grown up by the time this biopic was made, I had to see it. <br /> <br /> Not only does Stewart perform very well, it also gives a lot of fascinating technical data, making them understandable to those technically challenged like me. And the look of the plane itself was great. <br /> <br /> I loved this description of a period before my birth and awakens the childhood love I had for the airplanes and the idea of ​​traveling by plane.
