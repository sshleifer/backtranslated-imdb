NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. There are about three wage earners who lean over their heads when their harmless drunken drunks take three other guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are much more insignificant deviants than the film lets us know, win the daylight of one of our "heroes", the trio decides to reciprocate the favor in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys ! The remaining two villains then begin the systematic destruction of all that these poor schmoes cherish, including their decreasing sanity. The DVD cover of Phaedra Video features a critical quote that calls the movie "A Paranoid Street Crime Freakout!" or something, and the term more than applies here. Taciturn, tense, very violent and discreet (but still quite slippery), photographed largely at night with many deliberately vague moments and character motivations that keep the audience guessing along with the besieged protagonists (who, to some degree, deserve everything. which they take!). I give a 10.
