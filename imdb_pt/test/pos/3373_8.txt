Forget Donnie Darko. I open it because it seems like a good bit of the comments I read in The Box equates to the simple but weak argument that he does not hold a candle to Darko. Not that I necessarily disagree with this, I just feel that this film is a completely different animal and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison, of course, but they are peripheral concerns when one considers that the key to the heart of each film is different. In Darko, the driving force of narrative is existential. In the box, the driving force behind the narrative stems from a moral dilemma. Believe me when I say that I understand the inclination to compare a filmmaker's innovative films by looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to approach each new film as a self-contained entity first, and then broaden my gaze afterwards. <br /> <br /> The Box is one of those movies about which you have mixed feelings because it seems to be in some sort of identity crisis. It's not always what you want to be. The twists are numerous, but easy to follow, if not predicted. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz play a relatively credible couple of newlyweds who are struggling financially. A box containing a "button unit" arrives at your door and they are informed by a horribly burned man that if the button is pressed will cause the death of a person they do not know, and they will receive a million dollars. One of the things The Box achieves is to ward off this invisible fear that somewhere our actions have moral consequences. Before the button is pressed, it has a sinister and seductive, attractive and sinister quality. Once this has been pushed, the events are set in motion, causing the two leaders to question their own morality and deeply regret their fateful decision. <br /> <br /> The notion that Cash is an experience is interesting because, for me, it provides the film with a paradox. If there are external beings developing a "coefficient of altruism" based on data collected by couples pushing and not pressing the button, then, as the conspiracy unfolds, we note that ultimately it is a forced altruism: Be altruistic or the species will be exterminated. I suppose couples do not know the consequences of their actions when they are faced with the decision, but they have no reason to suspect The Box can do anything, so why would they choose altruistically? Is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care about it when we come across a problem in our own lives? <br /> <br /> The psychological obstacles in this movie are everywhere. Push the button or it is not, someone is probably touching you. Take the money or not, nobody gives anything for free. Look for the truth, the answers you find slowly reveal your death. <br /> <br /> I propose that The Box is an ironic work, because it offers the false choice of free will, while revealing that we are stuck in many metaphorical boxes. You can only choose to be free at the expense of another person's life, is that freedom? No, it's just another box, because then you get caught up in the consequences of your own morality. There is no escape for us because we live on Earth and this is another Box. This is precisely why the external beings of the film are ultimately antagonistic. They demand that we conform to the moral standards that rob us of our freedom. We got to Mars, and we were burned for it and we became slaves in a sick game. <br /> <br /> References to Jean Paul Sartre illustrate this point well. "You can only enter the last camera free, or not free." Sure, but no matter how we get into the camera, it's a camera, though. <br /> <br /> Trevor Nemeth
