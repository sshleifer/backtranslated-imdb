This is a film about a six year old from a village in Maharashtra (a state in India) and his grandfather who comes to Pune (a city in Maharashtra) to treat the child's eyes. here the grandfather learns that the child has cancer in both eyes and that they need to be removed to save the child's life. the movie is about the main characters and their feelings and actions until the operation. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a typical Indian clich√© movie, so do not expect to see music or romance or melodrama. This is an extremely elaborate sensitive film, which resorts to silent expressions, rather than to the top of the dialogues, to get the point. witness the scene in which the grandfather is informed about the need to remove the child's eyes. the acting is superb, dialogue breaks the heart. his heart clings to the grandfather who has the unenviable task of telling the child and mother about the operation. <br /> <br /> The handling of the subject has been excellent. The film was made under great difficulty by the director, Sandeep Sawant, who had to hit many doors to collect the Rs. six million (approximately US $ 130,000) from the budget. even so, the finished product looks polished and has decent production values. also witness the subtle contrast of the village town shown by the director, incorporating some random shots of the boy's life in the village. Sawant definitely seems to prefer the village life. <br /> <br /> Everyone's performance is excellent. Amruta Subhash as a social worker is competent, adding the necessary human touch to her role. Sandeep Kulkarni as the docter is great, showing perfect mannerisms of a doctor. Ashwin Chitale as the child is natural. he does not seem to be acting. everything about it is natural and does not seem forced. <br /> <br /> But above all else is Arun Nalawade as the grandfather. he is amazing in his role. mere words can not describe their work. is a performance to keep forever. <br /> <br /> Shwaas is a sincere effort to make a good movie. should not be ignored just by the fact that this shows that if things are kept simple, the results can be really surprising. 10/10.
