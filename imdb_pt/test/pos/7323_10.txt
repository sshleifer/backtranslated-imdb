The unit Columbia Pictures Short Subject never had any illusions about the production of any 'Art' Films. They wanted to give the film's exhibitors a little more money by booking a Columbia Picture in their movie theaters. That would double for the 3 Stooges films. MEN IN BLACK (1934) came as close as any of his Comedy Shorts in which he received an Oscar nomination for Best Short Subject, Comedy. Although it did not win, well it could have. It was good enough and even those who do not rank among the Stooge files still seem to be overcome by the cry of "....... calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!" This was the second entry of the long Stooges Comedy Shorts series to producer Jules White, head of Columbia's Short Affairs Department. Only Woman Hates, described in her credits as a "musical novelty," preceded her in Harry Cohen's Poverty Row store. The film starts at the office of Dr. Graves, the head of the hospital. He is receiving new trainees and when addressing the group, he reports that three of them were passed on Medical Conditionality because they stayed there for so long. But, the good doctor states that he will not reveal their identities as long as they commit themselves to all "...... for duty and for humanity!" The Stooges run ahead promising "... for Duty and Humanity!" And run out of the office, smashing the window pane at the door. The game was in progress. <br /> The Stooges took off and did not stop for the rest of the 2 Reels. All kinds of gags were in evidence. From broad jokes such as Sennett, to puns, to humor dialects, to the theater of absurdity and a surreal joke involving a Public Address System, which apparently takes on its own life and taking the real culprit, a radio tube take a shot "... ..... He got me!" (Everything works out very well, honestly!) The scenarios used were very authentic and were undoubtedly borrowed from the resources of Columbia being made at the same time. There are plenty of wheelchairs, surgical swabs, stethascopes, scalpels, etc., in evidence to keep the illusion of a hospital. <br /> <br /> The true strength of MEN IN BLACK is the high number of unnamed people. players, whom we all recognize by the face. Along with them, the film prides itself on a large number of veteran comedy actors, who always present great performances, often stealing the scene. People with names like Billy Gilbert, Hank Mann and Bud Jamison shine in small parts. <br /> <br /> And finally we have Maestro, Director-Master Raymond McCarey, Leo McCarey's younger brother who showed his skills in getting this little movie "in the can." He skillfully kept everything moving, acting like a traffic cop at times, what with all the actors, extras and behind the scenes of the team moving and out of the way of each other. And that does not count the Giant 3 Man Tandem Bicycle, the Sway Backed Horse and the Miniature Race Cars, not to mention the 'Giant, Green Canaries!'
