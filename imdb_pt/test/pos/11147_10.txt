This film is exceptional in that Marlene & Raymond present remarkable performances. The acting in this film is the greatest force of the production, but the script, direction and edition deserve applause. There is an extraordinary chemistry that exists between the two stars. If you like Marlene and like Raymond, you'll love this movie ... (It's a classic that compares to Casablanca.) <br /> <br />
