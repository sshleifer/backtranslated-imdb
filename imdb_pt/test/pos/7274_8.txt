Oh how refreshing to see a vision of 18th-century England complete with mud, smallpox and gazelle ... and accompanied by a delectable techno soundtrack. This is the story of the demoted bandit Plunkett (Robert Carlisle) and Captain Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller), and how they come together and steal the aristocratic pigs. Plunkett is a tough nut, but MaCleane is very polite to it, and thus becomes "knight knight". He falls in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler), (who to be frank is the only weak part of the whole thing) and wants to impress her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are fantastic. Large, colorful, historically innate and beautiful togs. Alan Cummings receives all the best topics, and the best lines like Lord Rochester, sporting a piercing of eyebrows very different from century XVIII. The song changes from a glorious choir to a bass-loaded techno that does not do what you think you should do in a historical movie. The script is quick and peppered with modern colloquialisms; Merchant Ivory, this is not. There are hilar parts, disgusting parts, sit-on-the-seat-and-nibble parts of the nails, but the whole thing stretches and is wonderfully fun everywhere. This is an exciting thing in the movies. Unmissable.
