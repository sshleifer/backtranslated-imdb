Few people realize this, but there was world literature in the ancient world before the Greeks came on the scene. In addition to the literary remains in the "Old Testament" of the Jews, there were considerable works of Mesopotamia and Egypt. The summit of the first was religious poetry and "The Epic of Gilgamesh". The Egyptians produced many poems, but the main addition was an adventure tale of a traveler and doctor called "The Story Of Sinuhe." It is from this work (actually a fragment, we do not know the end) that the novel "The Egyptian" came from. <br /> <br /> The story is unique (just like the movie). "The Egyptian" was a bestseller in the early 50's, and Darryl Zanuck decided to risk: yes, he wanted a showcase for his girlfriend Bella Darvi as Nefer, as well as the rest of the cast (Victor Mature, Edmund Purdom, Peter Ustinov , Michael Wilding and Gene Tierney), but he knew that these films rarely made big box office. You can sketch this as an example of Zanuck trying something different. <br /> <br /> The number of films dealing with ancient Egypt is very small. "The Land of the Pharaohs", "The Egyptian", "The Ten Commandments" (De Mille versions), "Moses", "Holy Moses", "Cleopatra" While the second "Ten Commandments" discusses Ramses the Great (Pharoah Ramses II - Yul Brynner) and his father Seti I (Cedric) The greatest pharaoh of Egypt was Thutmose III, who conquered most of the Middle East known from the 1470 BC era or so. film about him appeared, nor from his predecessor usurper, the first great female ruler of history, Hatschepsut. But the only known Pharaoh who attempted a religious revolution that approached what the Jews (and later the Christians) tried - a kind of monotheism - is the theme of the "Egyptian." This is Pharaoh Akhnaton. In fact, Akhnato n was practicing a personal form of monotheism that was not for public consumption. But this infuriated the priestly class who worshiped Ammon instead of Aton. Due to our uncertain historical records (although Akhnaton's official records - the "Tel-el-Amana" letters - are quite complete as far as they survive), we do not know whether the Pharaoh was killed in a palace coup or not. However, he died, he was succeeded by a young brother or son of his, whose name is best remembered than any other pharaoh except Rameses: Tutankhamun. <br /> <br /> This movie is really very good as far as it goes. Wilding makes a humorous Akhnaton, who is too weak to be as effective as a religious reformer should be. Mature is good as the ambitious (and - out of the movie - finally successful future Pharaoh) Horemheb. Tierney and Purdom do well in their main parts and Ustinov is good as a friend of Purdom. It is also good to Mrs. Darvi in ​​a great deal of support. In a wonderful cameo is John Carridine, as a thief of philosophical tombs. The film is certainly worth seeing, as one of the few attempts to show part of the history and culture of Ancient Egypt.
