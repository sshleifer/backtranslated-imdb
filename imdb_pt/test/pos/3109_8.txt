Wow, I'm learning so fast that sometimes when you watch a movie when you're young and then again 20 years later you get a different view - mostly because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great a director he was and how much of that made that movie fly. All I can say is ... I really enjoyed this movie as it touched on an area that resembled my life: lasting friendship between two women. Can this exist? Well, in certain doses, yes ... and this movie blurted out a bit ... "like." <br /> <br /> Being a young man with little experience of life the first time I saw it So I focused more on the "rich" and "famous" part of the two. At the time, I did not know there was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered that there was ... and how that would affect their friendship. Through his men, his career, the decades that defined them. And coming to realize that one thing remained stronger than anything else ... their friendship and getting to know each other more than anyone else could have. <br /> <br /> So I got older, I studied the movie a little bit ... and I saw this movie again with my best friend from high school. We understand the angle 'rich' and 'famous' ... and we are still best friends ... but this film is not a work of cinematic art ... can be seen as a little overdone sometimes ... a little above the top in stitches (kind of on a level of 'Dynasty' and 'Dallas' for me ...) and honestly I can identify myself with the "teddy bear" scene because we share a bear that means much more than a stuffed fun toy through our trials and tribulations with men / careers, et al..so not as overpowering as it seems ....! As many have already said, seeing Meg Ryan and Matt Latanzzi and Dack Rambo and David Selby are great in this 1981 piece. This is a good chick movie!
