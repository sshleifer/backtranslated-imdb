Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and will probably never be again. From the first image of that police light blinding you and from there you heard the words: "Police Squad - in color", you were surprised to see that this was by no means a common sitcom. <br /> <br /> Kill an "Invited Star" and never refer to it again where you've seen it before. Then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention, you would lose several jokes in the background. Do not pay close attention to one thing or you would regret it. This was the show that video recorders were made long before Married with Children or The Simpsons. <br /> <br /> The stories did not make sense and the dialogue was sometimes so strange that you had to think about it. for 5 minutes before realizing it was a joke. The characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came straight out of Dragnet and they were absolutely straightforward (no accents or funny expressions), but instead there were puns and twists phrases interpreted utterly unimpressive. Only once, as I recall, was a segment played for silly laughter - a scene involving a trip to a dentist, suction and lots of saliva. <br /> <br /> There were some boring moments - like the informant. Johnny and an appearance of some celebrity. This was strictly a joke moment, but they had to use it in all six episodes. Oh well. Everything can not be perfect. The important thing is that the rest of the time you were in the knee in tears of laughter. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen was fortunate that this revived her career when they put the Frank Drebin character in 3 features, but must have been an Achilles heel as well. Can you remember seeing him in anything except Naked Gun work ever since? And do not tell the awful Mr Magoo reworked for live action. He probably made a lot of money.
