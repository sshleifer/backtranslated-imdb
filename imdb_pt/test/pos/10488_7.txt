I was not familiar with this movie, until I saw it included in a list of the Top 20 Spaghetti Westerns I encountered recently (following the marathon I've done in recent weeks of sub genre films); it was auspicious, then, that the film had to appear almost immediately on Italian TV at dawn (for the first time, I'm sure, in a good number of years)! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the cable reception of the channel on which it was broadcast has not been great lately: I recorded the film on VHS but decided not to keep it because of this factor; as it happened, the next day I watched the film, I discovered that it was available on a DVD of Region 2 of Italy (with an interview with uncredited writer Ernesto Gastaldi) - and, having been sufficiently impressed, I decided to order it. from time to time, even though I knew I would not get to the DVD for a long time, because I wanted to allow some time between watching one movie and the next! A brief parenthesis here: when I recently bought a series of Spaghetti Westerns on Italian DVD, I chose not to order Sergio Sollima's FACE TO FACE (1967), because I had the impression that it was a simple case; however, I just learned that the disc contains an interview with the director (as was the case with THE BIG GUNDOWN [1966], which I bought). It struck me as disconcerting that Sollima did not offer a similar contribution to the DVD edition of the film, when he actually considered FACE TO FACE as his favorite work (according to the director's talent included in the Blue Underground Region 1 album by another Sollima Spaghetti). Western - RUN, MAN, RUN [1968]); the problem is that I loved THE BIG GUNDOWN so much that I followed with a vision of FACE TO FACE through the recording I made of Italian TV! I asked for the DVD of the movie now - especially because it is still discounted - but as I said with regard to a second look at THE PRICE OF POWER (although I can still check Sollima's interview when the disc arrives) ... /> <br /> OK, complaints: the movie under review is a rather unusual and very interesting, indeed ambitious, Western Spaghetti being a transposition of the JFK murder case into an Old West scenario! In fact, it is reminiscent of Anthony Mann's treacherous black-and-white thriller, THE TALL TARGET (1951) - which was about an assassination attempt against the then U.S. President Abraham Lincoln's life. He presents one of the most popular Italian stars of this subgenre, Giuliano Gemma, in what is perhaps his most impressive role in the West (many of his other films tend to have a slight inclination). The supporting cast includes at least two other notables: Van Johnson (in one of his few Italian films) as the dead American president in the post-Civil War in Dallas and Fernando Rey as head of a conspiracy of Southerners - who not only plot his assassination, but also conveniently maneuvers the new American leader in office, Johnson's vice president, through blackmail! <br /> <br /> Benito Stefanelli also makes a good impression as a corrupt sheriff who chases Gemma throughout the film, and with whom he has sometimes engaged in a 'duel in the dark' - with his guns resting on the ground , and not in their respective holsters, and the only light in the room provided by the end of the cowboys cigars! Also involved is Ray Saunders as Gemma's black partner, to whom the narrative eventually becomes the doomed figure of "Lee Harvey Oswald." Stelvio Massi - who later cut his teeth, as a director, in several poliziotteschi - is behind the film's luminous cinematography; Similarly, Luis Enrique Bacalov provides yet another great "Euro-Cult" score - which is quite different from Ennio Morricone's style to be equally distinguishable. Valerii's direction here can be as imposing as in other western spaghetti, but he deals with procedures with sufficient efficiency (the final shooting is especially well done); the film is certainly one of the most underrated entries of the subgenre and, for those who wanted it, the novelty of the plot should only make it visible ...
