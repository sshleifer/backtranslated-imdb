Well, SWORD IN THE MOON finally had a DVD release in Korea, and despite the most negative responses I've heard, and the suspiciously delayed release of the DVD, I could not stop picking it up - any wu xia movie is better than that most non-wow movies in my eyes: D Maybe low expectations were an advantage, because I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> A murderer is killing several ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne, and the government swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit. This does not take long, but the answer is not one he wanted to hear. Through prolonged flashbacks, we learn why, and the story of the swordsman and the killer, and the revolution. <br /> <br /> The film is typically melodramatic for a Korean movie, and resolutely serious in tone - no comedy-style HK moments to be found here. The story may be a bit difficult to follow at first, but it all makes sense eventually. The movie goes a little hesitant at the end but not worse than a Chang Cheh movie could do, and for the most part I found it enjoyable. The production values ​​are high, with good cinematography to capture it. The fight scenes do not measure up to the best films in Hong Kong, but perhaps they are not to be - the fights are more "realistic" as they are less like choreographed dance routines, but there are some occasional cable and cgi work that put the movie in "wu xia" mode. The movie does not have the best cast, unfortunately, with the leads being a bit lacking in charm and occasionally hard to distinguish from each other. There's a young woman in the movie that I do not think I've seen before, but it makes the best impression on any of the basics - not just because you see your nekkid ... or maybe it's: p The movie lacks the charm and grace of best movies from Hong Kong, and maybe the beauty too, but I just wanted HK to leave them with half of it - Twins Effect 2 does not give me hope that this is about to happen soon, though Tsui Hark certainly still has in it , if he can get the funding and cast. SWORD IN THE MOON will not be on my favorite wu xia list, but it's much better than ROMANTIC WARRIORS or LEGEND OF THE EVIL LAKE - maybe better than BICHUNMOO too, although I really enjoyed that movie. bit more in a second view. Obviously, it's not even close to the wonderful MUSA, but it's a completely different case. SITM will probably have a second audience within three years, which is perhaps the best indicator of how much I liked :) 7/10
