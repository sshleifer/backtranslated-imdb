I have to admit I've never heard of this movie. I got it last night at TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the ending. Imagine what a film of Marx's brothers would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolm X and then everyone would abandon LSD. <br /> <br /> Funny and edgy are two words used too much these days, this movie has over 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surreal to boot. I had to be at 6:00 in the morning and watched until 2:30. I slept and lost my obligations. Still worth it. I would not recommend renting, I would recommend owning it. It was so good. <br /> <br /> The only warning I have is that the references are dated and may not be obtained by younger people. Bare with it and use your head. <br /> <br /> I would have to put it in my best comedies of all time.
