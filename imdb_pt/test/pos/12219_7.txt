What can I say? I woke up this morning and turned on science fiction and watched half of the first season and discovered it all. Strange, unusual and brilliant. It gives you all the potential and at first I think that sounds stupid. This has to be the next best thing since X-Files, but as always, nothing is going to overturn this show in my opinion. I'm telling you, it's scary and then suspenseful and then mature. In the end you have Miles as a love puppy with a strange pet that is a new species. You have two people running away from the authorities. And a killer tsunami about to strike! Wow!! And I mentioned Miles pet is a potential killer (well the rest of his kind is). Surface is a brilliant spectacle with twists and turns that delivers everything.
