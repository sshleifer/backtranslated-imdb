This was the most compelling capital punishment film of all time! He refused to look unilateral and the emotions felt throughout history are as real as possible. This movie had one of the most 'human' religious characters (and I use this term in a good way) compassionate! This movie really made me go out to find and read the book (which is rare for me). Sister Helen exercised a spiritual rather than a religious tone (which is also rare). And presented both sides of the issue so that people on both sides who watched the film do not feel that one point was left out. And we have the director to thank for that. This is not a movie for entertainment. But it is the film that conveys a message that can reach the core of your heart. I can not think of another movie like that.
