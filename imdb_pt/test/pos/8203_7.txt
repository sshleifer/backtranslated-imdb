When "The Net" was first announced, the ads looked ridiculous. So when I saw it, it was actually pretty good. Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) spends her days working on the computer and never got to know her neighbors. Then, through a series of events, her identity is erased by a cabal of obscure people, and she can not prove she exists. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the film are a little overdone; you would probably know which parts if you saw the movie. Still, it's a good look at what the existence of the Internet may have caused in unsuspecting people. I recommend.
