Being a big fan of Monkey Island, I became a terrible person, since Ron Gilbert could not. Boy was I surprised! Although not as good as the first two, there is the comedy I wanted. I was a little nervous with the new graphics, the new SCUMM engine and just the fact that it was on a CD. But it all came together, and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of his favorite characters. I especially liked that SWORD FIGHTING returned. And the whole story about finding the big, unrevealed ring was simply amazing. Go ahead and experience this two-CD adventure. And now we can rejoice, because Monkey Island 4: Escape from Monkey Island is REALLY REALLY coming out soon! This fall!
