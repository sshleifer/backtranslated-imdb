what can I say, this movie is incredible. has its flaws as every movie does, for example, wobbly headstones in a graveyard, a clearly visible slide during the death scene of the penguins, Max Shreck losing his heavy coat in a fraction of a second between scenes during the scene of image consulting , batman losing his eye-black Makeup suddenly between shots so he can reveal Bruce Wayne to Catwoman, being recorded dialogue but is reproduced and spoken differently than when it was first spoken and lastly Catwoman suddenly knows how to use a whip without any training whatsoever. these flaws are minor compared to some you'd see in, for example, Batman Forever, where the charmer can obviously be seen waiting for his tip or for Kilmer's hair swapping between photos. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so worthy of an 8/10 is the great acting because the performances are absolutely incredible. Michael Keaton reprises his role as Batman and has much more to do in this movie. He seems more comfortable in the role of the second time and is on par with the performances of the villains. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like the penguin conversion to the grotesque penguin man instead of the non-threatening character of the comic book or TV show because now the character has more depth and has a much more interesting story that generates the basic need of family and feel accepted and desired. this gives us an evil character by which we feel sympathy because he was rejected for being what he is, which is not his fault. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as a catwoman. she is hail and sexy and she is also a villain by which we may feel sorry for the way she is victimized. Christopher Walken is a great secondary villain and is such an interesting character even though he is not in the batman universe. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is much better than the first and Danny Elfman is more likely to show off his musical talents this time around. The sets are amazing. They are detailed, attractive, sinister, gothic, unique, dark and many other adjectives can describe how incredible they are. the costumes and makeup are great and obviously a lot of work was done for them and all the work is worth it because the Batsuit is better, the cat clothing is amazing to look at and the makeup and effects of the penguins are so compelling. Penguins look really realistic and are played with good effect. The script is very good and the plot, in my opinion, is plausible. Overall, because of all these factors, this movie deserves an 8/10 and is my favorite of all Batman movies.
