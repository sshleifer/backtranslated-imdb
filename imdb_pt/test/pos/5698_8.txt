I swore I would never allow myself to move on to the false authority figures of the sixties who told me that things were better in the "good old days"? The current Australian Prime Minister is a sordid example of such a mentality. <br /> <br /> But I moved to "The Decade Under the Influence" because I found watching the much-publicized documentary "Sneakers" on the other channel is such a discouraging experience. I found the values ​​expressed by the interviewed "Sneakers" too ugly to accept as reasonable. So materialistic! So devoid of any sense of indignation in a society that can approve killing someone to steal your very ugly shoes! Therefore, the lack of any purpose they can report without displeasing the exploitation of an audience by making them widen their shoes to secure a patronage agreement for themselves with a company of shoemakers was too much to continue watching. "A Decade Under Influence" portrayed a completely different response to the fruit of stupidity, corruption and concupiscence in high (and low) places. <br /> <br /> I have noticed the change in the film doing this has accompanied the exposure of the disastrous US foreign policy disasters in Vietnam and so many less informed places on my website www.peterhenderson.com.au. "A Decade Under Influence" documents the exact moment the change occurred. Before the 1970s, the military was portrayed in American films as an invincible fighting force made up of decent human beings who turned out to conquer heroes on the battlefield. After the seventies, they are generally portrayed as a discouraged mob cheated by a bunch of bureaucratic clowns in the Pentagon. Before the seventies, the FBI agent and the honest cop tended to be described as their friends and protectors. After the seventies, the FBI agents were all incompetent, and the best a cop could aspire to was to ignore his foolishness and the corruption of his superior and defend justice in his own idiosyncratic way. Before the 1970s, the archetypal American "Little Guy," the "common Joe," the Jimmy Stewart type would face the problems encountered and thus gain some insight into the underlying wisdom of their elected leaders and the justice of the "American Way." After the Seventies, Kevin Costner usurps this role, but now he is the voice of someone crying out in the wilderness for the evil to be exposed, or to accept their fate and do the best they can. <br /> <br /> And now these "old-time religion" mentalities have been stripped of any honesty and righteousness and portrayed (with a certain amount of justification) as hypocritical intolerance and selfish hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> "A Decade Under Influence" says how it was. "The Decade Under the Influence" tells how it is now. It portrays the redemption of the American film industry from the hands of art moguls artistically, morally and intellectually bankrupt. It shows the takeover of Hollywood Bastille by independent filmmakers who have promised to lead a disillusioned and tired audience back to theaters. The fact that their failures are numerous and sometimes disastrous just underlines the greatness of their achievement. An achievement reflected in the attitudes of adventure and questioning of the big box office stars such as Clooney, Daman, Affleck etc and the directors and producers who provide the vehicles for their talent.
