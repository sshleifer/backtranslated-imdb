This film was the introduction for many of us to the works of K Gordon Murray. That's because it was easy to find. It was on all public domain labels in the VHS era, and before that, a late night cult classic t.v., double knee thigh slapper. Also, how do you resist the title? For those who arrive late, a brief explanation of their merit: Florida's wheel dealer, K. Gordon Murray, imported Mexican horror films, dubbed them English, and minted them with input. The Mexican ORIGINALS were weird enough to begin with; American borders and accepted horror film conventions were blithely disregarded. Great, great design and lighting were placed alongside strange or laughable special effects. NOTHING in Hollywood has been as close as these have been out and out strange. Now, mix social conventions influenced by Catholics, Mexican folklore, and we're not in Kansas anymore. <br /> <br /> Add to that the scripts in English in which they were dubbed. The majority was written by Reuban Guberman, who wanted the words to correspond to the movements of the lips of the actors on the screen, not the literal translation. As a result, American soundtracks tended to go from exhausted down and to the right. There is even a fan site for Murray that prints the best, more on the main lines of each film. First-time viewers in the movies complain about rhythm, purple prose, production values ​​and say they're supposed to be like this ... while people laugh with satisfaction at things usually considered fatal movie flaws. Everything must be very confusing if you have no taste for it. <br /> <br /> This was back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series; THE ASTECA MOM AND THE MALDY OF ASTEC MOM. All three are now available on disc 3 AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION (BCI) and it's time. It has the version K Gordon Murray on one side, the original Mexican production on the other side. The contrast between the two is fascinating. Many times the original Spanish is not much healthier. <br /> <br /> ROBOT / MUMMY begins with a good flashback prolonging the speed of previous episodes, more or less continuity has been eliminated. window on number two, and it's from there, logical wise. You do not even get the Angel back, or any mention of him in this final episode. Names, places, and even family trees alternate between movies. After a while, you begin to look for continuity changes. So far, the villain in the Doc Krupp series is totally crazy, almost drooling with dementia and still wants to steal the Aztec pectoral. Rosita Arenas is sent back to the past with another beautiful edition of the ASTEC parade, and wanders into the darkness in her nightgown to help find the breastplate again. The mummy is no happier with it, so it was the last time. <br /> <br /> The robot actually has a production credit. It was made by 'Viana & Co S.A.'. I mentioned this because it seems that the grips appeared between the takes on a slow afternoon when the real outfit was walking. No. <br /> <br /> This has been PLANNED. <br /> <br /> Wait until you see the controller from where it runs. X box, where were you when Krupp needed you ?? The Robot LOOKS was crushed to death in the end, but actually came back in two more Mexican films ... he had a FAN BASE .. In all, a quirky and funny finish for a series of three movies. . Sit down and enjoy.
