I feel like I know these people and I know people who are like them. Nowadays, however, people are discouraged from showing such a passion for anything, especially love and solitude. It has a slow start, but then look out! If you like romantic comedies, but would like to see one that has some basis in reality for a change (or at least it's back in the '70s) then you should see this movie!
