Like the first, the JACKASS team is back to try to kill themselves in whatever way they think fit. Or you're fitting into a tractor tire and down a slope. Or being deliberately crushed by a bull. worse. <br /> <br /> The first one was crazy, and that's how you can describe it. It was also very difficult to laugh movie. But this is completely crazy. It's even more dangerous acrobatics, and even more laughs So I I think watching stupid assholes get killed is the funniest thing this week. <br /> <br /> So, before BORAT comes out, I'll laugh at my exit.
