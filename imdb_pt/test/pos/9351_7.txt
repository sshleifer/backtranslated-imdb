** SPOILERS ** Really based on the novel "The Brick Foxhole" about a gay man who was murdered by a GI license because of his sexual orientation. The movie "Crossfire" is about a violently anti-Semitic GI who, because of his own failures and frustrations in life, takes him out of Jewish persuasion. From whom he obviously feels threatened. Being attacked at a local ginger factory in Washington DC, Montgomrey, Robert Ryan, sees Joseph Samuel, Sam Leven, and starts getting a little too much. sarcastically, friendly with him. It seems that Montgomery is a little annoyed with Samuels because he is talking to his best friend and culinary friend Arthur Mitchell, George Cooper. Samuel is also succeeding, what the Neanderthal Montgomery can not, for the sensitive young GI who is in the arts, he is an artist and painter on the outside, about war, the Second World War that has just ended. Just like unstable peace, if that is what happens to the dawn of the atomic bomb, this is now following in this very dangerous and unstable world. What really outrages Montgomery more than anything else about Samuels is that he is obviously Jewish. That more than anything else is enough reason for the racist Montgomery wanting to make Samuels. <br /> <br /> Samules Inviting Mitchell to join him and his friend Miss Lewis, Marlow Dwyer, in their apartment to take a couple of drinks and continue the very deep and stimulating conversation they started at the bar. This has one, which seems very jealous and feeling hurt and rejected Montgomery along with his also inebriated but a little clueless, in what Montgomery's plans for Samuels are, friend and fellow GI Floyd Bowers, Steve Brodie, later that night without being invited to Samuels' Place, put. With the party already over, with Mitchell and Miss Lewis missing, the two drunken soldiers unceremoniously knock the place down. The fact that Samuels, in Montgomery's sick, anti-Semitic mind, had stolen Mitchell, turned him into a warm white frenzy. Montgomery and Bowers invade Samuel's house, attacking his well-groomed liquor cabinet with Montgomery taking a few sips, against Samuels 'strong objections, Samuels' very broad and refined wines and drinks, which is very different from the unpleasant drink and cockroach. Montgomery is used for booze. This all led to a violent and brutal attack on Samuels by drunken, drunken psycho Montgomery, with Bowers chilled on the couch of all the drink he consumed, beating the poor, innocent man to death. <br /> <br /> The film "Crossfire" then goes on a long and tedious, since it is obvious from the outset who is Samuels killer, investigating why Samuels, a wounded and decorated veteran of World War II, was with purple heart at the Battle of Okinawa. Murdered with Montgomery acting like he was really interested, yes, sure, in finding Samuels killer, who in fact is himself. This called voluntarily action on the part of Montgomery in order to cast off the suspicion of himself that he may be the man who killed him. <br /> <br /> Montgomery is so ridiculous and even for someone who presumably considers himself very intelligent, stupid in him constantly opening his big yap and vomiting epitaphs and anti-Semitic and racist insults about the murdered Samuels. ! This only throws suspicion on himself and anyone else. I guess this guy just could not help it. <br /> <br /> It is not enough that Montgomery murdered Samuels, who in his sick mind was one of them, he even murdered his frightened friend to death, being implicated in the murder of Samuels, Bowers! Who in Montgomery's racist mindset is one of the "we"! Just because he feared Bowers would talk to the police in order to save his sorry neck and thus put the spotlight on Montgomey on the death of Samuels. <br /> <br /> It does not take so long for Captain Finlay's case detective Robert Young to see through the lies and obvious lies of Montgomerys, and then he mounted him having another "friend" of GI his Leroy (William Phipps ), who was the target of all his idiot and racist jokes from the hick, put the arrogance up. This has Montgomery returning to the scene of his crime, where he murdered Bowers, where a trap was created for him. That was all Captain Finlay needed to panic in Montgomery, when Montgomery saw that the jig was in order, and ran straight into the crossfire of a police ambush. <br /> <br /> Dating a bit now, but very blunt in 1947 when it was released. "Crossfire" addressed the horrors of anti-Semitism, when it was then kept under cover, and out of sight, in almost every post-World War II Hollywood movie about the evils of racism in the US and Europe. Even after World War II and what happened to the Jews in it. When it should have been given the very complete and honest, for the film to go public, which it rightly deserved.
