The first in a new style of films for the Lamas - without tattoos, motorcycles or caratecas. I, for example, miss them. But this is a serious movie. He plays an FBI profile expert who has lived so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer trusts anyone, including himself. Gary Busey is a great actor or someone I would not want to meet in broad daylight on a busy street. Kristen Cloke pursues Lamas as obstinately as she pursues the serial killer. There is one surprise after another as the story unfolds no less than it is the end. It seems to never arrive - there is always one more layer to the story. Cloke and Lamas start out as the good ones, turn into bad guys and somehow do away with the heroes. But definitely worth the price of the rental. For maximum enjoyment, throw in a chocolate bar, a bag of popcorn and a soda. You're going to the movies!
