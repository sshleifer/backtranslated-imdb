Once you get over Nic Cage playing an Italian soldier who loves opera and believes in making love, not war, you may start to like this beautiful movie. This could be used as an advertisement for tourism in the Mediterranean. John Hurt is great and Penelope Cruz is not bad, as you might expect. The character of Christian Bale is somewhat one-dimensional, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> The main drawback of this film is the adaptation of the book - having been told subsequently the differences between the book and the plot of the film, I feel cheated of a much better and more convincing plot.
