An interesting film based on three of Jules Verne's novels. Considering the special effects and improved computer animation of today, this film stands out as a historical marker of resourcefulness and cinematic imagination. Karel Zeman brought to life the lithographic images of the original texts of Jules Verne. This is a must see for classic science fiction and history buffs. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 9 out of 10. Enjoy !!
