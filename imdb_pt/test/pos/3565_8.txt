George Hilton never grabs me like Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood, but this is a great ride for him. Basically rippin off Django / nameless man and doing a pretty good job. The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat mouse games that follow are a delight to watch. Fans of the genre will be in heaven.
