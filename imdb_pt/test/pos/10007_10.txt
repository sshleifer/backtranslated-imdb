This movie is amazing because the fact that real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job is as if they were almost living the past again. Jia Hongsheng plays himself an actor who left everything except music and drugs, fighting depression and seeking the meaning of life, while getting angry at everyone, especially the people who care about him the most. There are moments in the movie that will make you want to cry because the family, especially the father, did such a good job. However, this movie is not for everyone. Many people who suffer from depression will understand the problem of Hongsheng and why he does the things he does, for example, keep locked in a dark room or go for a walk or ride a bike alone. Others may see the film as boring because it is so real that it's almost like a documentary. Overall, this movie is great and Hongsheng won an Oscar for this movie, as did his father.
