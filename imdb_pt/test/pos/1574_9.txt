Until I did a web search on "What Alice Found", I did not realize that the name of the movie is embedded in the title of one of Lewis Carroll's books. The full title of the book is "Through the Looking-Glass" (and what Alice found there). <br /> <br /> The Alice of the movie comes from a scenario quite different from that of Lewis Carroll's Alice. His fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. The movie Alice begins as a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her boss and runs to Miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. She finds a middle-aged couple in a motor home (the husband retired from the military) who rescue her from a strange man at a roadside stop and from the collapse of his car (perhaps caused by his mechanizations). <br /> <br /> As it turns out, the couple is heavily involved in the prostitution of truck stoppages and sees sweet young Alice as a promising recruit. The wife (played by Judith Ivey in a performance worthy of some grand prize) purchases Alice's sexy clothes and shows how to apply hot makeup. Initially, Alice passively accepts his care and, with the couple's instructions, does several tricks. The meeting shown in more detail is quite different from the more cinematic sex, but may be typical of what happens most often in real life. The man is shy and respectful and apologizes for "finishing" too fast. <br /> <br /> What is wonderful about Alice (and unlike her prototypes from Clarissa to Sister Carrie) is that she learns from her experiences and asserts herself. That's how things really are. Prostitution is everywhere. People are neither good nor bad. Alice leaves the trailer with her well-deserved money and a sense of mutual respect.
