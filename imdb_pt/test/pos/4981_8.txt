Extremely entertaining in the mid-1950s, which means a lot in just 96 minutes in length. Most viewers will quickly be drawn into this story and find the experience quite enjoyable. More than just a B-Western, but not really an epic, the budget was modest and the cast accessible despite several big names. Glenn Ford was the only box office tie at the time. Edward G. Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck had passed their cousins ​​and looking for work, Stanwyck was 10 years of a new popularity in "The Big Valley". Brian Keith and Dianne Foster were just getting started. <br /> <br /> Ford plays John Parrish, a small farmer who decides to sell himself when the nice sheriff is murdered by a big farmer's gunman (Robinson). Parrish is a former Confederate officer who only moved west for health reasons. <br /> <br /> Robinson plays Lee Wilkison, who already owns most of the valley and intends to get the rest, fulfilling a promise to his wife Martha (Stanwyck). Lee was crippled in a land war he fought 12 years before; his brother Cole (Keith) came from Texas to help him carry out the huge spread. Lee has turned a blind eye to obvious connections between Stanwyck and Keith, but sensitive daughter Judith (Foster) is understandably upset about what is happening in her home. <br /> <br /> John Parrish has promised his fiancee Caroline (May Winn) that he will return to the east. Caroline, who is inspired by Grace Kelly's "High Noon" character, interrupts her engagement at the first sign of trouble and simply disappears from the film. This leaves the way open for John and Judith's novel to unfold. <br /> <br /> Violence begins early and continues throughout the film, with Parrish able to apply military tactics against an enemy who underestimates his ability and determination. He has a very original clash with the main shooter midway through the movie. Ford plays one of his standard characters; the modest guy who disarms everyone with a self-deprecating way, which is slow to offend, but brutal when finally provoked (much like his role in "The Sheepman"). <br /> <br /> Robinson is also excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity, though physically only a shadow of his former self. And he gets enough lines and screen time to properly develop his character. Stanwyck has the most difficult role and she simply is not convincing as the classic two-faced woman, an apparently loyal wife who is planning to replace her husband with his brother. In part, this is because she does not get enough time to do anything but superficially convey either side of the character. That being said, a talented actress could have done a much better job even with these limitations. <br /> <br /> Dianne Foster is a pleasant surprise. It should remind viewers of much Carroll Baker, both physically and in acting style. Although forced to play Judith according to the 1950 convention (she may be harsh, but then forced into hysteria after every major confrontation), Foster shows a good range. She conveys a growing attraction to Parrish, but does so subtly that it is only in retrospect that the various clues fit together. The real problem with "The Violent Men" is that it attempts to be both a Western action and a piece of moral character study. Because a lot has to happen on the screen, much of the action is rushed and many of the characters receive only a superficial treatment. This is neither a fatal flaw nor a reason to avoid the film, but it could have been significantly better with another 20 minutes in duration or the absence of unnecessary characters like Caroline. <br /> <br /> So, again, what do I do? to know? I'm just a kid.
