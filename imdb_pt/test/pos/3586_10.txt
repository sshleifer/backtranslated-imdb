full of surprises, beautiful, cruel sometimes. as well as life itself. leaves one asking for more. The best parts are, of course, action scenes and chases. have to really wonder how much work these guys put in to do some scenes (whale chases, polar bear hunts, etc.). is a wonderful and not to be missed experience for anyone who dives, surfs or goes to the beach from time to time. the music is attractive and the narration is superb and extremely well paced. definitely one of the best documentaries ever made and not worth less than a very respectable 10 (for its kind). some of the footage is very cruel and may not be recommended for people with weak stomachs (every shot of a murderous whale is cruel).
