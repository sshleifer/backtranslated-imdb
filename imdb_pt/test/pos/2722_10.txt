From "36 Chowringhee Lane" to "15 Park Avenue," Aparna Sen indeed traveled a long way. If the former falls in history as the clean sweep of a debutante, the latter will definitely occupy a special place as a "mature" film. Until you see 15 Park Avenue you can not feel moved and moved at the same time. Excited to see the ingenuity and agility of the director in portraying challenging situations and moved by the sensitivity that echoed throughout the film. It's not a movie that just makes you feel "tchh tchh, how hard life should be for schizophrenics," but it asks a much deeper question about the reality you see and believe. Sen did a brilliant job of highlighting this supreme fact of our existence that we are all, in one way or another, trying to live in a fantasy world, trying to run after mirages called happiness, peace, contentment. Along with the depiction of an illusory mind, Sen's magic has produced many small nuances of human relationships as they sustain stress and tension. The fact that sometimes we all lose quiet, break, make wrong choices, be haunted by guilt, behave selfishly, and so on, is captured with extreme dexterity by Sen. She pointed out the cruel dilemma with which Shabana had to handle your entire life. , of having to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with a husband and children for herself. And in always being close to her sister, always being a strong person, giving support, making judgments and so on, she unknowingly cut off some of the oxygen her sister needed to bloom. Is not it a very hard truth that sometimes in an attempt to do the best for someone else, do we strangle their assertiveness and end up damaging their self-esteem? Of course the performance of Konkona and Shabana deserves laurels, as always, because the ingredients had not been so good, the dish could not have been so extraordinary. Aparna Sen once again made a masterpiece of a movie for those who crave for some "food to think". Angry!
