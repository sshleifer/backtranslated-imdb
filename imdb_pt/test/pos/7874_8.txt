This was a disconcerting look at an ostensibly functional family confronted by her daughter's drugged boyfriend. Father entangled with, and finally kills junky boyfriend. Wallowing in guilt, he reveals to a drunken hick-boy what he did. Things quickly spiral out of hand before completely degenerating. The end you dread persecutes the viewer, but is still capable of frightening when it finally arrives.
