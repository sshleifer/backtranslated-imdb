This movie is like "The Breakfast Club" meets "Mad City". There's a turnaround behind the other, with Justin Walker, Corey Feldman and James Remar delivering great performances. However, this movie is not for everyone. If you do not like movies that "go all the way" to violence, then do not watch the last twenty minutes. My wife had to leave the room. Of course, I could not take my eyes off the screen. This is a really brave and realistic teenage drama. I can not believe it came from King B-Movie Roger Corman. This movie is a must-see for those who are not faint of heart. Highly recommended.
