I saw this movie when it came out. I thought an average movie. Now I realized that this director was ahead of his time. This is a great movie and a great soundtrack. I've seen my share of rock movies, but although this is far from being a lumbar puncture (which I did not like)> This movie takes us to the life of an 80s rocker wanting to be nothing more than that. This is nothing more than our inner child wanting to grow up to be a * ROCK STAR * Yes, I said that. Everyone wants to grow up and be in the spotlight (time said or not). This movie just puts you in the center of the emotions and you can almost feel the emotion of Izzy. I must admit that the performance was less even, but still the music and the story were enough to keep it going, until the credits rolled. Worth watching, especially if you are a fan of Ole hair bands.
