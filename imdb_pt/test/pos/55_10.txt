No blood, no sex (although there is passion) with no special effects, but just one of those pearls that appear on your movie screen when you're not really looking and catches your eye. <br /> <br /> Great acting, great sets, great music, beautiful story. If only there were a lot more movies made like that! <br /> <br /> Sets move us in time and make us feel like we're there. <br /> <br /> The acting appears like the real life. and elevates us to the level of consciousness of the "nanny", for whom no one is a lost cause, let alone the inhabitants of his own house "Midway." <br /> <br /> The best of all is a true story of misfits learning to "fit in". I was a bit jealous of the good times that everyone seemed to be having in the movie! Could we all spend some time in the nanny's house?
