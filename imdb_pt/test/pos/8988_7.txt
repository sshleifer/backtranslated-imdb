Young Warriors (1983) While this is a deeply flawed (and, to some extent, foolish) film, how it continually defies expectations makes viewing decent for adventurous fans. <br /> <br /> Meet yuppie college student Kevin and his gang of little buddies. In what begins as a particularly shocking teen sex comedy, we follow this bunch of idiots and their antics, which involve, among other things, prompting bricks to hit their genitals. The movie changes abruptly when Kevin's younger sister is brutally raped and beaten in a coma by a gang of motorcyclists who apparently have nothing better to do. When she dies in the hospital, Kevin promises revenge, much to the dismay of his detective father. So far, we've gone from Porky's-lite, through the territory of Last House On The Left, in what is seemingly shaping up to be your typical urban vigilante revenge movie. However, the portrait of Kevin and his gang goes from vaguely sympathetic to becoming crazy lunatics for killing. It's to the credit of the movie that he does not glamorize the fascist anti-crime rhetoric that Kevin continually releases, while still making it understandable that he feels the way he does. <br /> <br /> The mood swings to Dirty and Pessimistic very quickly, and in the end is so exaggerated and exploitative that it will leave you incredulous. And that's the strength of this movie. You never know what to expect next. <br /> <br /> In over 100 minutes, it's a bit time consuming for this kind of fare, but you're not bored. Bad acting for the most part, with cardboard cutouts for characters and some particularly ridiculous situations and stupid dialogues, this will not be at the top of anyone's forgotten list of classics anytime soon. I got a kick out of it though, and I'm sure anyone who reads it knows if they're willing to.
