This is a decent effort for a B-Movie Martial Arts actioner. Ian Jacklin, a former American Kickboxing Champion, is the leader and looks good in the action scenes. The muscled Matthias Hues has the chance to add more to his Martial Arts villain in this movie than in all of his many others and if you are a fan of The Teutonic Titan, rent this movie now! <br /> <br /> Renee Griffin is also noteworthy as the romantic interest in this film. It starts with attitude but soon warms up to the hero and they make "The Beast with two backs" in a very elegant way. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes are good in the American tradition (NO Hong Kong acrobatics here!) with additional realism of having Benny "The Jet" Urquidez interpreting himself as coach of John Larson (Jacklin). <br /> <br /> In short, this movie seems to have more sub plots than most in its genre, so you get more of a story.
