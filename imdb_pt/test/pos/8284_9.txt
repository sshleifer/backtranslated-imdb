When I saw this movie I was just a kid and I fell in love with it, they do not really make movies like that anymore, I just watch it again now a little older and I still love it. <br /> <br /> The humor is perfect and fits nicely into the movie, all the jokes are kind of kid-like, but they make the adults laugh too, and in a children's movie it's actually very rare. <br /> <br /> Animation is amazing and watching animations drawn by hand is a real breath of fresh air for all the computer animation we see today. The backgrounds are awesome and the coloring is incredible. <br /> <br /> Characters are exactly the kind of character you fall in love the moment you start to watch girls think the Squirrels are adorable and the Boys will think the Chipettes are really kind of sexy. <br /> <br /> The songs are fun to hear and some really make you want to cry or get up and dance, it's fun to watch the visual mood to go with them, too. <br /> <br /> The voice act is great, no doubt even though most of the dubbing is loud but something interesting has appeared and is one of the songs in this movie but slowed it down to show the real voices behind them and it's really fun to watch. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a store or somewhere to rent I say check out it's really worth seeing and it's a perfect family movie is absolutely amazing, words can not express this movie.
