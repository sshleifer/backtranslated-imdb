A movie that tends to be buried under prejudice and prejudice - it's a remake! Doris Day is in it! She sings! - Hitchcock's second fissure in "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is his most underrated film, and undoubtedly a complete masterpiece by itself. <br /> <br /> This is, in more ways than one, Doris. Movie of the day. Not only does she give the best performance of her career, more than she does against James Stewart, but the whole movie is subtly structured around her character, not his. This is, after all, a film in which music is both motif and plotting device. What better cast than the most popular singer of his generation? Consider: Jo McKenna of the day gave up on her stage career in order to settle down with her husband and raise her son. This seems to be a mutual decision and she does not seem to be unhappy. But look at the way Stewart provokes her in the horse-drawn carriage because of her concerns about Louis Bernard, implying that she is jealous that Bernard was not asking her any questions about her career. This is clearly a recurring joke between them - she responds with a 'har-de-har-har' that denotes the familiarity of this gag, suggesting that she has some latent resentment about her confinement, and that both realize it. After her son was kidnapped, Stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news. This is a cruel scene, brilliantly played by both actors, which illustrates the imbalance of power in his marriage - he is trying to control and subjugate his reactions, using his professional knowledge to suppress his voice in marriage, as well as his medical career. career as a singer. <br /> <br /> The power of this voice is demonstrated in the sequence of the Ambrose Chapel when it needs reign in its highly trained volume and clarity to blend in with the congregation of female drudges - they almost act as a warning of what will be her repression of her talent. At Albert Hall, it is your need to shout, to exercise those impressive lungs that save a man's life, and at the end of the embassy, ​​it is his talent and reputation that enables him to locate his son. In contrast, all of Stewart's masculine activity is counterproductive - his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end, he is left behind in the church while all the others move to Albert Hall, and his efforts only succeed in killing the killer, depriving so the Police potentially useful information. It is only when his action joins the voice of his wife, in Hank's rescue of the embassy, ​​that he really can do something useful. Far from being forced into the film to give Day an opportunity to sing, 'Que Sera Sera' acts as the first musical device in the film, foretelling the nightmare that is about to swallow the McKennas; 'The future is not ours to see' in fact. It also paves the way to the end, in which the close connection between mother and son through music will allow Doris to save the day. <br /> <br /> The film's most famous sequence makes music the central element - the accumulation of the assassination attempt at Albert Hall. This long speechless sequence may be the most extraordinary thing Hitchcock has committed to filming, the ultimate expression of his belief that movies should be stories told visually. We see people conducting conversations in this sequence, but we never hear a word they say. We do not need it - the pictures say it all. It's also his most exquisite thriller sequence, with the pieces moving slowly in place as the music builds. The editing is incredibly tight, combined with the music perfectly. There is no picture out of place-anything that does not relate directly to murder is giving the viewer a sense of the environment, the geography in which all this is happening. It develops slowly, but in the end the suspense is almost unbearable. When Jo yells, it's not just a relief to her, but to the audience. <br /> <br /> The Ambrose Chapel sequence is witty and particularly effective for anyone who has to go through a particular service. non-conformist church of mud-in-mud. The embassy sequence seems a little flat after the Albert Hall that preceded it on the first show, but the second time seems more effective, with the final walk under the gun's aim really benefiting from the wonderful use of Day singing in the background, reminiscent of music-as-environment-noise in 'Rear Window'. The score as a whole is subtle, allowing the music from on-screen sources to be brought to the forefront effectively. <br /> <br /> Bernard Miles is a discreet villain, somewhat banal, but with a dry mood. He is overshadowed by Brenda de Banzie as his wife, who walks in a fine line between the sinister and the sympathetic. Just look at the way she smokes a cigarette while her husband prepares the killer - his position is pure gangster mule, scorning the outside of the middle of England, but she clearly has a soft side and possibly maternal feelings towards Hank. <br /> <Stewart is excellent, although if Hitchcock has ever really chosen him as "Everyman," as the director's daughter seems to think, then confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. Stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who adopted the fascist ideology in Rope, a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in Indiscreet Window and an obsessive necrophilia in Vertigo. The day is nothing short of phenomenal. Just look at her reaction to the news that her son has been kidnapped - she never overdoes anything, but also sells nothing. This is one of Hitchcock's most emotionally effective films. He never lets us forget which are the McKennas bets; they feel the most human of all their central characters.
