I suspect there is some revisionist history going on here, but one definitely comes with the feeling that Patrice Lumumba was a troublemaker who incited his people to violence from the moment Congo declared independence. His inability to control his people and his decision to bring Soviet aid to put his military back on the line was obviously what enveloped the United States and led to his assassination. However, replacing it with Mobutu, the United States did not solve anything. They made the situation as bad as. Well-acted with excellent cinematography and an exhilarating score. Definitely worth seeing.
