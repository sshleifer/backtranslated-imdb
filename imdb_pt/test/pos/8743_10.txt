Traffik is an excellent miniseries that deals with drug trafficking in Europe. This is the series produced by the European PBS in which the Oscar-nominated film Traffic is based. If you loved Traffic, then the Traffik is a must see. <br /> <br /> In general I recommend this miniseries to anyone who is interested in seeing drugs from a social point of view. The script is exciting and unexpected, as it goes through the lives of drug traffickers, drug dealers, farmers, police and police. Unlike other films that sensationalize the drug issue, Traffik presents it as it is.
