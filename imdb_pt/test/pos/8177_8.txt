This movie is great (I watched the French version). There are many subplots (which generally harm the whole), but they unfold very well and compete with the main theme "discovering the true self." In fact, the whole movie (beyond its history) is the journey to the discovery of someone's self (or someone else's). Is the king really a "good pacifist monarch" trying to wage a "war to end all wars" or is he just a bloodthirsty thug? Is he a real king, anyway? Is the Queen's attendant just a voluptuous, career-headed, headless puppet, or a sharp-eyed, fearful person? Will the lady / concubine realize who the king really is? What is there between the king and the old chancellor? What is the secret that everyone knows, but will not tell? What is the real reason the killer left his "job"? Subplots (something I do not like very much) are well handled and keep an eye out until the end. Scenes are well crafted and CGI fits perfectly without overdoing it. The suspense is maintained properly and the actors are ready for the task. There are many smiles with brain problems, but this is how one should behave in the court of the king (as claimed by the lady / concubine). Realistic movie without moments of superheroes. This Chinese movie really shames the colossal Hollywood cardboard (Gladiator etc).
