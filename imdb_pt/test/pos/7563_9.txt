What a great movie !! It's a poignant story about four high school friends who grew up in the 1960s. Throughout the decade, friends are somewhat separated but need to see each other occasionally. There are many tragedies, but there are also many happy moments that make you laugh and smile. It is a tale of life full of heart, love and friendship. Definitely a must see for the theater fans.
