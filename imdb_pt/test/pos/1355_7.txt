There is something that one of the characters (the film director who pretends to be dead) says he can summarize the whole film: "In Italy are the dead that govern." Truth! This is a country with no future, in the hands of old and tired men. And Bellocchio's enigmatic portrait of the country, based on the seemingly senseless story of a director who has to film wedding parties to earn a living, manages to say a lot about what is not working here. But foreigners can miss the point, as it is not clearly expressed. I understand that Australian or Canadian people who watch this may get bored and wonder if there's any meaning - well, there's a meaning, but it's only clear to people who live here today, and keep their eyes wide open ... like Bellocchio . Certainly not one of his best films, and not as powerful as Buongiorno, notte, but worth seeing ... for the Italians who live in Italy.
