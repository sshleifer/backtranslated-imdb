SPOILERS AHEAD ------------------------- Honey is happening. From the opening credits to the final credits, this movie has direct laughter. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comic force. Cary Eewes takes the film most of the time, but the supporting cast fills up strong when the plot is drawn from Robin Hood. From the beginning, this movie proclaims that it is not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics, you would have that movie. What makes this special movie you say? Throughout the film you see blink and acuhu walk next to each other, becoming great friends as companions of Robin Hood. But Blinken is never told or fails to understand that he is black, until the crowd says "a black sheriff," Blinken repeats "He's black." This is a timeless scene. Simple one of the most important movies of our time.
