John Schelesinger's career as a film director was extraordinary. We watched this movie when it came out, but we wanted to see it again when it appeared on the cable recently. The film has a faded look, as is seen today, but still, it is interesting because of the intense performance of the two directors. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen, please do not read Chris and Daulton were two childhood friends who came from middle-class backgrounds. Chris went to a seminary to be a priest, but he gave up. Daulton has become a user and drug dealer for a short time. The two lives seem to run parallel as the two engage in an illegal activity that will prove their short-sightedness. In fact, this shows how young people misjudge their attempt to deceive the CIA and the Soviet Union. These two, in a way, were so naive in thinking they could pull something bigger, and the better equipped people could not even imagine they could be made. <br /> <br /> Chris's motivation is legitimate as he feels indignant. in discovering the underhanded role of the agency for which he works in dealing with other nations, in this case Australia, something he finds by pure coincidence. When it involves Daulton, we know that the whole thing is doomed because no one on drugs, as it is, will ever come to anything. In fact, Chris and Daulton had no concept of what they are trying to do or their consequences. Timothy Hutton was in this period of his career, an actor who was going to different places. He proved that he had talent in his work in other films, so it was a natural choice for Schlesinger to select him, a choice that is worth it. Sean Penn was also a young actor who showed an intensity, as if he had not seen it before. In fact, sometimes Mr. Penn reminded us of a young Robert Mitchum in training. The contribution of both actors to the film is incredible. One can not imagine who could have interpreted this pair, but they. "The Falcon and the Snowman," although not the same as other great films by John Schlesinger, is an interesting sight for us. far past.
