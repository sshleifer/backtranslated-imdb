Anyone who wants to learn more about skateboard development should find research material suitable for Dogtown and Z-Boys. This should not be confused with Lords of Dogtown, which lament Hollywood's attempt to profit from the success of Dogtown's original revival. Directed by Stacey Peralta, a former Z-Boys and also a professional skater behind the Bones Brigade of the 1980s, and co-written with photojournalist Craig Stecyk, this documentary traces how a group of surfers the kids from the bad Southern California streets (known as Dogtown) who formed the Z-Boys skateboarding team (actually there was a girl - Peggy Oki) revolutionized skateboarding. The film contains interviews with almost every Z-Boys (the whereabouts of Chris Cahill is unknown) with the most notable being the evil Tony Alva and youngest, Jay Adams, who has talent (along with Perlata) who seems to transcend the rest of the teams. . There are interviews with the founders of the team (and the Dogtown store), board designer Jeff Ho, Skip Engbloom and Craig Stecyk. There are also interviews from people like Tony Hawk (obviously), Ian McKaye (Fugazi) and Henry Rollins, who were young children in the 1970s, when Dogtown was making its influence on skateboarding (skateboarding was another context in earlier years as documentary explains). <br /> <br /> This really shows not only who was the Dogtown team and how they graduated, but because their style changed not only the tricks of skateboarding (pool skating became immensely popular, and gave way to but also facilitated the sport (though not for the extreme commercialism it is today) as more than just the fleeting fashion it had been previously, as these surfer kids who had exhausted waves early in the morning needed ways to spend your time and eventually get on the skateboard. The days of Russ Howell and Alan Gelfand lasted long as Dogtown, at least through the publicity of its skateboarding team, paved the way for the new generation of skaters. As Dogtown got all the attention, they were able to push the skating to the next step. <br /> <br /> It's a great documentary in the way it's set up, although Stacey Peralta always knew how to do it, even when producing the Bone Brigade mini-movies / skateboard demos like "Ban This" and "Search for Animal Chin. " Narrated by Sean Penn, the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, contains many fantastic archive footage, and lots of interviews to give you a genuine sense of who the Z-Boys were and how they made their mark on skateboarding.
