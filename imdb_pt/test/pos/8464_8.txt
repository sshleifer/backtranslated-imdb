I went to see this movie out of curiosity and to settle an argument. The film is now best known of the set of songs that Sergei Prokofiev extracted from his incidental music for the film, Troika's movement until appearing in pop arrangements. The overall sketch of the plot is well known from the notes of the manga in several recordings. An employee accidentally generates a nonexistent Lieutenant Kizhe on a list to be presented to the Tsar. The tsar cares for this person, and instead of telling him that it does not exist, the courtiers and officials keep the pretense that he is real. Kizhe is exiled to Siberia, remembered, promoted, married, promoted again, dies, given a state funeral, revealed as a defrauder and posthumously demoted to the ranks. <br /> <br /> I had heard conflicting stories about how the employee invented Kizhe, involving ink blotches and sneezes, but I heard that the movie was lost, so there was no way to find out what happened. So the film appeared at the Barbican in London as part of the Prokofiev festival. For the record, it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two words while writing an order and turns Kuzhe into Kizhe. As the Tsar is in a hurry to see the order, there is no time to correct the error. <br /> <br /> Having been waiting for a historical curiosity, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is very funny, and the audience, myself included, laughed continuously. Although most of it is filmed in a straight line, mainly defined in the palace, there are some scenes of "tricks" where several images appear on the screen. For example, the Tsar's army is represented by a small group, repeated across the screen. Four identical guards perform a perfect drill in perfect harmony. Two identical servants rub the floor. <br /> <br /> One small inconvenience was that it was very difficult to find out who everyone was. There were two women who might have been the tsar's daughters, or a daughter and a servant, or whatever. And very few people were named. But after all, a nice film and I'm surprised it's not seen more often.
