It's been almost 50 years since I've seen "Jennifer" for the first and only time. I did not know the name of this movie until I looked it up on this site, but I told a lot of people (especially my grandchildren) how the movies do not need to include graphic details to scare him and leave a strong impact. History cleverly presents concepts that, if true, leave Ida Lupino in a very dangerous situation. Every time Ms. Lupine discovers a new "fact", it draws the viewer to his confusion and fear. <br /> <br /> This movie has so much impact on me that almost 50 years later I still the clever one of the scariest. movies I've seen. However, this movie does not contain the blood and blood that became popular shortly after this movie was made. It's amazing the impact that a good story and great actors can cause.
