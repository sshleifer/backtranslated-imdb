During the brief period between the filming of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns and his Dirty Harry films, he and director Don Siegel teamed up to make that image uncommon. Eastwood plays a wounded Union Army during the Civil War, which is taken by a southern school for girls until it recovers from its wounds. It has been a while since the young women (most of whom appear to be a teenager) had a man on the scene, so they are reluctant to turn him over to the local rebel soldiers. The resulting situations are often humorous, shocking, erotic or even downright grotesque, as Eastwood slowly regains his strength and begins to think about the establishment. <br /> <br /> The basic plot almost sounds like the result of a porn movie. We have a male male suddenly surrounded by young nubile women. Most of them are sexually attracted to him. And he is more than willing to spread the love between them. The material never slips to the "tasteless" level, however. Eastwood, Siegel and filmmaker Bruce Surtees are such skilled filmmakers that the film always retains its dignity. <br /> <br /> John McBurney, of Eastwood, is like no other character he has ever played. McBurney is an amoral, conniving, lascivious charlatan. He knows that most women, even the young ones, want his body, and he allows more than one of them to have a shot at him. McBurney often uses flattery to soften women, and then uses his good looks to wrap them up. He's like a drunken player in a cocktail party, often beating out different women, even in the same scene! Eventually, your lusty ways cause you great agony and loss in a way you should see for yourself. This author would not dream of revealing the specific consequences of his actions, but there is little doubt that he is coming. <br /> <br /> Eastwood gives a great performance. He seems to be having fun with the role until things get ugly, so he turns bad and ugly. Geraldine Page is a treat like the steel B * tch that runs the school. We know she wants both McBurney and the other girls, but with her chess past shown to us in flashbacks, we find out she's not all she wants! Mae Mercer, as a slave belonging to the school, also gives a great performance. She obviously knows that McBurney is a skunk from the start, and she never lets her fake charm overturn her guard. This is a character you will want to know more after the movie is over. She seems to have a greater knowledge of the world than anyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> Beguiled did poorly in his theatrical version. No one was sure what to do with it, and part of their content no doubt raised a few eyebrows in 1971. For example, in an early scene, we see Eastwood romantically kissing a 12-year-old girl. Is he just trying to keep her quiet when the rebel soldiers approach, or is he really enjoying it? Probably both! A fantasy sequence, later, even shows Clint getting along not only with Page, but with his young assistant! Really some interesting happenings in this. It's a good thing Eastwood has become the star he made, or this may have been forgotten long ago. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 9 out of 10 stars. The Dog.
