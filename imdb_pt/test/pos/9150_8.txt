Fran√ßois Villon was a real-life poet and ladino who lived in Paris in the 15th century. However, most of what is portrayed in this historical film is, in fact, fiction - a play created in the early twentieth century. While in the film he met and became friends with Louis XI, he actually died at age 30 and was never involved in all the intrigues as he was in this movie. In fact, he wrote some lovely verses and was often on the wrong side of the law - not the combination of a patriot and Robin Hood-like character as he is in the movie. As long as you know the movie is almost 100% fictional, so it's worth watching it - just do not assume it's a good story lesson. <br /> <br /> In AMBITO ROGUE, Villon is touched with great abandon by John Barrymore. I was also very excited to see that his three friends were all interpreted by very familiar faces. Angelo Rossitto, who was the brave dwarf, played in tons of movies over the years and had a very long career. Slim Summerville was an actor known for adding a touch of comedy to the movies. Mack Swain is best known as the silent film in many of Chaplin's short films and played his partner in THE GOLD RUSH. All four men did a good job and had no complaints - even with Barrymore's overdone treatment, reminiscent of Douglas Fairbanks' performance. However, the performance I had had a serious problem was Conrad Veidt as King Louis XI. To call this "nothing subtle" would be a gross understatement. He played the part of a schoolboy who thought he should be the stereotype of Richard III - dodging and acting like a demonic caricature. While Veidt has been wonderful in many, many films (both in silence and in sound), but here he is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it is full of adventure and action - like a movie cover and sword sailing boats. The sets worked well for all of this, since they had been used the year before for THE HOCKEY OF NOTRE DAME. Both films were created around the same time period. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's one of the last big silent movies. There's a lot to like and the film is a lovely combination of romance, comedy and action. It's worth seeing, though losing a few points to Veidt's excess, as well as how the film plays fast and loose with the story. In fact, this movie was also made twice as if I were KING (1920 and 1938) and apparently these two films are closer to the original game. However, in total, six films were on Villon and count, more or less, variations on the same tale!
