This movie is "the" stupid comedy of the year, and possibly the best thing about Mike Judge since "Office Space". If you are a fan of Mike Judge, or like programs like Futurama, then you are doing serious disservice by skipping this limited, little-known version. Although the DVD offers very few "bonus features," this movie is certainly funny enough to make up for its "lack of value." <br /> <br /> This movie is about an army grunt called Joe Bowers. (played by Luke Wilson) as part of a secret Army experiment intended to preserve Army personnel in peacetime so they can be thawed in time of war to fight for our country. However, things take an interesting turn when the general in charge of the operation is arrested in a network of prostitution and the experiment is almost forgotten. Bowers and his assistant Rita (played by Maya Rudolph) are both awake in the year 2505, where, through the course of natural selection, America's population has become increasingly stupid. Now Joe and Rita have to find their way to a time machine to go back to the year 2005 with the help of Frito (played by Dax Shepard). <br /> <br /> What I really liked about this movie was that of Mike Judge. comic satire throughout US history over the past 50 years and how humankind progresses in the subsequent 500 years. This is further evidenced by the publicity in the film, which has become a landmark of American culture. With shows like South Park in the mainstream media, it's easy to see how conclusions can be drawn that, in the future, profanity has become a marketing tool. This is portrayed in the movie with humor, with subtle things like "Fudd-Ruckers" changing its name to "Butt-F ### ers", and a billboard displaying the ad "If you do not smoke Tarryltons ... F ## I also can not stop laughing at the role of Carls Jr. in this future, with his slogan "F ### you ... I'm eating", and its automated kiosks self-announcing their "Extra Big-A ## Tacos "(with more molecules)! This movie contained everything I go to the movies. Excellent, clever, witty comedy as well as a captivating storyline make this DVD one for the ages. If you are not a fan of Mike Judge, you did not care for "Beavis and Butthead", or you have no sense of humor, so this movie is probably not a good match for you, otherwise I would say this is probably the movie funniest thing to come out of 2506 ... I mean 2006.
