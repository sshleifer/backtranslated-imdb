Ettore Scola's masterful interpretation of this epic of the heart deserves a much wider audience. He is a worthy successor of the risorgimento classics, like Senso and Il Gattopardo, of Vischonti, and Vanina, Vanini, of Rosselini. The nineteenth century is indeed a fruitful source for Italian filmmakers. Period settings and pitfalls are beautifully done here, but the story is timeless and can occur in any period. What is so intriguing in this story is that the hero gets stuck in a claustrophobic situation in which he finds the object of desire vigorously pursued and he is completely powerless to break free from the alarming circumstances. Beautiful and inexperienced Giorgio (Giraudeau) is frustrated by his inability to visit his charming but naive married lover (Antonelli), and is the victim of the dangerous passion of Fosca (D'Obici), the ugly and sickly daughter of his stern. (Girotti) The resulting anguish and tragedy that followed this improbable pair are becoming understandable, regrettable, and immensely sympathetic to viewers. Bernard Giraudeau's stellar performance will captivate and leave a lasting impression. To not lose.
