When in 1982, "The Thing" hit theaters everywhere, it had a cold reception and very bad box office results, making it almost a failure in John Carpenter's career as director of horror; however, time proved that "The Thing" was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the movie's fault. Today, "The Thing" by John Carpenter has earned the appreciation it deserves and is regarded by many horror fans as a horror classic, and not without reason, as this new version of the story of John W. Campbell Jr. "Who Vai lá? (Previously adapted as "The Thing of Another World") is closer to the original tale and maintains a pessimistic feeling of fear and high doses of suspense in a masterfully elaborated study on paranoia. "The Thing" storyline begins in the winter of 1982 at a US research station located in remote Antarctic territory, as crew members note a Norwegian helicopter coming toward them.The two apparently insane pilots of the helicopter are attempting to kill a Husky dog ​​that enters the American base.After the Norwegians are killed accidentally, the Americans try to find out what made them insane.Soon they will find that the Husky dog ​​that the Norwegians were ca walk was not a normal dog, but a creature able to imitate all living creatures, and not only that, it has a tremendous hunger. <br /> <br /> Director John Carpenter gained a place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher "Halloween", where suspense and atmosphere were above blood and shock. "The Thing" can be seen as an evolution of this style, because even when Carpenter makes great use of Rob Bottin's special effects (which were labeled by critics as "repulsive" in his day), the film still focuses more on the atmosphere and thriller. rather than the violent (and very well done) blood displays. The feeling of loneliness as well as "bad karma" among crew members increases the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the Thing, even our main character, RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell), ending up in a situation where no one can be reliable. <br /> <br /> This plot element was more faithful to the concept of the source novel, and was blatantly ignored by the previous version (not quite a bad thing, just a big difference), making this version feel less like a remake and more like a new conception of the romance source. Bill Lancaster's script deals with the characters with brilliant mastery, giving us enough to distinguish them, but not much to fully trust them, making them an essential factor in the haunting sensation of the film of fear that continues to run through the film. The mystery and the suspense are at the maximum, as you can never say who is the Thing and who is normal, increasing the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results. <br /> <br /> The cast is very effective, and its performances as a whole so effective that you can almost feel the bad feelings between your characters as real. Carpenter's regular collaborator, Kurt Russell, like MacReady, carries the film, and through his eyes we witness the madness and horror that the research station becomes when situations get worse. Definitely one of his best performances. Wilford Brimley is also fantastic as Dr. Blair, a scientist who goes crazy after discovering the purposes of the Thing. "The Thing" is a film so beautifully crafted that its flaws tend to go unnoticed, though they do exist. . The most notorious is the very discreet and sometimes inappropriate punctuation of Ennio Morricone. It's not exactly bad, but it seems out of place in some scenes and is not one of the legendary composer's best works. Also, due to some flaws with special effects, some scenes were left out that actually fill in some small holes, though nothing of major importance or really annoying. When talking about John Carpenter's films, most people will almost immediately name "Halloween" as their favorite movie, but personally, I would go with "The Thing" as I consider the greatest achievement of Carpenter so far, and one of the most interesting and really scary horror films ever made. I'd say it's one of the best movies ever made. 10/10
