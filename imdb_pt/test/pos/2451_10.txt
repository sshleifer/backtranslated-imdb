I have to agree with the previous author's comments on the excellent performances and plot. Started watching this movie by accident ... (lazy on Sunday afternoon clicking on the channels to see if anything good was going on) ... and was hypnotized by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Wow!! Intensive! Congratulations to everyone (I always admired Martin Sheen), but was particularly impressed with Emilio! Excellent acting and directing job ... just superb! So why have I never heard of this movie before? I'll have to spread the word.
