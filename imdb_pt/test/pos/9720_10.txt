Each story has a lesson for young and old. But what else I have to say can ruin a future story. But I believe that what I have to say is for everyone; Only for one episode in particular: The Soldier and the Death. <br /> <br /> Ok ... of all the stories, the one that stands out for me is "The Soldier and the Death", because that was the point of my life. I realized that life was terminal. I'm not kidding. The airing was on my 8 1/2 anniversary ... and I'll always remember. I do not remember his title until tonight, but the synopsis is new. (May 15, 1988) It is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part of life. It is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact. I am living proof (now 28 years old) that children can accept this fact and from time to time remind adults ... <br /> <br /> I write this with tears in my eyes. Heath Ledger - a wonderful actor my age - died today. It reminded me of many lessons I've learned in my life. So I write this as a reminder to Young and Old ... no one is immune to everything that is reserved for us. <br /> <br /> I hate to say that death will happen, but this story was the first time I saw death was not a bad thing; but a part of Life, was literally in this story. I can not avoid. It was a moment of life change for me and always will be. <br /> <br /> And so ... <br /> <br /> I love you Jim Henson (and I still remember much of your work in life until the day you died, and your memorial Muppet Show) and thanks Brian Henson for keeping the Workshop alive !!! Honestly, I thank all of your co-workers, editors, and trainees. <br /> <br /> The stage is just a stage / And a show is just a show / But the imagination will create Magic / That Forever the world will know. Thank you !!! <br /> <br /> (And for everyone who doubts me ... Dance, Magic Dance)
