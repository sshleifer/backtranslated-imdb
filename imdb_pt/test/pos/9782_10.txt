When I learned that there was an Australian Broadcasting Corporation based on Changi's [WWII POW] camp life ... focusing on "comedy elements," I was deeply skeptical and a bit critical. /> <br /> My father served in World War II. Such was the barbarity of the Japanese, he was able to talk about the horrors in Labuan and surroundings (where he was parked) until very recently. Together with my father, I was fortunate to meet many great men (of character and spirit stronger than I will ever have), who had witnessed acts of indescribable barbarity at the hands of the Empire of Japan and never fully recovered. . The name 'Changi' is meant to conjure horrible images for the ages to come ... <br /> <br /> But, on seeing, I was very impressed with the cast, the characters and the complex lines of this wonderful series. . Now I consider 'Changi' as the highlight of my week, (remember, I've only seen three episodes so far ... I hope the remaining episodes follow the standards set by the top three). <br /> <Black humor works strangely well (though the flatulence jokes are a little overdone), and although much of the horror has been suppressed, the series comes close enough to convey the fearless spirit of survivors who were able to continue later. with their lives despite the inhibiting memories. <br /> <br /> The flashback format of this series will be difficult for some to follow, <br /> <br /> but I can not think of anything better way to do justice to men who have suffered deep hospitalizations and emotional ... when painfully repressed experiences are remembered, sometimes years after the horror. <br /> <br /> One of the darkest chapters of World War II, the twentieth century, and (I would say) the history of mankind, is being rebroadcast to a new one, and I hope it will convey the overwhelming adversity of the generation in time of war. <br /> <br /> Continuing 'Changi', I do not think I'll ever be able to hear the touching melody. 'on the road to Gundagai' in the same way again. Tune in ...
