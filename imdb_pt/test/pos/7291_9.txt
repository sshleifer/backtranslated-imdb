Okay, I'm 12, so this is where you watch the movie from a preteen perspective. I also commented on Magnolia and Bicentennial Man, both great movies, if you want to take a look. Okay, Here On Earth was a beautiful movie with stunning scenes and images, very pleasing to the eye. The writer (I do not know who he was, check out the IMDB) either worked hard or had a good appreciation for love, poetry and drama. I cried 4 times over this movie, once for over 30 minutes. It was very sad, very beautiful, very significant. It's a great movie for anyone, say, 11 years or older, other than a romantic comedy. Yes, it's romantic, it's comical, but (in my opinion) it's better than "She's All That" or "Whatever Takes." I never cry! It's a tender story. Go rent it and tape it :).
