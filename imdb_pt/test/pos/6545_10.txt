I remember watching this movie many years ago on VHS in a place of friends. At first I thought it would be a boring car movie. But to my great surprise, it turned out to be one of the best movies I remember watching for its time. <br /> <br /> It has a good story and, best of all, it has some amazing Australian cars and street races. I really loved the Fox car more than a Dodge Charger. The paint job that was done on this car was really exceptional in my opinion :)! <br /> <br /> There's also a two-door black blown 57 Chev that gets into the movie later. <br /> <br /> I actually got a copy of this movie on VHS last year at K-Mart here in Australia. I had plans to convert this movie to DVD because I believe it's a worthwhile movie. But to my surprise this weekend while I was browsing the DVD movie bin I came across this on DVD. So, of course I caught it while I could, since it was the only copy there. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you really want to see some classic street races with real muscle cars, including a great story without a discernment rice burner. So this movie is for you !!!! <br /> <br /> Here is some additional information taken from the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> He will win at any cost Fox is a young man who lives on the fast lane. He believes he is the fastest man on the road - but street races are illegal. If he does not accept his last challenge, he may lose his girl ... if he accepts, he may lose his life. Living dangerously, living fast, and winning at any cost is your obsession. They do not give up, they do not give up ... and they do not ask for help.
