This is the best direct DVD effort of Van Damme that I have ever seen. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who is trying to stop heroin smugglers from entering the United States. The action in this film is great and the fight scenes are classified with the best of Van Damme. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For more evidence, check out "Undisputed 2". Adkins is so good, in fact, that before watching "The Shepherd", I thought that Van Damme would not seem very convincing in defeating him onscreen. Van Damme has his own and although he is not as athletic as Adkins, he can still kick the best of them. All the fighting scenes in this movie are very well done and the battles with weapons are above average for this type of movie as well. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that the story is a bit underdeveloped. I think the motives of the character of Van Damme should have been presented earlier in the film, especially with regard to why it carries around a rabbit. The reason it does is pretty cool, but you will not find out until the end. There are a few other things that are never really explained, but this is a Van Damme movie, so you know where the priority is in making this kind of movie and it's not character development. Overall, this is a solid action movie that I highly recommend. Then run to the Damme border!
