I just do not see what's so bad about this movie. I loved this movie! I thought this movie was the best movie in the series. Although part 3 is the best of the series, I still gave this movie 10 out of 10 because it's great. I do not see what everyone else hates this movie. Who would not want to see just a little action? I wished Brad Brown would show up in this, because I could have done it a little better. Those who like a bit of drama because ... wait, I will not tell you, you'll just have to watch. This movie also contains some popular actors that are ... (I will not tell you why I hate it when people give spoilers, so I do not want to be one of those people). Well, I guess that's all I have to say about this movie.
