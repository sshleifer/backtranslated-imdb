This is definitely one of the best cult classics, and is a must-see for all psychotronic fans. Because? It has everything a great 1970s exploration film should have. Exaggerated dialogue, bad acting, enthusiasm, sex, sloppiness, political inaccuracy, violence and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. In other words, Dolemite is a must. <br /> <br /> Like many of these films, the plot makes little or no sense. What I figured out is that Dolemite, a cheater pimp, was framed for stealing skins and half a million dollars worth of narcotics. While he was making time, his arch-nemesis Willie Green (the same man who framed him) took over his nightclub. However, the sympathetic director (the only white character in the entire film who is not completely evil or incompetent) decides to free him to stop the evil Willie Green and his drug trafficking. Fortunately, he knows kung fu, as well as about 50 to 75% of the characters in this movie do. And even more fortunately, while he was locked up, Madame Queen Bee sent all her "hoes" to the kung fu school. With this kung fu army battling "hoes" (his words, not mine) on his side, he plans to regain Willie Green's nightclub. However, two racist white cops try to frame him again and send him back to prison. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, do not try to follow the plot. I've seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that seem to have no connections to anything else. Support characters come in and out of the movie. I'm still trying to figure out what was going on with Reverend Gibbs, the Mayor, and the Hamburger Pimp. Who cares, anyway? The scenes with these characters are all priceless. As for dialogue, it's horrible with even worse delivery. As Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, I begin to wonder if this movie should be a parody or a serious action movie. It seems he could not decide which one. Lines like "Yeah, I'm so bad, I kick my own ass twice a day" appeal for further investigation. Anyway, the movie is hilarious, and the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese factory. Another hilarious element is one of the most erotic uses of sex and nudity in movies. Actors you would never want to see bare naked (including the mayor and the queen bee). Not to mention the fact that the microphone boom seems to appear in all other scenes. <br /> <br /> Most of all, Moore shows incredible enthusiasm. He seems to be generally amused and is certainly charismatic. Their comedy raps proved to be a huge influence on gangsta rap, including Dr. Dre who experimented with it on their groundbreaking 1992 album "The Chronic." As technically inept as the film, it is culturally influential. Even more important is a good time. The biggest crime an exploit movie can commit is being annoying, and that, for all its flaws, is quick and fun. In other words, if you enjoy this kind of movie, you'll love "Dolemite". If you do not dig, you are a "non-commercial, born insecure, chin-faced". (7/10)
