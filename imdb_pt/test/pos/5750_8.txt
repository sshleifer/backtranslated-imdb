I'm a Christian and I thought this movie was really good! :) Although the acting was not the caliber of the Oscar, I thought it was good, considering that the cast had limited acting experience at the time this movie was made. <br /> <br /> The message of the Gospel and the transforming power of Jesus Christ was beautifully explained. The message the director was trying to get through (which is important, not how the characters dressed!) It definitely passed. The theme of having the main characters involved in illegal take-off races was also a good idea (cool muscle cars, btw). I think this movie will definitely reach many young people. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie, it's a great testimonial tool! :)
