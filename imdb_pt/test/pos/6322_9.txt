A variation of the same plot line was used in an episode of Simon & Simon (Thin Air) that originally aired in December 1982. <br /> <br /> The victim's gender has been changed, the surviving spouse is a of Rick's "old flames". It is also interesting to note that Gerald McRaney played a role in this Rockford archive episode. <br /> <br /> Both episodes were based on a Howard Browne story - as noted in the list of 'writing credits'. <br /> <br /> Anthony James plays one of his classic villain roles. <br /> <br /> The continuation of the concept between Rockford Files and Magnum PI for Simon & Simon is quite interesting.
