I remember seeing this movie when I was very young and I was quite disturbed by it. I found the plot very distressing and I still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in their soup before he could taste a spoonful. They also tied him up and scraped his inner parts. All this because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have the feeling that even though he was good at games, he would have been intimidated because it is hard to decide what makes someone popular. To me, he is the kind of person who would always be chosen because that is how children operate. Popular kids are popular because they are, in some ways, "cool." Popularity is a hard thing to define. So even in the end, when he is successful in his career, it makes no difference and he is still feeling tormented. I found the end quite distressing as there was no resolution.
