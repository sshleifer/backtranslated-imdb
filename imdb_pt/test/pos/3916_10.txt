OK, so Paris Hilton is a drug (typical Barbie Malibu), but the rest of the actors are just great! I watched the movie last night and it kept me completely out of the whole movie. Chad Michael Murray It's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just an actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister of nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Affirmative. I think it's so different from filming these days, most of them to go with psychopaths, possessions, ghosts, but here you have a wax theme! I totally have vines for the wax models in the house, although they looked so real. I still do not have the story with the twins at the moment, I'm just waiting to pick up the DVD and watch it all over again. Thumbs up for such a good movie! 11/10. All those people who do not like it, please do not bother criticizing my opinion, since most people think it's cool to do it. I also think that the Paris scene when she takes off her underwear is totally inconvenient. Why not just get a dog fucking a cat ... it's more fun than that. When the scene of Paris's death came, I thought she was poor, for she was still running, though a knife would simply climb up. Hmm interesting. <br /> <br /> TILL ALL THE WAY!
