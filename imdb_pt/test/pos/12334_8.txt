"One Dark Night" is a milestone in the low-budget horror genre of the 1980s. Filled with puns, clothes and retro scenarios, "ODN" transports the viewer to a simpler time when horror movies were just that .. Horror! <br /> <br /> Nothing so intense that you can not understand what's going on, the film tells a dark fable of what happens when you mess with the dead. Well represented by his screams and queens and a great job of directing Tom McLoughlin, who has fun with time and makes you believe what he is presenting. There is no "who did it?" and certainly no major turnaround in the end. It's direct and in its horror face from start to finish, with a lot of 80's mood played to add seasoning. I give it "8", simply because some of the special effects fall short of the end of the movie, but at least there is no CGI ... Perfect movie for new fans for the horror genre of the 1980s, or for those who want to relive a fun happy classic horror night.
