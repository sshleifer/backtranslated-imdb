Six teenagers attend an old abandoned school where 27 years ago a horrible massacre happened for a night of fun and games. Instead, the children are in conflict with the cruel crazed security guard (excellently interpreted with an extremely chilling threat by the Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy) who committed the unpleasant deaths. Director Carlos Gil reports the intriguing story at a fast pace and does a compelling job of creating a compelling, scary and mysterious atmosphere. The witty script by Tino Blanco and Mercedes Holgueras offers a clever and inspired mix of slasher and supernatural elements that keep the viewer guessing to the end. The slippery cinematography of Fernando Arribas makes specialized use of light and shadow. David San Jose's humor score also does the trick. The attractive and attractive young cast contributes lively and engaging presentations, especially with Carlos Fuentes as Ramon, Olivia Molina as Maria in panic, Zoe Berriatua as the crazy Jordi, and Carmen Morales as Sandra. The murder pieces are as bloody and brutal as they should be. Terrible surprise blow in a dark end too. A solid and satisfying shock.
