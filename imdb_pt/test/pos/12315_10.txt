In the press this is one of the greatest tales ever written, brought brilliantly and poetically to the screen by this father and son team, working together, unfortunately, for the first and last time. It is fitting that John Huston ends his career on a high note, bringing the work of one of his favorite authors to the screen, in what is easily the best screen adaptation of Joyce. Huston has made a career of adapting great works of literature to the cinema, usually with great success. It is sad, and somewhat intriguing, that Tony Huston has begun and finished his film career by adapting what would be his father's final project and receiving a well-deserved Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> I once had the privilege of sitting in the company of great screenwriter and playwright Horton Foote, who cited this film as one of his favorites in recent years (at the time it was still a recent release). As a rather prolific screenwriter (and a brilliant screen adapter of his own work, as well as great authors like Faulkner, Steinbeck and Harper Lee), he was obviously impressed by Tony Huston's first effort, and possibly equally intrigued by his lack of output since then. If anyone has insights to share about it, I would be interested to hear more.
