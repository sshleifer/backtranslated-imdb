A great movie about triumphing over all those who say otherwise, who try to kill their spirit, reaching the impossible. I'm not going to talk about it, other than to say that I enjoyed reflecting on this movie when I'm facing something particularly scary, and I realize that if Lindberg could do what he did, I certainly can face the task before me. . Definitely a "feel good" movie. <br /> <br /> See. You will not be disappointed.
