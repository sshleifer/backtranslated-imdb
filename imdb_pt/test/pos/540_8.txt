I was lying on the bed, flipping through the channels ... and kid I have channels ... 500 of them. With over 70 movie channels, I probably watch a movie on the cable once or twice a month ... The DVD provoked me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm going through and I come to this movie and because I see Natilie Portman, I became interested. 110 minutes later, I'm still interested. How could this be? When I first saw the previews of this movie in the movies, I remember mocking him. I never thought I'd watch ... Never mind like that. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a book, and you can tell. The movie is very episodic, and it's not as if the movie had a great plot, it's just a drug to you. Maybe it's their performances that do it. I'm sure it must have been. <br /> <br /> This movie was good for no reason ... <br /> <br /> Peter's Movie Rating (out of 10): 7
