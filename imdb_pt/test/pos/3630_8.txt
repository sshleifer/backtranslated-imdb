The Duke is a very silly movie - a dog becoming a duke! But it's a really fun movie. There are some of those jokes that many children's films have, but (fortunately!) There are no bodily function jokes, as so many animal movies feel compelled to have! Mostly, it's just dogs being dogs and people being. . . well, people. The "good ones" are friendly and attractive. The "bandits" are ridiculous and, of course, the pun on many jokes. But there's something worthy about this movie, because even if it's silly, it's not for every cheap laugh like "Home Alone" and others. <br /> <br /> Crocket, Simon and Copper do a great job playing Black and Tan Coonhound "Hubert," who becomes the duke after his beloved owner, a true duke, dies. Most of the time, they only act like dogs, without 'talking', or human emotions and attitudes. However, they make stereotyped poodles, and Hubert falls in love with her, just because she is a poodle. Let's go! These are dogs - they have a different view of beauty !!! <br /> <br /> In general, charming, fun and enjoyable.
