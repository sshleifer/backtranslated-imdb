This was a great movie! I saw this in Karlovy Vary IFF in the Czech Republic, and won a prize there. This is the first film I've ever seen from Jan (the director), and I was impressed. It's a great story about love and family. The film has a great balance of comedy, romance, drama and thriller, all in one. I will not give up on the plot, but this is a well-made movie, and I would watch it again if I had the chance! Cinematography / editing is great, the film simply flows and the characters are warm, and they are the kind that can relate. I hope you can enjoy this movie like I did. If anyone knows where I can find this in the United States, or if they plan to release it on DVD soon, please let me know !!
