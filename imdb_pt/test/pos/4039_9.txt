I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not usually one for fairy tales or make believe in stories, but this movie caught my eye. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time on the UK's Hallmark channel ... which usually shows some cheesy movies ... but then Snow Queen came along ... and I was loving it! I really admire Bridget Fonda in this movie ... she plays the snow queen in a brilliant and glamorous way. <br /> <br /> I will not explain what the story is like other people have done, so there is not I do not want to repeat. <br /> <br /> I would just suggest that if you want to watch a fun fairy tale journey ... get this movie ... but if you want to buy it and live in the UK, you can have difficulty. I bought from new South Korea (English edition, of course).
