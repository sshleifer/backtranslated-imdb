This movie has it all. Great actors, good dialogue, drama, comedy and excellent writing and directing by Paul Thomas Anderson. I've seen this movie several times and I enjoy it more and more. It does not age, it is consistently fun and stimulating. Easily Burt Reynolds best role, and he does a great job. John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle also give excellent comedic performances. There is not a weak element in this movie.
