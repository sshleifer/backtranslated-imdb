Is it along the comedy line of mistakes, the transfer of misplaced affection from one to another, blooms and passes in situations of cat and mouse ?? Flares of passion, sparks of fire scattered and erased? Guessing maybe she loves it, does she love it or do they love it ?? Circle of emotions, evolving, releasing itself hiding but not hiding - wanting to let it know, wanting it to know, let them know ?? Good cast despite the seemingly confused mix of emotions from different parties involved. <br /> <br /> It's a charming, relaxed, casual, free and easy, and quite realistic - not Hollywood glamorous like "Notting Hill" but many human feelings, fragility and vulnerability. Yes, everything revolves around a love letter accidentally (lost). Kate Capshaw as the owner of the town's bookstore, with a variety of characters portrayed by Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Tom Everett Scott, Gloria Stuart, Alice Drummond and Geraldine McEwan as the seemingly unaffected Mrs. Scattergoods. Romance is in the air, love lurks everywhere. You start to appreciate the talented Kate Capshaw. ("The Alarmist" is another quirky little movie that's fun to watch: Capshaw has a wonderful chemistry with David Arquette, and Arquette with Stanley Tucci). "Notting Hill" is satisfying in its history revolving around the brilliant pair of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, and the wonderful support of her (London) circle of friends. "Love Letters" is delightful in her quirky little town (Loblolly), and her story involves the spin-off effects of Kate Capshaw on her friends and neighbors. Both, perhaps fantasies, somehow, the latter felt more attainable if this happened to you. And if you appreciate words or poetic lines, it may be the movie for you.
