Nurse Charlotte Beale (the lovely Rosie Holotik) arrived at Dr. Stephens' clinic for the madmen ready for a new job. What she does not expect is to find another alleged doctor in her position after Stephens is attacked by the maniacal "judge" Oliver W Cameron (in a joke, whenever he confronts a situation out of his control, he retreats). to repeat his name). This doctor is Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick) who is not sure if Beale is suitable for her establishment. After a long discussion about the position (which is a rather strange scene as the two debate over the fact that Beale gets a letter from Stephens getting a job at the clinic with Masters often reminding her that he is no longer in charge ) Masters agrees to let her work in the nursing position but the good doctor may not be who she looks like .. <br /> <br /> The assortment of freaks includes Sam (Bill McGee) a simple man-child who went the last victim of Stephens lobotomy, Jennifer (Harryette Warren) a woman who needs an adult to comfort her while she pats on the Masters heel as a puppy, Danny (Jessie Kirby), an annoyance that often tries to steal the fake baby (Camilla Carr), Allyson (Betty Chandler) a sexy nymphet who just wants to be loved and jumps into any man she sees, and "Sergeant" Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) his typical soldier case that did not escape the madness of war. The film depicts Masters's unorthodox methods of administering the clinic, allowing patients to roam Free with the doors to all rooms without locks challenging ... and, not to mention, the fact that Oliver is still allowed to walk around, though he just cut Dr. Stephens with an ax. And what exactly happened to Dr. Stephens? Ah ha .. <br /> <br /> The Tacky 70's drive-in junk is a lot of fun if you enjoy a movie brand. I'm attracted to bizarre movies about mental rejections because of their unpredictable nature ... you never know what the heck can happen, especially in this case where they are allowed to roam frequently without supervision. Some consider the low budget a liability, but in the case of this movie, I think the experience increases. With cheap photography and weak production values ​​(being shot for peanuts in a house destroyed in a horrible place), it seems more frightening and I felt like a voyeur looking at insanity through a camera lens on the outside looking out inside.
