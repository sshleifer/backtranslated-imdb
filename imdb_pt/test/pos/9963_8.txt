Venice in 1596. The Jews are separated from the good Christians.Bassanio, a poor but young Venetian loves the beautiful Portia, who is a rich heiress. Then he approaches his friend, a merchant named Antonio for three thousand ducats to travel to Belmont and propose Portia. All the ships and goods of Antonio are occupied at sea, so he turns to Shylock, the moneylender of the Jewish faith. Shock does not like Antonio because he spit in the face. He offers Antonio a loan of three months no interest, but if he will not pay the money at that time, he will own a pound of his flesh. In addition, the daughter of Shylock Jessica Elopes with Christian Lorenzo. The Merchant of Venice is based on the play by William Shakespeare which is believed to have written between 1596 and 1598. I read the play last summer and now I saw the film, made in 2004 by Michael Radford. I liked the play, and I totally disagree with the accusations that it is anti-Semitic. Jewish character does not appear as an inhuman monster, even th He is ready to cut a piece of Antonio's flesh. There is a lot of depth in his character, everything comes out in his speech, where he asks, "If you sting, will not we bleed?" and so on. There is a lot more human in Shylock's character than in one of Antonio who spits in the good Jew. Pacino's unbeatable as Shylock. He gives such a strong performance. Jeremy Irons is also fantastic as Antonio.Lynn Collins is more beautiful and brilliant in the role of Portia. Zuleikha Robinson does a great job as Jessica, and Charlie Cox as Lorenzo is also very good. Kris Marshall plays Gratiano, and he does a good job. In the role of Nerissa, we see Heather Goldenhersh. Mackenzie Crook plays Launcelot Gobbo. As in Shakespeare plays normally, this also contains the most brilliant dialogue. The film paints a fantastic portrait of the time. It deals with some major problems, in a Shakespearean way.
