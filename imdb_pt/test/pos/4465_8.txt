Sporting a title seemingly more appropriate for a short Looney Tunes than a horrible giallo, "Do not Torture a Duckling" (1972) is still a thriller of Grade A of the master of terror Lucio Fulci. In this, someone has strangled the pre-teen boys in a rural village in southern Italy and, typical of these gialli, there are many suspects. There's Barbara Bouchet (Patrizia), looking more scrumptiolicious than you've ever seen, a rich girl hiding after a drug scandal; Florinda Bolkan (Martiara), the local epileptic voodoo woman; her boyfriend practicing witchcraft; Giuseppe, the local idiot; the sweet-faced priest; his stern mother; and so on. The film features some extraordinarily violent scenes, including a chain of whipping from one of the main characters in a graveyard (one of the most realistic and bloody sequences I've ever seen) and a beautiful duchess when the killer is finally revealed. The explosions of violence in the film outweigh the fact that there are no real scares or suspense to speak of. Still, this giallo fascinates, with its unusual rural scenery, disconcerting children's murders, eccentric characters and an odd score by Riz Ortolani. The film was beautifully photographed in what I presume is Monte Sant'Angelo, near the Adriatic, in southern Italy (at least, the city police force is grateful for the final credits). And while the subtitling has made this excellent DVD work even better (the American slang does not convince in this Italian rural setting), Anchor Bay should be thankful for another job well done. Oh ... this title makes perfect sense too!
