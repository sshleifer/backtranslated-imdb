"Belief in the Great Other as an invisible power structure that exists in the Real is the most succinct definition of paranoia." ??? Slavoj Zizek This is a review of "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman," two films by director John Schlesinger. Although Hitchcock and Lang brought "conspiracy thriller" to Hollywood, the genre flourished only in the late 1960s and 1970s, with films such as "The Parallax View," "Z," "Marathon Man "" Capricorn One, "" The Manchurian Candidate, "" Three Days of the Condor, "and" All the Men of the President. " This was the era of Vietnam and Watergate, the public deeply distrustful of all political leaders. <br /> <br /> The genre remained quiet in the 1980s and early 1990s, until the TV series "X Files" came to life. With slogans like "The Truth Is Out There" and "Trust Nobody," the series has proposed a world of vast conspiracies and government plans, the common man at the mercy of all manner of ridiculously elaborate schemes. The only way out of the maze? "Fight the future!" as the slogan of the final season of the proclaimed series. It was our duty to scour the labyrinth of information, discovering some elusive "truth" that secured our own freedom. <br /> <br /> This trend has ended with the internet boom, the conspiracy thrillers now giving way to "conspiracy documentaries." The internet generation has animated independent documentaries such as "Loose Change" and "Zeitgeist," while in the mainstream Michael Moore has stimulated his audience with such things as "Fahrenheit 9/11". All of these documentaries believed in a "secret order," a cabal of politicians and wealthy businessmen who conspired to reduce human rights and enslave the world. They struggle to create a mono-myth, linking various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single comprehensive narrative that explains the purpose and point and future of it all. <br /> <br /> This need to "streamline the narratives", make them more "efficient", is reflected in the scientific community, which struggles to create a "Theory of Great Unification" and, finally, a "Theory of Everything, "blending everything from Quantum Mechanics to Special Relativity into a single giant formula. <br /> So, finally, the "conspiracy thriller" is rooted in man's desire to have control. The modern subject is one who exhibits a direct cynicism towards official institutions, but at the same time believes in the existence of conspiracies (an invisible Other pulling the ropes). This seemingly contradictory coupling of cynicism and belief is strictly related to the end of the Great Other. His disappearance leads us to build an Other from the Other (conspiracy) to escape the unbearable freedom that his loss causes. On the other hand, there is no need to take the Great Other seriously if we believe in Another from the Other. So we are allowed to show cynicism and belief in equal measures. Man thus seeks to assert control over a rebellious universe, to create a sort of paternal nanny (be it God, a mathematical formula, a conspiracy theory, an explanation for violence / conspiracies / murders / wars etc.) that provides meaning and symbolic order. The Great Other provides assurances to the believer. It is a "lifestyle choice," similar to religion, in which your place in the world depends on pure irrationality. The problem with most "conspiracy thrillers," from the innocent days of Hitchcock's "Topaz" to modern dishes like "The Da Vinci Code," is twice. First, they are not incorrect in suggesting that something is "wrong" between "elites" or "better people," but they are incorrect in individualizing and personalizing processes that are social, collective, and systemic, an approach that implies that it is only a matter of personal morality and not of social structures. Secondly, and more importantly, these "conspiracies" ignore the fact that the Great Others simply do not exist. There is no symbolic order pulling the strings. Some modern "constellation thrillers" ("Eyes Wide Shut", "Existenz" etc) recognize this, with their webs of lies, accidents, truths and half truths, nothing adding, nothing making sense, the real and hyperreal, truth and desire, all blurred, with no identifiable zero mark, but these are mostly films of intellectual directors. <br /> <br /> In comparison to these modern "conspiracy thriller", "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman" are positively archaic. "Marathon Man" is about a graduate student (Dustin Hoffman) who engages in the affairs of his older brother (Roy Scheider), which unfortunately has to do with evil spies, guns, double agents, diamonds and dentists. Scheider is smooth, Hoffman is excellent and Schlesinger shows us some cool visuals (the Eiffel Tower's revelation is impressive), but what's more interesting about the film is how its various plot lines do not intersect until the 1 hour. . Even so, it takes another half hour for things to start to make sense. Unfortunately, the film ends with a cliché clash between the villain and the good guy, all perfectly solved and explained. <br /> <br /> "The Falcon and the Snowman" is a little more ambitious. Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton play two friends who sell government secrets to the Soviet Union. Hutton works in a civil defense contractor and smuggles information from his office into the hands of Penn, a drug dealer who has no qualms about selling to the KGB. Penn does this strictly for the money, while Hutton is disillusioned with the US government (particularly his attempt to depose the leader of Australia) and thus sells the secrets strictly because he hates how his country conducts crimes and espionage games. In other words, the film is about a conspiracy undertaken as a response to conspiracies. <br /> <br /> "Marathon Man"? 7.9 / 10 <br /> <br /> "The Falcon and the Snowman" ?? 8/10 <br /> <br /> In addition to a strangely slapstick car crash and its cliché ending, "Marathon Man" is an effective thriller with several clean scenes. "The Hawk and the Snowman" is even better, Penn turning into a memorable performance.
