I saw it back in '99 and I remember loving it. Even today I can remember parts of the film in my head, like the tone inclined. Unfortunately from 99 - now I could never remember the name of this until I was looking through the filmography of a friend of my uncles and I came across this (he played Clive Kennard). Immediately after reading the description, I knew what it was. After catching up, I was shocked to discover that not only was it not released on video or DVD, but it is still to be repeated. This is a great shame, I'm begging you at least for ITV to repeat this great TV movie. Nick Hancock showed in this film that he could do more than just perform a show with his character Mike Tonker. This is a movie that most football fans would love and even those who are not very interested in the sport would be able to appreciate the comic value of it. Yes, this is a brief review, but there is not much to say, plus this is an understated movie, deserves to be duplicated or released on video / DVD for ITV, me and other fans of this movie beg you. PLEASE, CONSIDER ONE OF THOSE!
