Freely, from one scene to another, from one story to another, as we walk, from a shadowy path to an open place, like the wind in the leaves, from one tree to another, how many different sounds? Just like when they travel, people meet and tell their stories and then leave forever, who knows? And just as in going through those places full of lost expectations of another time, the human 'thickness' of the world takes your breath away. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my friends, not all of them liked it, maybe they were very accustomed to scenario-based and ready-made stories, I do not know. So this movie is for the fools who love looking at the sun shining in the sea, walking unhurriedly in the hills or through the small villages, listening to the growing grass, which tells the stories of those below, six feet below, in the hot summer wind .
