"Labyrinth of Passion" - with the possible exception of "Matador" - is the best Almodovar film. It exhibits its unique personality at its best and less censored, before it begins to become more popular. Almodovar is practically the only modern director who can approach the wonderful mark of madness of Preston Sturges. It is useless to try to explain about what the film is, the real point is Almodovar's willingness and ability to take his situations to the limits of sanity and sometimes plausibility and taste as well.
