But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And this is just the beginning. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if any description of the movie and the plot will motivate you to watch this. Suffice it to say that there is something for virtually everyone: death, singing, shiny suit, cell phones, a small person (a pretty woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not medieval), a boombox and a beast. Oh, it's a psycho. And Barry Manilow. <br /> <br /> You will have to trust me when you say that 50% of you out there will hate this movie because of the lack of the absurd gene in your DNA composition. It's not your fault; is hereditary. The other 50% of you will probably want to change channels after 20 minutes, but you have to keep watching. <br /> <br /> Even so, in the end you may wonder why you watched ... but keep this absurd thing in mind. It should grow on you. It's a test.
