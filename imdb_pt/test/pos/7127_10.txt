This movie is so wonderful that captures the life of the game. I laughed so hard while watching this. The movie is about a group of players who have difficulty with a campaign that the dungeon master created. The film changes from the real world and the gaming world as they play the campaign, show them in the gaming world as their character, and then return to the real world when they are not playing. The campaign is the basis for a module that the dungeon master, Lodge, is writing. The problem is that Lodge can not finish its module because the characters can not finish the campaign. They are more to kill and plunder than to play roles. Lodge wants them to pitch into the campaign something they have never done before. They decide to bring some extra help so they bring one, wait for her, girl to play. Lodge also makes a npc, a non-player character, a paladin, who can not testify or do wrong, to play. The movie is how they do all this and more, I do not want to ruin anything of the film, so I will not say anything else. This movie may not be a big budget movie, the acting may not be worthy of the Oscar, but if you're into games or in dungeons and dragons, then definitely watch it. They had a lot of fun making this movie and it shows that I'm not going to hit it for any movie problem like continuity or anything that was a low budget movie that is just fun. There are some comedy slap stick that I like and some damn good writing in my opinion. So, if you want a fun movie, try.
