I love Ernest going to jail. It's one of my top 3 favorite films by Ernest. The others being Ernest Scared Stupid and Ernest goes to camp. In this film, Ernest (Jim Varney) works as a janitor of a bank, but he wants to be an employee of the bank. Soon he is assigned to the jury position, but soon gets in trouble when the evil criminal Felix Nash (Varney too) knocks him down and swaps places with him! Soon Ernest is in jail and is forced to act like Nash or else Nash is going to kill Charlotte Ernest's love interest. When they take Ernest to the electric chair thinking that he is Nash, he gets so electrocuted that he ends up leaving and saves Charlotte from the evil Nash! Filled with hilarious scenes and comic books Ernest Goes to Jail is a movie that will make you laugh so much! Still does for me! Jim Varney was such a fantastic actor! He did a good job playing both good and bad face! Varney was like his Toy Story Co star Tom Hanks. No matter what role they played their roles were memorabilia and this is one of the things that Varney will remember forever! REST IN PEACE. Jim Varney 1949-2000. Thanks for bringing Ernest and other fantastic characters to life! 10 out of 10!
