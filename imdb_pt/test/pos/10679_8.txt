This lesser-known movie, starring Roy Thinnes (From TV's Invaders), is actually what I consider to be a lost jewel. It was made at a time when the story was more important than the special effects (although the effect is reasonably good for its time). A scientist theorizes that there is another world in Earth orbit directly behind the sun. As the sun always blocks this from us, we can never see it from Earth. Roy Thinnes is selected to go on a mission to reach this world. I do not want to tell the rest of the plot because this will give the rest of the movie. Let's just say there are some real surprises. <br /> <br /> The film is British and has that good British flavor of acting in TV series like The Avengers.
