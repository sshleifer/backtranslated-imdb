I first encountered Arthur Penn's "Four Friends" late night on HBO. I had never heard of it, I expected very little, but I watched because I was interested in seeing what a creation of a Penn team and screenwriter Steve Tesich would be. For the next two hours, I was mesmerized, watching this incredible talent pool and the story they wove. A semi-autobiographical tale of a young immigrant to America growing up amidst the turbulence of the 1960s, "Four Friends" follows the story of Danilo, an Eastern European immigrant (the brilliant Craig Wasson) since his arrival in the United States . decade that changed the American landscape. Accompanying Danilo on his journey are his friends Georgia (the radiant Jodi Thelan, in a role that, unfortunately, she never had the opportunity to match), Tom (Jim Metzler) and David (Michael Huddleston). "Four Friends" covers a lot of territory to try to explain it here, but if you have not seen this movie, I ask you to find a copy (just released on DVD) and watch. You will not be disappointed. Is Tesich's script marvelously poignant? sometimes funny, sometimes incredibly sad, but always fascinating and honest. Penn drives with a certain hand and an obvious love for the period and the people whose lives we are following. The cast is uniformly excellent. This movie should have made a big star out of Wasson, who is truly one of the country's most wasted talents. Jodi Thelan, which is not his brainless Hollywood single, warms up the screen in a performance that makes the audience fall in love with his character as easily as the characters in the movie. The subtle performances of Metzler and Huddleston can be easily ignored in the shadow of their co-stars, but they are excellent and help anchor the film. Also magnificent are Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence as Danilo's parents, as well as Reed Birney and Lois Smith. I have not been without a copy of "Four Friends" since the day after I first saw her on HBO for many years. It has been and continues to be one of my favorite movies of all time for more than 20 years. I can not recommend it enough and feel, if you give it a chance, you will feel the same way.
