The first few minutes of this movie do not do it justice! For me, it's not funny until they embark on the submarine and these hilarious characters begin to freeze. I was born and raised in Norfolk Virginia and met my share of "different" sailors - even married one! Most of my favorite movies are funny, are not topics, do not depend on sex or violence and are fun every time I see them. Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still funny even after I know the color dialog. Kelsey Grammar with his "God I LOVE this job!" It was sincere, genuine and kind. Rob Schneider is hysterical when the team turns on him for being annoying. I'm still amazed at the size of that fishing boat next to a submarine! I can see why people living this life would realize the uh-oh, but it's not a documentary, after all it's a comedy and I love it!
