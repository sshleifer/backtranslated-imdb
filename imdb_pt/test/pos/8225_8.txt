Ronald Coleman had been a screen star for several years when the talkies came in, and what a boost was for his career. His English accent at Oxford is so fascinating that I could hear him reciting the farmer's almanac and not getting bored. <br /> <br /> Coleman plays Willie Hale, a 30-year-old playboy from a wealthy family who spends time becoming womanish and playing. However, he is a nice rascal - not only sympathetic from the public's point of view, but also from family and friends. He went bankrupt due to his constant gambling and sells his possessions in a foreign location to settle his debts and provide passage back to England. When he arrives there, he is at first received by a father who insists that he is going to expel him - he had him with Willie and his vague ways. However, five minutes alone in a room with Willie and his charm, and Willie is not only forgiven by his father, the father gave him a hundred pounds to boot. Willie then goes on a day of recreation with her sister and her friend, Dorothy Hope (Loretta Young). Dorothy must be engaged to Grand Duke Paul that very night, mainly because the father wants royalty in the family and there is no one more special in his life. That changes after his day with Willie, and soon there is a scandal brewing when Dorothy refuses to continue with the marriage as planned. <br /> <br /> Ronald Coleman is always pleased to watch in these spoken films that he did to Sam Goldwyn where he is playing the confident adventurer or cad or both. He behaves like Errol Flynn, but he is unable to show Flynn's physical agility due to a crippling wound he received during World War One. However, what he does not have in physical agility is always agility. Loretta Young, only 17 years old when this photo was made, shows the beginning of her sweet trademark that could explode in a fireball when the occasion calls. Myrna Loy plays Willie's girl from the past - Mary Crayle - a dancer. Here Myrna is still playing a role similar to the exotic vamp parts that she got stuck so often at Warner Brothers when she was a contractor from 1926 until just before this movie was made in 1930. <br /> <br /> It's practically a light and cheerful romantic comedy from beginning to end. If you're in the mood for the kind of escapist entertainment that lit the hearts of the public during the Great Depression, this little movie fits the bill.
