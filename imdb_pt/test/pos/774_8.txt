I loved this movie, what a joke. Rupert and Julie are great together, with Rupert being almost a poker face against Julie's animation, which worked well. Laura did a good job as a dominating mother. Julie, of course, is wonderful as usual. While this movie will keep him laughing most of the time, he also has a poignant side when he uncovers the secrets of the main characters' lives. Interesting that he was entitled Driving Lessons, as this may lead him to believe that this is the main feature of the film, which is not certain, as it certainly could be seen as "Ben", finally be in the driver's seat in his own life. Like most things that are funny in life, there is always the sad side and there are some thrilling moments in this movie. Very nice movie and worth watching.
