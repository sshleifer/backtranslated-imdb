While driving on a road to the wedding of his beloved Betty-Ann, Adam (Eric Jungmann) is surprised by his former Harley schoolmate (Justin Urich) in the backseat of his car. Adam broke with the inconvenient and dumb Harley because of Betty-Ann. Throughout his journey, Harley makes fun of some rednecks in a bar and then his car is chased by a giant monster truck on the road. After a few incidents, they give a ride to hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks) and earlier the trio is terrified by a creepy monster driving the monster truck. <br /> <br /> Despite having one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a horror movie, the annoying Harley, "Monster Man" is a surprisingly good horror comedy. The story is a collection of clich√©s, beginning with "Joy Ride" or "Duel"; then it turns into one of the innumerable assaults of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"; There is an amazing turnaround, ending with a hook for a sequel. There are hilarious scenes, Aimee Brooks is extremely sexy and this movie really entertains. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Monster Man"
