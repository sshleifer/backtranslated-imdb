The subgenre "old dark house," which dominated the early talkies, rarely fails to disappoint when we review today's oldies. Here is one that provides so many suspicious characters that you have to wonder how they will be able to tie all the loose ends in the 6-cylinder runtime. <br /> <br /> Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who decided to take revenge on Colonel Walters (Berton Churchill), who sent one of his ranks to jail. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile, the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs. This does not match Thelma's fiancee (Irene Purcell), of club member Brand Osborne (Ben Lyon, who is at the end of the mega-budgeted HELL'S ANGELS (1930)), who wants him to leave the club and stop risking his own life. Brand promises to resign after saving Colonel's life. Everyone goes to the newly purchased Walters mansion on Long Island to await the killer. <br /> <br /> The Colonel may be the new owner of Melody Manor, but it's an old dark house complete with eccentric neighbors (like Raymond Hatton). local hermit) and maybe even a ghost. Zasu Pitts is the housekeeper Nora, who hopes to see a spirit in every corner. Throw a police officer (James Gleason) who is sure that Brand is a criminal and that we have a picture full of action and surprises. <br /> <br /> You will notice immediately that the writer was lost come with a lot of dialogue because many characters repeat the same lines over and over again. Yoganda (C. Henry Gordon), a Hindu mystic (whose films of the time were born) says that "evil is on the way." many times and I have lost count of how many times Mrs. Pitts says "Something always happens to someone!". There are many suspects and two characters (Gleason as the stupid cop idiot and Roscoe Karns as friend of Lyon) that serve as relief from the comedy. The house itself is aptly scary (actually, I think the same set was used in THE PHANTOM (1931)), with many secret passages and violin music coming out of empty rooms, but somehow you never have a sense of danger . Maybe it's because no one in the movie, and I mean no one!, Is totally what it seems to be. Everything ends well at the end; but going into more detail would ruin everything for you. Carefully watch Robert Frazer (from WHITE ZOMBIE) and Frank Reicher (better remembered as Captain Engelhorn from KING KONG) to appear among the suspects. CIRCLE CROOKED is a fun movie. Some aspects of the plot are predictable, and again, several others are not. I suspect you'll have fun.
