I mean it too, I mean, do not get me wrong, if you do not have a tendency for this kind of Z-type creature feature (why would you be watching is my first thought?) So it's a rating of about 3 to 4 out of 10 tops, but for me it's a special kind of nonsense that takes me back to a good time in my childhood. You know the type, the memories that never leave you. Longing for all this, with youthful astonishment, Doug McClure and Peter Cushing tunnel under the cloak to fight a series of subhuman creatures and species. It's personal! now we are all grown up, we can more seriously admire the wonder of Caroline Munro and her panting cleavage. No wonder my older brother liked to take me to the movies to see this one. <br /> <br /> Yes, the effects are bad, men in suits, ropes dripping with parrot monsters and blowing up rubber frogs like little things amuse us a lot. And yes, Cushing and a surprisingly plump McClure act as if they've been really hypnotized by the mean Meyhas in the "core" of our movie. But it does not matter, zany and clumsy and flooded in glorious colors, At The Earth's Core is a setback for a special pre-ILM era when kids like me on the block queue to see this cheesy nonsense. 8/10
