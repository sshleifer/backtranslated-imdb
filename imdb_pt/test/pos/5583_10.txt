I also remember seeing this movie as a youngster in a small local theater that featured foreign films every week. It was the daring adventure of everything that has remained in my memory ever since. Especially impressionable was the scene with Noel Purcell as the old sailor, Paddy, who drank too much, saw or heard apparitions and died. of fear in a cave. I always followed Noel's career, even decades later, because I saw him at the time. There is also the young Cyril Cusack as the leering boatman, James, with drawings on the lovely Jean Simmons, shown as Emmeline grown up. <br /> <br /> I would love to have a video of that haunted movie and update my memory of it. Where do I send my order?
