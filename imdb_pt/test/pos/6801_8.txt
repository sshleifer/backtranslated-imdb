"National Velvet" tells the story of Velvet Brown, an English girl with dreams of entering her beloved horse in competition at the prestigious Grand National horse race. The film follows her as she trains her horse with the help of an ex-jockey and the support of her parents. While "National Velvet" is a family movie, this fact should not deter anyone who typically sees these films scornfully. The film is, in fact, a movie that will appeal to the whole family, and not just the young attentive to the attention. He managed to get five Oscar nominations, hardly a sign of a loss of audience. Anne Revere, on the part of Velvet's mother, actually won an Oscar for her performance. She was really excellent at the role, but it's Elizabeth Taylor, 12, who steals the show. She is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years. Also aboard are Oscar-winning Donald Crisp as Velvet's father Mickey Rooney as former jockey Mi Taylor and Angela Lansbury (in one of his first film roles) as Velvet's older sister. <br /> <br /> The brilliant Technicolor makes for a compelling viewing experience, while the edition secured the second of the two Oscars of the film. In addition, the film was nominated for directing (by Clarence Brown), art direction and cinematography. Also worth mentioning is Oscar-nominated tenor Herbert Stothart's score, although it was not indicated. <br /> <br /> All in all, "National Velvet" is a wonderful family movie that deserves a higher rating. I realize that the prospect of watching a movie about a girl and her horse will not exactly thrill some people, but it's worth risking that chance.
