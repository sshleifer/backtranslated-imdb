(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school and nymphomaniac hooker who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to satisfy her needs. Ronnie must report to her National Guard unit and leave Rae alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the city slut with a powerful need to relate to a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) meets Rae and takes her home. LÃ¡zaro gives medical care to Rae, and believes that he can also save her from herself. Rae is like a dog in heat, so Lazarus puts a 40-pound chain around her and her radiator to stop her from going looking for men. Lazarus has problems of his own because his wife has just left him for another man. Lazarus turns to his blues music to ease his pain. <br /> <br /> (My Commentary) The movie has a deep meaning when you overcome sex and violence. The film has a different feel. The story is crude and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there. The 40-pound chain is a good metaphor and symbolic of a chastity belt. You give no love to anyone, but you keep true love. The chain could also be a parallel for a wife who is chained to the kitchen, but Rae did not cook. Rae just wanted to have sex all the time, while a wife can not. I think Craig Brewer (writer and director) made an extraordinary film, and Samuel L. Jackson sings a half blues song. The story is emotionally charged, addressing the issues of race, religion, music, and sex into one. (Paramount Classics, runtime 1:56, Rated R) (8/10)
