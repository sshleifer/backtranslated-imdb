Although I do not like cricket and I've seen this movie 13 years ago, I still think it's one of the best films about ripening ... I remember the day I came home from my school and sat down for my lunch, I saw the opening titles of that movie and then ... I was so immersed in it that I felt it was there, it really affected me personally. I still remember how I felt when I first saw it, I felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine, going through the same teenage experience we were having in those days. What I really liked about this movie is the main theme of a "shy" boy fantasizing about "kissing" his dream girl, no offense, but if this were an American movie, you would certainly see - at one point, climax - "shy" boy "make love" with your girl, and I really can not understand these contradictory concepts so far ... I have a simple request, if anyone knows how to get this movie on a DVD by mail, please , let me know why I need a shot of memories .. Thanks
