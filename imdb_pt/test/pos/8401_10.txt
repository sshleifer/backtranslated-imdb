My God, this was a fantastic movie. Every time we watch, it takes us to another place of "WOW". Rhett & Scarlett were brilliantly played by Joanne & Timothy. They did a fantastic job reviewing the roles of our two favorite heroes. All! It's a must see ..... Do not deprive yourself of this movie. If you loved Gone With The Wind, you'll love this miniseries. Go Rhett !!! Go Scarllett !!!
