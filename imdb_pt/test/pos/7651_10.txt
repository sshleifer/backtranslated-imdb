We stumbled across this show one Sunday morning at 6:30 am while browsing through all the cable channels and this turned out to be better to show! It is absolutely lovely. We need programs like this for kids (and adults, since I'm certainly far beyond my childhood years.) As one of the other comments pointed out, this program benefits from the simplicity of the characters and the stories. The puppets are fantastically cute, the scenery is colorful and although they are made of cardboard, foam, ink and pure imagination, they remind us of our own childhoods, when we could spend the day at our own grandmother's house, exploring the world around us . For those who have never been lucky enough to have a grandmother as cool as Nana, this show is for you, you will make up for lost time! This show is a real inspiration and full of wit and humor and fun for kids and adults alike. In other words, do not neglect this show, just because you are more than three years old! Spend half an hour with Mona, Nana, Mr. Wooka and Russell, they will be friends you are eager to see!
