Thank God not all the Dutch are so relentless. I think Jason is being judged this way by most people, simply because he has a famous father. Maybe it's not as good as some of these actors, but it's definitely not as bad as suggested. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie a few years ago, and I really loved it. I met Jason from other movies and, of course, Robin from Sherwood. But I must say that I really enjoyed your performance in this film. Was very good! <br /> <br /> During the movie, I really forgot that he was the son of. Sean .. who? <br /> <br /> And if you're a Shakespeare lover, I can recommend this movie. I'm sure you'll like it!
