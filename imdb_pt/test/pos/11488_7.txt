"Committed" has everything to do with Graham as an irrepressible optimist who goes in search of the husband who runs away in search of itself, which leads to a kind of comic and optimistic odyssey involving a lot of characters and parallel problems. A small, fun and unpredictable film, what "Committed" lacks in history, pays off in good nature and subtle moral and quality. If you like this little girl movie, which has received critics a little above the average critics and the public, you may want to check out the success of Lisa Krueger, Indie "Manny & Lo" (1996).
