I saw this movie in 1954 in a double account with "Valley of the Kings". These films have helped to inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. Seen today, "The Egyptian" suffers from flat dialogues and a few touches of gauche, but it's a glorious movie to see - the kind of thing that Hollywood, unfortunately, just does not do anymore - and it has a great story ... not just the usual boyish face or revenge is mine. Too bad the 20th will not reprint restored prints to be seen on the big screen.
