That may actually be the best film of 1999. No, I'm not joking. This documentary directed by Chris Smith captures the spirit of artistic compulsion. Smith does the cleverest thing any documentary filmmaker should do: he becomes invisible and refuses to judge his subject. <br /> <br /> As the viewer watches Mark and his efforts, no matter how funkly aggressive they may be, end their films. He refuses to compromise and suffers repeatedly as a result. But let's not forget, remember that Speilberg, Scorsese, and others began with the same humility. <br /> <br /> And what a great subject he chooses. Mark, his family and friends are all fascinating characters, far more than any character created in the fictional filmmaking products of last year. This film swings in the coin between comedy, tragedy, moving sympathy, and inspires any viewer with a will to create, despite the talent issues, to get out of their asses and do something. <br /> <br /> The film is about independent artists and their passions. It is also about families, no matter how co-dependent and dysfunctional they may be and how unique and beautiful this organ really is. Mark proves in the film to be totally devoted not only to his dreams but also to his family - and they to him. <br /> <br /> Why this film was not nominated for the documentary of the year is beyond me and criminal (ie assuming I was eligible last year). This film should be sought and valued.
