I can not believe this is not a big hit. Maybe people in 1968, thinking of the Monkees as a pop band sill by the Beatles, refused to see him. This cynicism has probably covered the view ever since. Do not make that mistake. _Head_ is an incredible movie that the most open people will appreciate. It's very funny and very clever (and very trippy).
