This is one of those movies that improve with each viewing. I watched it three times and actually registered for IMDb because I wanted to comment on it. The "food" movies have been made before, some of them are really good - like, for example, a certain Japanese comedy that Asian cinema aficionados will know anyway. But this really is in its own league. At its core is a Protestant Christian parable symbolizing the ideal of goodness, but far from being dogmatic, it also addresses "good" in each of us, regardless of our religious beliefs or their lack. There is a euphemism and refinement in Babette's party, but this makes the message of the film stronger, not weakened. If you can not attend the extraordinary physical banquet offered by Babette, you will still be welcome to this soul feast. Highly recommended!!
