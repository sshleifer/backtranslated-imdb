This movie caught me by surprise. For years I have avoided many of Harold Lloyd's (as well as Keaton's) sound images because they have a generally well-deserved reputation for being lousy compared to dumb films because the basic formula was lost. However, when I saw this movie I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I really enjoyed it, ... once I accepted it, it really was not a "Harold Lloyd" movie (though it starred). This is because although it's nothing like the style of his previous films, it's highly original and Lloyd is not bad playing a totally different kind of character. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the formula of the old movies is almost completely absent here. Lloyd does not do the old stunt family work, the novel is quite different from his early screen novels, and the plot is simply weird! Instead of the usual roles, he is the son of a Chinese missionary who returns to America for the first time since he was a small boy. Because of this, although he looks like an American (except for the white suit and the explorer's helmet), he thinks and acts a lot like someone who is Chinese. In many ways, he is very naive about America and is like an innocent among the wolves. Early on, he meets a man who turns out to be a local party boss. This boss ALWAYS produces a losing candidate for the race for mayor - because he is bought and paid for by the corrupt mayor to produce a "symbolic" candidate who HAS NO ADVANTAGE to win. Well, the old old man that they traditionally run into the office just died and he decides to lead the naive Lloyd - he does not have a prayer to win! Well, the unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins !!! That and Lloyd's decision to clean the city upset the old political machine and they do not stop for nothing to destroy the honest Lloyd. Exactly when it seems that Lloyd goes to jail on a charge of forged corruption, he creates a scheme that is 100% impossible and very illegal to get signed confessions from the bad guys. However, despite this, it's incredibly funny and a great ending. So, my advice is in the end, just suspend disbelief and enjoy. <br /> <br /> An important note: This movie is definitely not politically correct. The word "Chink" is used repeatedly. I found it offensive, but considering the times, I ignored it as you should too. If, however, you are someone who CAN NOT and likes to be angry, I suggest you never watch movies in any way - as you are bound to be offended over and over again.
