Just watched then. It's very unbelievably incredible. The fights are fantastic and the magic is really cool! It's totally like a video game in parts, with some incredible side-by-side fighting. <br /> <br /> This film is for fans: "For those who loved this world once before and spent time with their friends, they come together again and dedicate their time ..." In addition to this sinister opening, history was not too difficult to follow, and I've never played a Final Fantasy game. I think it pays to be familiar with RPG games in general; Knowledge of the genre helps you to understand a little better. I think if you pay attention and accept what the movie throws at you, it's very easy to understand. There is a lot that is not explicitly explained, and if you require it to be, then you will probably be confused and angry. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie is like being put in the middle of a big saga. and have to join as much of the puzzle as possible. I like this approach; you get involved in the mystery and confusion that all the characters are going through. But like I said, just accept. If a strange red lion thing speaks, it pops up and starts kicking its ass and picking up names, and the other characters say it's an old friend, take it and move on; you do not need a biopic flashback, or a tell-all sit-me-down. You are an observer here, of something beyond your experience and understanding. <br /> <br /> So fantastic graphics and animations, great dubbing performance, stylized video game music, involving story and characters, and maybe some of the coolest fights you'll see right away. It's worth seeing, and while it's for the fans, it's perfectly accessible to people like me who have never played the games.
