Well ... it's time! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that is his best movie in recent years. The plot is not very inventive, but the whole subject of border patrol is interesting and the former Marines as drug smugglers are cool. But what makes this movie incredible is the fact that Van Damme is back in the martial arts again. His most recent films were more performance-oriented, but in "The Shepard," JCVD ​​is back to leave the bad guys and seems to be in great shape. There are some impressive fight scenes and Van Damme shows that he can still take the famous 360 foot kick. As a low-budget action movie, it has good sets and great acrobatics. Van Damme says some funny lines and shows that he is improving as an actor. I'm glad he's back to dealing with some Van Damage ... I was disappointed by the lack of fighting in his recent movies. Scott Adkins is great in his role and Van Damme and he have a 1 on 1 showdown in the end. Overall, it is one of Van Damme's best movies and will keep you entertained. A must rent for JCVD ​​fans. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like "Bloodsport" or "Kickboxer." Nok Su Kow!
