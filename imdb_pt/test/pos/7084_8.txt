One True Thing proves that it's the characters who make a movie. Streep will certainly receive an Oscar nomination for his role. One beautiful drama, One True Thing is a great example of making movies in the late 1990s - there are still people out there who care about making and watching movies other than the big blockbusters with million dollar special effects. It's not the best movie or anything ... do not be silly. But the amount of emotion that was conveyed by the actors and the writer hit me like a shock wave. I cried twice in this movie, which says a lot for a 24 year old man.
