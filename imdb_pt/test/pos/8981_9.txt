This does not happen very often, but occasionally a man can make a difference - a big difference. <br /> <br /> George Crile's best seller in 2003, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, is a fascinating and revealing account of the most unlikely "difference maker" imaginable. A relatively obscure Congressman from the Second District of Texas, "Good Time Charlie" was better known for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation. Playful and licentious (even for a politician), Charlie Wilson served his constituency well, since Lufkin's good friends only wanted two things, their weapons and be left alone. It's Easy Street filled with its bunch of well-known beauties, appropriately, like Charlie's Angels. When asked why his entire office staff was composed of handsome young helpers, his answer is a classic: "You can teach them how to type, but you can not teach them how to grow breasts." There is no discussion there. But even the most arrogant rapsper has a conscience hidden somewhere, and to Charlie Wilson the unimaginable atrocities committed in Afghanistan have led him to muster all his political knowledge to finance the total, humiliating defeat of the Russian military and possibly even help accelerate the end of the Cold War as a result. Or fat chance, eh? Under the skilful direction of Mike Nichols and a clever script by Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a shimmering, sophisticated satire that chronicles the machinations of three colorful characters that make up "Charlie's Team." The "Team" on the screen is composed of three wonderful actors with four (4) Oscars and nine (9) nominations between them. Charlie is beautifully played by Tom Hanks in a solid, understated way that is among his best work in years. He is aided, aided and supported by Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite played by Julia Roberts. Hey, why else has the bikini scene more than letting the world know that? In all respects, Roberts looks good and maintains himself, but the script never gives us a clue as to why Kabul and the country are so important to his character. Maybe the two Afghan dogs, usually by his side, know - but we, as a public, never know. As for the third member of the "Team", Philip Seymour Hoffman steals all the scenes in which he appears as Gust Aurakotos, a clever disgruntled CIA who knows the score - both in the Agency's boardroom. and Wilson's room. <br /> <br /> For the Mujahideen to succeed, the most important help the US can offer is the ability to take down the feared MI-21 helicopters that rule the skies. That takes money, lots of money, and finally "Charlie's team" secretly coerced congressmen into funding the $ 1 billion advance in weapons to arm the Afghan rebels. This includes state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. Unpleasant and unpleasant things. <br /> <br /> That such illicit activity of billions of dollars can happen and happens behind the doors of Congress is really alarming. Every American should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly scary aspect of the business political scene as never seen outside the walls of our own government. Oh mother, I wish it were not so ... <br /> <br /> Although the initial result for "Team Charlie" was an absolute success, the unpredictable and unpredictable end result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the Taliban and others. Since funding was entirely "covered up", the new generation in this part of the world has no idea that the fall of Soviet oppression and the end of Russian barbarism were the direct result of American intervention. Yes, once the Russkies left, so has our help - zip to schools, zip to infrastructure, zip in maintaining meaningful relationships with the Afghan people. As a result, the overall consequence is an absolute disaster - it's like the precursor to "Mission Accomplished." <br /> <br /> As Nichol's film points so incisively: "The ball you set in motion can keep bouncing even after you've lost interest in it." Mike Krzyzewski knows this, Eva Longoria Parker knows this , the little Lateesha in Lafayette knows this, but the typical American politician does not know. So we go from good to bad guys because we could not let the world know we were the good guys. Talk about a Catch-22 (another Mike Nichols movie). <br /> <br /> Maybe Charlie Wilson said better: "We did the final game." <br /> <br /> Again.
