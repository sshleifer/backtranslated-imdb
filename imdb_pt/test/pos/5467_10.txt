I saw this movie when it aired on Lifetime in 2004. I've never seen it since, but I've been thinking about it often. It made such a big impression on me that I've been looking for it lately. I finally found it and realized it was made just for television. The film is fabulous - full of good writing and acting. William Petersen is perfect, as always. This movie left me speechless and in tears. It is a wonderful story of faith, love, and compassion. Does anyone know how I can get a copy of this movie to my house? Is this possible with television movies? I would really love to see it again. This is a must-have among my collection !!
