I have to rate this movie in a 10. I'm sorry, but I think it's classic comedy. so if you're rating for other Madonna movies ... well, what? You want to tell me it was not her best movie? Mira Sorvino did not win an Oscar for almost the same performance ten years later? Please, this movie deserves far more credit than it receives. Also, I like to think of it as an A + sociological study of the 80's lifestyles. Remember when you could steal from Sam Goody and Cartier the same day? Remember when women proudly used their thick eyebrows? so it was not "Last Emperor", it was still good. there are certain movies that I would be willing to watch every day. three, actually, that liven up my day and make me smile. if you like "Who's That Girl?" so I also recommend "Party Girl" and "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion".
