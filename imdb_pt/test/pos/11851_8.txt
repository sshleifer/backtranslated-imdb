Well, the movie ended up much better than I expected. It's not boring and it's not unoriginal. Not really a silly romantic comedy. The situations in which the characters stand are very unusual, of course, we are still talking about a movie, but the main characters are really plausible. Donald is of course an exaggeration, but he's just a pawn in the movie, a means to prove something. The ending is not one of those ridiculously happy crap, always the same, you can see in the movies of the genre. I really liked it and I'm hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies. It's worth watching. In addition, it is better directed than other films, the plot always stands out, the characters themselves stand up. And they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them as a jet god given artifact, yada, yada. At the end of it all you really see yourself going through all this, the movie makes you feel something, you can even learn a thing or two. It is not the usual idiocy of producing hope, damping the fabric. It's a good movie, not a consolation prize for hurt women around the world.
