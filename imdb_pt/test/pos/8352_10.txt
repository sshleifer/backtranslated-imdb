This movie is great! Angel is beautiful and Scamp is lovely! Her screams get scared, and the funniest parts are when: Scamp gets caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing "Ive Never Have This Feeling Before." I totally recommend this movie, which will be released in a special edition on June 20th. The cover has a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid. <br /> <br /> I can not explain this movie more than romantic, charming, hilarious and adorable. The junkyard scenes are funny, all the junkyard dogs have something special. Very funny I laughed, the kids will love it. Buy it when it comes out, it has new features!
