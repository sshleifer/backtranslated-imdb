It is a great achievement that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers can be simultaneously insightful about gay and bisexual relationships, and their struggles! <br /> <br /> "Pool Days" is about the ineptitude of adolescence and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger one. A story about experience and vulnerability! "A Friend Of Dorothy" portrays a common dilemma that many gays and bisexuals experience at some point in their lives: the intense attraction to someone who is heterosexual. Analyzed with sensitivity, this story really made me excited! "The Disco Years" shows another version of a winless situation: engaging with someone who is not just confused about their sexual orientation, but is also terrified of being exposed as anything but straight A very powerful story for those of us who suffered betrayal at the hands of a sexually confused and frightened person! <br /> <br /> Although these three stories appeal to anyone who has a bit of empathy toward others, they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay, bisexual, or who seek. Each story is uplifting in a unique way!
