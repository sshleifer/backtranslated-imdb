Well, someone who likes to travel the road at 120 km / h, eat McDonalds and drive the air conditioning 24 hours and watch Fox News without stopping, I found this documentary interesting. One thing I picked up, when they talk about North America, I assume this documentary was Fabrique Au Canadie. For Canadian bashing, I'll leave that to Bill O'Reilly. <br /> <br /> The aftermath of oil depletion will affect everyone, especially those living in large countries in Australia, Canada and the United States. I'm sure Green Peace is not getting more gas, no more SUVs, not realizing that people living in sub-zero temperatures could starve. <br /> <br /> As someone who has studied economics, I know that we are living in a world of finite resources. I'm going to give the documentary to try to present a balanced view on the depletion of oil. However, I am studying a degree in journalism, this documentary is full of loaded messages - Republicans as warmongers. What the Democrats did not send troops to Vietnam? <br /> <br /> If you plan to present a documentary on economics and resources, it is best to leave the political uproar to one side because that could potentially cause a member of the potential audience to close. Focus on the issue of finite resources. At the end of the day, it is better to open the minds of the mainstream, as it is not good to preach to the tiny chorus. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy watching documentaries like Fahrenheit 911 and End of Suburbia not because of their political bias because they remind us that the world is not so safe. Of course I like to shop, and junk food consumption as if there were no tomorrow, but if the world will end tomorrow I would rather die rich and consume the living beep of it. <br /> <br /> For potential documentaries, simply give the facts of the people and let the viewers decide for themselves. If you are trying to muster your political opinions as a balanced documentary, people will smell a mouse a mile away.
