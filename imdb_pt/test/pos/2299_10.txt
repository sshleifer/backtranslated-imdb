After spending most of my youth watching these films, I find this very easy to follow, both in the unedited versions and in the cut versions, (though the story has a lot more to hold together in the unedited version. of Ninja Scroll, this movie hit a much more serious note and I think that's where it hit me. The animation while grainy is very original, and I love the way the artists that year emphasized the shadows to show different emotions. I think the story is perfect. The beginning of The movie really hits hard and as the movie progresses, you get the feeling that you are going on this adventure with the characters. As you meet, become allies and discover your greatest strength, a lot of heart was put into it.
