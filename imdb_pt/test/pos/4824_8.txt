I saw part of that movie on the Sci-Fi Channel, but I missed the end. I bought the DVD to see the whole movie, and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> A young mother and her two daughters move to a house in a backwoods area that they inherited from her husband, who died of an illness. It is very degraded, but the three women do their best. The teenage daughter (Scout Taylor-Compton) is alerted by a local boy about the zombies that go out at night. She ignores him, but since he has a cute friend, she joins his group. Meanwhile, the youngest daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) makes a friend of a zombie girl of her own age named Mary. It turns out that Mary and several other children died in a mine in 1913 while working as child labor. Now that they are zombies, they attack and kill anyone who is not a relative of blood. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by J.S. Cardone, whose previous films include The Slayer (1981) and Shadowzone (1990), two films that I did not like at all. That's why I was surprised that I really liked this movie. The film is deliberately stimulated, which I liked. This lets you get to know the main characters, most of which are enjoyable. Children's zombies have been used at least since George Romero's 1968 classic, Night Of The Living Dead. Still, I found the infant zombies who use tools in this movie interesting. It seems Cardone has finally found the script and the cast right. Only the stereotypical scenes of teenagers smoking, drinking, and making a parked car were boring to me. <br /> <br /> Taylor-Compton also appears in the remake of Halloween. Moretz appeared in The Amityville Horror (2005) and the horror film Room 6 (2006).
