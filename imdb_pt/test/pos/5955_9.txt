That's how I'll sum it up! There were others who said: Naked Gun meets James Bond. I think mine is more accurate, but I'm not neutral at this point ...; o) <br /> <br /> This movie is a kind of explosion of the past. He remembers the old movies (50's and 60's) and not just because he plays in that period of time (1955, to be exact, with the exception of Flashback), but it's the mood in which the film is made and it shows on screen! The main actor here (which is how I was told very popular in his homeland, France), is perfect in his role here. He is the spy with the number 117 attached to it. There's a character who sums it up in the movie, asking a question, whether it's good or not ... you'll see when watching the movie! <br /> <br /> Very funny, in fact, this is and if you like your spies mixed with comedy with the old school style, but not taking yourself or anything else seriously, than you need to watch it! : O)
