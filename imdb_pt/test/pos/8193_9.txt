The Emperor and the Assassin (with English subtitles) at 161 minutes is long, but time is filled with a story that barely fits him. The golden palace scenes and the dusty yellow panoramas of Chinese landscapes show a real story of the unifying king of China, around 300 BC. An intricate plot with an infinity of twists and turns is played with excellent cast portraits. King Qin's simple desire for a unified empire for his common people is fulfilled, but not without treachery, plot and counter-conspiracy, but bodies. Many bodies. This epic early Chinese story is a great way for Westerners to glimpse little-known Asian history. The legacies of Emperor Qin include the thousands of life-size terra cotta figures that are still being excavated today. As a historical person, this film makes it clear that Emperor Qin should be considered along with George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar, to name a few of the world's greatest conquerors / statesmen. I recommend seeing the Emperor and the Killer, especially on the big screen.
