A touching documentary that puts a human face in the tragedy of September 11, showing how a small community united to honor two lost school friends that day. The film interweaves the lives of Chris and Tom through interviews with family and friends and snippets of old photos. Through their reminiscences, we glimpse two tragically interrupted lives. The film also documents how, through a series of coincidences, an inspiring memorial garden has emerged through the efforts of many people, known and unknown to the two victims. Through laughter and tears (and sweat), we see the power of hope, honor, and love. This film evokes many different emotions, but the final feeling is of admiration of the human spirit, intimidated by the tragedy.
