If this movie had been made in the 50's or 60's, critics and fans would have praised the film. I even liked the movie from beginning to end. It's not a timeless piece and has not aged well over the years, but it's nice to watch it anyway. What about Mrs. Ritchie in the movie? Not the best on the planet - but it increases the comedies and comedies of the film, and shows Madonna's sense of comic timing (often underestimated). Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a former convict who was framed for a crime she did not commit. Griffin Dunne plays the unfortunate future boyfriend / puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events takes place, thus creating the plot. (And there's * one, folks!) Give the movie a try. You may be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is.
