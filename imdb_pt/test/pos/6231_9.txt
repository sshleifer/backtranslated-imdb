I really liked that one. I know, it's rampant with what are now clich√© plot lines, and a lot of overacting, but it was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> In our quest for horror cheese from the 70s and 80s, we come across many Moves that are so bad they are good. We also have some that are so good that they are bad, and so we have some that are so bad that they are bad. This is definitely so bad that it's good. <br /> <br /> Some traveling teenagers come across an "oasis" in the middle of nowhere, a forgotten slice of America on the road, and decide to "take a look". They cross each line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay for it. They pay dearly. <br /> <br /> I would not normally give a movie like this 9, but girls of this type are the type we missed in the '70s: ditzy, half-naked, and FIT. These are not the anorexic expansions of today's horrible horror; they look great in shorts. <br /> I give 9 out of 10, children.
