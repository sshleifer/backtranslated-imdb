Impeccably directed, written, performed and filmed, this quiet and unpretentious Danish film is an example of cinema at its best, and if there is a person who can watch the BABETTE PARTY without being played on a very fundamental level, they are a person who I do It does not matter to know. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple. In the 1800s, two elderly single ladies (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) reside in remote Jutland, where they sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities and personal happiness in order to continue the religious ministry of their long-dead father to the small flock that he served. . One of the young women admirers sends them a Frenchwoman, Babette (St√©phane Audran), whose husband and son were killed in France and fled their homeland to avoid the same fate. Although they do not really need their services, the sisters employ her as a maid and cook - and as the years go by, her cunning and relentless efforts in her favor allow the old congregation to remain united and the sisters live more comfortably of what they had. imagined; in fact, the whole village admires and depends on it. <br /> <br /> One day, however, Babette receives a letter: she won the lottery and is now, by village standards, a wealthy woman. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France, the sisters give their wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation. The meal and the night it is served is in fact a night to remember - but not for reasons that might be expected, for the Babette feast proves to be food for body and soul, and it is ultimately her gift of love for the women who took her and the villagers who were so kind to her. <br /> <br /> The film is extraordinary in every respect, meticulously detailed, but not overwhelming in its presentation of them. As the film progresses, we begin to love the characters in their simple devotion to God and their human weaknesses too, and the scenes in which Babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful, beautiful and incredibly memorable. There have been several films that used food as a metaphor for love, but none comes close to the art and simple beauty of the FEAST OF BABETTE, which reminds us of all the good things about mankind and which tastes food for both body and soul. the soul. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
