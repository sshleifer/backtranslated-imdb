"Babette's Feast" and "The Horse's Mouth" are the two most insightful and accurate films about what it's like to be a real artist. The key lines in "Babette's Feast" are not, as some commentators here have said, "an artist is never poor," but two lines come before and after him: "I could make them happy when I gave my best ... Around the world it sounds a long cry from the artist's heart: give me the chance to do my best. " <br /> <br /> I spent nine years producing experimental multimedia musical theater in San Francisco, raising money for productions involving dozens of singers, actors, designers, etc., and the artists I supported stretched every cent in their productions. effort to do your best. They were just like Babette: they were desperate to get every dollar they needed to do their best job. The art of Babette is good French cuisine, and for her to perform her art at her best cost of 10,000 francs. When, after years of political exile in France, isolated with two loving spinsters on a dark Scandinavian coast, she suddenly receives a fortune of 10,000 francs, she does what every true artist would do: she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance make her much better, and she does it. She spends all the money to be able to do her best work as an artist. The turnaround in the film is that we do not know that she is an artist, until she is actually cooking and serving the meal. Until then, she seems to be just a French working class lady who bargain a little with the merchants, and is very serious (her husband and son were murdered in Paris in 1871). <br /> <br /> For such an artist, it is secondary if there is an audience for art that is competent to enjoy it. That is why the author put this dinner into a community of people who could not have any understanding of what they are getting. Babette did not prepare this meal as a gift to the two spinsters or to the religious community. It was not his goal to achieve a reconciliation or a spirit of good feeling among the members of the small religious sect. In fact, she never leaves the kitchen to talk to any of them. After the meal, she sits alone, drinking some wine, not paying any attention to how the guests responded. She is warming up in the satisfaction of finally having the chance to have done her best as an artist. That is why it is so satisfying and so important to history that the General unexpectedly appears - for, as Babette knows instantly, a general will know what she has put before him, and will like it. For there is a kind of tragedy in a great work of art that is shown to an audience that does not even have a competent person to enjoy it. She is happy, very happy, he came, in fact he is the only guest she mentions throughout dinner, the only one she chooses for a special treat - not one of the spinsters. But she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to her. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has had the opportunity to enjoy a true first-class Parisian dinner like me (my father was a naval attache in Paris in the 80's and I had my honeymoon in France ), dinner, and Babette's satisfaction in doing so, and the pleasure it brings to customers, is absolutely compelling. If any art has the power to flood the recipient with a sense of joy, it is a good French meal cooked and served in France. This film makes a statement about the transforming effects of great art on recipients. Before dinner, members of the small religious sect are quarrelsome, resurrecting old resentments. The old hymns do not restore good fellowship; people ignore them, talk about them. But the shared experience of great sensual art - for people to enjoy the flavors of food and wine, even if they have no idea they are experiencing great art - contain people, put them in a climate of forgiveness, reconcile, and make them happy, encourages them to love one another, and thus has a sacred divine effect of bringing peace. This is the claim found in the modern art movement today - that art can supplant traditional religions to make humanity more peaceful. Thus, unlike those commentators who say that this film speaks for the power of Christian belief, it is more correct to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that Christian ritual can not. After all my years in the art world, I must say that this claim - that art brings peace that religion can not - is exaggerated and invalid. But it is a beautiful concept and is the second main theme of this beautiful film. One last note: when Babette arrived at the spinsters' house, a French general in particular, Galliffet, was called the person who in 1871 executed Babette's husband and son, and imposed a military rule which she had to flee. At the end of the film, as the general tells the story of the magnificent meal he enjoyed in Paris many years before (before 1871), at the conclusion of some military maneuvers, it was discovered that this same Galliffet was his host at the meal. . As the general tells the story, French General Galliffet praised the chef of that meal as the greatest woman, the only woman for whom he would risk his life. Of course that woman was Babette. So, ironically, the same French general who said he honored Babette above all other women was responsible for driving her away from France forever.
