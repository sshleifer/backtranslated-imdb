Do not hate Heather Graham because she's beautiful, hate her because she's fun to watch in this movie. Like the hip outfits and trendy environments, the actors in this movie work well together. Casey Affleck is hysterical and Heather Graham literally lights the screen. The supporting characters - Goran Visnjic {sigh} and Patricia Velazquez are as talented as they are beautiful. Congratulations Miramax and Director Lisa Krueger!
