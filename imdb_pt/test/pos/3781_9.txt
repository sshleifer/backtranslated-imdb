Chaplin enters the trenches of World War I in this witty comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present, but Chaplin seems strangely alien to them all. He's in France for one thing: fighting the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success. It seems almost a long ego trip to Chaplin - very funny - until the very last minute. when it rises to a new level of pungency and everything makes sense. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's what all soldiers dream about before going to war.
