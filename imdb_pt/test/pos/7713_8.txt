The eighth and therefore the penultimate of the Animatrix, this is the only one like that. This takes two of the main types of entertainment inspirations filmed from The Matrix and combines them incredibly well. This is immensely true to the trilogy in this respect, the tone. The animation is a beautiful and dazzling Anim√©. The style, which is omnipresent in this, is Noir. The plot is appropriate, and storytelling, like music, is perfect. The overall sound is fantastic and really helps to solidify the mood and atmosphere along with the designs and designs. The dubbing is flawless. This is one of only two in which people in the movies also reprise their roles, and both have Anne-Moss, who is the only one of them appearing in this. This is one of the best of the nine, and also one of my personal favorites. This lasts about ten minutes. The pace is perfect. It never slows down a lot, but it's not too much. The end could not have been more appropriate for this. This shares a nine-and-a-half-minute story with Kid's Story, and is well done and informative. I warmly recommend this to any fan of the universe and the two genres that this is made of. 8/10
