2005 will be in the history of 'Dr.Who' as the most incredible year. Everything seemed to click; a new doctor and first-rate companion, large audiences ($ 10 million for the first episode and Christmas special), grand prizes, critical acclaim, and those idiots who spent years laughing at the Daleks' apparent inability to negotiate ladders were well and truly silenced . But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a bomb, giving up after only one series. It looked like the honeymoon was over. Fortunately, the public seems to have embraced his successor, the great David Tennant. In addition, the show is proud of S.F.X., as the spaceship crashing into 'Big Ben' in 'Aliens Of London' and superb story lines like 'Tooth & Claw', 'Army Of Ghosts / Doomsday'. The new 'Dr.Who' is basically the same as the old one, updated only for the 21st century. Some fans accused Russell T.Davies of "ruining" the show. They need to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until he appeared.
