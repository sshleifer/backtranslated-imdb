A very bizarre presentation in the trilogy of William Shakespeare's tragic love story. <br /> <br /> The family That and the Capulet family have a long hatred of each other that often results in violence. Hate has something to do with a movie company and with the fact that everyone is very crazy. In the midst of all this madness are Tromeu and Juliet, the most celebrated lovers of literature, who fall in love with each other at first sight and problems arise when they realize whose family the other belongs to. <br /> <br /> The film follows remarkably well the basic plot of the original game and the key scenes use even the original, or almost original, lines. But the infamous bizarre Troma permeates the film from beginning to end. This makes for a movie that definitely is not for everyone, but it's still quite inventive. Tyrone (Tybalt in Shakespeare) has a particularly funny death scene. 7/10 <br /> <br /> There are many versions edited and classified differently. Each contains violence, swearing, drug use and sex, all with a great deal of bizarreness.
