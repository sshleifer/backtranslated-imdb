Watching this little movie is a delight from beginning to end. The story is always fun, the tension never losing. The whole cast is wonderful. The partnership of Walken and Bracco works flawlessly, it's almost like an echo of a classic novel of freaks. Bracco is very sexy and very funny as the scammer who fights for his independence. For some reason did they give Walken a very strange makeup and the strangest haircut I can imagine? is a kind of parody that Burt Lancaster had in Elmer Gantry. To me, added the pleasure. It's the first movie I've seen Miguel Ferrer, probably one of the most underrated movie actors of his generation. He is very good in a small role as the pimp of Bracco. Even Jamaican thugs are a sight to behold. I highly recommend this movie.
