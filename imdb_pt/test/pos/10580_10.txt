After reading all the books of Sarah Waters, I was anxious for an adaptation of Fingersmith to the BBC. Especially since Tipping the Velvet was done so well by old and familiar Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the results, in fact I think this may be on a par with TTV; both romantic and fun. And not like so many ignorant people want you to believe, a meaningless lesbian joke. Having been a fan of Elaine Cassidy ever since I'd seen her shamelessly on Felicia's Journey, I thought she embodied both the hard cheating and the growing frailty of Maud. His transformation was believable and impressive to watch. I recognized Sally Hawkins as Zena Blake of Tipping the Velvet, a small role primarily, so I did not have as many expectations, but she was surprising in the role of Sue Trinder. His eyes were mesmerizing, conveying everything from anger to absolute despair. The two acting together, combining these talents, have made this drama a must-see. Of course Imelda Staunton was amazing, as usual, she is unmistakably a national treasure and the support cast were all of a high standard. Even the direction of the relatively unknown Aisling Walsh wore contrasting but beautiful shades of blue for Briar and brown for London. <br /> <br /> However, much praise should be given to Ransley, the screenwriter. To turn a 600 page book where every line is of the highest quality in a three hour extravaganza is a big feat. He illuminated the key revelations at a steady pace, while giving us lots of story and character development at the same time. He has my full admiration. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a brilliant adaptation, where everyone involved gave 100% and making this one of the best BBC dramas I've seen.
