I'm a big fan of space, and at almost 44, I just discovered this movie for the first time. I came in an indirect way from Space 1999, after the UFO. I went hunting for Anderson's other creations and discovered that this was his first live action show. What a home run! I actually heard about this movie many years ago but never knew how it was called so I'm glad I found it by accident. <br /> <br /> These Andersons were nothing less than surprising in their texts, execution of the models completely credible and realistic, the quality of performance, etc. <br /> <br /> I do not think it looks dated at all. Let me tell you ... I'll take good old models on the fake-looking CGI crap today ANYTIME! Seriously, most of the rocket scenes looked real enough. They had a science! If you choose to think about what you are seeing as real, it is not hard to really believe it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the amount of detail in scenery designs, beautiful photography, the whole look. Man, I wish I could go back to this time! They knew how to make great movies in the '60s. Personally, I lost all interest in Hollywood movies today. Anyone with a budget can do CGI. I hate that! Bring back the models! Think of all the people that style has employed! Anyway, I'm complaining. :-) If you like good science fiction that is very well done, you will do a service watching it.
