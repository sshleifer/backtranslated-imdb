A dozen bored surfers, most kids in Venice, California, not only reinvent the skateboard, but also remake a previously overlooked suburban fashion of the 1950s in an action sports revolution. Narrowed by Sean Penn, Dogtown portrays life in the most degraded "Locals Only" beach communities around 1974, which consisted mostly of tidal surfing and early morning loitering. The Zephyr Team (or Z-boys, as they are called) spends a summer fighting boredom building their own boards with the help of a location that has a surf shop. After entering re-emerging skate competitions in SoCal, they transfigure everything into their own scene; one that awakens a generation of skaters formed by big names like Tony Hawk, Shaun White and the creators of X-Games. <br /> <br /> Dogtown puts chronological perspective on skateboarding, and the up-from-the-bootstraps story you never knew you had.
