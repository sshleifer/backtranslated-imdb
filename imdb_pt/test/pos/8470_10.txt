The first spoken picture has returned from oblivion, and now you can hear and see! In the fall of 1894, at the Edison lab complex in West Orange, New Jersey, Thomas Dickison's associate William Dickson tried to combine two existing technologies (phonograph and kinetoscope) to record sound and image together. In the event, Dickson was unable to synchronize sound and image playback, so this experimental movie was never released for paid audiences ... and consequently (unlike the many silent films that Dickson did for Edison at the moment) has no official title . . The silent image (recorded at 40 fps) has been in the Library of Congress for years, known for filming historians as a mute curiosity. It was also known that the "soundtrack" had been recorded on one of the wax drums that languished on the Edison National Historic Site ... though no one knew which one. <br /> <br /> But now that has changed. Recently, the curators located the wax cylinder, which had split into several pieces. These were reassembled: a reproduction was obtained and the sound was digitized. Veteran Hollywood sound editor Walter Murch cleared the background noise and adjusted the scan to make it sync with the movie image that Murch digitally compressed at 30 fps. Sound and image are finally synchronized! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a man's voice off screen: 'Are the rest of you ready? Continues!' (The invisible speaker remains unidentified, but was probably Dickson's assistant, Fred Ott.) On the screen, Dickson plays a violin on an immense funnel mounted on a tripod (one of Edison's sound recording devices) next to him, in view of the camera. , two lab assistants embrace for some quick ballroom dancing to the beat of Dickson's music. <br /> <br /> The film lasts only 17 seconds: long enough to marvel at this raw technology before we are provoked. A laugh as we see two men dancing in each other's arms. Speaking of which, here is a WARNING: a well-known but extremely inaccurate reference book ('The Celluloid Closet' by the late Vito Russo) includes a frame enlargement of this film and identifies it as 'The Gay Brothers'. This is incorrect. 'The Gay Brothers' is a totally different film, made by Dickson in the Edison laboratory during the same period. 'The Gay Brothers' never had a soundtrack: it's a short fiction movie about two brothers who are NOT 'gay' in the sense that Russo meant it. The late Mr. Russo, for his own reasons, wanted us to notice Dickson's experimental sound film (possibly the first musical film!) As an artifact of nineteenth-century homoerotism. (Hmm, what about gays and musicals?) Sorry, but there is no such content here. <br /> <br /> This film of vital importance deserves a rating of 10 out of 10. I have always held that no 'lost' movie should be considered irretrievable unless it has been deliberately destroyed: I am pleased to report that this film is finally available to the public as its intended producer, more than a century after it was filmed!
