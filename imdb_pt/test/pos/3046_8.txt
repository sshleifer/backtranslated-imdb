Martin Ritt seems to be a director who has always been interested in social issues (as the son of immigrants, he had every incentive to be so, especially since he was blacklisted in the 1950s). "Conrack" is based on Pat Conroy's novel "The Water is Wide," about his own experience in 1969 teaching a school of impoverished black children about the outside world, much to the dismay of right-wing superintendent Hume Cronyn. What was added to the strength of the film was the cultural and historical context: Conroy (Jon Voight) talks frustratedly to another teacher about how many children do not know Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, the Vietnam War or even where Vietnam is. He goes on to clarify them about all these factors. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, I read a complaint that when Conroy played music for children, he only played white music. The truth is you can not blame the movie for that; was based on Conroy's real experience. Anyway, the movie is a real gem.
