I've seen this movie twice and the theme is invigorating. I have been in computers for many years and this film inspired me technologically, as well as a new love that fueled the furnace of my poetic passion in the heat of passion. Very original idea, great attraction in the way it tells the story to the minds that need to be freed from the everyday realities of this life.
