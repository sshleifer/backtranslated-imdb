Hilarious show with so many great stories, it reflects the world today as we know it, in such a funny way that it literally stole my laughs at other shows. I laughed so hard that I just found any other comedy without it. The unique confessions of each character are a great original technique that makes the program funny and very funny. You may think this is a medley comedy show about difficult life with a family. That's what I thought at first, but I discovered that it has new and unique techniques that set it apart from any other ordinary comedy program. Michael Rapaport is a star. I certainly wish this show would not be canceled.
