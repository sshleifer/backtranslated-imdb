I loved the airport shots - Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just unique buildings with the name in capital letters on the roof. And the tri-engines and the well-dressed passengers. Advancing 75 years ... <br /> <br /> But what really caught my attention was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent to the logo behind the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill found that Jim would become a general in a Chinese rebel army? This, based on the hammer and the sickle, could only have been the Revolutionary Army of the People of Mao Tse Dung !!! Do not worry about underwear and unmarried bedding - did this logo and that reference survive during the Cold War? <br /> <br /> Additional Note 12/27: This 1930s movie with the Soviet emblem may also reflect the influence and charm of communism in Hollywood and much of America during the Great Depression. It adds to the historical value of this fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed aspects of the American Dream of two Winnemucca boys who took at least part of the world through the storm, Red-Blooded (literally and copiously in the case of Jim) American Boys. <br /> /> Others commented more skillfully than I did on acrobatics, etc. I loved everything. <br /> <br /> This gem deserved more than the mere 1.5 stars Osborne and Co. rated it at TCM, even if only for recording parts of American history from the early 30's.
