Whether you like Madonna or not, this movie is hilarious !! I'm a fan of Madonna and I saw this in the theater at the time of its release. However, over time, it has not lost its foolishness and pure fun. Of course there are some bad lines and tacky acting, but the whole movie is just a crazy comedy with Madonna, actually carrying the entire movie with big bombast. She's cute, funny and the only comedic role in her film career. Madonna usually just plays "herself" in roles, but looking at her as Nikki Finn in that film, she really does look like someone else for the first time. Of course the film is directed by James Foley (who filmed the dramatic and astonishing 'Close Close Range' with Sean Penn & Christopher Walken) and co-stars Griffin dunn ('After Hours'), who is also brilliantly cast and enjoys the material. The story is nothing short of genius and do not expect a climactic end, but if you're in the mood to watch a fun, clean, 80's fun or if you're a Madonna fan than this is a must-see. The soundtrack is also very remarkable and contains 4 Madonna songs: # 1 hit "Who's That Girl", # 2 hit "Causing A Commotion" and the beautiful one and one of her best ballads "The Look of Love" 10 hit in the UK) and "Can not Stop" a left over pop ditty of 'True Blue' sessions the year before. It's only on VHS, but it will soon be available on DVD.
