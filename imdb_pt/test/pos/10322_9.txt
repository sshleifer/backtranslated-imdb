The Stooges are back and funnier than ever. "Brideless Groom", in my opinion, was probably Shemp's best film. Shemp has the opportunity to inherit 500 thousand dollars (which was probably more than a million dollars if compared to today) of his dead uncle. BUT! There is a catch. He has to marry someone that day at 6 o'clock. Shemp is a bachelor with many admirers, except for an irritating and aggressive corner student. But he does not want her, he wants someone a little more about the type of Victoria's Secret model. But obviously he has no choice, since he is not Collin Ferrel himself. But when it is printed in the newspapers that he must inherit all that money if married, his ex-girlfriends are in the "I want my man back" attack! <br /> <br /> What a stupid movie! This is up there with the winners of all the fantastic movies! <br /> <br /> 9/10
