I'm not a fan of that brand of comedy - stereotypical characters overcoming the path through a farce of cops and thieves. But there are characters quite pleasant to sustain the interest. Michelle Pfeiffer is adorable, but the person who actually carries the film is Dean Stockwell, who steals all the scenes as the head mafioso (called Tony, not less). <br /> <br /> Stockwell's performance is the reason I'm writing this review (and the only reason I would recommend it), actually. You will be pleased by your screen time. He plays the mafia boss perfectly, with comic touches in the right places, managing to avoid becoming an arrogant cliche. In fact, Stockwell is a complete treat to watch - a master of the "double take", and a true "looker" in these elegant and fedoras suits. <br /> <br /> Meesa says: A good movie to watch when folding clothes or eating leftovers.
