Watching this series will probably make you feel like our parents felt when watching Star Trek for the first time. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. The kind of stories that makes you forget how to blink, the kind of character that makes you want to get on the TV to join the action, and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair shiver and endless admiration. In short, we start with John Chrichton, an astronaut, who is shot in a wormhole and ends up with a gang of prisoners fleeing the black badguys ironically known as Peacekeepers. <br /> Other colorful characters consists of D'Argo, big face with a short temper and a sword / laser rifle. Aerun Sun, former peacemaker and Ph.D in buttkicking. Zotoh Zhan, which is a plant. Not true, she is. She is also a priest, but with a bad expression. There is also Dominate Rygel XVI, a fat, lazy bastard who releases helium and often does more harm than good. <br /> <br /> Later, in the series, we find the sexiest alien that has ever been on television, namely, Chiana. A young and seemingly chronically nervous Nebari. She is played by Gigi Edgley, which is a name you should remember. <br /> <br /> One of the many things I love about this series is that since John Chrichton ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake, he still gives references to "real life." That is, when John is having a hard time accepting being frozen as a statue for 80 years, one of his many complaints is that when he returns, Buffy the Vampire Slayer will be dead. <br /> Frell all other series, join your Dren and pass an Ahn in one of these episodes. I can guarantee, Sci / Fi as you know, will change forever. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. It's sexy. It is actionpacked. It's hillarious. It's Farscape
