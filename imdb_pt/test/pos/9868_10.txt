Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers is probably the best sequel to all Halloween movies. Jamie, the niece of serial killer Michael Myers, has a baby who has been taken by the Man in Black since the conclusion of Halloween 5. A gentle nurse helps Jamie escape, but Myers quickly locates and kills her. Jamie's baby is found and rescued by Tommy Doyle, one of the children Jamie Lee babysat in the original film, and Myers arrives in Haddonfield and begins to kill the Strode clan that lives in its old house. The film ends with scenes that reveal clues about Michael's illness, the identity of the man in black and a story of Dr. Loomis / Michael Myers. I recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers is Rated R for strong graphic violence, extreme gore, brief sexuality, language and brief nudity.
