The Eighties produced a lot of small horror films, most of them within the sub-genre of the slasher - thus putting this film ahead of most of the rest of its class. Night of the Demons is a kind of cross between the definitive film, The Evil Dead; and haunted house-cum-slash night-hell movie. Films like this usually have a madman upset / deformed like the bad guy at the front; but here we have bloodthirsty demons, which is always more interesting than a lunatic if you ask me. There's also a lot of comedy in this movie, and the first third of the movie could easily be created for a direct comedy movie. But once the characters enter the central location; a sinister funeral home known as 'Hull House' - the movie becomes the horror movie you would expect given the title. The plot is as simple as you'd expect, and we followed a group of kids who decide to have a Halloween party inside the funeral home. This turns out to be a bad idea, however, since it is known that the house is owned; and the demons begin to inhabit the bodies of the children! His only salvation is on the other side of the underground stream ... but finding the gate to the ground is not as easy as it sounds. <br /> <br /> The centerpiece of the movie is the Gothic mansion where the action takes place. Place, place. This old, noisy house makes a great location for horror movies; the fact that it used to be a funeral parlor only contributes to this. Director Kevin Tenney fires well in the house, and a particularly good job is done to establish the fact that the house is in the middle of nowhere and the escape is difficult. The comedy for the beginning of the movie is usually very funny, and I expected it to continue laughing as soon as the horror began. The movie has its comedy moments when kids enter the Hull House, but it's never very funny and it's obvious that horror is the main goal of the film. Not that this is a problem; but the Night of the Demons could have been much better had it fused these elements properly. The characters are pretty much what you'd expect from this kind of movie; but the acting goes well with the film, and of course the young cast had fun making this movie and translating well on the screen. The effects are good because they fit well with the film and as most death sequences are well executed; It's a good bet that most people do not get bored watching this. This is not a classic or must see movie; but I can recommend it highly because it offers a good time and will attract fans of horror nonsense.
