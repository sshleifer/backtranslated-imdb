This movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is. It's a movie for children and parents, and it's "timeless". I've seen this movie before Ocean's Eleven and I must admit that the OE actors have class in advance, but Klatretøsen's game is so much more realistic and moving. Why I say eleven from the ocean, is the fact that these two films have many things in common and Klatretøsen is so good! which can be compared with OE. The 3 young people play their role in a perfect way not to believe, compared to what we are accustomed in Denmark. The different cases of impossible acts are treated in a way that you would not believe in many young actors (and sometimes not even the "old boys"). The story ? once again, has things in common with Ocean's Eleven except for stealing money, and in Klatretøsen they need to climb to the strongroom. The part where the young people have to take care of Ida's younger brother gives a good element in the film. Try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2-year-old with a diaper on his arm :-). <br /> <br /> This movie can be compared to the more "adult" movie like MI2 and Ocean's Eleven. Yeah, I think it's good. It's better to watch it in a theater, as all the children in the room comment on the movie and these comments will stay in their hearts forever :-). <br /> <br /> Regards Klavs.
