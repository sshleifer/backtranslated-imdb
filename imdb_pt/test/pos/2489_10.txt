Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema. Filmed in Southern California California using his fake documentary style, Watkins creates a movie like no other. He follows two groups of prisoners (one pre-sentenced the other post-sentenced) along the board. After they are tried by a military court, they have the choice to serve a prison sentence or they can participate in the punishment. Park (a tiring three-day walk through the desert with nothing but clothes on the back) while being hunted by local law <br /> <br /> police officers who use the park as a live action training <br /> <br /> ground). I can not say enough about this movie. Sometimes it feels like you're watching a real documentary. This is one of the most accessible films by Peter Watkins. I advise you to look for it. You will not regret! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended <br /> <br /> A + <br /> <br />
