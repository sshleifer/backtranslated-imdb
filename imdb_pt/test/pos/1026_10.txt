Just as a reminder to anyone reading the comments on this excellent BBC miniseries, published in 1981, it was not available on DVD until the last few years. Since then it has become available, but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an 'international' DVD player, which you have to hack - I suspect, illegally), but the series is now available through amazon.com - 3 discs - between $ 19 and 21, to be viewed on DVD in the American format, without intrusion. There were 41 reviews, average 5 stars. This mini-series is one of the best of the Oppenheimer, or the Manhattan Project, or virtually anything produced by the BBC.
