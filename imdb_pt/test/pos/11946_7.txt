I love this movie as much as anyone loves to see what they saw when they were young. was one of those movies that the Home Box Office showed every day during my youth. this movie is forever housed in my brain. For someone who has not grown up around this movie, you may have been spoiled by the ADD cycle that we are in the mid-90's and may find it harder to appreciate this gem. cool this is, as my sister was doped in "best dead" before I saw this (of which I raped and loved) and no one, can anyone deny the embrace of clumsy teenage humor in American cinema in the 80s - this gave rise to to everything we find tiresome in teenage comedies ... because with all the overuse of slow-mo, the current soundtrack, the new technology. I wonder if the cinema will return to these roots ... This is the teen comedy ... YES!
