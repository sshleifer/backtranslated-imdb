This is an amazing movie, and if you have not seen it, you should go to the video store now and rent it. First, the cast is excellent. Not only does current stars such as Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton, but also have their past stars like Judge Reinhold. He also has numerous special guest appearances from actors such as Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson and Jamie Lee Curtis. Secondly, the story was very good too. It was interesting how they made a plan for a drugged movie and almost made it dramatic. It takes the drug situation in the United States and instead of giving it a comical face as in "Half Baked" has a true, life-lesson image like "Traffic." So watch this movie, if you're a junkie, it will give you insight into something you love, if you do not use drugs, it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see.
