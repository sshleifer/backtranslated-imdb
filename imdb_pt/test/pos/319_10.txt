My favorite movie of all time. This was a flawed work of Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more attractive. Coppola was then king of Hollywood after making "the godfather" and "godfather" and had developed the necessary ego to dare to make a film like "Apocalypse Now". Out of sheer arrogance he went to the Philippines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought, he would know what to do when he arrived at Colonel Kurtz's compound. And like Willard, he did not know what he would do when he got there. This is a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is a perfect metaphor and backdrop for history. What I like most about Apocalypse Now is that it does not offer answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this lack of openness, it infuriates some viewers who like their films to be much more obvious. <br /> <br /> This movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie that is not at all, it's actually more of a personal study of man. The best picture on Vietnam is "Platoon", in my opinion, and if a bystander is looking for a rereading of the Vietnam War, go there first for answers. Coppola should be commended for his opinion on the bureaucracy of the war that he conveys fairly effectively with the meeting with Gen. Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic. <br /> <br /> It's an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending that makes a movie inaccessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch, but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations in each scene, but that would be totally useless. This film is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification. <br /> <br /> A little footnote, definitely if you are a first time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more meant for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved' version of the movie
