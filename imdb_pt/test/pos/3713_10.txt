Two soldiers is an excellent example of film production. The director and producer had an entertaining story and brought him to life with a very skillful and dedicated cast, excellent cinematography and lots of creative art. <br /> <br /> The brothers' laid-back lifestyle was portrayed. with great detail, and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle in which they were pushed. The interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they struggled with a tough but peaceful life in the woods of North Carolina and an even harder life of war. <br /> <br /> The performance was great, particularly from the younger brother on the big screen (played by Jonathan Furr), the older brother (played by Ben Allison) and the powerful performance of the Colonel (played by Ron Perlman). The performance was extremely well done. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of Two Soldiers, and I heartily recommend it to audiences of all ages.
