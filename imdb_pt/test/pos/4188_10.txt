To experience Head, you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it. <br /> <br /> That was when the series was drawing to a close and the group was about to end. His inventive and comedic series (a kind of American Idol of his day) led to four unknown actors and formed a supergroup built around them. <br /> <br /> This is your opinion on your "fabricated image" and status as the second level Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, stuck and unable to find credibility despite their talents. <br /> <br /> It's also a hell of a musical journey, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises. <br /> <br /> Watch with an open mind.
