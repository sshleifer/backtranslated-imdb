Melodies are the best aspect of this television film that has production values ​​admittedly better than average, but a very superficial and slightly altered biography. It dramatizes Richard's discovery of "We Only Only Begun" and Karen's wedding problems admirably (the "Superstar" set was a nice touch), but leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony's guitar solos Peluso, etc. is sweet in his persona Karen, but does not include the taciturn and meddlesome sides of Carpenter's real personality. Anderson is in great shape as Richard, the creator and responsible, and Fletcher makes his mark as the loving but arrogant Agnes. The most astonishing moment of the original broadcast is the use of "Goodbye to Love" at the bottom of a commercial displaying a direct line of anorexia.
