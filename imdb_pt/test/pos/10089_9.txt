Disgusted as an Asian Horror, "A Tale of Two Sisters" is actually a psychological drama directed by a complex character, who engulfs the viewer in the problems of a seemingly normal family. I was really surprised at the depth of this movie. Director Ji-woon Kim's decision to focus more on telling a story, rather than providing cheap scares, proved to be correct. Creating one of the most ingenious new horror movies. <br /> <br /> "A Tale of Two Sisters" tells the story, as the name suggests of two Su-mi sisters and young Su-yeon, who after spending time in a mental institution, return home father and the seemingly abusive stepmother. From then on, we witnessed how the sisters deal with their stepmother's increasing aggression and erratic behavior. To say what would happen next would be to ruin the whole experience. So, I'll leave it at that. <br /> <br /> The plot is very well written. With well-developed characters. Kim Ji-woon's focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed insight into them and their relationships to each other. In addition, each of the four main castles has a very different role and character type. From the protector Su-mi, the weaker Su-yeon, the visibly disinterested father of the frantic and then deadly behavior of the stepmother. There is a great sense of mystery, with much of the plot not revealed until the end and even after that, the movie still leaves a great room for interpretation. Even after watching it once, the viewer will be required to see it at least one more time so he can better understand. <br /> <br /> The actors fit neatly into their roles. It is especially difficult to create strong and emotional scenes in psychological films, but it is a great joy when you can create them and this is a great example of such a feat. Ji-woon Kim's direction is slow and thrilling, raising the tension for the film's gruesome scenes. While few in number these moments are strong and downright terrifying. The cinematography and score are first rate, further helping to establish an atmosphere that fits into a psychological film. <br /> <br /> "A tale of two sisters" is a demonstration of how the horror genre is actually much more than a simple thrill ride. With its strong focus on character and mystery, this is a complex movie that can easily entice you to watch it over and over again just so you can understand it better.
