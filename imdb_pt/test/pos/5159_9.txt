This movie should not be funny, but it made me laugh. <br /> <br /> It was not designed to be sad, but my heart was heavy on several of the stickers. <br /> <It's not written as an action adventure, but my wrist shot more than once. <br /> <br /> Like life, this movie does not manipulate your emotions and tells you how to feel. It just is, and you react. <br /> <br /> If you do not find it funny, sad or moving, I suspect it says more about you than the movie. <br /> <br /> It is incredible and refreshing to see a director celebrate with all our heart that we are all human, and to embrace that we are all stuck here, doing this "life" thing over and over as long as it takes. <br /> <br /> Tomorrow is another day.
