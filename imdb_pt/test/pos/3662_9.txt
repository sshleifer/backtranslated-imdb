"Hari om" is an Indian greeting and the title character of the film with the same name (played by the wedding planner of Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a trip through the heart of South India. There are no "Bend it like Beckham" scenarios and stereotypes, and only small greetings to Bollywood music and dance (however, the soundtrack is worth seeking), but rather the feeling that you are seeing the real India pervades the film through the use of dozens of locals in each scene to enhance the performance of the five professional actors. Fortunately for us, Hari Om's companion is a young and beautiful French woman in search of a journey. With openings of a journey "Y Tu Mama Tambien" for self-discovery (without sex and fatal disease), this beautiful film calms and brings the philosophical mind. Against the initial juxtaposition of the protagonists, all identify with traits of both and the cultural division disappears as humanity enters the scene. More succinctly, the central theme of the film: "Everyone has a love story, do not let it go" teaches us a lot about love on many levels. Do not let this movie go through you!
