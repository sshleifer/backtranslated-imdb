My dad, the hero is sweet, funny and handsome. Gerard Depardiu is amazing as Andre, a divorced father who takes his fourteen-year-old daughter, Nicole (Kathrine Heigl) to the Caribbean for vacation. Meanwhile, her daughter meets a guy named Ben (Dalton James. To impress him, she tells him that Andre is her lover and her father is arrested for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute and she ran away with her pimp Andre is one of two relationships, one with Isabelle (Emma Thompson, who plays a special role at the end of the film) and Diana (Faith Prince of Spin City ) My dad, the hero, has lots of funny moments, like when he's at a talent show and everyone tells him to play So he plays Gigi's "Thank Heaven for Little Girls." Everyone gets disgusted and goes away. Dad, the Hero, does not deserve a 5.1. I think he deserves a 9.0.
