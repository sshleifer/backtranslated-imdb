I watched the series after seeing the Naked Gun movies. I found it much better than the movies, and I found the movies great! This series literally glues you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun, vision gag or funny situation (the whole wicker place at night, club flamingo). I think I've never laughed so hard at a TV show in my life, even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes. I think it's a shame that only six episodes have been produced, but I agree that writers would be hard-pressed to keep this level of comedy for more episodes. Overall, the series is a must see for anyone who likes puns, bad jokes and visual gags.
