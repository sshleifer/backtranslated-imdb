This may be my favorite so bad it's amazing movie of all time. like many pre-adolescent children of the 80s, the repetition of revenge of the ninjas generated a ninja phase of my childhood. Dude, I found Sho k. was badass at that time. Jet Li could wup him with both legs in a cast! This movie has insane passages that include the flashdance, the exorcist and the TV program Lee Van Cleef Ninja. ugh but as a friend of mine says that anyone can get a good movie if it takes a real genius to make a movie that starts with a ninja surviving 17 shots enough to take the body of an arrogance instructor to take revenge. Wow. While previous commentators have measured the sword flying out of the closet on the rope, no one has yet filled the mighty love scene. Where the sexy cop takes his shirt to reveal a backhair mane. The fun never ends. Rent this !!!!!!
