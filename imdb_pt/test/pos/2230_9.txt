I can not understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently available only through an Australian video company, but that is the unfortunate obscurity of this Peter Sellers classic (Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide continues to award the same review of BOMB in the 1970s ). With so many thieves on the scene, Sellers appears with what may be his most hilarious role. It all begins with the discovery of a patient who expired at 11.15, but Sellers argues that the corpse is still alive, due to the fact that the new day does not start until noon!

Unfortunately there are some missing images of this print, including a topless string with Uschi Digard nearby the end too m a scene with actress Kathleen Freeman (who wants to use green stamps to finance his operation), who is locked by Sellers in his office, never to be seen again (in the uncut version, he returns to his office to find out that she wrote in large letters on the wall "UNFAIR PRICK"; your answer? "you misspelled price!").
