After three notable BBC television series and a Christmas special, the bizarre and grotesque (though perversely lovable) characters of the shadowy fictional town Royston Vasey make the leap to the celluloid along with their creators - The League of Gentlemen . <br /> <br /> Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are the quartet's three best-known quarters, with the central roles shared between the trio. In a turnaround, the last member of the team - Jeremy Dyson - is interpreted by the actor Michael Sheen. <br /> <br /> Where to begin? Dyson (Sheen) is in conversation with his writing companions, when - horror of the horrors - he is paid a visit by two of his most horrible characters. Both Tubbs (Pemberton) and Edward Tattsyrup (Shearsmith) are unhappy with the League's decision to kill the Vasey inhabitants. "You are not real!" Dyson screams in vain, as the local shopkeepers of hell avenge themselves. Mayhem follows, while reality and Vasey converge with the wide range of characters that enter our world to save theirs. <br /> <br /> Confused? You will be, like the unfathomable Teutonic camp, Herr Lipp (Pemberton) is forced to take on the daily disguise of Pemberton, while Pemberton is hijacked by cannibalistic butcher Hillary Briss (Gatiss) and Geoff Tipps (Shearsmith) Briss tries to force Pemberton to rewrite the movie - thus continuing his life - but leaving Geoff in charge is never a good idea. The former comedian engages in the league's latest post-Vasey adventure - The King's Bad - entering a typically twisted 17th-century England with special guest appearances by Victoria Wood, Peter Kay and David Warner. Known as George of Asda (due to his clothing line), Geoff saves the day and is treated like a hero, but for the outcome of the film, he joins old and new characters in the Church of Royston Vasey to meet with his characters. manufacturers. <br /> <br /> For the fans of the series, the film is a must see. And yes, it features Papa Lazarou (albeit a bit too fleeting). Pauline, Mickey, Barbara and cursed veterinarian Matthew Chinnery are some of the other favorites in the series, and the picture of The League (as well as Sheen's as Dyson) is also a fascinating insight. The Gentlemen's League is the Radiohead of the British comedy - they are ambitious, innovative (witness the excellent Series Three) and are not content to rest on their laurels. They also share the opinion accordingly. <br /> <br /> Of course, his macabre sense of humor is not to all palates, and although not written exclusively for 'fans', an understanding of the plot would benefit those who have seen the Series. However, Apocalypse is a movie by itself and The League will undoubtedly be able to attract a new generation of fans as well as appease and please existing ones.
