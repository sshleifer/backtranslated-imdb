One of my favorite non-MGM musicals, it's a classic! Rita Hayworth is in her best shape, her beauty jumps off the screen. Gene Kelly shows off his dance skills and introduces musicals to his innovative choreography that would eventually change the way the musicals are choreographed. Phil Silvers is the second perfect banana, and Eve Arden injected this movie with a lot of class. <br /> <br /> The structure is so theatrical that one wonders why, at this time when great Broadway shows come from the movies, Cover Girl was not adapted to the theater.
