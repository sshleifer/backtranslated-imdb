<br /> <br /> My favorite science fiction, incredible ride through mistrust and the distortion of reality. Probably the best performance I've ever seen Jude Law play. Incredibly original with interesting character developments and a storyline that spins and turns so quickly that it takes a few minutes after the movie to fully understand its genius. Even more fun to watch again for the end changes the beginning.
