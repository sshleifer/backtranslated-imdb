When someone stops to remember the frequent formation of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland onscreen, "They died in their boots" (1941), it is more likely that the film has remembered better. General Custer's saga (Flynn) - told from the moment he enters the West Point military academy and falls in love with the delightful Elizabeth Bacon (DeHavilland), during his tenure during the American Civil War, and finally with his death in Little Big.

It literally exudes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of its loyal heroine. Resident Warner action actors Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet deliver wonderful appearances that seem to have much more depth and character than what is actually written in the material for them. Overall, despite its loose rendering of the story in favor of a good romantic thread, "They died in their boots" is a bountiful movie for a Saturday matinee or a Sunday night gracing love someone.

Some fading is obvious during scene transitions. The audio has been very well cleaned and is presented at an appropriate listening level.
