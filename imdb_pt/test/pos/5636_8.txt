For me, the best and most memorable films are those that, the first time, do not know anything about it. The American film is a perfect example of such a gem. Watching TV late at night, I saw the only good review of the impurities - fortunately I settled for real treat. American Movie is a documentary that follows the unforgettable Mark Borchardt, a highly articulate and charismatic Wisconson lad, while striving to write, direct and produce "MidWestern," a low-budget offensive horror film. that he has been working for years. In Mark we find a young man full of contrast. Its appearance is from the classic stereotype of trash to trailers - fine mustache, punk style, heavy metal style of the 80s, mulatto hairstyle, etc. For the camera, however, Mark reveals amazing wit and insight when philosophizing about life, love, movies, and American Way. As the film unfolds, it becomes clear that Mark's lack of discipline and excessive drinking are relentlessly sabotaging his creative endeavors. American Movie is a charming clock filled with hilarious moments and vivid characters. Chief among them is Mark's amiable friend Mike Schank, a mild-mannered reformed junkie who, having won a scratch card addiction, now relies on soft drinks. I absolutely loved the American movie. It creates real empathy between the viewer and the main characters and provides hilarity without feeling exploited. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.
