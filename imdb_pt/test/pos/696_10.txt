As a teenager, I watched this movie every time I was on TV (and it was a lot) because of its spirited and appealing humor to the teenager. It may not be what the critics consider the 4 star view, but I love it for what it is - a fun comedy meant to please audiences. The teen actors are from my generation (probably because I love the movie so much) and it was like a fantasy cast of all the favorite TV shows of the early '90s - Full House, Family Matters, Fresh Prince - all the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 1990s. While it may not include the high doses of nudity and violence that many teen movie writers consider vital to success among young demographics (or perhaps because of their absence), I I strongly recommend pre-teens and teens everywhere.
