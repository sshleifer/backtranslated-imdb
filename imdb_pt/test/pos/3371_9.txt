The Box is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this picture of the word: Imagine you've been talking about pixie sticks and paint for the past month while watching Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma takes you to a hospital where the nurse seems to revel in the adrenaline in her IV. The dream you have while in a coma will be something like this movie. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: A man appears at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button. Press the button, they will receive a million dollars in cash and a person who does not know will die. I will try not to ruin anything, but from there things become such a tangled, complex and purely original plot that it will make you question your sanity. But, hey, most of us have been healthy for a while now, and the change is good. <br /> <br /> PROS: Incredible plot, good overall performance, not a slow time once it starts. He asks questions about human morality that are rarely if ever asked in popular culture. This movie is deep, it has meaning. It's not summertime blockbuster special effects fluff (not that there's anything wrong with this); this film had a relatively low budget and showed in some places. But I think maybe that's what makes me like it so much. <br /> CONS: The first twenty minutes, before starting, are very slow. At the end of the movie, you will be so confused that you will have to sit and think for a good half hour. I can guarantee that this film will not be praised by your colleagues or most critics; It's very strange and there are no blasts every three seconds. In fact, there are no blasts of any kind in this movie (besides your brain that comes from trying to figure out exactly what the heck happened). Personally, I do not think this is a bad thing, but many will. <br /> <br /> CLASSIFICATION: Easily a 9/10. I've never had an experience like watching this movie. The only reason I can not give a 10/10 is that he is very self-absorbed. There are several big things that have not yet been explained in the end and that are still bothering me while I sit here writing this. But overall, this is the best experience I've had in a movie in a long time. But be warned, you will not like this movie if you can not sit down, activate your suspension of disbelief by about 150% and prepare your brain to do stunning stunts. <br /> <br /> Visit www. thestuffblag.com for more comments
