A breathtaking look at the ocean and the life in it. <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Each photo is done beautifully. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see all the different animals that I could never have imagined. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough has the perfect voice of the narrator. No one could have done anything better. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> There were one or two different times when there was a reference to Earth being 1 million years old (I hold a different belief). <br /> <br /> In general, a TV series can be enjoyed by anyone. I recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.
