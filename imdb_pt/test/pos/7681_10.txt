Certainly the Gershwin family realizes that this is one of America's greatest operas. You have thousands of fans of this opera waiting to be released on DVD. Please do not be so stubborn, give us some time. Think of the joy and wonder you can bring to an audience hungry for quality music by releasing this great GEM. Do not wait until the film is beyond repair. The cast is top notch, the music is simply amazing, we need beautiful music in today's world. You can never be filmed again with such a cast. With today's home theater systems, wonderful sound systems and the need for great music, I'm begging the Gershwin family to reconsider and release this amazing movie. Thank you very much
