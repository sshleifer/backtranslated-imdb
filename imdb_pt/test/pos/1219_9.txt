True Love, I really liked and loved this movie. It was fun, fun and inspiring. I just saw it on DVD. How I lost this one is a winner! I want to say that Flex was "That Guy". I wanted to marry him. This was my first time seeing him as a leading man and he pulls it off. I thought Tangi Miller was the best of all time and I was also a Felicity boss. A fearless woman who is only afraid of her. Thanks for giving the women color in their work and she looks great! Tasha Smith was a blast! Aloma Wright was invaluable as Nana. This romantic comedy is "must see". Oh, and the new singer Marcus Patrick is worth the surprises ... True Love. Karen
