It worked! Director Christian Duguay has created a very clever action / espionage thriller. Actors Donald Sutherland and especially Aidan Quinn performed at a high level. Too bad we could not see Aidan Quinn in other movies like this until now. He was simply the best in the role as Ramirez / Carlos for what he should have won the Oscar. The photo was very good. The scenes are fast from start to finish and the story does not let you have the chance to be bored. The film is very underrated and I recommend it to anyone, otherwise you will miss something great. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. That's why I give 9/10.
