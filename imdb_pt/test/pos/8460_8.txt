Although the premise of the film involves a great "coincidence," all actors do a meritorious job and look great, bringing history to life. I found myself waking up to the characters played by Mary Tyler Moore and Christine Lahti, empathizing with both and wanting them to reconcile. Sam Waterston and Ted Danson are well into their roles too, doing a decent job with the stereotypical relationship of friends. While the story tends to jump through time, occasionally leaving the audience, perhaps a little hungry for missing details, it still flows and avoids any real confusion. This interesting storyline has all the elements for a good "chick".
