The song is from Stravinsky (and not from the incompetent stupid Philip Glass) and was written ten years before the unfortunate birth of glass. The staging is simply extraordinary. The Japanese narrative adds a threatening quality and intensity that the Latin version does not have. cf. Terzieff version. The giant heads and hands are totally justified by the mythical aspect of the tale. The props and make-up used for the plague are simply visible. It's Taymor's best job. The singers are very good, especially the Terfel. Langridge is quite moving and clean, and Norman finds the right expression, and his beauty is magnified here and finds his right place: greater than life. Simply a must.
