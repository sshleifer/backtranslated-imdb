If you repeat a lie enough times, will this become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The film is about her quest for her home in a fictional address where her imaginary husband and five children live. Aparna Sen offers another work of art. Every actor in the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen seems incredibly convincing as a schizophrenic. She takes out the paper so easily and maturally beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is amazing as always. She plays the dominant and fiercely independent older sister of Mithi, who takes care of her sick sister and elderly mother. She refuses to accept that, despite all her strength and courage, she still feels lonely sometimes. This should have been a very easy movie for Rahul Bose. The paper was undemanding and anyone could have played the part. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was the most surreal part of the entire Park Avenue experience. It took me a while to digest that the movie was over. It made me confused and maybe even a little disturbed. But later, it began to sink. My eyes are black. But if everyone says they're blue, do I still believe it's black ??
