THE FOUR SEASONS MERCHANT was the first shot of Rainer Werner Fassbinder in mainstream acceptance. In a turbulent career of just fifteen years, he has managed to create an impressive body of work in film and theater, both as an interpreter and as a producer, actor, and creative director. Although this movie does not attract many viewers, the film has a lot to offer. The plot is quite simple. A man is banished from his upper middle class family because of emotional and economic problems, and is unable to control his downward spiral. The TRADER OF FOUR SEASONS is filmed with a servile devotion to elegant details, and each set is carefully designed and constructed. Each object on the stage seems meticulously organized to bring layers of emotional texture. Many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of the various rooms and seem to speak to Hans's desperate search for spiritual direction or direction in his life. Much was thought of how lighting and color were employed to contrast and enhance the drama. Several times during the film, I froze the painting to marvel at the beauty of the composition of the shot. I conveyed this film, and the impression was almost perfect and second to none. Fassbinder employs his actors in an almost "Anti-Natural" style. He does everything possible to prevent actors from react in a normal or colloquial manner, and this creates a rather flamboyant effect. However, in doing so, he injects an almost "hyper-reality" into the narrative. Instead of presenting a mundane melodrama, the almost militant lack of affectation of the actors forces the viewer to confront the film in a different way. Fassbinder's film intentionally prevents the viewer from easily connecting with the characters. You're constantly outside looking inside. This will be a disconcerting experience for many, but I thought it was a unique and satisfying artistic adventure.
