First love. Teenage love. We all experience this, even if it is not as sweet as what the protagonists share. "Friends" could be considered an adaptation of the classic "The Blue Lagoon", originally of 1949, and its remakes of 1980 (most popular with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While "The Blue Lagoon" puts the two young lovers on a deserted island, with no contact with civilization, "Friends" follows the opposite route and is sure to sound so much truer and be a more difficult film with the contemporary audience. Paul and Michelle who, for different reasons, turn their backs on the family and the world of adults to end up living together in a small cottage in the south of France. Having just one another and their childish innocence, their friendship slowly develops into much more, as they struggle to sustain themselves, in this sweet maturing story. This movie to this day is controversial, since the actors are teenagers and they certainly look like the ages that appear in the film (15 and 14 and a half). The film contains a suggestion of child sexual abuse, nudity, depictions of teenage sex, and teenage pregnancy. But the real controversy is not the subject, but the fact that the love of Paul and Michelle is presented as a natural and healthy relationship. While this worked well for lovers stranded in another time and on a deserted island, having them in a modern setting presents some very difficult moral issues. Laws prohibiting sexual consent among minors are in force in almost all countries and the lack of sex education in adolescents is seen as one of the causes of increased unwanted pregnancies in adolescence and abortion. It is a film like this just child pornography or a slap in the face to make us face our own hypocrisy, in relation to a modern society that does not care for teenage parents and laws that clearly go against human nature and hormonal development, but which are necessary to prevent child abuse? Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? These are not easy questions and most of us will feel uncomfortable with them. As an artistic piece, this movie is truly a forgotten and rude gem. The script progresses with extreme simplicity, despite some weaknesses, but never giving any impetus to affirm its message, although, according to current standards, it is a bit slow. The photograph is beautiful and has scenes of great beauty. The acting of the two protagonists varies from really horrible in some scenes to wonderfully innocent and credible in others. Pop music, unlike most productions nowadays, is used with taste and sometimes the lyrics speak the thoughts of the protagonists. Overall, this is a delectable piece, even if moral values ​​do not agree with yours.
