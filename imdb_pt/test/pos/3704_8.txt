Mommy has to be one of the uncomfortable movies of all time to watch. It features an old lady you would like to take as your nanny, who becomes the most fucking mother you would like to meet on a dark night! <br /> <br /> This nanny eats the inners of a young woman at the opening of the movie and gets sicker as she continues. A cross between the howls and the brain dead seems to come to mind when describing Mom! <br /> <br /> A must for terror fans who have stomach for it (if you watched re-animation or brain death, this will float your boat) and are willing to turn off the brain for an hour or more ... Let the blood fall! ... 8/10
