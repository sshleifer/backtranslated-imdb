May contain Spoilers !!! By no means, shape or format, does this movie break the mold of the horror movie. Not for a long shot. However, it creates a spooky atmosphere, characters and gore enough. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and does not care more about unraveling than it needs. A group of children is killed in a mining accident in the early 1900s. Since then they have chased and killed the residence of their quiet town of PA in the mountains. <br /> <br /> Simple: they want revenge on the man who caused his death years and years ago. Of course, his great, great great-grandson is in town and he is a real idiot. <br /> <br /> Along with this, a mother and her two daughters inherit an old house after the husband dies. The eldest daughter is rebellious, detestable ... a typical teenager. The younger one is curious, with bright eyes and comes in contact with the ghostly children. <br /> <br /> The scariest part of this movie is the sheer lack of emotion of the children and they make their way through victim after victim. Excellent performance. It was so scary! I mean, the Children of the Corn movies are one thing ... but that's gotten past any of those (like scary kids). <br /> <br /> Worht a look. I bought it before I saw it and I was not unhappy. But I'm a fan of terror altogether.
