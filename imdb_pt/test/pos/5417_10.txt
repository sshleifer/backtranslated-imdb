This short was nominated for an Oscar, losing to Anna and Bella. Not since Dr. Strangelove has such a hilarious nuclear war! Condie takes a situation and turns it into his ear and then takes a good turn around. Visual gags abound in Condie's work and I always see something I've missed before every time I watch it. In the biggest animation in the world, it is worth seeing for this and many other short films. Recommended.
