The whole world is falling victim to a deadly disease, and the rain never stops: however, in this nightmarish atmosphere, a man and a woman discover that they are neighbors, thanks to a hole in the floor of the man's apartment. They fall in love: at least, not everything would have been lost. Although this wonderful film expresses the solitude and weakness of the human being, there is also some room for hope in the brilliant singing scenes.
