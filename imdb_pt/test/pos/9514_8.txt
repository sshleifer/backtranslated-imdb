In fact, I caught an advertisement for JAPAN SINKS in a Japanese magazine last year and wondered what the hell it was until I saw the movie trailer. It was then that I remembered that I had seen the English translation of the Sakyo Komatsu novel some years ago. I got it, and it was very good as well as frighteningly realistic. It's enough to make the reader afraid to hear any news about earthquakes in Japan. <br /> <br /> Now, I read the book, and I saw this version of the 2006 film (the first film came out in 1973). And you know what? I thought the movie was very good, even though there were big changes from the novel to the movie (but that's understandable). The story is simple - a major tectonic shift will cause Japan to sink within a year. Massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis stir the country as frantic efforts are made to evacuate as many people as possible. A scientist has a plan that could stop the shipwreck of the country and save what is left of the earth, but can it be implemented on time? I saw JAPAN SINKS at Otakon 2007, and although there were some problems with it - it got a little too long, and some of the character's moments were a little overdone - I was impressed anyway. The concept of an entire nation sinking into the sea has become terribly real, and the effects were some of the best I've ever seen, rivaling anything Hollywood has done. The movie also has no favorites with the main characters, with some not reaching the final credits. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was surprised by some of the negative comments made about this movie. Difference of opinion, I think. Personally, I liked it. And I read the original book.
