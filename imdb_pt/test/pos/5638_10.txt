This documentary is the most mesmerizing film I have seen in a long time. I must have had this for a whole day. The selected material included in the piece flows incredibly well and develops three characters that are impossible to forget. The different layers of these people strip to make a strangely touching movie about perseverance, loyalty and determination. These characters ended up surprisingly fascinating and the film is unforgettable.
