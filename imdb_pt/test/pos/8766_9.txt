Barry Kane is a factory worker. Suddenly, the sabotage happens at the factory and a fire starts. Your best friend is dead. They accuse him of acting, but Kane knows it was a man named Fry who was there. He becomes a fugitive. will find this man named Fry. He is helped by a gentile blind man. He leaves his niece, the outdoors model Patricia Martin to take the man to a local blacksmith to have his handcuffs removed. They do not end there for the woman. I do not believe Barry and he wants to take him to the police. But soon he changes his mind about Barry and they discover another sabotage attempt that will happen soon. There is a group of anti-American fascists. And Frank Fry is a member of the group. Saboteur (1942) is another example of Alfred Hitchcock's failure to make a bad movie. Robert Cummings plays Barry Kane and he's very good at it. Priscilla Lane, with her good looks, plays Pat Martin. Also very good. Otto Kruger makes a great main villain as th leader. The fascist group, Charles Tobin. Norman Lloyd, still alive at age 94, plays Fry and makes a very convincing con man. Vaughan Glaser is the nicest character as the blind Philip Martin. The sequel to the ballroom is fantastic. And also the moments on the circus train. In the end, we're at the Statue of Liberty.
