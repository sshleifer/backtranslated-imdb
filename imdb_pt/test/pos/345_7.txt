Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a cult who lives in the desert and tries to resuscitate one of his men just to have a heart attack! He ends up dying on an operating table, and as a matter of revenge, his spirit takes on the body of the title character (Jill Jacobson), who then proceeds hacking and slashing until his fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demon. <br /> <br /> Although I know enough about the directors' filmography to know that it basically consists of a total shock, "Nurse Sherri" is not that bad. Of course, of course this was very low budget, but all I found notoriously extravagant about this were the visual effects. The acting is not as bad as one might expect. <br /> <br /> There are two different versions available on DVD. A much more sex-oriented version with abundant amounts of T & A is the original cut, with vignettes as fun as the victim and their love interest sharing their "stranger sex" moments, including one involving fellatio during a talk in college The film would then be re-cut to the theatrical version with the elements of horror emphasized with more force. Some scenes are discarded with new ones (with Stevens, the role played by J.C. Wells, expanded). The most memorable sequence of films in this cut is a scene in a casting and works very well. This cut of the film is more interesting overall; I would recommend that the viewer see them and compare them. <br /> <br /> Both versions reached their rhythm in the final third, and benefited from a wonderful performance of stealing the scene of Bill Roy as the crazed Reanhauer, and a moody climax set in a graveyard (though in the truth filmed in Adamsons' backyard!). Marilyn Joi also deserves to be mentioned as the cute nurse who is drawn to football player Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden), who lost her eyes in a car crash and who, incidentally, is key to settling the story with her knowledge of the rituals of voodoo. The film also makes fun use of music from Harry Lubins' personal collection, including compositions for TV series such as' One Step Beyond 'and' The Outer Limits'. <br /> <br /> "Nurse Sherri" (known for more alternative titles (including "Beyond the Living" and "Hospital of Terror") than any other Adamson movie) is actually a pretty fun low budget fare . I ended up having fun watching. <br /> <br /> 7/10
