One of his lesser-known films, many horror fans have not yet been able to get this offer from Dario Argento, which is a shame. It is mostly underestimated due to the fact that really few people have seen it. The film features Argento Gore grade A, with its usual close-ups set in wild rock scores. While it is true that this script is not very complex, it is not as bad as other entries in its genre, or your own personal resume. <br /> <br /> This film symbolizes more the 'dread'. which he likes to portray in his films by his own admission. Worth a good look any night.
