It bears the same resemblance to Dean Koontz's novel that Jessica Simpson does with a rocket scientist. If you read the book, I suggest you put it as far away from your mind as possible before watching the movie. Watchers is his typical "Boy meets dog, dog ends up being super- intelligent laboratory lab experiment, dog and boy are chased by a super-intelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by the same lab, and, oh yes, did I mention suspicious government agents chasing the monster chasing the dog? "movie. <br /> <br /> Corey Haim is the boy, Barbara Williams is his mother, Michael Ironside is one of the evil government guys, and Sandy the dog is, well, the dog (called Furface here; The monstrous effects are ridiculously extravagant, much of the dialogue is laughable, the script rarely makes sense or is believable - a good example is the unquestioned acceptance of the dog's intelligence by the character Haim, as if every Fido off the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no! Hmm, it has to be the dog, right? Haim's performance is enthusiastic, but unstable because it carries the stupid dialogue with Ironside has been the highlight of many bad movies, and this is no exception. It easily gives the best performance of the film, although I have to add that the dog (who is a good actor in himself!). Comes second. <br /> <br /> In all, a atrocious silent film, and yet. And I even watched it three times in a week. And yet I can not help liking it. Hey, what can I say, I like junk - and Michael Ironside (not that I have proven Michael Ironside - I'm sure there are laws against it). But any movie that makes me laugh so hard (yes, even unintentionally) can not be all bad. Chalk a guilty pleasure, a movie "yes, I know it's insultingly stupid, but I like it anyway." <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to evaluate this. On a normal scale, I am forced to give a D-, but on my own cheese scale, it is pushed to an A-. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know. I'm weird like that.
