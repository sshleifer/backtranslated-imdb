The feature of the early creatures of the 80s is a long, abandoned gold mine that some intrepid prospectors are determined to check. Of course, they do not find gold down there, but a hungry monster that glides for prey. <br /> <br /> Although I have to be honest and admit that I found it tedious at first (I personally prefer the theme similarly "The Boogens"), it actually grew on me as it did together. Now the characters are not very interesting nor are the actors. The closest of an interesting character is Morgan, played by Keith Hurt. Anyway, the female protagonist Terri Berland is very pretty and Rolf Theison makes her domineering idiot a person easy to hate. The writer interpreted by the effects man Mark Sawicki wears off quickly. <br /> <br /> It starts in a comfortably predictable way, with a night set in which two victims are accused of making a good start. The monster itself is intriguing by its design (as you can imagine, it is revealed a little at a time by the end of the game) and for being the product of stop motion animation when this process was no longer used much. Director Melanie Anne Phillips (director under the pseudonym of David Michael Hillman) and the crew deserve some credit for their atmosphere creation. They manage to make the film look rather claustrophobic and gloomy, and its use of lighting works well. The movie builds in intensity for a very good ending. Suffice it to say that they do the best they can on their low budget. <br /> <br /> A small and obscure item that is worth looking for tough terror fans. <br /> <br /> 7/10
