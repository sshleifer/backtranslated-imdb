After all, I really like this movie. Pauley Shore is invariably funny, and here is no exception. He is excellent at playing the weirdo with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> His performance, though nothing out of the ordinary for him, is so good that it seems to improve the performance of other cast members. Maybe that's because he's the kind of guy that's easy to beat. The clich√©s about country life in this movie are hilarious and the way Shore is "city kid", Crawl is so different from the way of life, it's funny too, but it's not just him it is a fish out of water; the comedy also comes from the fact that for any "ordinary" person or person, Crawl is a weird person's nightmare. That's why this movie works so well: we love the Crawl, it's a breath of fresh air, but we can also sympathize with the Warners. He is a hell of a culture shock. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is classic Pauley Shore, so there is not much brainpower needed to enjoy the movie, take advantage of it, and even there is a "never judge a book by the cover" moral type here in some place. Not bad, not bad at all.
