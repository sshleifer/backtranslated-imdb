Well, this movie showed up on a work day at 10pm. The cute actress who played Billy first caught my eye and after the first 15 minutes I was held captive on my television until the end. You have you at the end of your seat, then play clever comedy pieces during the most tense sequences. <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that the story was not substantial enough to fill an hour and a half of film. , causing certain sequences to drag a bit. However, it was still a lot of fun, and I recommended it to all my co-workers the next day.
