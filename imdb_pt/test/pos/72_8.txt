Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and this is not bad! Actually, it's a lot of fun. In fact, it's a fascinating study about trying to manipulate the personas of a star. <br /> <br /> To break Julie's "two-shoe mold", she plays an actress of German Spies / Hall of English. She subsequently went on to take her top off in the S.O.B. and play a drag queen on Victor Victoria and other not-so-good girls usually under the direction of husband Blake Edward. <br /> <br /> The film is admittedly problematic. It's hard to feel her personality because she's a German spy. We want to love Julie, but she's on the wrong side of the law. That's probably why this movie failed. Julie as a German spy? Our Mary Poppins? our Maria Van Trapp suddenly a German spy? <br /> <br /> The novel seems to happen overnight and comes from nowhere. But it does not matter, it's a musical and there's Jullie. Oh, and did I mention that the handsome Rock Hudson is also involved? <br /> <br /> Julie gives a wonderful performance that any musical comedy fan should not miss. Great WW 1 Mancini songs and nice songs. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie has holes and sometimes it does not seem logical. For example, why Julie and her uncle are suddenly chased by the Germans when a minute ago she was spying on them. <br /> <br /> But on another note, who cares? The musical numbers are fun and exciting. The extraordinarily luxurious costumes and scenery. Cinematography is right on the mark. <br /> <br /> There are the annoying detective idiots that Blake Edwards puts on all his movies. (Yawning) <br /> <br /> But Julie is desperately trying to change her image. (You can imagine dinner with Blake and Julie - Julie: "Blake, we need to change my image" Blake: "I'll make you a German spy, so let's take off our clothes in another movie and then play a transvestite on "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> to Star!
