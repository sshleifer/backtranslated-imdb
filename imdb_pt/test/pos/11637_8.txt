(*** Small Spoilers ***) If there's anything in the world of silent clowns that intrigues me, it's that Charley Chase never got his well-deserved "hit" in the movies. Well, maybe it's not so strange, actually, since he's never starred in any feature film. But when I think about it, such an explanation makes it all more mysterious - why the hell did Chase not get any offer to lead the resources? One explanation is that his character, however amusing, was simply too realistic to suit a longer story; without the burlesque elements that Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Langdon and other comedians possessed, it can be assumed that the comedy he made and that worked so well for twenty minutes would become repetitive after a few more rolls. I did not buy this, however, since the construction of Chase's gag is magnificent and I could, I think, at best, keep the viewers' interest alone for a longer period; at least I'm tempted to think so when MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE does the show. Mr. Moose is not extraordinary, and Mrs. Moose is not a "classic beauty"; It has the truly largest front teeth of any human being on the planet, and it has a remarkably large nose. Both undergo plastic surgery without the knowledge of each other, and when they meet accidentally shortly after, he does not recognize his wife and she does not recognize the husband. A series of hilarious misunderstandings begin, with many clever jokes all the way. I do not think I'll reveal anything else, to make viewing more enjoyable for you. Because if you are a fan of silent comedies, or even if you are not, MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE offers so many memorable moments in such a short time that I would consider it a shame not to see it; silly indeed but no less extremely funny.
