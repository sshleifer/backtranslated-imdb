If you asked me to choose the best movies of all time, this movie would be on a short list along with 1951 Streetcar Named Desire. I imagine I'll find out some others who qualify but Kramer vs. Kramer is a great exercise in naturalism. So it's a very satisfying experience at this level: just watch the wonderful and riveting performances of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and son Justin Henry in particular. One of the best children's performances of all time. <br /> <br /> But I also find it very satisfying to watch, because it's such an engrossing story - it always makes me forget my own problems. It has an excellent narrative drive. Once you put Kramer against Kramer, Alice Kramer leaves Ted to juggle work and his young son, telling him nothing more than she needs to figure out - you keep watching to know that all is well for them. And even knowing how things end, every moment of the ride sounds so brilliantly true that it is a joy to see it happen again and again. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake - Kramer vs. Kramer is not light entertainment: it is a very realistic picture of the effects of divorce on everyone involved. <br /> <br /> 10/10. <br /> <br /> By one of the best scripts (born of conversations between Benton) and Hoffman, who was going through a divorce at the time) already written, executed and executed beautifully and without fail. Not to mention the large and engaging story that it is. Simply put, a perfect movie.
