Fantastic series, one of my favorites (Miami Vice and Tour of Duty are the other two, and this series is up there with them). <br /> <br /> These guys are not wearing frilly stockings - they dress more like loggers. Everything about this series breathes an air of realism, artistic license or not. <br /> <br /> He paints an image of a Europe only slightly out of reach of paganism, as most of the locals still have their local deities, and there are satan worshiping nuns, and wizards, witches and wizards casting spells. <br /> <br /> However, what comes to the fore most is that it is a series of your time. Instead of the fifties version, which was a lament against centralized government and the persecutions of the McCarthy era, this series is fully grounded in the 1980s in the Thatcherist desolation, and has a strong environmentalist lean. Robin's protector is a worshiper of nature called Hern The Hunter, who often appears using the head of a deer, and is a personification of The Green Man, an alternate version of Osiris (the Egyptian god of vegetation and resurrection - It is interesting to note that Robin In The Hood is not a person, but a concept, when the old is dead, a new one is invoked telepathically by Hern - the person may die, but Robin In The Hood will live forever, hence the concept of resurrection ). <br /> <br /> The music and the score are really remarkable, and performed by the Irish line up, Clannad. Watching it, I could not help but think about how authentic Anglo-Saxon folk music would have been. :-) <br /> <br /> All of this is beautifully filmed in the lush forests of Wales, which pass through The New Forrest. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that in the opening episodes of both series, the actors have to overcome their own skepsis, and convince themselves that this is really a serious job. After that, they come in and the acting is great! Judi Trott makes a beautiful, fragile redhead Marion, Phil Rose as the corpulent and really kind Friar Tuck, Ray Winstone as the volatile and passionate Scarlet, Clive Mantle as the giant shepard Little John, Peter Llewellyn Williams as little friend of Little John and colleague shepard, and Mark Ryan as the former Hashashin / Assassin Nazir - all of them giving great performances. The bad guys are also great, Nicholas Grace as the bulging-eyed sheriff of Nottingham, and his aristocratic and clumsy helper (and Robin's half-brother, as it turns out) Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne. Very cool is also the stylist Richard O'Brien, like the evil Lord Owen of the magician of Clun (Olliver Cotton) Gulnar (he appears near the end of the first series and later in the second). <br /> <br /> The Tithe Barn at Bradford on Avon represented the sheriff's castle. (Check out at bradfordonavon.co.uk for "places of interest".) So if you're in mythology, in the Middle Ages, in romanticism, do not waste your time on Xena or Hercules - this is the real thing, so get out and watch! <br /> Alex
