I was not surprised to read a comment from the director in the sense that she made this film as an antidote to all those "making of" the DVD, which certainly impressed me. I confess I have a "goal" drop, but I find this film very accessible and fun, and not even in a clever and self-conscious way, which is certainly a bit of what you expect in a movie. about cinema. It is very "French", as there are a lot of strange, but occasionally convincing, theories about how filmmaking (and even sexuality) "works," but since the principal is not interpreted (using an avatar), we remain with many choices (since I'm sure she's constantly contradicting herself). Apparently, Catherine Breillat is a specialist in hard-to-watch movies, but I'd definitely say he does not qualify. I liked the dialogue, the balance between the cinematic and the natural, the relationship between the director and his assistant and actor, and so on. Highly recommended.
