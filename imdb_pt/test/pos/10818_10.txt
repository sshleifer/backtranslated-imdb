I saw Bon Voyage two days ago and found an excellent production. The movie should entertain, and this happens! It simulates the style of the American comedies of the thirties, but Von's journey is more refined. Adjani and Depardieu are simply excellent in their roles. The plot is simple. The film begins with people involved in many situations that apparently should have nothing to do with each other. It's very funny how these situations connect during the movie. It's good to see a French movie with that kind of sense of humor. I think, mainly, a movie in which love is the main theme. Peter Coyote, as the German spy in France, once again shows himself to be an excellent actor as well.
