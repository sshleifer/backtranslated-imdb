You Are Alone is a beautiful, almost delicate, clever, simply written film with two complex and fascinating performances, and a twist of an ending that no one will see but will make you want to see the movie a second time. go back and catch up on all the clues you misinterpreted. <br /> <br /> The story about a high school girl drowning her depression and embarrassment working a few hours a week as an escort of "students" for $ 500 an hour, and the depressed neighbor who discovers her secret and hired her for an afternoon visit at a hotel in downtown New Haven, features breathtaking performances by Jessica Bohl as the girl, and Richard Brundage as her neighbor. <br /> <br /> Bohl as Daphne gives an innovative performance on par with Maggie Gyllenhaal at the Bureau. She captures the anguish of a teenager growing in her own skin, and when she talks about being always in control, you begin to realize that she is not in control but in danger of going over the bottom of the well, which I think she makes. <br /> <br /> Brundage as Buddy is depressed, angry, heartbroken, a man's shell. But it's not until the film's startling conclusion that you fully understand your pain. <br /> <br /> After a brief opening segment, it will attract most independent film lovers, and will have the religious right running towards it. on the way out, we are taken to the hotel room. At first you are not sure about these people, or about the style of making movies. Shaky, annoying ... like the characters. Until you realize their story, told in short flashbacks. They are confrontational at first for a reason, and so is the camera. But as they open up, as the story unfolds, so does the camera. And, I do not know, 20 minutes or so, you find yourself unable to take your eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> Have just watched the world premiere at the Brooklyn Film Fest - - where the director asked the audience if anyone expected the end and not a person answered yes? I almost wished the movie was already on video so I could watch it again. Because now thinking about some of the conversations in the movie, particularly a very frank dialogue about fantasy and climax, I really thought things were going in a very different direction. But now I realize that much of their conversation meant something completely different from what I imagined. I need to see this again !!! But as obscure and sexual as the conversation is, to say the least, I found myself laughing more than I could expect in some of his frankness, which definitely falls into "the things we think but lacks the courage to say out loud "category. It's very blunt, especially when you realize that a lot of it has a completely different meaning. Some of them will make you uncomfortable, especially if you're watching. You're alone with a partner. Do you definitely have something to talk about? maybe discuss about ?? after. Maybe you should come with a warning: you MUST be alone to watch! The music is incredible. I would have come home and bought the soundtrack from my favorite online music store if I could. The movie looks as good as anything filmed in the movie. After sorting director Gorman Bechard was asked what kind of process he used to make digital footage look so good. His answer: none. They could not afford it. <br /> <br /> I have to give Bechard credit. I'm a big fan of their two shorts, The Pretty Girl and Objects in the Mirror, but even they could not have prepared me for the intricacies and surprises of this movie. <br /> <br /> For all involved: brave.
