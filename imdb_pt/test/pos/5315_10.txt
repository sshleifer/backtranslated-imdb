I liked it, enjoyed it, will see this movie again, because I am sure there are subtleties that I missed. Wonderfully released, no performance or clich√© performance or plot. Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple Relationships, how those involved in each relationship are connected (or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each occupies in the relationship, in life, and how they deal with Confusion, Joy, Hurt and Disappointment to discover that things are not what they perceived. At first I thought there were "observers" and "observed", but this is not the case, we are all connected in some way and our perceived separation is only in small degrees. I recommend the movie to everyone, especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and any other person who breathes.
