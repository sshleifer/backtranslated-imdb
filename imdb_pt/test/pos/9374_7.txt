I did not read the source, Richard Brooks's novel "The Brick Foxhole," which I hope is not as unfortunate as its title, but I understand that the original villain was a homophobe and not an anti-Semitic. (And to be honest, Sam Levene is written like a gay guy picking up a drunken soldier.) But, okay, you have to follow the flow. Consider 1947. Not even anti-Semitism has been dealt with on the screen yet. Many of those responsible for contemporary films were Jews, but anti-Semitism had been banned for years because it was considered unpleasant. So we can hardly blame the producers of this movie for not leaving the victim homosexual. Now this is REALLY nasty - and in addition, there may have been many among the public cheering for Robert Ryan to get away with it. We are not free from prejudice, but we have come a long way since 1947. Seeing this again for the first time in years, I was struck by the rather slow pace of the first half of the year. the film, the many scenes of two people talking, the shadows, the time that passes between the question and the answer, the uninspired edition. But I could live with that because of the subject of the movie and because of some other things. <br /> <br /> One of the things that holds me glued to the events as they unfold so deliberately is the performance of Robert Ryan. The guy does a splendid job. At times he may appear attentive, cheerfully subordinate and helpful to the police - "I can help anyway, sir." Then, alone or with another soldier, boiling hatred rises to the top, not so much by what he says, but by the way he LOOKS. That frown, that piercing look, those dark eyes shining. Wow. <br /> <br /> The film was very hot because of Robert Young's speech about the murder of his grandfather. That does not bother me at all, though I do not think Dmytryk needed Young to stick his face in the camera while talking about "MICKS and PAPISTAS". Still, given the context, it is one of the film's most shocking moments. Part of its impact is due to Young's almost casual delivery, and part of it is due to the fact that the message has not been heard on the screen before. <br /> <br /> Another feature of the film that turns it almost into the surreal is the character Paul Kelly and his relationship with the prostitute Gloria Grahame. Holy Guacamole, what elliptical talk to Kelly is given. "Do you know what I told you?" "All these things I just told you?" "They're all lies." Your character perfectly crosses the pathos with the shiver. It is impossible to know what to do with it. It adds practically nothing to the plot, but the film would be much smaller without its presence. <br /> <br /> It's a dark and somber movie. His people live in the dark. And there's murder on foot. Hardly anyone screams or shouts. The horror that these men have experienced and that some of them still carry with them as malaria seems just beneath the surface. <br /> <br /> See if you have a chance.
