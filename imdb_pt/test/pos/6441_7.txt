This is a movie I watched when I was young and never forgot. It's certainly not the best movie of all time, but there's something very special about which I can not put my finger on. I love it. I'm the kind of person who likes everything that is explained to me, and that's the reason this movie drives me crazy. <br /> <br /> Exactly what / who is that mysterious witch and what is your relationship with Tom? Why and how he became a baby of water ... why was he created on earth? These are questions like these that are just eating for me! I thought if I read the book I would have answers, but I just read an article that the book from which this story is "based" is very different. So I guess I'll never know what the writer was thinking! <br /> <br /> I still love this movie and I recently watched with my two year old niece. She loves it too, though she insists on calling him "Baby Water" for reasons unknown to me. She loves the part where he jumps in the water and then says "I'm all clean". (You have to understand that my niece is the cleanest 2 year old in the world!) We've watched that scene several times. <br /> <br /> I'm so happy that we can enjoy this movie together! There should be more movies like that. (But what about the gay seahorse? !!)
