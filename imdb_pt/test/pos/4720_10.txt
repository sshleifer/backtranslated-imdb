Beyond Rangoon is one of the most exciting and intense movies of all time. Superbly directed by John Boorman, and intensely represented by Patricia Arquette, this film can easily be called one of the best films of the 1990s. History and vivid characters capture the audience from the opening and never let go. After seeing the movie, the viewer will never be able to forget "Beyond Rangoon". The movie made little money at the box office, and is little known, but it should be high profile. Noting this, you can say that it was meant to be seen by a large audience. It is a very important and moving film, and must be seen by all. <br /> <br />
