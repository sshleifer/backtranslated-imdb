I think it was Fran√ßois Truffaut who said that the best films involve the joy of making movies or the agony of making movies. This movie is definitely of the first type. Tromeo and Juliet are happy to watch from start to finish. The zany zany feeding this Shakespearean shenanigan is infectious. I do not think I've laughed so much since I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail. That's nice!
