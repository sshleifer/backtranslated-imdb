Meatballs work in conversations like no other movie. Especially during the summer. Be the song about the CITs (Counselors In Training) or the cut-downs or Rudy the Rabbit's inspirational speech or It Just Does not Matter ... it pops up! Poor Mickey / Morty, who knows where he'd wake up next! Such a great portrait of the seventies and a cultural icon for my generation of those who understand that non-PC is really funny no matter who you are! Wheels and Spaz are the favorites, as is the hot dog eat contest with the famous line "what ..? No mustard?" How many times I repeated that phrase and I was the only one laughing! Thanks to writers, actors and directors! Applause, applause!
