My dad took me to see this movie when it was released in 1976. I was just a kid and it scared me. So much so that I had to leave the theater during a particularly claustrophobic tunnel scene as it was too intense for me !!! I went home to my family's safety. I watched the movie the entire time I got older and enjoyed it. Shame about men in monster costumes, though. If you ignore the low price of production and delve deeper, you'll find Cushing's excellent performance, an impressive opening score, a beautiful photograph, and the ever-reliable Mr.Douglas McClure, my childhood hero! British police guarding the White House in the end! Mama bang bang cave woman! Monsters with beaks! Actors in monster costumes sliding into wires! That has it all! Great.
