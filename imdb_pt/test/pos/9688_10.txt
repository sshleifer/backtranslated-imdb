This movie had to be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my entire life. I laughed so hard I almost threw up. After the movie was made I laughed for about an hour just thinking about the last seen in the movie. It's definitely 100 times better than the first Jackass movie. I loved seeing them all together again. If you are scrupulous or do not like obscene childish humor you will not like this movie. If you can come in with an open mind and do not take it so seriously then you will laugh. Your incredible nobody was killed in this movie. Each one seen in this movie is so unique and so different from the other that you do not know what to expect. <br /> <br /> Mike Webber
