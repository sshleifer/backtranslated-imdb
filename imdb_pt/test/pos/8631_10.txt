Although copies of this movie are hard to find, if you can find it, buy it! !!! I believe this was in addition to In The Navy, the only musical from Abbott and Costello. Although they have distorted the plot a bit, (I've never heard a version where the butcher goes with it), you still enjoy the antics of the idiot but adorable Jack, and the greedy butcher, Mr. Dinklepuss. Slightly reminiscent of DuBarry Was a Lady, this noisy movie will make you roll on the floor - only to get up and dance while Lou Costello sings. (I do not know why they did not do this in other movies.)
