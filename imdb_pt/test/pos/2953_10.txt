In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues to make the documentary, uncovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of the word, in which a sympathetic but ignorant narrator unintentionally privileges the audience. The narrative, therefore, has a double plot, the history of the documentary and the history of the documentary filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for obstinately pursuing his story, but for risking his whole notion. of their parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama. Although Hollywood stuff hides in the details, Doug Block treats history as if it were everyday life. For those of us who have always speculated about the life of our parents before we came on the scene (or after we arrived, but while we were too selfish to realize they had a life independent of ourselves), 51 Birch Street gives a fair warning Wonderful things there at home, but beware if you choose to go there. <br /> <br /> But caution is for the audience to wander slowly into the details of their parents' past. Not a warning to those who had a glimpse of the life of Block's parents. The film is a marvel to make the mother come alive as a vibrant, passionate but introspective person who makes her own conscious decisions during the 1950s. The filmmaker's success is to make viewers really see the young woman behind father and grandfather. We all know that our parents were already young and vigorous, but at 51 Birch Street, the mother is. The father who was distant while the filmmaker and his sister were growing ultimately remains distant in the film, but this is due more to his own illusory nature than to his portrait. This biography that turned autobiography is dramatic, intense and unforgettable, sure to send viewers rushing to a closer look at their own family albums, but more hesitant to look at the backs of these photographs.
