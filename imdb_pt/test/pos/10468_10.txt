I do not know if this movie reaches my heart the way it does because of the feelings of friendship, love, closeness to others or the heat of this transformation that Babette's cooking creates, but when the party starts and for the rest of the film, I choke often. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a well-being movie, but without a hint of shit or easy sentimentality. Please note that the plot elements are discussed. Feast of Babette tells its story with moderation and care, and allows us to discover for ourselves the values ​​of grace and love. All we need to know is that Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) was a French refugee who was sheltered by two elderly sisters in a small community off the coast of Jutland. The sisters take what is left of their father's flock. He was a pastor of conviction who taught that salvation comes from self-denial. The sisters made their sacrifices for duty and faith. Those who still remain honor the teachings of the long-dead pastor and his spiritual guidance. Yet as they get older, the tiny community has become irritated and argumentative. The sisters do what they can. For the pastor's hundredth birthday, Babette wants to prepare dinner for the small group the sisters will invite. The sisters reluctantly agree, but when they see the supplies Babette has requested, they and their guests are restless. They are accustomed to the usual food of the dry, cooked cod community, and a soup made of bread, water, and some beer. Even though Babette over time has made improvements, what they are seeing now seems close to God's lack. At dinner there will also be a visitor, General Lorens Lowenhielm, who years earlier had chosen the ambition of his love for one of the sisters. <br /> <br /> What do we experience? There is the austerity of the faith of the elderly community and the houses of stone, swept by the wind in which they live. There is the candle-lit heat of the small, crowded dining room of the sisters. And then there is the transformative power of Babette's art as we watch her cook, we watch Erik, a boy helping her, serving and serving, and watching old parishioners, with the help of fine wines and fine cooking, gradually rediscovering their community and love and friendship. The general serves as our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they are eating. The general tells a story to his incomprehensible dinner companions, a story about a famous woman who was the exemplary chef at the famous Café Anglais in Paris. "... this woman, this head chef, had the ability to turn a dinner into a kind of love affair ... a love affair that made no distinction between bodily appetite and spiritual appetite." He is also being transformed into a man who will accept what he has become and yet will always know the value and love of what he has long chosen not to accept. An old couple kiss. Two old people remember past friendships. And Babette, who spent everything she had won in this dinner lottery, had the opportunity to be the artist who was once in France, an opportunity she accepted with love and friendship. <br /> <br /> Babette, now as poor as she when she arrived without money years before, will continue with the sisters. The general in a carriage with his aunt returns to his property. And the elderly guests leave the sisters' house to return to their own homes. They pause and look at the clear sky and the stars in the sky. They spontaneously join hands in a circle and dance and sing this hymn ... <br /> <br /> "The clock strikes and time passes, eternity is near, let us use this time to try to serve the Lord with heart and that our true home may find us, that our true home may find us. "They smile at each other. All has been reconciled. <br /> <br /> Babette's party is a wonderful film, full of contained emotions, tacit understandings, wisdom ... and of course a meal that will leave you with a grunting stomach as you leave the theater. If you win the lottery to be able to pay what Babette has created and have her skill and artistic talent, here's what she served: Potage à la Tortue (a rich tortoise soup) served with sherry amontillado Blinis Demidoff au Caviar, served with Veuve Clicquot Cailles en Sarcophage champagne with Perigourdine Sauce (boneless quail stuffed with foie gras and truffle in puff pastry with truffle sauce enriched with Madeira), served with Clos de Vougeot, Burgundy Fine Salade Cheese and fresh fruit Baba au Rhum with fruit glacee and fresh figs Coffee and a good cognac
