On its surface, this is one of the most classic action / comedy / romance movies I've seen in a long time, reminding me of delightful old "Saturday afternoon" movies that had the right balance of unexpected twists and turns, timed humor and integrated action. In addition, however, there is our knowledge of the context of this film. It has the same elements as "Casablanca" but is defined shortly before many of the characters truly understood the seriousness of what was happening to their country (and the world) and the consequences of some of their own behaviors. This adds a strong note of irony to humor (we feel that one of the female characters has a radical change of hairstyle in her future). This is a movie that you will not regret watching.
