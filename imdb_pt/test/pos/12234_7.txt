Now I like Victor Herbert. And I like Mary Martin and Allan Jones. But it would have been nice to see a true biography of Victor Herbert. Walter Connolly as Herbert has a decent resemblance to him in his later years <br /> <br /> Jones and Martin sing beautifully though. Herbert's music is just there to adorn the plot about these two musical artists. John Ramsay, of Jones, is a fragile character, much like Gaylord Ravenal on Showboat, which Jones also played. <br /> <br /> As for Mary Martin, it's a mystery why she never had a good career in Hollywood. She made films with Bing Crosby and Dick Powell as well as this one. She performed well, but the film's audience did not take it. The best musical moment of the film is Jones and Martin in a duet of Thine Alone. The recordings I have of the song are individual and written in a duet. There's also a nice scene with Jones and Martin riding their bikes by swapping songs from Herbert as they walk. <br /> <br /> The real Victor Herbert with his womanizer and his Irish patriot past and his music training in Germany where he developed a love for all things German would have been a fascinating study. He was also a virtuoso cellist before devoting himself full-time to composition. I have to make a strong exception to the reviewer who said Cuddles Sakall would have been a good Victor Herbert. Sakall as Irish, HELLO. <br /> <br /> Good movie, but the true Vic would have been much better.
