I was curious to know the name of the Tuscan village where the filming in Italy were made. I know the name of the villa: Villa San Girolamo, however, I would like to know the exact location in Tuscany. Cinematography is excellent and it would be wonderful to visit this area. I would also be interested to know what the location of the desert shooting is as well. I travel a lot through Europe and Africa and would be interested in visiting the areas that the book and the cinema were. Please email me with any information on the websites that anyone can have. We would be very grateful. And if anyone knows if the village in Tuscany is still habitable, that would be amazing too. I look forward to any information and thank you in advance for your time.
