Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, absolved from active duty, is doing his part by the war effort producing prose snippets for some branch of government propaganda in Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Thomas is portrayed as a free thinker who believes in free married love. for a woman with an equally demanding artistic tendency and also with a penchant for extramarital affair. Thomas writing and reciting his poetry in systematic household chaos everywhere becomes a little pragmatic in the end, resting uncomfortably in his connections with society and attracting a war veteran who shot at his house and married the woman he had. The true story of this film is the love of two women, one (Keira Knightley) whose first love was Thomas (Matthew Rhys), the second (Sienna Miller) who is Thomas's Wife. Sometimes it resembles The Singing Detective, as on very good television, with slightly ominous tones placed upon scenes of absurd surreal camp.
