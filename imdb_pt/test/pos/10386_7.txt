First, the positives: Great job in portraying urban landscapes to suit the mood of the movie. Some of the shots could be paintings by De Chirico. Sophie Marceau, beautiful. <br /> <br /> The negatives: the stories are hard to believe. Unreal, one-dimensional characters stand out and pose 100% of the time, as if they were on some kind of walkway. This is not Antonioni from his previous films, much better nor the Wenders we all know and appreciate. Malkovich is overweight in this movie.
