There have been several books that have cited this as the oldest gay cinema. I do not really see this as anything gay in the homosexual sense, but then see two men dancing in what has to be the world's first musical has its attraction. <br /> <br /> There have been several previous comments about this film, ruling out any homosexual connotations. As for those who are quick to reject this movie as being just silly and an experiment done late night after many drinks ... Well I've heard this story before. <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting, and if people want to consider it the first gay film, so be it. Better than the depressing Anders 1919 Andern die.
