I am from the city of Phoenix and the first time I saw this movie and read the book just confirmed the stories I had heard all my life. I asked my grandfather about the crowd and he told me that when he returned from fighting in the Pacific theater, he started a CPA company that is known as the largest in the Columbus area. when he was just beginning, was invited by the mob to do a financial job for them, but he said he declined gently. Even when the FBI and Army arrived in Phoenix and cleared the place, my grandfather did not take it lightly when my mother, aunt or uncle crossed the river, but I assure you that this is all over now. downtown Phoenix is ​​in need of restoration and has favelas in court, where all OCCASIONALLY ACTIVE shooting occurs in people of low socioeconomic status who are irritated, uneducated, and the Phoenix-eagle bridge on 14th Street was closed for a solid period of 15 years old and replaced by a new bridge from 13th street, but on the fair side of the city of Phoenix in summerville rd. It is very picturesque and the scenery is depressing. Another incident I was told by my high school's best friend's family lives on a hwy 165 site called Holy Trinity, Alabama, which is about 28 years old. minutes outside of Columbus, Georgia, my best friend in high school uncle was a man named Old Man Davis. Regardless of how the movie goes, the fact is there were 3 bosses and Old Davis was one of them ... you can even read about it in the original book. Legend has it that it was so cold that he went to downtown Phoenix to make a deal with a man, but apparently the man gave up the deal right in front of Old Davis, so Old Davis began to take a sawed-off shotgun out of his coat and shoot the man in the chest in the middle of the city by the court. they say he even walked off regardless because the mob had paid all the law enforcement officers in town so he had nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> Another incident is on a bridge that another friend of mine has a rent. house next door in downtown Phoenix. it's the same bridge that the mob killed and ejected a Negro, and you can even read that part of the book. I also like to like in many city of Columbus and Phoenix, civilians were invited to be extras in the movie. when patterson's friend is murdered and brought to trial and proven guilty in front of the judge, but still released, well, the judge is my father's partner at his law firm in columbus, which unfortunately is deceased.
