This is a truly great and beautiful film. The underlying theme of this film is the innocent child (Heather Graham as Joline) struggling to make their na√Øve wishes of how the world must make sense while being ceaselessly defeated by the real world. It's not an unfortunate movie, though - just the opposite. It's a funny movie with a sad side, but just thinking about the movie makes me feel so happy. Near the beginning of the movie, Joline, beautiful and vulnerable, confronts a drug addict who tries to break into her friend's car. She argues with him, persuades him to seek help, and gives him $ 30 as a start. At the end of the movie, he reappears to pay her back, explains that he is off the drugs, doing well, and he thanks her. I can hear the cynics moaning. Of course, that would never happen. This movie does not happen in the real world. It happens in the world that we want to live. The sad part is to realize that we do not live there. The happy part is knowing there are people who want to do it.
