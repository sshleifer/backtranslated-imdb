Alfred Hitchcock's remake of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is generally not considered as good as the original, but for me it's one of the best films of all time. I prefer it in "Vertigo" and "Rear Window". Like "North By Northwest", it is the story of an ordinary man who is played unintentionally in the world of international intrigue. James Stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is mistaken for an international spy. He will do anything to ensure that he recovers his son and protects his family. <br /> <br /> Although the original is good for your time, it is difficult to observe by today's standards. The remake has excellent production quality, a captivating Doris Day and a very scary villain. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about renting this because you will want to see it several times.
