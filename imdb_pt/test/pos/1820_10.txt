This is the essence of the early eighties! The malls, the credit card machines, the food, the hair color punk, the soundtrack ... I'm in love with this movie. This sweet and clever teen movie from Romeo & Juliet is instantly addictive. <br /> <br /> Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. She actually employs her actors, such as John Hughes and Steven Soderberg, so check out -Joy of Sex- and -Real Genius. The Valley Girl soundtracks are great. If you can find a copy of the movie, buy it! It is out of print and very difficult to find.
