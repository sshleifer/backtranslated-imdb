When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought it was sweet - a family movie. For the rest of the night and in the next few days, clever moments and funny lines kept creeping back into my thoughts and our conversation ... There's a lot going on, classic elements of farce, good character acting, and Wendie Malick's story is just hysterical. Labeling this as a "feel-good" movie belies the intelligence and fun - it's smarter than it looks, just like "It's a wonderful life" is.
