In Moscow, the young couple Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) are deeply in love with each other. With World War II, Boris volunteers to join the army and is sent forward the day before Veronika's birthday, and they do not have a chance to say goodbye to each other. While waiting for news of Boris, Veronika is raped by Boris cousin Mark (A. Shvorin) and they get married. However, Veronika does not forget Boris, and still waiting for him. <br /> <br /> "Letyat zhuravli" is an impressive and moving novel in times of war. The direction is excellent and uses ellipses throughout history, including in the capital scene, when Veronika is raped by Mark. The camera work is amazing, with sophisticated planes and angles and long trips. Veronika's scenes in the middle of the tanks, or at the train station with many extras are impressive. The magnificent cinematography is highlighted by the restored image of the DVD. T. Samojlova has an extremely handsome face and a touching and sensitive performance. The speech in the last scene is another great example of an anti-war film. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "When the Storks Fly" ("When Flying the Stork")
