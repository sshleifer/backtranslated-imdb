I saw the movie in the movie at its launch, so I watched the VHS tape over the years, and while strolling through Target, I saw this DVD packaged with "Pushing Tin" for the exorbitant $ 5.50. It's something about this comedy that really struck me - as Kelsey Grammar, "with a tattoo on his thing", is an unorthodox commander who inherits a rusty submarine and a crew of crazy and misfits. He faces the best of the Navy - a Los Angeles Class nuclear attack submarine - and his former captain (Wm Macy). <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern plays the villain, Rip Torn the Admiral running the exercise - If you did not laugh hysterically during the "silent" segment with the cook, well, you have a kind of humor different from me. In the end, the driver says "DBF" without explanation - apparently it is some internal knowledge obtained from a former dive consultant - thanks to Google, I learned that with the advent of nuclear submarines, the old salts would use "DBF" pins - Diesel Boats Forever. A Navy friend said many of the technicalities are not correct, but who cares - it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I do not know, I think it takes a clairvoyant to know who will win in this exercise!
