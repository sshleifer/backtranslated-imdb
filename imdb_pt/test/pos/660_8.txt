I just saw Baby Blue Marine again after 30 years. I still find a nice and romantic movie that captures a time that was lost forever. The innocence and purity of a time that has long passed is captured with truth in this little film. The performance is above average and the brief appearance of Richard Gere as a war hero Raider Marine, takes a keen interest in any fan of film or fan of Gere. Jan-Micheal Vincent is at its peak and looks and acts like the "all American" kid. The late Bruno Kirby (who was hired as B. Kirby Jr.) has a fleshy role as "Pop", a rejecter of Marine Corp, who loves peace and dreams of returning to his wife. If you're looking for sex, drugs or rock and roll, this movie is not for you. If you are looking for action and adventure, the same applies. However, if you want to recapture a time in America's innocence, honor, romance and love, then Baby Blue Marine is a movie for you.
