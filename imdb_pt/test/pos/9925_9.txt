I consider myself a casual fan of Dario Argento. For every very good film he has (such as "Deep Red" and "Tenebre"), there seems to be one that is equally uninspired (his departure since "Opera" has tended to disappoint). Still, there is no denying that when he is at his best, there are few directors of terror who can dominate him. I consider "Opera" the best work of Argento. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the movie where all your trademarks are present. There are no well-developed characters and the plot makes very little sense when you begin to examine it. Still, think of Argento as a European equivalent of Brian DePalma - style is all that matters here, so much so that it becomes the substance. Typical for Argento, there are some beautifully filmed murder sequences. Those who are unfamiliar with man's work may perceive this as a sadistic observation (and may be, considering the misogyny of time many times of them), but it is actually true. Argento stages the murder with a complexity of eye-popping visuals. He really makes graphic violence an art form. In addition, his direction and the look of his films are impeccable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, "Opera" is one of its most frightening products. Argento is the only director to whom I feel rock music on the rise works well for horror sequences (when others try to do that, this sounds absurd). The acting varies, with Cristina Marsillach interpreting a young opera pretty and reasonably nice, but never particularly lively. The rest of the actors are professional and do the job, but again, with Argento, acting is never the point. Its beautiful colors, the terrifying violence and the general atmosphere of dream / nightmare. (9/10)
