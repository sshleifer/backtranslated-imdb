This is a classic sequel to Bleu, the equally excellent film, with Juliet Binouche as lead star; moreover, she's an apparition here in Rouge, just for a second at the end. But this movie, truly red and very sweet, though very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, played by the ever-great Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full and active life, only obscured by her traumatic relationships with her strange friend Mike, who is in England. By any chance, she befriends the old judge, who spends her time listening to the private telephone conversations of her neighbors. The story begins to weave even more, and we see him in court, being almost universally condemned for his hobby. She is the only one who feels sympathy for him, for his beautiful bitch Rita and her cubs, and for all the people who surround them. We also witnessed the dismemberment of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady, and their fight is also fueled by this phone scandal ... But the movie is not about that, really. It is mainly about loneliness and deep disagreements between people, far and near. When she sails to England on a ferry, with the lawyer as a passenger, as well as the previously mentioned Binoche who starred in Bleu, the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of the judge when he watches the news trying to think she survived. She did, and we still felt very heavy on the heart. Kislowski was able to trace a grand and subtle story about loneliness, incomprehension, secrets and pain. Deep, dark personal pain of those who are lost and alone. Bright movie.
