When I tuned in to my local PBS station last night to watch "The War That Made America." I was expecting an unsightly documentary, instead, I had a very good and believable reconstitution of the major events of the time. Now I see the reasons for the American Revolution and the part that the Indian wars played. Larry Nehring is George Washington, and he's perfect for that part. The narrative for the camera, also works fantastic. I look forward to next week to see the rest. It's good to see PBS actually using the HD format to bring the 1700 directly into our living room. <br /> <br /> I hope Larry Nehring will be seen more in the future, since he is a talented actor.
