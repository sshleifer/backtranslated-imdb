This is a very well done story with beautiful music, lots of dancing, lots of sister / younger sister interaction (almost all positive), and many wishes granted. There are funny moments that older kids and adults will like, like when King Randolph exclaims, "They're just SHOES, are not they?" And tender moments like when Princess Genevieve comforts her younger sister, Lacey, after a mistake. <br /> <br /> The animation may not be as good as Disney, but it's still very good. Facial expressions have nuances, particularly for Genevieve, King Randolph, Duchess Rowena and her maid, shoemaker Derek and little princess Lacey. My only complaint about the animation is in the dance sequences where the dancing princesses turn into absolute carbon copies of each other without the slightest detour - even the three younger ones perfectly copy the dance steps. I would have liked to see a little more individualism in dance, considering that these girls are not professional dancers or choir dancers. <br /> <br /> The resolution of the story is treated smartly to get rid of a villain without hurting her. There is some violence done to the guards in history, and the villain's monkey is cruel to other animals in history. <br /> <br /> My 4 year old daughter loves this movie and watched it several times, and I found it very acceptable for her to watch.
