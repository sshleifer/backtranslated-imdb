One of the best silent dramas I've seen. As dark and gloomy as anything the German Expressionists produced, but with performances that were quite underestimated and naturalistic for the day. No camera assault and no unintentional laughter due to histrionics waving wide arms. Sjostrom gave a convincing performance as the drunken, stingy and scary David Holm. Situated mainly at night in a dingy shanty slum, the film had a very claustrophobic feel, aided by the unobtrusive lighting and extensive use of the fellowship. There was a deep and typically Scandinavian feeling of despair and hopelessness in the narrative: the film begins with a rather gloomy present, and so we are told the story of David Holm in a series of flashbacks (and flashbacks within flashbacks - a rather complex story structure for 1921), where his character is offered countless chances of redemption, but he does not lead, and we know he will not take them because we saw him die drunk and miserable and say as ever in the gift. The penultimate scene is as somber as any I've seen in all the movies. <br /> <br /> Writing and direction are firm and intelligent, even by today's standards. In several cases, Sjostrom cleverly places the public to suspect something and then takes a surprise. The ending may not be a surprise to some viewers, but I have not seen it happen. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves a complete restoration and DVD release. Or even a low quality budget release. It just needs to be out there so people can see and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10, which is rounded to 10/10
