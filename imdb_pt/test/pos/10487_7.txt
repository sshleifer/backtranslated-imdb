PRICE OF HONOR aka PRICE OF POWER is an ambitious, overweight western melodrama about the action, which seeks to tell a version of the Old West from JFK's murder. In 1881, the president travels to Dallas and is shot from a window as he parades through the city in his carriage. Corrupt officials executed the murder and sent a humble slave to take the rap. Our hero, the serious but dull Giuliano Gemma, wants to unravel the conspiracy. An engaging story, audacious for its subject, but entertaining despite the scarcity of shooting action. The film is a 7 out of 10, despite the poor presentation of the DVD, which is overly dark with weak sound. Look for a good copy.
