Rendered in beautiful colors of water, Ponyo At The Cliff is definitely a sight to behold, vaguely remembering the trailer, which I did not find so impressive, I was surprised at how beautiful and detailed it was. This movie just flooded me with its purity. <br /> <br /> In the center there is a boy who comes in contact with a marine creature, and it is their relationship that carries the film. Miyazaki is a master both in creating memorable images and in showing young people interacting convincingly, with their little quirks intact. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that did not look good on me. It would be a euphemism to say that music during a particular scene "resembled" Ride Of The Valkyrians is a shame, because such a precious film like this can not take liberties and detract from a truly excellent scene. The antagonist and his background story also never interested me, but I think it served more as background than anything else. <br /> <br /> Anyway, great movie. The scenery of boat trip with all your pictures and sea creatures stood me thinking. Pure and magical. And yes, the hand art is more intimate than computer-animated, I'm really pumped to Princes And The Frog now.
