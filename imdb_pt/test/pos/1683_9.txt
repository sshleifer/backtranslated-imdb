I was amazed by the quality of this movie, particularly after seeing photos of the evil adult director - all 140 (?) Pounds of it! Really, a kid directing a movie about a boy. I look forward to seeing more of Luke Eberl's films. <br /> <br /> I thought that was a little too long. There was a lot of time spent showing Connor being unsuccessful (and unwilling) to make a move on Owen. Caleb did not try hard enough. Owen, being so young, could easily approach Caleb and later decided that it was not his preference. And Owen would still have learned the "valuable lesson" about corruption and politics. Instead, he did not give himself a fair chance to learn about his sexuality. And poor Caleb? Owen could have been a good influence. <br /> <br /> Although the film intends to show Owen as a hero who overcomes perverted corruption, I felt sad for Owen. He was offered the opportunity to have fun with Caleb, who was extraordinarily handsome. Owen did not have to agree with the political perversion offered. But he could have tried to amuse himself with Caleb and still walk away when he wanted to. It was clear that Owen was in charge - no one forced him to do anything he did not want to do. But he could have had more fun, and a very sweet boyfriend. <br /> <br /> I hope Luke makes more films where young and attractive characters have more fun.
