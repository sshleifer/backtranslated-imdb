Sometimes reading the user comments on the IMDB fills me with despair for the species. For anyone dismissing 2001: A Space Odyssey as "boring" they should have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of making movies. Finally, I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and empty - they understand their audience. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, those who fail to appreciate Kubrick's feat are still a minority. Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and absolute virtuosity that went into producing this epic. This is the movie that puts science in "science fiction," and its representation of space travel and the future of mankind remains unsurpassed to this day. He was so far ahead of his time that mankind has not yet attained. <br /> <br /> 2001 is essentially a technical film. The reason is slow, and full of minutae is because the goal was to realistically imagine the future of technology (and the past, in the impressive opening scenes). The film's greatest strength is in the details. Remember that when this movie was made, the man had not yet reached the moon ... but there it is in 2001, and that's just the beginning of the journey. To create such an incredibly detailed view of the future that 35 years later is still the best we have is unbelievable - I still can not figure out how some of the scenes were made. The only notable error of the film was the optimism with which it predicted the technological (and social) development of humanity. It's a shame that 2001 did not look like the 2001 movie, or Kubrick's. <br /> <br /> In addition to the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food. I thought about what it means to be human and where the human race is going. Yes, the ending is strange and difficult to understand - but that is the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke started the task of visualizing it, now it's up to the public to continue. There is no perfect resolution, no definite end point, because then the audience could stop thinking after the last roll. I know that's what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick will not let us down so lightly. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see that this movie is in IMDB's 100 films, and I just wish it were even bigger. Stanley Kubrick is one of the best filmmakers the world has ever known and in 2001, his best work. 10/10.
