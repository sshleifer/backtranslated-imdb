It is true that there are some foolish people who want to find them. They are not important, however. <br /> <br /> The main feature of this film is to watch veteran expert actors do their job. Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful and plays well the part of a strong woman, but who was injured. The same for Harrison Ford, who, for the ladies, is as silly as Kristin is beautiful to us boys. <br /> <br /> Their pain in the hands of their adulterous spouses unites them in an awkward way, but one in which they find support in each other. How they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity on the screen is why these artists are so sought after. The spectator can not help but feel what they feel, nor can he help to animate them when they are together. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are several action scenes involving corrupt and angry cops, but they only pepper it. a little, and are not a significant part of the movie. <br /> <br /> For the music lover, Dave Grusin provides an excellent Jazz-based background with trumpeter Terrence Blanchard. Like the actors, Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought-after music consultants in the film business. Blanchard shows why he is one of the main trumpeters of the scene. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie for lovers of courage, blood and blood. But for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside, we're witnessing a beautiful English actress with big expressive blue eyes who can act, like Harrison Ford, to the endless and gentle accompaniment of Dave Grusin and Terrence Blanchard. Move to watch with someone you love. Preferably in bed. <br /> <br /> I thought I deserved at least an 8.
