The French Babbette appears in the modest house of two Danish sisters wet, cold and alone. Fleeing the revolution in Paris, she seeks refuge in an obscure religious community on the wind-swept coast of Jutland. <br /> <br /> Without the knowledge of those who so generously welcome her, she is a great chef, a food artist. Babette delivers to her adoptive community through shared economy, productivity and faith. She only leaves when she wins the French lottery - 10,000 francs. She returns loaded with an exotic load, the result of a single meal celebrating the birthday of the sister's father, the founder of the community. <br /> <br /> This meal appears darkly in the minds of faithful deniers of pleasure, but its subtleties are translated by an elderly military officer who, as a young man in Paris, learned to appreciate the sensory experience unfolding here. The meal is the climax of the film, a communion of love in the transitory art of food - without affecting the art, love, and meaning of life.
