This interesting noir film features three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly remarkable. Demming, like the detective, is unfortunately not so good. He has no intelligence, strength, and cynical vision of a Bogart's world. If Humphrey had played that role, we might have had a classic. <br /> <br /> The pace, the location (a library) and the atmosphere are all good. But there are some holes in the plot. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the relentless (Nazi) organization he represents. However, after killing Blackmer by mistake, Sanders seems to feel no anxiety or remorse. Sanders then apprehends the library and its occupants using the ruse he and his men are detectives investigating the murder. However, Sanders' killer later attempts to kill Demming by firing at him (without a muffler), although many other detainees may be expected to hear and become frightened by the noise. Finally, Sanders' killer tries to kill Roberts, who discovered the truth, but when she faints, he inexplicably does not. <br /> <br /> What bothered me the most, however, was that the chance of a grand and unexpected conclusion was wasted. Throughout the film, Patrick is portrayed as a smart and tough sociopath, fearing nothing. However, in the end, she runs away from the last surviving Nazi, a brutal brute. When the cops find him, he killed her. And she ends up being just another weak, stereotypical victim. What should have happened is this: the cops find the Nazi thug, but he's dead. She cleverly killed him and then disappeared - to continue her evil ways.
