These prophetic words were uttered by William Holden (as a war reporter) to the beautiful Jennifer Jones (as an Eurasian physician), explaining his failed marriage on the beach. They begin a case, despite the huge odds of adultery and racial issues. In Hollywood of the 1950s, the interracial romance was allowed, but only with dire consequences in the end. Beautiful scenery from Hong Kong (although some beach scenes look like studio ones), a famous title song, poetic script, beautiful background music (by Alfred Newman), great costumes, exceptional performances especially Jones (directed by Henry King, who also did "The Song of Bernadette - 1943, an Oscar for Jones) still makes this novel a world-class novel.
