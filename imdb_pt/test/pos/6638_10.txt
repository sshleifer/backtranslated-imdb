This film offers one of the greatest experiences available to film goers. It is by no means a nice film, but it offers realities and emotions that the human mind has never wanted to address. It opens paths in how an individual thinks and then will change the person forever. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was in the classroom, and immediately after seeing it I had to skip my next class and walk around campus in order to redefine my body and mind. I felt devastated and somehow unreal, as if I did not exist. It was only a few months later that I was telling one of my friends about SHAME, and she asked, "Oh, that was when you got confused after seeing it, and ran at me talking really weird about it?" I did not even remember running or talking to someone while I was off that day, I was amazed. <br /> <br /> In terms of plot, it is the simple tale of a war-torn couple. The suffering is greater than that of the dead and to the end ... there are no words to complete the image that Bergman creates. It's like a horrible dream that makes you wake up, changing your own reality forever. This movie should be seen.
