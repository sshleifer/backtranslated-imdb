Definitely a "must see" for all movie noir fans. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a refined script and sharp, sharp direction, a prominent cast joins and functions as a well-oiled clock to produce a psychological crackerjack thriller. Wonderful characterizations articulate the film's powerful message of racial and religious tolerance. It is difficult and almost unfair to highlight a particular performance because there is no weak link throughout the company, but Robert Ryan, as the odious and violent white supremacist, is truly creepy. <br /> <br /> Making this movie in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage. Now, all those years later, in a time when contemporary films are dominated by ridiculous language with bare breasts, sinister performances and deafening soundtracks, it's refreshing to go back to the basics of quality film production with a screening such as "Crossfire ". <br /> <br /> Another low-budget preciousness from the Hollywood archives.
