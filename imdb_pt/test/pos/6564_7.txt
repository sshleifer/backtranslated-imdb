As is often the case when Manga is translated into live action, there is little lost in the translation. However, this remains a very entertaining film. The premise is unusual and is presented in the discreet and discreet style, so prevalent in Japanese films (ha!). The special effects are a bit of the '70s, but they contribute to the comic climate of the movie. I do not recommend this movie to everyone, but if you're familiar with (and liked) other Japanese horror movies like "Evil Dead's Trap," this movie will appeal to you.
