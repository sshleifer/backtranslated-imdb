Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) committed an indescribable crime, stabbing the retarded younger brother of his ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone). No one, let alone Leland himself, can explain why he did what he did, whether the act was premeditated or spontaneous, made out of hatred or love. At the detention center, Leland meets Pearl Madison. (Don Cheadle), a former writer who sees in Leland's case a second chance. But Pearl also wants to understand Leland's motivation and puts him under his care as a confidant in prison. <br /> <br /> The movie jumps from the past to the present several times, often allowing the past to act as a context. for the present and vice versa. The writer / director Matthew Ryan Hodge shows how Leland's crime - and the events that preceded it - affect the people in his life, from Becky to his family to Leland's mother (Lena Olin) and her father (Kevin Spacey) to Allen (Chris Klein)), a young man who is staying with Becky's family after the death of his own mother. <br /> <br /> The main asset of the film is Gosling, which is perfectly chosen as the 15 year old pseudopsychopath. Like Bartleby the Scrivener, Leland de Gosling hardly exists; he shows little emotion during the film, but instead his expressions belies an ocean of guilt, sadness, love and anger. <br /> <br /> Each major actor has perhaps offered his best work to date except Spacey (who is not exactly a newbie). A special accolade is due to Malone and Klein, two young artists who are better known for their cheerful comedy than for the heavy drama of this film. <br /> <br /> Another great benefit in terms of the story is that none of the characters is flawless; none of them are heroes to save the day. This is simply not a black-and-white movie.
