Battleship Potemkin is now the oldest movie I've seen and it's also the first silent film I've seen. I heard a lot of good things about this movie, so I took the tape home and watched it. When it was over, I thought it was a classic work of art. The story is based on the real life of the Russian Potemkin Naval Battle. You would not think about it, but some of them were sad and disgusting. How sad it is that the mother dies and the cart goes down the stairs and it is disgusting that they have to eat rotten meat with worms in it. <br /> <br /> Today is still considered one of the best silent and Russian films. always done. I think everyone should see (if they can find). You'll be amazed at how good it is. It is a must see classic. 5/5.
