I really liked this movie. If other people want to average around 5.0 / 10, that's their choice. I would give it 10/10. Sutherland's performance as a private detective is utterly impressive. The story is incredible, human, exciting, intelligent. Dialogue is good. The story may not be perfect, but anyway - the mood of the film is good enough to make up for it. Also, the ending is incredibly cool and your puzzle really comes back together. Either way I liked it. I also thought the lead actress performed very well. I'm not a big fan of detective movies, but this was very good, also because it does not give a damn about the conventions of the supernatural.
