So you're not a prize winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a movie that was silly? "The villain" and this could be at the top of the list. My husband says that "Jekyll and Hyde Together Again" is one of those films that if "you've been there and done that," you think that parody of cocaine from the 80's culture is a riot. I think the whole movie is fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes .... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch to enjoy. To say that the film does not follow the book would be true, but many really good films also take liberties with the published word. I recommend this movie to all the old stoners among us. We can be smarter now, but will we still recognize and laugh at many people we knew (ourselves?) In the old days.
