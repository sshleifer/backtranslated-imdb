... and my reasons are simple - there are so many great films presented and discussed here (most of them by their own directors and stars), so many clips of infamous moments in the history of the cinema of the 70s, and in fact a series of films that I still have to see, that it would not be fair to classify this work. By this logic, I should not have given notes to other documentary films like Martin Scorsese's Personal Journey through American Movies and My Voyage to Italy. But while these films were based on a man's movie vision, narrating most of the way, Richard LaGravanese and Ted Demmes's A Decade Under the Influence allow filmmakers and creators to speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> What makes 'Decade' worth at least one watch for moviegoers, or for anyone who likes the movies of the 60s and 70s in America, are the levels it goes, version three hours, not the theatrical version, about which I have no comment) much is covered. Among the interviews are Scorsese, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, Julie Christie, Jon Voight, Francis Ford Coppola, Paul Schrader, Pam Grier, Bruce Dern, Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Dennis Hopper and Robert Towne. flow of insight from start to finish. The way the clips and directors / actors appear, edited together in flashy and fast style, is also fascinating. <br /> <br /> The only comment I have about the documentary is that most of the information presented was reported in several books, such as Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, and although I have not seen the film version of this book I still have certainty that it would have covered many of the films and directors and incidents as here (in fact, the book of which is one of the best I have ever read.However, this documentary serves as something special for movie buffs and occasional movie goers of the future - they can look at this and learn not only about well-known images like Easy Rider, The Last Picture Show, Annie Hall, Coming Home, and others known as Scarecrow, Panic in Needle Park, The Landlord, Joe, they shoot horses and not in them.They can also learn about who influenced them (new waves from Europe and Asia), for whom they served as influences, and how the subject that created controversy after controversy still serves as intrigues gent. and chancy material for the contemporary crowd. ut!
