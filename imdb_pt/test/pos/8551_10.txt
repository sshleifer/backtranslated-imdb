I was involved to see many other people also liked this movie. I first watched it when I was in my teens and then again several times late at night a few times later. So, unfortunately, no more. I'm almost 49 years old and would like it to be available on DVD. Why not? The best role of Anthony Quinn, no one could have been more appropriate for the part or parts he plays - I mentioned this to other movie fans of similar age and, unfortunately, no one I know remembers. As the daughter of a generation that went through World War II and its aftermath (and I was deeply fascinated by what this generation faced) I think this film at the time gave me a wonderful cinematic insight into some of the moving issues of the day. For classic final scenes, this movie is a highlight.
