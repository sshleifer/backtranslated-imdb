The above summary is not really a hit against this movie, since the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar ("The Saint") encounters a lady in distress and comes to his aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was accused of taking a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time Paul Guilfoyle as "Pearly" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not particularly attractive mystery (none of them really is), Templar is extremely erudite and simply cool! George Sanders is once again the consummate sophisticated Briton and he manages to once again make an excellent B-series detective film. Nothing particularly special, but a familiar and cheerful product that will appeal to fans of the genre.
