The Man of the Golden Arm, Otto Preminger's controversial and panoramic drama, unfolds between the mental descriptions of its living and architectural occupants, in a rhythmic arrangement and whipping. Opening the film, a close-up of a Frankie bar looking out the window, already tells us the prominence that the subjective experience of the protagonist will understand. Pulling toward darker spaces, the movie is silent, as the local gangster's poker game isolates itself from daylight, comes on the scene, like Frankie Machine of Sinatra locked in a room in the celebrated scene. of their harrowing struggle to overcome their habit. As he delves into the shapes and faces of his urban haven, the visual traffic in The Man with the Golden Arm characterizes distorted psychological circumstances, forming an overwhelming environment, kept by the recurrent traced in close-ups of Frankie's eyes. <br /> <br /> The grace of this fire drama, as impressive as the gripping opening of the crane, shows the command over the perceptible world that studio production allows. Wonderfully dilapidated urban settlements define an independent place, without beginnings or ends, an indeterminate state, the kind that, in reality, hardly lasts as long as it seems before it is gentrified or leveled. The talent of certain performances, particularly of Robert Strauss as the wonderfully named underworld play boss Schwiefka and Arnold Stang as Frankie's faithful four-eyed dog, makes this surreal feature of fire pleasantly. The premise of Sinatra's drug addiction, Elmer Bernstein's infallible and infectious soundtrack, and Saul Bass's infamous, controversial opening sequence, centered on the animated paper cut by the arm of a heroin addict, asserted that in his day, The Man with the Golden Arm presses the cause of realism in the still reticent Hollywood. It is impressionistic and subjective, as I say, but your intention, your strength and your spirit are much closer to home. <br /> <br /> What absorbs me most in this movie is its gangster-like appearance. It has illegal card games, short cons, fights, weapons, double crosses, flaming characters, a femme fatale, an incredibly sexy missile, dark nightclubs and urban landscape, but it does more than explore environment for entertainment. Actually, it's the perfect environment, and genre, to tell this story, an urban neighborhood full of crimes, where it is very comfortable to escape through a bottle or two, or three, or four, or drugs, a transient dose that really only works to keep someone in the dark of any enlightenment and all the clear scenarios that the world could offer.
