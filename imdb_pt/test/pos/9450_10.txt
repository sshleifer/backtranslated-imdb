Well, I'm not a movie critic or something. But I have my opinion for this movie. I think the best in this movie was Amanda Bynes, she threw her roll to my look very well, I watched a lot of her movies This I liked the most! When you are watching this movie, you can relax, go down and watch. You do not have to search for a subtext or something. You just watch. The movie is really great. Maybe I liked actress, maybe the whole scenario, but I liked it. All the atmosphere that was created. In a moment I just felt like I was in that university, in that room. It's not another drama movie that's made to win Oscar, it's just good movie to watch in your free time.
