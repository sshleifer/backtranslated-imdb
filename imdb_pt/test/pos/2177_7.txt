This comedy "Fatty" Arbuckle, by Roscoe, is most remembered for introducing a young Buster Keaton, just released from the film Vaudeville, in his film debut. Buster has a substantial part in this movie and it's pretty funny overall. "The Butcher Boy" has lots of laughs and is an example of pure and old-fashioned glitter well done, although it seems to come from the brief era of two-cylinder comedies when filmmakers still imagined on segments of a reel as a matter of course. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie happens in a general store, with Arbuckle as the butcher boy's title. It's an excuse to undermine the many possibilities for a quick physical mood that a general store offers, and Arbuckle actually turns out to be a 300-pound acrobat, demonstrating subtlety, skill, and grace in his performance of what could have been common pie- them to a different level. A racing gag causes him to wrap a large butcher knife casually so that it fits precisely into the correct position attached to the cutting board, and I'm still stunned that Arbuckle really does seem to do this every time. There is also a really cool joke that sees you leaning on your scale and confused about why your cuts of meat weigh so heavily. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is a kid who goes in to buy molasses, and performs cleverly. in a routine of foot attached to the ground that follows. In addition to the strange and almost unsettling half-smile, his idiosyncratic attitude and body language make him immediately recognizable as the Buster we know. He even has his flattened trademark hat - here first destroyed when filled, of course, with molasses. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie turns into more comedy based on the situation and Arbuckle and his rival Al St. John dressed to infiltrate Fatty's girlfriend's boarding school. Much of the humor also comes from the generally surreal and mysterious vision of inducing the laughter of these two strange companions using drag and trying to "be girls." The buster is also in this segment, but most occasionally stand in the cutaway, helping St. John. <br /> <br /> The ending of "The Butcher Boy" becomes a little hectic, but in general historical interest of curiosity, it is a well-made comedy that gets only the laughter that it is doing.
