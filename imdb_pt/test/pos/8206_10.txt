Wow!! In my opinion, THE NET is a great cutting-edge technology thriller that will suit you. When I first saw it, I was feeling good all over for days. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought to myself, "This is a great place to vacation." From the moment Jack (Jermey Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) started chasing her, I thought to myself, "Do not let anything bad happen to her! Please!" I also took some deep breaths to stop myself from screaming more than I already had. On the plus side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. In conclusion, I give this excellent thriller weaving from end to end of its four-star seat.
