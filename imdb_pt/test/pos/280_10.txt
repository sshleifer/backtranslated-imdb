At the beginning of this film, which I found myself watching at the IFC in the early hours of the morning, I felt a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort. The feeling of being trapped in no way to escape was so powerful that I did not know if I wanted to continue watching ... although it did not really seem to me that I had much choice, so convincing was the situation However, gradually, this feeling of discomfort (though it has never really disappeared altogether), and I was drawn to Tessa & Bobby's problems, and really hoping they would get back together. <br /> <br /> Actually, only a poignant and powerful story fits perfectly into a tiny package. I had no idea that Sarah Polley had something to do with it until I read her trivia, so now I love it even more. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend it. ... If you're lucky enough to pick it up on the Independent Film Channel at some point, or cunning enough to figure out some other way to visualize it.
