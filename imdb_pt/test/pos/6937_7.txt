"You can not take it realistically." -heheets <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2 (ZB2) is a world all its own. I've never really seen anything like it. The only thing I can think of comparing is with psychedelic drugs. Forgive the clich√© I do not mean simply that it is incoherent and absurd, although occasionally it is. I mean it takes you through a wide range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly as to overwhelm you, and when it's over, you find out that everything happened while you were sitting on the couch. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that it is extremely low budget as a warning to those who, after seeing "Shaun of the Dead", consider themselves fans of underground zombie movies. Also noteworthy is that it is much more "brutal" than you would expect. Children are gutted and someone teases a teenager before tossing into the groin. His corpse is later "raped." These are certainly not flaws, and in fact feel like it's for the movie's credit. But if it does not sound like your kind of movie, do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> (I do not intend to exaggerate in brutality. <br /> <br /> Do not wait "Inside" or something like that.) I hesitate to cede any part of the plot, because it's really full of surprises. has nothing to do with zombies, it is both a classic horror scene and something quite unique. <br /> <br /> Man, I have three paragraphs and I almost said nothing. <br /> <br /> Here's why I thought the movie was Incredible: 1. It's big and it's still moving. At one point, you expect it to become another clone of NotLD, a "climb in the window" movie where everyone stands in a farmhouse and argues with each other. At the end of the film, however, the farm scenes will seem like a distant dream.There are also several outdoor urban scenes.These are rare in low budget zombie movies. 2.The makeup / Blood is a lot better than ZB 1. More convincing and more creative.A bit funny: the first zombies look really dumb. In the middle of the road, they suddenly look very good, with prosthetics and everything. Some of them look like Fulci zombies, some are reminiscent of Mr. Tongue's "Day of the Dead." And there are great scenes from dozens of zombies walking around. It never gets old. <br /> <br /> 3. There is something strangely emotional about it. A character claims that heaven exists and that our dead / undead are now in heaven. In the context of the film, we believe it to be true. Although the characters behave with the typical stupidity of horror movies, they genuinely seem to care about each other, and so I found myself worried about them. <br /> <br /> 4. The pace is great. There is not a moment of boredom. <br /> <br /> My only remark bordering on criticism is that Todd Sheets presents the most bizarre dialogue I have ever heard. I personally think this adds to the experience but I do not think it does it on purpose so I can not give the movie a perfect rating. (Example: when a car breaks down, the owner shouts at the passengers.) Then he says something in effect: "Sorry, I yelled at you.You do not know what it's like to have your dad standing over you with a razor when you have five years old. "wtf?) In the end, it comes to be more than I can bear. It involves an assembly with Bill Clinton and some final credits explaining the metaphor of the zombies. Actually, at this point, I was reliving my experiences with drugs. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 7/10
