This movie has a decidedly weird scenario taking place in a school that is really old to begin with, but it certainly does not look like any sterile medicine environment. Very gothic and atmospheric. As for the movie itself, well, OK, the premise is a bit overdone, but that's why we watch movies, is not it? And it's less exaggeration than a little bit of the junk it is today, for sure. Medical students are experiencing "short-term" death, as if they allow themselves to be briefly dead, so they can experience life after death. It is good, in some cases, even parts of him to return with the traveler and begin to meddle in their earthly lives. I had not seen this movie for years until I got it on DVD and I have to say I had forgotten how good it was. And it occurred to me that Julia Roberts looks really beautiful in this movie, not like today's actresses who are supposed to be beautiful, but are dressed up and made up as cheap prostitutes. Ah, the good old days. Anyway, this is a great movie, maybe not for fundamentalist Christians, but many others may like that. 8 out of 10 stars.
