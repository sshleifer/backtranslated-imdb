This film brings to mind "Boys in the Hood", "Threat to Society", "South Central" and others from his laia and even shares actors with some of them. The mentality of the movie "us against the law" is highlighted by the totally black neighborhood against the almost all white police force. Here the cops are so bad they look like caricatures and in one scene they even ambush the boys while they drive in a car that they have just "released" from their owner. It's like a bushwhacking of an old western, but the contemporary setting makes it look very real. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the young Jason Petty and his friends, for whom school is just an inconvenience that takes time away from their "real occupation" of boosting cars. This happens in Newark, N.J., a city with low rates of jobs, but notoriously high in crimes. In fact, the problem is so serious that police officers have "car theft" written on their backs, to show that an entire unit should be devoted to this particular crime. <br /> <br /> The boys wear a "lean Jim". "They are only faced with real problems when the police ambush them." The dark lieutenant, Nazi, has a vengeance on the boys, seeing them not as human beings who they might be worthy of redemption, but rather as human targets.In fact, he rather resembles that sadistic Nazi officer in the Warsaw ghetto, who overthrew the Jews for pleasure in the film "Schindler's List." When the boys steal a car from the police in return for the ambush, things are predictably falling fast.Â They are severely beaten by the police and Jason finally ends up in prison.Â Of course these are `` bad boys '' who steal your car in a minute but the movie wants us to see them like anti-heroes, showing Jason protecting his sister and his friend taking care of their own grandmother.The movie left us wondering which side to take and who to feel the most sadness: the boys whose lives are going down the drain, honest citizens whose cars are being stolen left and right and could get caught in a gunfight at any moment. moment or the city of Newark itself, the spirit of whose law is being betrayed by brutal, mortal police officers of the soul. Despite the over-the-top portrait of the latter, the film offers a realistic depiction of the ghetto, the protagonists and their families and the culture of car theft in a city where there seems to be only two avenues of career - law enforcement and crime. Strangely, the whole subject of drugs is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are obviously biased against the Newark police, which we hope is not as bad as they are portrayed here. However, they gave us another strong, affecting story about the inner city and black youth went wrong and Sharron Corley is just like Jason.
