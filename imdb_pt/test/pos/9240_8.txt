I should also apologize for a somewhat biased opinion of this effort as I contributed to the soundtrack. Still, I received my copy, sat down, and enjoyed the cast of characters who were perhaps more colorful than the characters they were creating in this tale of a sequence of films in Shanghai. For those who think George Bush is a "believable Texan," look no further than this film to break the image that Texas is full of one-dimensional truckers. The cast contains some of the most intelligent, quirky and humorous people you'll find anywhere while they tell you their agonies, happiness and disappointment as they go to a great sequence of films, with no budget, guerrilla style (ie punk rock style ). each person helps to define). <br /> <br /> This is a great documentary made with passion and courage and all the venom you need to break through the other side of any bs industry and speak in pairs with which you deal (take note of authors, painters , musicians and fellow filmmakers). This refers to the credibility of the first wave of American hardcore music when the term "D.I.Y." was the standard, a time when courage, passion, and commitment mattered far more than technical, style, or precious calculations. Not that there is not much technique or style for it ... the tone of the documentary is quite refreshing. Editing cuts offer both drama and dialogue. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​creating a documentary from the sad ending of the cast, team and the director's initial intention is brilliant, totally Texan and absolutely punk rock. In the true sense of the term.
