This movie gives you more of an idea how the Australians act. Even though The Castle is such a great Australian movie, it's a bit out there. This movie is by far the best Australian movie I have ever seen (and I have not seen Dirty Deeds yet) and would probably be my favorite movie. The point is, if you have not seen it yet, go see. If a crime / action / comedy is your thing.
