I saw 'Begotten' last night, and I'm two minds in the movie. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I thank you for being the total reversal of a Michael Bay movie. No dialogues, extremely stylized grainy B & W photos, some of the most genuinely horrible pictures ever filmed, and one use very appealing sound (which no one else seems to have realized yet). It is a reflection on a theme, and it dares to go where most filmmakers do not, not only in terms of images, but of production and concept. It's a movie that most people do not understand, and if you read those reviews, you'll find many people whose lack of ability to discover this movie results in them screaming about 'pretentiousness' with the fervor of a double-breasted rattle. the bars of your cage at the time of feeding. It really shocked and disturbed me, and the last time a movie could do that was a while back. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is a thirty minute short that stretches for over an hour and a half. I understand that there may be artistic merit in using repetition and monolithic rhythm like a fuck, but in that case it does not help at all. Imagine being approached by a ragged man in the street who takes you by the shoulders and says something that completely confuses the core of your being ... but then, instead of leaving his shrapnel and chattering in his wake, he continues talking and talking and talking At the end of the movie, I found myself looking at my watch from time to time. <br /> <br /> This is not entertainment, people. This is entertainment. This is how you deprograte people who have just watched "Glitter". If you watch movies for fun, it will frustrate, confuse, and possibly anger you. You do not approach 'Begotten' like a chocolate cake you want to eat because it's yummy. You approach it like something on the menu you've never heard of before, something that you see sneaking through the kitchen door, something that is dark and twinkles and writhes in your tray; something you ask not because it will taste good, but because you just need to know how it is.
