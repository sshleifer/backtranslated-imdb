From the opening success of "We're Gonna Groove" to the latest "Whole Lotta Love" guitar hit, this DVD can be one of the best music DVDs ever released since the Beatles' anthology was released. earlier this year. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this DVD is that on Disc 1, an entire concert and many television appearances can be found. For example, the entire Royal Albert Hall show is on the DVD as well as some of the best performances of the band's latest gig at Knebworth. <br /> <br /> At the Royal Albert Hall show, for example, the band had plenty of room to improvise. Jimmy Page's guitar solos make "Dazed And Confused" a great rock ballad as opposed to the laid-back blues music that was on Led Zeppelin I. <br /> <br /> Then on DVD 2, it's a promotional video for the hit of Led Zeppelin III, "Immigrant Song". One of Zeppelin's most difficult songs, the video is as shallow as a Pre-MTV video, but it shows a lot of guitar power from Jimmy Page since it was taken from a live performance. After the video ends, we are treated, in transition, with a small photo of fans filling the seats at Madison Square Garden. The following are performances that should have been part of "The Song Remains The Same", but did not cut it. Excellent Riffs like those of the songs "Black Dog" and "The Ocean" were present. <br /> <br /> After the Madison Performances, we are treated to Earl's Court. Most Led Zeppelin IV material was played here, as the most popular song Zeppelin ever recorded, "Stairway to Heaven." It's as brilliant as ever, even more so than the IV version. <br /> <br /> Finally, to finish the 5+ hours of live material, it's the last Led Zeppelin concert at Knebworth in August 1979. As the viewer notes this, they have to admit that Robert's voice Plant is getting more hoarse and deeper than all the screams he has done in the past, and it is evident here. In songs like "Kashmir" and "In The Evening", Plant does not have its old vocal impulse, but in "Whole Lotta Love", it returns for another song. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the best music DVDs ever released, just next to the great boxing set "Beatles Anthology" that was released in early 2003. The sound, in both 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital, just like the Beatles DVD, gives the feeling of being onstage with the artists, standing right next to them, as you would feel on the Beatles DVD when they are playing in the studio. Although the Beatles and Led Zeppelin are different bands, each has received several DVDs. Even though this set comes in only two albums compared to the five Beatles Set records, it still feels a lot filling the viewer after they've gone through all this content. It's also a pleasure to watch again and again, not just because of the sound quality, but because of the sheer energy on stage when Robert Plant starts singing. <br /> <br /> A brilliant effort from Atlantic.
