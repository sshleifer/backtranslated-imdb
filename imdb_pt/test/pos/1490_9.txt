Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the ignorant Mr. Bean, who never goes away without his teddy bear. Mr. Bean's appeal is largely his childish behavior and innocence. We do not know if it came from heaven or from another planet. He's the kind of weird character you can not easily invent. He is often alone and accustomed to it. He has difficulty communicating through speech, which may be the reason we only hear his grunts at times. There are other characters that talk to him and he responds. The character of Mr. Bean is a mystery and still is. He lives alone and does the unthinkable when he can do the sensible thing. Mr. Bean is a strange man who does not care much. He prefers to live a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time.
