Brighton has a traumatic drama in her family: Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts), twenty, is delayed due to a fall, and her overprotective mother, Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan) blames her negligence for the accident. . Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose), seventeen, loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily. His father Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his models of trains and railroads. Evie mysteriously sabotages her interviews to different universities being rejected, and teaches Emily's own poetry. When Martha hears Emily repeating the poems, she takes notes and shows them to English teacher Stewart Worthy (Christopher Lloyd), who believes that Emily had a moment of genius. When Evie's only friend, James (Fran Kranz) reads the notes, he immediately reveals the truth about the authority of poetry. But when Martha becomes conscious, she finds the reality of Evie, provoking a series of revelations. <br /> <br /> "Admissions" is a very powerful drama about those in need of love and guilt complex. The performances are impressive, and this is Lauren Ambrose's first work of "Six Feet Under", which I see and she's amazing. This independent movie is an excellent choice for viewers who are looking for a refreshing story based on the cast's performance. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Complicity" ("Complicity")
