This movie is incredible. You'll never laugh any more. It's a target. No, I think it's ... yes, it's ... an idiot! This movie gets funnier every second - like when the character of Jackie Chan finally dies in his final fight scene. This movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha! Congratulations if you buy or rent this. You will never return it, in my opinion. I have not done it and have not found it in a store since. I watched this movie once and I always fell in love with Kung-Fu action movies. If you're looking for an incredible movie in the realm of great production value, good or even mediocre acting and good special effects ... this is not that movie. If you're looking for timeless laughter and wonders, pick a dollar and you'll probably never let it go. With friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect night.
