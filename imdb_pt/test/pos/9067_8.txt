Peter Lorre was born to play Stephen Danel with phrases such as "Mr. Smith, you should not hold my wife like that." and "I told you not to keep the monkey in the house!" The poster for this movie is a strange green and Peter Lorre's way leers that makes you never want to go to your penal colony / island. This movie is not available on DVD, although it is a classic and very rarely seen on TV. What exactly is the relationship between Stephen Danel and the monkey? Why does the monkey bother you so much? We'll never know. The movie should be colored by someone and excerpts should be made into a video of the Kinks. The film was reissued in the 1950s and only a few of the biographies of Peter Lorre pass on some text about this film. Casablanca was just around the corner. Bogart could have been on that island, but they certainly did not have the budget for it
