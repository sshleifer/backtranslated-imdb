(Possible * SPOILERS * warning) <br /> <br /> You never know. The guy keeps saying he's an alien, but ... oops, he seems to be the most human in the whole story. It came from the distant planet. I said strange things. Earth science has advanced. Healed the doctor ... Or was it just a crazy dream? Never know. Better to see K-PAX by yourself. Think. <br /> <br /> Great acting from the entire cast. Do not forget to notice the music, it's right in one place. Lots of fun, some sadness. 8 out of 10, after all.
