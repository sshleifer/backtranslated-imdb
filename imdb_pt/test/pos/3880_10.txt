I thought it was brilliant! It was great to see the presenter tracking each one of them. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had barely changed his appearance, nor Dirk Benedict, he still looked so dishy! I thought Mr. T looked thinner, but it was still great to see how he'd taken care of all this time. I thought it was necessary to track the other cast members, like the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was a pity Mr. T could not make the actual meeting. It was also a great pity George Peppard had died, leaving a loophole, so to speak. I only wanted now that I had recorded to keep. Let's hope they repeat again.
