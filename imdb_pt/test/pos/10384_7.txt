"Beyond the Clouds" is an artistic group of four vignettes, each offering a glimpse of a relationship between man and woman, from the faint to the turbulent. Although the film offers superb cinematography, some exquisite visual beauty and a cast of excellent artists, there is little flesh in the bones of this fragmented work. The taste of a relationship can not convey the fullness of it and the synergism suggests that much more can be accomplished with a story in two hours than with four. However, "Beyond the Clouds" will be the food for dilettantes and a visual feast for everything, albeit superficial, flushed and without substance.
