Although you stray a little from the book, you can not help but love the music and atmospheric settings. <br /> <br /> The scenes in Bath are exactly as they should be. Although if you have watched how many times I have noticed that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, I like the scene where they are in the Hot Baths, but do the men and women really bathe together? Like that? You could see all the men perched outside sneeringly at the women. It also seemed odd that they all had their hats, but maybe that was the style of the season. The ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the clothes looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine's dress at the first dance scene. <br /> <br /> Northanger Abbey looked suitably imposing, but I enjoyed the scenes of Bath better. <br /> <br /> Schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the best performance that Mrs. Allen I feel. <br /> <br /> Ugh Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, he just talks a lot of garbage, and is not a cleric as it should be, it's hard to think he's in love with Catherine, but the book has never given this printing too. <br /> <br /> General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy, and Stuart also performs well as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not perform well as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, he gives the impression of a sordid and lascivious man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but I quite like him. <br /> <br /> I can handle scenes being cut from an adaptation of a book. , but when new scenes and characters are added, this usually irritates me. The marquise! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story and she is not even your reeling page boy. <br /> <br /> part of the script is quirky. When Catherine asks Elinor Tilney about her mother's death, she asks, "I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear?" What a silly thing to say! Elinor's calm response is stupid, too. <br /> <br /> Anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me
