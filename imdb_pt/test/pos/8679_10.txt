I must say that this is the best movie I have ever seen. I know that on this site he only received negative reviews, but for the first time I would like to be the good person that gives the best movie in the world a good review. I find the film extremely funny, and it has the perfect blend of everything. it makes me feel every kind of emotion when I watch, and I can not get enough of it. the brilliant soundtracks. I love it, I understand why people may not love it as much as I do, but I do not understand how people could hate it. The film is 100% brilliant. Turva is incredible. I never realized that Australian films could be so good, and I also never realized I could watch a movie so many times in a single day without getting sick of it. I think everyone should watch it, be it to get an idea of ​​what life was like in the younger days, or whether it's to see what you're looking for when you reach the end of year 12.
