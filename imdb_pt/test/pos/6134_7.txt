Yes, I watched this mini series with my mom and dad as a kid. It was one of the few mini-series that my 9-year-old mind really could follow. I remember it was very well done, and does not necessarily have the feel of a typical miniseries. It was more or less an original concept that really caught your eye. I would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is a fan of stories and twists. While most of the film's twists are explicit or predictable, it's still worth it. I have not checked to see if you can get it through Netflix yet though. I do not know. They should play in the history channel or something.
