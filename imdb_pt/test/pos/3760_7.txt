Mark Blankfield (from the old nightly TV program "Friday") plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a gentle surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was obviously not his intention, he had higher aspirations, but he follows the flow. This is really a pretty stupid movie, but it's also a lot of fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's embarrassed, but he's also not above doing it all over again and running around Hollywood like a crazed sex machine with curly hair and gold chains. There are some subplots like the bride of Jekyll, who is the daughter of the chief physician of Our Lady of Suffering and of Pain, the employer of Jekyll. And there's Tim Thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly few "real" parts and a taste for men, and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of Howard Hughes, and who will enrich several people with a full set of organ transplants including testicles . Yes, the humor is cheeky and silly, and overall the whole thing is quite tasteless, but if you are not above a quick wallow in the gutter, you will probably like it very well. Now also available on DVD for the first time! Woohoo! 7 out of 10.
