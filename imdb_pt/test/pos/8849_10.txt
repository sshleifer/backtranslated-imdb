A brilliant horror film. Totally horrible and very scary too. The Thing is a remake of John Carpenter, but please, do not let that get you out of this movie. It is simply brilliant. The beginning of the movie has the spacecraft of the alien advancing towards Earth centuries before humanity trek across the planet with a blast that unleashes the title of the movie in an incredible blue and white brilliant saying "THE THING". One of the best opening credits for an all-time horror film. <br /> <br /> The cast of actors who play the twelve-man scientific team is a joy to contemplate and the venues for the installation of their Station in Antarctica are visually stunning. on widescreen DVD. It must have been great at the movies. Sorry to not see it on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men who try to fight a lethal form, changing the monstrosity that infiltrated his base. All the actors are really good and they create fantastic scenes of paranoia and tension about who the thing infected. My favorite scene in the entire movie has to be when Macready tests everyone who's still alive for the infection, it's tense, scary and ultimately spectacular. I love it because it's funny too. <br /> <br /> Special mention should go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing makeup effects and shaping alien's own change projects. If he did not get an Oscar for best visual effects then, then he should have. This is also debatable if this is John Carpenter's biggest movie ... it's certainly a horrible masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Wait for a cold winter night. Get some Budweiser in the fridge. Sit back and watch The Thing, a fire horror masterpiece playing fighting shape heroes changing towers of blood and slime. <br /> <br /> Totally brilliant. Ten of ten.
