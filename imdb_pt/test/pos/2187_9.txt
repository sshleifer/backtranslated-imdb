SWEENEY TODD, by Stephen Sondheim: DEMONSTRATED BARBER OF THE FLEET STREET premiered on Broadway on March 1, 1979, with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the lead roles. Although it has varied practically all the prizes imaginable, the box office fell short of expectations and the original production finished with 557 presentations. Fortunately, however, the game was on tour - and along the way was captured in the film. The result is a remarkable capture of the piece with George Hern, who replaced Cariou and Lansbury in a great approach of the original staging of Broadway. <br /> <br /> There is, however, a flaw. Simply: the plays are not very well filmed, because a performance that works well on stage must fill the theater and is therefore very, very large - and when placed in movies, these performances usually appear to be slightly static, overwhelmingly aggressive, or both . SWEENEY TODD is no exception. Seen in the movies, he has a "stay and sing" quality, and while Hern and Lansbury seem to have modulated their performances because of the camera, this is not the case with Betsy Joslyn as Joanna; his larger-than-life performance reads in the film as unpleasantly frenetic and his extremely operatic voice seems out of place when contrasted with the voices of the overall cast. <br /> <br /> Taking this effect of staging in the cinema In consideration, however, this really is an exceptional performance of a comic musical unique and macabre in the operetta style. Lansbury is astounding, a mixture of nonsense, stupidity and cunning malice, while Hern really owns the role of the psychotic barber whose clients "go to their impeccably shaven graves." The overall cast is very good and although the film does not allow us to see enough of the set, there is enough to be impressive. And the music! Who can argue with what they consider the best work of Sondheim? The story itself is extremely well known, particularly in England. In 1846, Thomas Peckett Prest interspersed several urban myths for a tale entitled THE STRING OF PEARLS; within a year or more, was adapted to the stage as SWEENEY TODD, the Bearded Demon of Fleet Street - and in an era that little knew about copyright law, variations of the play were soon to be found throughout England. Each, however, was more or less the same: Sweeney Todd, a barber, kills the men who seek him to shave; Mrs. Lovett, her associate, turns them into pies and feeds them to an unsuspecting audience. Sondheim's version is specifically based on a 1973 version of Christopher Bond. <br /> <br /> The story is very Grand Guignol, with lots of blood, bodies falling on kicks and grotesque humor; at the same time, however, the music, letters and sub-plot of an innocent in the clutches of evil open the subject to countless lyrical charms that no one would expect. Sondheim's lyrics are often ironic, but never more than here; It entwines much perverse satire of industry and capitalism along the way, and certainly one can not blame the strange and Victorian elegance of its complex music. Like the "concert version" starring Hern and Patti LuPone, this particular movie also offers us several selections that were cut from the 2007 film version of Tim Burton, more particularly the opening "Participate in the Tale of Sweeney Todd ", which functions as a topic throughout the play. It is also, in my opinion, considerably more comical than the film, which tends to underestimate the comedy in favor of an even greater demonstration of blood. Whatever the case, if you're a fan of the story, this is the legendary Broadway show on tour, and it's a knock-out. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
