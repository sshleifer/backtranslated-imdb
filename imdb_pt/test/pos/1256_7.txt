The Kid - At 39, Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful home and makes buckets of money. But everything has a cost, in this case, without social life, without conscience and afraid to spend the rest of your life alone. He just needs someone to show him the way. <br /> <br /> As I watched the movie, I kept wondering why Disney did not pass this movie on to Miramax - not because it's particularly daring, but because it's clearly an adult movie. This is exacerbated by the marketing campaign that clearly targets children - it's included in the trailers of "Rugrats the Movie" and "Pokemon 2000" (are not they past yet?). But I'm sorry. <br /> <br /> I was struck by the sensitive treatment of the subject - instead of the typical midlife crisis involving some pathetic sap buy a Porsche convertible and act like an idiot, the character of Willis is committed. some serious insight and take stock of your life. His guide on this journey of self-discovery is himself at age 8 (they never explain how Rusty arrives and, frankly, I do not care). Young Rusty's innocence and unbridled optimism give him a clear advantage in guessing the truth - he sums up Russell's work as an image consultant: "You teach people to lie and pretend to be something they are not." For a good script to succeed, however, you need actors to bring it to life. Not a problem here. <br /> <br /> Although Willis ignored W.C. three times. Fields's warnings about starring with children or animals he once again got lucky, also mingling comedicly with Breslin as he did dramatically with Osment. Willis manages to balance Russell's powerful features with vulnerability and confusion, without becoming ridiculous. Breslin, however, gives a dead portrait of a child from the childhood of everyone - which has always stood out for some reason and was chosen in. We also have two bonus performances: Lily Tomlin is great as Russell's levelhead assistant and Jean Smart is perfect as a charming and insightful anchor (I loved her in "Guinevere"). <br /> <br /> The Kid is charming, heavy, and real. And it will appeal to adults of all ages.
