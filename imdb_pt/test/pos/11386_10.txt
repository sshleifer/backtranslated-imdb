Some time ago I saw this when HBO was showing and from what I saw, it looked like a good movie. so I'm at Blockbuster today and I see it there with the DVD and I decide what the heck. So I rented it. After I finished watching him, I was shocked at how good it was. <br /> <br /> This movie touched my heart. Everything was so incredible. The stories, the actors, the black humor, the MUSIC !!! Oh, do not make me start the song in this movie. Andderson is one of the greats. Definitely the best thing to come out since Quentin Tarantino (a god.) <br /> <br /> After I finished the first performance I watched Anderson's comment again (I was surprised at how cool he is). <br /> <br /> Anyone who is interested in movies should watch this movie if they have not already. Anderson is obviously a movie lover. In the film he pulls out so many other technical directors. Like the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water. Obviously he got off "I'm Cuba". But I have no flesh what so ever with it. The film is very respectable with its ripoff. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who can handle part of the movie's content (pornography). <br /> <br /> 10/10
