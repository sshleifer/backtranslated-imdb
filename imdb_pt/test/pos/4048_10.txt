I probably watched the movie 4 or 5 times. Every time, I am ever more impressed with how much the desire of a young heart can go, and the strength of both Kai and Gertha to fight for what they believe. <br /> <br /> And the whole story is presented in such a way, you've just been transferred to the plot and before you know it, you're there. you can see ... yeah, there's Kai ... working hard in the mirror ... a little leap ... there's Gertha, fighting for your love ... and there's the Snow Queen ... <br /> < is just a wonderful blend of love, adventure, tension. <br /> <br /> it's brilliant 10 out of 10
