I saw it last week and the sketch on the cities of Korea was funny. Too much tongue on the cheek and suited to the political climate. Complete points for writers and Spike for this. The part where he makes the translator pull a rickshaw and drop Korean words could have been ripped off just by Spike. This is a brave attempt by Fox. This is a brilliant show and I hope it is successful. My wife and I have been working with her on a regular basis and although this has hit a few other shows, we've watched her on MySpace now. I hope Fox devotes full resources to the program and does it daily. I can not wait to see Bobby Lee at his show. With people like Bernard Abedalla behind the show, this is on the right track. Also Mary Mae as his wife looks beautiful.
