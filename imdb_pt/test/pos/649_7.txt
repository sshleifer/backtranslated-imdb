In August of 1981, there was a country buzz in the movies, big hits like "Urban Cowboy," "All That Way," "Smokey and the Bandit" were everywhere. For that reason, I suspect that the producers of this film chose "Honky Tonk Freeway" as the title in the hope that it would help the box office receipts of the film by drawing in the same crowd "Urban Cowboy." Instead, "Honky Tonk Freeway" bombed theaters and I suspect that this is done in part by being overloaded with an ill-chosen title. This same problem now overloads on video and this is very bad because it is a very good movie and comedy style ahead of its time. No matter what, probably anyone who remembers 1981 will like it. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that this movie has been bombed. But I think it would have anyway, even if it had not been a bad title. It's a movie ahead of its time. One could look at this movie now and see that it is clearly a parent or * great-uncle anyway) for the types of comedy made today. For his day "Honky Tonk Freeway" was quite full of insinuations and a kind of frankness about life that did not become popular in comedy until much later. Although clearly a son of "Airplane", it is more mature, and although it is not "Knocked Up", points clearly in this direction. The characters are more "mature in comedy," for they are discreet and never think anything they do is anything but serious. Jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and in the visions of the cameras and in the way they see and in their situations. <br /> <br /> But more than that, "Honky Tonk Freeway" is a real-time capsule. A great look back on the extremely early 80's. The people in this movie are dressed and act like ordinary people from 1981. It was clearly to reflect the times and be a malicious and comical commentary on everyday life around them. <br /> <br /> I do not know if my review is helping you, but this is really good, sometimes kind of great, worth renting movie if you want to see how many familiar faces today looked like when they were 30 years old younger. Beverly D'Angelo is so young that it's hard to see it at times. So are Beau Bridges and Terri Garr. Terry Garr was about to become the Hollywood toast as his next movie after this was "Tootsie," which finally made her a star. Howard Hessmann was undoubtedly the biggest "current" star of the day this movie was made. In 1981 Howard Hessmann was the star of the TV hit "WKRP in Cinncinatti". He played his main character, the night DJ. Daniel Stern was about to come out as a star as the voice of an adult narrator of the childhood protagonist of the popular 80's sitcom "The Wonder Years." There are also several faces that are no longer among us these days, it is good to see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as an old couple on a journey. Jessica Tandy would finally get her Oscar ten years after that for "Driving Miss Daisy". There is also the great Geraldine Page in one of her last movie appearances. Despite having a brilliant career, she did not receive her Oscar until four years after that in 1985's "Trip to Bountiful," for which she deserved it, and she died shortly after receiving the award. In addition, there are many other faces in this film, actors who are not big stars but who have done tons of supporting work. Many are familiar, even if you can not think of their names. <br /> <br /> This movie is a nice little fun. A group of people with a variety of problems left from various places, each for their own independent reasons, that all, vaguely in Altman-esk mode, ended up going to Florida and without them knowing a rendevoux in the small town of Ticlaw. Florida, which happens to be recovering from the effects of being circumvented by the newly built nearby interstate, which has not built an exit to Ticlaw, which effectively takes the city off the map. <br /> <br /> And also what is this movie. This is a fascination with the whole idea of ​​the interstate system, which has only recently been "completed". It took a generation to be built, from when it was authorized by Congress around 1960, over many years, when different parts were built and then "went live" and by 1980 most of the system was finally built and all connected together . first time the promise that the interstate system would be transformed into what it is. And people were delighted with that. Everyone in 1980 was practically an "interstate highway veteran" in the sense that by then everyone had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads where it had no red lights or stop signs, just on and off ramps, and that was for places that were previously less accessible. In 1980, anyone could drive anywhere with comfort and without having to stop for anything except to eat and sleep and a toilet. And all this was new then. <br /> <br /> The ending is anti-climatic and not as satisfying, although it is a spectacular moment. What makes it great is that the journey is not the destination that makes Honky Tonk Freeway timeless, despite being a product of its day. Forget your title; instead, let it take you down memory lane.
