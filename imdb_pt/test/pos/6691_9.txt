Due to a very misleading advertising campaign, I watched this movie in theaters with a relatively small age of 10 years. The TV trailers portrayed the movie as a comedy, and I yelled at my parents until they took me. After seeing the movie, I was impressed. I did not know what to think. Totally unlike anything I've seen before, leaving lots of questions for such a young mind. Needless to say, I loved it. This morning was the first time I've watched in probably 2-3 years, and I still think it's one of the biggest movies made in the last decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are at their best, as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and the psychiatrist who develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery. The support cast is almost perfect as well, each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in his own way. The open end was handled very well, giving plenty of evidence to support what you believe happened at the end. As this movie failed to get at least one Oscar nomination this year is beyond me. If you have not seen this movie, hurry to Wal-Mart NOW. The DVD is usually in the bargain box, get it! <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
