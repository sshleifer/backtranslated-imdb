In a world where debatable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes one at the top of the list; In addition, it does so objectively and realistically, and with a sensitivity and sensitivity that makes it a great movie for anyone. And to add some irony to all this, even the subject of this movie has been widely misunderstood, as it is mistakenly perceived that this is a movie about the pros and cons of the death penalty; it is not. At the heart of Dead Man Walking, directed by Tim Robbins, is a subject that in reality is possibly the most misunderstood of all, and rightly so, because it may be the most difficult thing that exists for a human being - and truly - to understand. And that's what this movie really is: Forgiveness. True forgiveness; not apologizing for a heinous crime or the perpetrator of it - not saying that what happened is ok - but finding the strength to continue, and to do so by choosing life. Director / writer Tim Robbins has Crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by Sister Helen Prejean, in which she discusses her involvement with death row inmates whom over the years she has ministered faith in God. As narrated in the film, what for her was to become a lifelong quest not just for justice but for human dignity, began with a simple letter from a death row prisoner at the Louisiana State Prison in Angola. Sentenced to death for rape and murder, Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) was looking for someone who wanted to hear, when his letter ended in the hands of his sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who soon found herself venturing into a territory she had absolutely no no knowledge or experience. And Robbins was able to succinctly capture Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey, while at the same time keeping her devoid of any sentimental sentimentality, which makes her not only real, trustworthy and believable, but also a moving and emotionally engaging experience to the public. Through film, what was once a personal and significant emotional experience for Sister Prejean, becomes one for all who watch this film as well. <br /> For your moving and passionate representation of Sister. Prejean, Susan Sarandon deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress. Sensitive and full of emotional depth, her performance is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way she conveys the underlying fragility and vulnerability of Sister Prejean, which she tempered with the hardness she needed to continue her efforts on behalf of Poncelet. (and, in fact, a total of five since it began). Whatever your point of view regarding the subjects examined in this film, Sister Prejean is undoubtedly an individual of heroic proportions, which Sarandon exquisitely personifies here; and it does so without resorting to any superfluous melodramatics, but rather by keeping it real, by subtly and humbly exploring one's humanity in a very believable characterization expression. It's an extraordinary performance, arguably the best of Sarandon's brilliant career. The best performance of his career is also Sean Penn, who was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Poncelet (he lost to Nicolas Cage, who won for his performance in "Leaving" Las Vegas ). Perfect for the party in every way, Penn simply has never been better, before or after. He effectively presents Poncelet as a real person, rather than an exaggerated caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes described here. Not that this makes Poncelet less despicable; exactly the opposite, in fact. This makes it genuinely disconcerting to come across the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next to you might be able to do such things. And that's the strength of Penn's performance - it's so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuance; you have to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a disturbed soul. A great performance, and - as best as Cage was in 'Vegas' - Penn should have got the Oscar for it. <br /> <br /> In another standout performance, Raymond J. Barry is a memorable supporting role as Earl Delacroix, the father of one of Poncelet's victims. With a limited screen time, he develops his character in such a way that allows you to empathize with him, as well as with Sister Prejean, for it is through him that we are given a little of how complex and seemingly tenuous he is. , at least on the surface. Barry presents Delacroix in such a way that it gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story, which is extremely effective and helps to underline the message of the film. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes R. Lee Emery (Clyde Percy), Celia Weston (Maria Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Helena's Mother), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Roberta Maxwell ), Margo Martindale (Sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet). It is doubtful that this film would change anyone's mind on the death penalty, but that was never the intention; what he intended was to make an emotionally engaging, instigating film, which is exactly what Robbins performed with 'Dead Man Walking'. Regardless of your personal point of view, this movie will have an impact and, hopefully, it will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness. For, as we see through the character of Earl Delacroix, true forgiveness is not something that someone simply decides to do, but it is a task that can become a life-long job. And it is possibly one of the most difficult things in life to actually accomplish; and you leave this movie with appreciation for individuals like Sister Prejean who devoted her life selflessly to helping the needy and filmmakers like Robbins and Sarandon for bringing her to life for millions of people who otherwise would never know of her. I rate this a 10/10. <br /> <br />
