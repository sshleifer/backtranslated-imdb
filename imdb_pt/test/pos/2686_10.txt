This show is brilliantly hilarious! I started watching in 2007, and I had never heard of it before. After one episode, I got hooked. I'm never at home to watch, so my wife bought me the entire series on DVD. Non stop laugh, need I say more? I wish I was still on TV because it's definitely worthy and much better of crap currently on TV. <br /> <br /> I wish they would make a movie, seriously, I would not see it. The name Kevin James alone will bring a huge fan base to any movie, the guy is (make your stomach hurt) funny. <br /> <br /> Just a very good show, realistic and believable. If you have the chance to buy it on DVD, make it worth it.
