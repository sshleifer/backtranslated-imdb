I had never seen this movie before to air on a local sci-fi cable network. This reminded me of the late-1960s TV show "Irwin Allen" (Time Tunnel etc). Great effects (they beat Star Trek 5 20 years later, but that was not too difficult to do). <br /> <br /> I found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production. They would need some tweaking to tie up some loose ends at the character level, but for a children's film it's surprisingly interesting (especially the glimpse of futuristic euro-politics, surprisingly similar to the current European Union!) plot is indeed reminiscent of the Twilight Zone in general (as other reviewers have pointed out), but in this case it's a compliment. <br /> <br /> Great scenarios, by the way! <br /> 7/10
