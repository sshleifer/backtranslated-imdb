I remember my father hiring these episodes on video. My whole family loved them, and now that I've moved out of my house and have my own life, I'm trying to share these fabulous creations of Jim Henson with my husband and stepson, but as I'm beginning to discover that not everyone is a Henson fan. Which is a shame as it means they will just have to put up with looking for this series. But even if they do not find it interesting, I would recommend everyone to get hold of the Storyteller. You will be lost in a world of tales from a time when people could only talk about unexplained situations through stories and how people need to care if they were confronted with such situations.
