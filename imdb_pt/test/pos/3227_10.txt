Gilmore Girls is my favorite TV show of all time. they only aired in the first two seasons in India, but I watched the rest on DVD or read online. It's very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist is not sneaking around behind her mother but has an open relationship with her. The chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel who plays Lorelai and her daughter Rory is really great. all the acting is excellent and the characters, although extremely peculiar, are still credible. the residents of empty stars show all the bizarre fun of life in the small town, which is contrasted by the endless snobbery and social norms that make up the high society life of Lorelai's parents. On the one hand, there are dance dances and fire festivals, while on hand you have cocktails, DAR meetings and cocktails. the whole character develops a lot and there is a happy ending for more or less everyone. there are dramatic elements, but also a lot of witty humor. Rory's boyfriends are incredibly hot, as are her friend Lane's. Basically it's a cool, fun, very satisfying show that encompasses every aspect of life and gives you a feeling that if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you'll get what you want, even if it's not what you intended.
