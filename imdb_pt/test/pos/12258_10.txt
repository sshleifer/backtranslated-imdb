Broadcast news {dir. James L. Brooks, 1987} **** / **** <br /> <br /> Although it does not have the emotional impact of Brooks' first film, (Terms of Endearment) Broadcast News is a superlative film with exceptional performances from each of the three leaders and a screenplay that looks genuine and well researched as a compelling story. Let yourself know, this is a first character movie and a second satire. In my opinion, it succeeds at both levels on its own terms. The characters in the film receive astonishing depth and dimension, while satire remains cunning and never bitter. Comparisons to the network are unnecessary because movies have two completely different goals and attitudes. Although also a great movie, Network is a cynical and tired job; in other words, it is mad as hell and full of the state of television. The satire style of the network seems more extreme and guerrilla. In contrast, the characters who populate Broadcast News newsrooms love and live by their jobs (sometimes to the detriment of their love lives). They take pleasure in the tensions and satisfactions of reporting, just as the audience gets pleasure from watching. sweet and romantically realistic masterpiece.
