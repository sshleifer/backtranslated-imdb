Lead actor Yuko Tanaka meets both the exceptionally meditative "The Milkwoman," a quiet magazine about the chances lost in the life of a woman in her mid-50s, charting her routine with heartfelt and poignant motives. Thrown into the picturesque and tranquil city of Nagasaki, Akira Ogata's unconventional romantic film, so to speak, is a less direct melodrama than a deliberate introspection of the surrender of its characters to present life as a result of a tragic past that forced them , a choice they did not ask for. <br /> <br /> Perfectly incorporating the fatigue of the world undergoing a spiritless routine, Tanaka plays Minako Oba, a middle-aged woman who, before her shift in a supermarket, takes on the delivery of bottles of milk among the residents of Nagasaki Mountain. One of the houses she constantly passes to make such a delivery is that of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a local government official who takes care of her terminally ill wife (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita were school boyfriends who, thanks to an ignominious event about their parents, have separated since then. Opening his film with the narration of a young Minako promising never to leave Nagasaki, Ogata as such with the narrative, patiently with Minako while he, skillfully aided by Tanako's discreet and highly effective performance, whether she is having a chat with her aunt (Misako Watanabe) in being single, or when she runs up and down countless steps from her mountainous city to distribute milk - as she and Kaita gradually overcame the obstacles that separated them for years . This unhurried development may not be suitable for viewers based on fast-paced narratives, but for the rest, it is a sincere insight that affects powerfully and emphatically.
