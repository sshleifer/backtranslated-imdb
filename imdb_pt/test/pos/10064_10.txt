I had seen this movie before but could not remember it was fantastic: it has a fun storyline, Madonna gets in the way with the city, with cougars, etc., causing a commotion. And the music is just perfect! And the happy ending! Who is this girl is a great choice for a romantic like me. In my opinion, this could be the best Madonna movie I have ever seen! 10/10
