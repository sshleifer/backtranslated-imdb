<br /> <br /> This film is a summary of Visconti's obsessions: the decadence of nobility, death, aesthetic pursuit, homosexuality ... all mixed with melancholy mastery. At a slow pace just to make him more able to contemplate all his beauty (which is in music and images as well as in history), this is the kind of movie that we can no longer enjoy, brave, deeply personal and intelligent. The genuine fruit of a genius like Visconti.
