Dan Finnerty and Dan Band are so good that they should be seen to believe. Does anyone have a copy of Bravo's concert for sale? Please, if there is a future version, let's all know. I checked the Bravo website, but there is no set date for a performance repeated by the most choreographed guys, the band, the Dan Band. What great energy they exude, flinging themselves with the American-boy attitude, based on the butch sensibility being wrapped in sequins and tears, making men and women fall in love with them. I hope enough people can influence Bravo's powers to bring the show back into our lives, as a biannual event.
