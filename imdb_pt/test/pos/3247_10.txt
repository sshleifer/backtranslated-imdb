Before starting my review, here is a quick lesson on Australian slang that can help you see the movie and understand some of the other reviews from Australia and abroad. <br /> <br /> In Australian slang, "thongs" are a pair. of rubber sandals (not to be confused with the same American word for revealing undergarments), "stubbies" are a mark of Australian shorts, a "stubby" is a small beer can and a "stubby holder" is a foam insulation for a small bottle of beer. <br /> <br /> If you like black comedies about little criminals then you will love this movie unfortunately many people in IMDB with weak stomachs and no appreciation of black humor have reviewed this movie which unfortunately makes this movie seem more mediocre of what it is. Many reviewers have also compared it to Lock / Stock and Pulp Fiction, while it's the same genre, it's a completely different and original style. Many critics have also criticized this film for using Heath Ledger's dead brother to open and guide the narrative for this film without watching the movie close enough to realize that his brother was killed by the same villain who want to kill the character heaths, this is explained in the middle of the movie, but not clearly enough for most people to understand. <br /> <br /> This film is also reminiscent of Lock / Stock and Reservoir dogs in that it is the director's / scriptwriter's debut film, and for a debut film he ranks as well as these two films, in fact, like Lock / Stock and Reservoir Dogs, I rate this movie as a 10/10 for a director / writer debut, but unlike Tarantino and Ritchie Jordan, it does not live up to the expectations of his subsequent films like Ned Kelly. This movie is one that you definitely have to add to your DVD collection and it is one that holds up multiple views quite easily.
