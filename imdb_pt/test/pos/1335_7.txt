"Strike Force" or "The Librarians" is a fun action movie that does not take itself too seriously. William Forsythe stars as Simon, who is looking for a missing daughter from a wealthy client. He meets Sandi (Erika Eleniak), who is also looking for someone - his sister. But there are evil villains in progress. The most evil of them is Marcos Canarious (Andrew Divoff). Marcos likes to kill people. So now, Simon and Sandi have to unite to bring down the villains. The whole cast is great, with Divoff stealing the movie. There are also special guest appearances by Ed Lauter and Burt Reynolds. If you're looking for a good action movie, watch and enjoy.
