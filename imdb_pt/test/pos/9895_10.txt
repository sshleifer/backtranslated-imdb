A wonderful story that must be seen by all families. The values ​​of history, performance and production are all first-rate. I highly recommend "Checking Out!" <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is wonderful as an elderly actor who wants to decide when he will die, so he can continue to know how things will end and not be "a member of the audience." His three children rush to New York to confront him and try to change his mind. There are, of course, unresolved family problems to be solved, and the script and the actors deal well with them and with great humor. <br /> <br /> The story is about a Jewish family, but it could be about any other family. Well, maybe it's not a WASP family. The brothers have problems with each other and also with their father. I loved the writing and direction as well as the acting. All in all, a humorous and moving film.
