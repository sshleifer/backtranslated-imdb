When people talk about "they do not do them like they used to," all they have to do is point them to the comic horror and fantastically entertaining, screenwriter-director Glenn McQuaid. <br /> <br /> It's a tale of graverobbers (played by Dominic Monaghan and Larry Fessenden) who end up digging up more than just motionless and silent corpses. After the initial shock, they soon realize that they can really take advantage of the situation. And that's exactly what they try to do. Remember, it seems things may not have gone well as they planned when young Arthur (Monaghan) is relating his story to a priest (Ron Perlman) before being taken to the gallows. Looking at the details of his filmography, McQuaid seems to have taken the core of his first short film and expanded for that effort, which is not bad. Fessenden returns and does well, Monaghan is one of those guys who can still make you like him while he deals with the nefarious business of stealing from the dead and with other favorite genres like Perlman and Angus Scrimm in the movie scene. very fun for fans of genre. <br /> <br /> He also benefits from a unique and favorable design and appearance, sometimes moving from EC Comic panels to live action (the Creepshow) and always somehow feeling quite authentic in the sense of Horror of the Hammer. Maybe everything is covered with a lot of dry ice, but that's irrelevant. Whatever was done to capture everything in the movie, it works. It works fine. <br /> <br /> It may not have any real scare, but this movie has a great vein of dark humor and definitely absorbs every minute of macabre material that should please everyone who has patience for the horror that is a little quieter and looks like it definitely could have been made back in the days of Hammer. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: The flesh and the demons, the doctor and the devils, Show of horrors.
