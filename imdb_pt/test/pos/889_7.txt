Generated by the same partnership Monty Berman / Dennis Spooner who produced The Champions and Randall & Hopkirk (deceased) - the latter renamed My Partner the Ghost for the American market - Department S remains a classic example of the series of action and adventure that the Kingdom United produced. in mass during the late 1960s. Like these two shows, their inner dynamics of two boys and a girl may indicate a progressive attitude towards equality (Dept S also has a black upper), but it is mainly fa√ßade: the episode of release "Six Days" is barely half-finished before Rosemary Nichols is called to parade her bra, panties and a (yes, a) sock to get rid of a dishonest situation. Still, it's an interesting time capsule, even if the fashion sense of the Peter Wyngarde character (who, surprisingly, degenerated even more in the spin-off series Jason King) should definitely have remained buried.
