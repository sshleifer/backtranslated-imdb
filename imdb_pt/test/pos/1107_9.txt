The Australian Alex Frayne calls attention to his stranger, needing a meticulous, visually stunning reading Modern Love (2006). Following in the footsteps of a man unable to control a drastic change of personality, stimulated by the death of a close relative, offers a fascinating examination of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia. <br /> <br /> John (Mark Constable), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill) and his son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small southern town to care for the late uncle (Don Barker) property. As Emily and Edward walk into a local hotel, John begins to question locals about Uncle Tom's death - some say he committed suicide, some are unwilling to talk. Troubled John comes up with a theory of his own - Uncle Tom is alive and well, hidden in the nearby bushes. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the occasional lines of dialogue used to ease his heavy atmospheric tone, Modern Love could have been easily mistaken for a Sokurov movie. Filmed with a 16mm camera, its faded color scheme is strangely evocative of the Russian director's reflective incursions into human agony. Maybe it's not a coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival, where Modern Love made its debut. Looking beneath the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating images, however, reveals a slightly different image - while Sokurov's films tend to remain painfully intimate, to the point where they intentionally separate the main protagonists of the surrounding environment, blurring everything in a large yellow blur of the director's favorite, Modern Love greatly feeds the Australian countryside. John's gradual psychological transformation depends on this, and the more history advances, the more obvious it becomes that nature was an integral part of Frayne's vision. <br /> <br /> In Sokurov's Second Circle, a young man returns to the interior of Russia. bury his late father. In the hut where the old man lived, everything is covered in dust. He collects the few scattered old clothes and puts his father's body into a coffin. Then he says goodbye and buries him. The rest of the film is an extended reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, the loneliness and dissatisfaction that many face. <br /> <br /> In Modern Love, a little ironically, love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary, it is pain, loneliness and dissatisfaction with the "modernity" that suddenly invades the life of John. Unlike the Second Circle, however, here the main protagonist has the opportunity to re-embrace his modern life. His wife and son wait for him, but he walks away. Slowly but surely the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing past. <br /> <br /> I doubt that Frayne meant that Modern Love was so unbelievably similar to what Sokurov did in The Second Circle. However, the rhythm, and in particular the enigmatic framing, is precisely what turns this film into an almost meditative experience - a difficult and extremely fragile approach to deconstructing the human psychology that the two directors mastered with perfection. <br /> <br /> Mark Constable delivers top-level performance as John adds even more depth to his highly challenging character. Your facial expressions are excellent. Both Victoria Hill and William Traeger perfectly match the tense visual style of their performances.
