If I had to decide what was Ernest's best film, and not act as if that sort of thing did not happen all the time, it would be this. <br /> <br /> All of Ernest's films are fun. , but the best ones are the ones that make Jim Varney make several different characters. In addition, I am known for enjoying the comedy styles of Bill Byrge and Gailard Sartain as brothers Chuck and Bobby Tulip. "Ernest Goes to Jail" contains all these elements, as well as a funny script and supporting cast featuring various actors of beloved character. <br /> <br /> And that's why I chose "Ernest Goes to Jail" as the king of all Ernest's films. Disagree with me if need be, but deep down you know I'm right.
