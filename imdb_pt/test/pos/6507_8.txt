The omission of Jazzy Jeff, the creator of chirp scratch and transformers, raised a few eyebrows, but it's nice to see that it hit the DVD extras after all. With SCRATCH, Doug Pray, who previously reported the grunge phenomenon of the '90s in HYPE (1996), made an excellent documentary on the world of hip-hop DJ and the evolution of turntablism. His most recent documentary, INFAMY (2005), explores contemporary American graphite culture. After a couple of previews four years ago, my DVD had accumulated dust since then, but recently I watched again and beyond the subject, I was amazed at how well shot and edited this documentary really is. An immensely nice soundtrack too, not just talking heads, but lots of music, old school scenes, parties, break dancing, her name. One of the best things about the film is that it examines mainly where the art of turntablism is today (in 2001), without disregarding the pioneers, of course. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
