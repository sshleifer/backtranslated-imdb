Night hunter is a B-style action movie sold. Get a life and grow people. Don "the Dragon" Wilson is a kick boxer (hall of fame) and not an actor. If you're looking for an Oscar, you're not brother here. Looking for an action movie with a lower budget than with a low budget, that's it. The plot may have been a little thin, but what movie B is not. I understand that everyone is a critic and how the trash of one man is the treasure of another man. Get real people judging all the movies like you're an Oscar nominee, just silly. Awesome fight scenes, mixed with a new twist on vampire moves. See if you are a fan, rent something else if you are a hater.
