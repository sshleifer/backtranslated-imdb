So you want to be a rock star? Watch this movie. You do not like rock, you say? Or are you really into heavy metal? Then, put your favorite album and dream, this movie has nothing to offer. Rarely have I seen a movie being able to portray the dream of being in a rock band as good as that. I had long hair during the late 80's and early 90's, and I've been playing guitar for the past 15 years. I liked Rock Star? Oh yes. The music is good, not great, the actors are good and believable, even Jennifer Aniston does her part with perfection. And Mark Wahlberg is perfect as the aspiring rock singer. So you know what you will get. A movie about dreams coming true, being stepped on and finally finding out what life really is. It's a good solid seven out of ten, no more, no less.
