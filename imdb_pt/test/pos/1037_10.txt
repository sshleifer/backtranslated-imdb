I saw this series on PBS in 1980 in college and I still can not get it out of my head, although I have never seen it since. I remember all the cast members (the cast was perfect, as mentioned in other reviews), the design, the lighting and of course the story, which by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set. Probably the best TV series I've ever seen alongside the original "roots."
