From the beginning, you will not be able to look away and will not want to. "The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu) is one of the most entertaining anime I've seen in a long time. If you can look away from insane and sometimes wicked humor, it is easy to find a brilliantly constructed and masterfully executed work. Part of the brilliance comes from the fact that the episodes are not in chronological order. order, then you may not understand some of the things they talk at first, but as the series progresses you will find yourself saying "ah, so that's what they meant!" Even though this may confuse some people, after watching the program, you will have difficulty arguing against history in this way. <br /> <br /> After all, the focus is on the characters. The title character, Haruhi Suzumiya, is by far one of the most eccentric heroines of all anime's of all time. Her opening speech in her class, in which she declares that she "is not interested in normal humans," and is looking for "espers, aliens and time travelers," is absolutely bizarre, but she is adorable like that. <br /> /> Then there's Kyon, the "normal" guy who is pulled into the madness around Suzumiya-san. He is the narrator, and his quick wit always makes the scene a lot more fun. He finds himself trapped in the middle of various factions, all trying to influence Haruhi Suzumiya, and the other three characters are representatives of these factions; ironically, they are the very beings Haruhi is looking for, and yet they can not reveal themselves to her. <br /> <br /> The first is Yuki Nagato, a quiet girl who is the only member of the school's literary club. and also a representative of the Integration Reflection Entity; she is basically an alien, although the best description of it is a computer program in a human body. Your purely emotionless responses make you comically impassive and always make you think there is more to it than it seems. Then there is Mikuru Asahina, the time traveler who by chance is incredibly cute, a great ditz and the subject of Suzumiya's plans to announce his club, the SOS Brigade, to the world. The end result is that Suzumiya does things for her that border on sexual harassment, making her dress up in fetish uniforms. The final character is Koizumi Itsuki, the timid and perpetually optimistic philosopher who happens to be Haruhi's "esper", although he can only use his powers under certain conditions. <br /> <br /> The end result of all these characters is a comedy unlike any other, which is both coarse and deep, and always brilliant. Do not believe me? Watch the first episode, your "student movie". You'll see what I mean.
