"Tourist Trap" is a genuinely scary low-budget horror movie that will surely satisfy horror fans. It contains an extremely strange atmosphere and there are some rather bewildering moments of total dread and fear. Some scenes are absolutely bizarre for example there are a scene when Chuck Connors sits down to dinner with a mannequin that comes to life and begins to talk to him before his head falls. There is very little blood, but violence is quite strong for horror movies. The mannequins look very sinister. the climax is horrible. David Schmoeller has returned to several other genre films, including "Crawlspace", "Puppet Master" and "Netherworld". Still, "Tourist Trap" is definitely your best horror movie, so if you want to be scared, gem the look.9 out of 10.
