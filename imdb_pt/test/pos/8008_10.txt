Of all the Bat movies, Batman Returns is my favorite. This cute, dark and funny movie is one of Tim Burton's best works. Although it is very violent and darker, this is the Batman that the creator Bob Kane imagined many years ago. Michael Keaton reprises his role as Gotham City avenger. This time he faces two deadly enemies, Danny Devito's penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's catwoman. With a great cast and soundtrack from Danny Elfman, the film takes us on an adventure as Batman battles the evil forces that are trying to take Gotham City. Christopher Walken makes a great appearance as Max Shrek, an astute businessman who has an evil scheme up his sleeve. But of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is the one who steals the show. With all these components, you have a movie that will surprise you. This is the reason why you go to the movies. It has everything. It's really a shame that Tim Burton has not been able to direct the other sequences. If so, I think the franchise would still be strong today. Batman Returns is an incredible experience for fans who like cool movies.
