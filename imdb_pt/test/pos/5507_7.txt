This off-beat horror movie seems to be getting nothing but negative reviews. My question is; because? I think this movie is very good. Dee Snider did very well for his first (and only) driving time. He also plays the antagonist, Captain Howdy (Carelton Hendriks). This movie seems to have a vision of the future. Although it was launched in 1998, it seems to be about modern issues. Internet predators seems to be the underlying plot here. Although taken to another level, this is an issue we still face today. I admit, the story was short sometimes, but that does not make it a bad movie. Robert Englund is even in this movie, which automatically does better. The acting was not bad, the characters were very good too. Hendriks was a good antagonist, I think. I give this horror off-beat a 7/10. Recommend to fans of Saw.
