Any movie featuring Bonnie Hunt, Sarah Silverman and Amy Sedaris in the supporting cast has to be well deserved, and actor Jeff Garlin takes advantage of the fantastic talent he has enlisted for his 2007 directing debut, a comedy about being overweight. man who feels out of tune with the world around him. Familiar with Larry David's manager Jeff, in "Curb Your Enthusiasm," Garlin plays James, a troubled 39-year-old actor from Chicago who still lives with his widowed mother. His self-esteem is so low that he can not meet women, but it's the comic way he sees his unique status that makes his dilemma involve. If the plot sounds a little familiar, it's because the film is partly a tribute to Ernest Borgnine's 1955 classic, "Marty," about a lonely butcher from the Bronx living with his nosy mother. In fact, Garlin uses "Marty" as the piece that James is desperate to do, since he is so empathetic with the situation of the character. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a kind of love story in this new millennium, and Silverman plays Beth, a sexually voracious ice cream worker who leads him into a marathon for underwear shopping. Their best scene together is at their favorite convenience store, where they improvise different characters in different aisles. Hunt plays a solitary teacher who shares a passion with James for jazz musician Ben Webster. They meet accidentally in a record store and then again on a career day at his school where he hilariously exposes his sexual neuroses in front of a first-grade classroom, including his daughter Penelope (played by the Dakota Fanning look-alike) . younger sister Elle). In an interlaced tip and looking a bit like Jerri Blank, Sedaris plays the school counselor who talks to James after his inappropriate monologue. David Pasquesi plays Luca, a retirement manager, and his scenes with Garlin have an easy relationship that makes their friendship easy to believe. Almost stealing the film is the character actress Mina Kolb, who plays James's mother with the courage and courage. <br /> <br /> There are also unexpected things from teen idol Aaron Carter and Gina Gershon (do not ask, but the set-up is funny) as well as plays by director Paul Mazursky (as the snaky director of a "Smear Job"), Tim Kazurinsky (as the innocent victim of the show) and Dan Castellaneta (as the owner of a convenience store he loves very much). With their lamentable crises of insecurity and self-loathing, Garlin's comedic sensibilities resemble those of Albert Brooks, and casual conversation at its best reminds me of "Modern Romance" and "Defending Your Life." The persistent problem I had with the movie is the rhythm, since some scenes are dragged more than necessary. The problem is most evident in the first half of the year, when Garlin is trying to set the right pace, and the lack of real conflict increases slowness. Regardless, what he does well is to capture that sense of despair one feels about the revelation that life is not what it should be, that a meaningful other may be out of reach, and that a steady diet of junk food is consumed car hood is the only thing certain when it comes to gratification.
