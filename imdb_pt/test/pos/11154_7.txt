Like many movie stars as their careers calmed down, many turned to the television where they probably got their reputation for posterity. Donna Reed is a case in point. <br /> <br /> I do not think Donna Reed thought Donna Stone was challenging, not for a woman who won an Oscar for playing a very different type in From Here. to Eternity. She was certainly better prepared to play the wife, mother and housewife Donna Stone after playing Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life. <br /> <br /> Donna has always been beautiful and wise and has always helped with the problems of her children and her husband. Carl Betz was not an idiot, he was a pediatrician who had his office attached to the house. Talk about the man being always ready in a crisis. <br /> <br /> Although this was the Donna Reed Show, because Donna's husband at the time, Tony Owen produced. However, it lasted as long as due to the popularity of their two children, Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen. Fabares had that bestseller Johnny Angel, which she presented on the show. She made the transition to the successful adult star, best known for her role in Coach as the wife of Craig T. Nelson. <br /> <br /> But Petersen was a teen idol chewing gum back in the day. The Donna Reed Show dares say I have the majority of viewers because of it. It's forgotten now, but Petersen also had a record sales, Dad. It did not do as well as Johnny Angel. <br /> <br /> Now Paul Petersen runs a support group for former child stars like him. Many of them end up so tragically, it's a good job he's doing. <br /> <br /> The Stone family was the quintessence of Central America. They lived in a suburb near Chicago, leading healthy lives. Mom and Dad were always there for the kids. Of course the problems they used were no more than breaking the curfew. <br /> <br /> It is this series that I believe to be the model for the TV city of Pleasantville, where Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are sucked. <br /> <br /> I have pleasant memories of The Donna Reed Show. Easy to take, but not too serious.
