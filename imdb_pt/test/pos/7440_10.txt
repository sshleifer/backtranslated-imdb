Hey, I think this movie was great and had great graphics and I was glad they used the final fantasy 7 I think this game was the best I've ever played, it's a great movie and I loved it. , but maybe they should use the ether final fantasy 7 again or the final fantasy 10 there both are pretty cool from: Tyler Sheena I hope you can email me back if you have any detail if there is another .people for any one reading this I suggest you see this movie is lively, but it seems quite realistic and has incredible fight scenes that I do not see as fast to fight in a movie for a long time. The final fantasy 7 game is also really great, not good graphics, but it's really fun and challenging
