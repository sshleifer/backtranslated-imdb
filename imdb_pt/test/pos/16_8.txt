I went to a preview of the movie thinking that I was about to embark on 120 minutes of stupid plotting, foolish plot and the kind of nauseating acting that made "The Postman" one of the most evil displays of cinematic errors of our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a movie starring Costner that drew the public's soul. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could play such a serious role. Shocked that a movie starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions. Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion. Kutcher seems to have stirred up the serious performance he played in "Butterfly Effect." These two actors came into this film with a serious and focused attitude that shone on what I thought was one of the best movies I've seen this year. No, it's not a movie worthy of the Oscars. It's not a movie of epic or deep social commentary. On the contrary, it is a story about a simple topic, illuminated in a way that takes that audience to a higher level of empathy than possible thinking. That's what I think good cinema is and I, at least, am impressed with this work. Angry!
