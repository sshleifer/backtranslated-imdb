I have to admit that I have prejudice about my vote in this film, but I have strong reasons because I know some of the true stories that have received the Hollywood treatment here. Edna Ferber's novel on which this is based is an era in which real names can not be used. In a way, this movie is all smoke and mirrors. Even though it was released in 1946, it was filmed shortly after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman is more radiant in this movie as a brunette. <br /> <br /> She plays a beautiful woman who is trying to trade for her beauty to get a rich husband. Today this is a gold digger, but in this social age she is desirable and the kind of woman who makes all men want her, and all the old types of society talk about her and avoid her, wishing they were her. Ingrid is at her best and plays well this role. Some sympathy for Ingrid's character is raised in the New Orleans section of this film as she gets a decent late grave for her scandalized mother as part of the arrangement by her relatives to get her out of New Orleans. The snobby family of relatives is so scandalized by her that they will do almost everything she asks to get her out of town. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper is good in this movie, although he already seems to be aging a bit to play a fearless Texan bachelor / gambler. He pulls it off well, considering that disadvantage he looked older than he was due to his real life chain smoking. Flora Robison as Ingrid's Maid was nominated for an Oscar as a supporting actress in this film. Jerry Austin, as Cupidor, has been neglected in many respects for his role, but is the only comic relief in the film and does it well. <br /> <br /> When the film moves to Saratoga, it accurately shows the importance of Saratoga. At that time. I like the sequence when Bergman walks to Saratoge Spring to get some of the "sulfuric" water that everyone thought was so healthy back then. When she takes a little, she forces herself not to make a face and comments how good she is and that she should have more. <br /> <br /> The true story is the railroad battle that actually took place on the Tunnel railway line, New York - which is the real Saratoga Trunk from which the title of the film is derived. This battle took place in 1869 between the agents of Andrew Carnagie and J. P. Morgan. The line was the economic key to the country in 1869, connecting the country of coal and the east coast. The references to him throughout the film are very real. There is even a dialogue that describes Carnagie as a "Scotsman," although the reference is vague and unknown to anyone who does not know the story around the battle. <br /> <br /> The railroad and tunnel rail in Tunnel, New York (ZIP 13848) still exist, although the film was filmed in California. The actual tunnel is about 1 mile long. It is still part of an important freight line today, years after this occurred. I grew up there. Gary Cooper's line in the movie while he's riding the train into the tunnel is right, it's still "pretty country".
