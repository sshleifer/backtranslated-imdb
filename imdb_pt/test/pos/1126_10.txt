... I can not believe I was hooked on this show instantly, after seeing the first scene I was in the background. <br /> <br /> Anyway, first of all guys are hot, Cappy, Evan, Calvin, Fischer, Cappy, Heath, Cappy etc. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the girls are cute , sexy, intelligent and not afraid to be called a bitch. I like it. Which, at the same time, does not make them mean and greedy, just realistic. <br /> <br /> Third, relationships are great, especially Casey and Cappy. Lately, each show is far removed from its original path and people end up with someone who was not even in the first season. Cappy's relationship with Casey is true love, a tough guy. They loved each other over the years and did not end when a guest star appeared. <br /> <br /> In today's world it may be unbelievable that two people have loved each other for a long time, but it does. And people define themselves in college, so I knew exactly who I wanted to be in college with. So is Casey and Cappy. <br /> <br /> I HOPE THERE IS MANY MORE SEASONS OF THIS SHOW AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN SEE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CASEY AND CAPPY NOW THAT THEY MAY POSSIBLY STAY TOGETHER, on Thanksgiving Day ... I love this show
