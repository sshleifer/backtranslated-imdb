FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN is a prime example of an anti-80 film. While many other films of the decade generally had no substance, this film is pure substance. There is nothing elegant, false or superfluous about it. He boasts two superb performances: Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as long time friends, Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee, respectively. Hutton, Penn and Tom Cruise were a triumvirate of actors from the early 80's who all looked for much bigger and better things (all 3 starring in TAPS). While Penn and Cruise's popularity skyrocketed, Hutton was forgotten, and that's a shame. In fact, Hutton is the first of the 3 to win an Oscar for supporting the role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980, but I think his performance in this film is even more remarkable. <br /> <br /> Hutton really captures the post-Vietnam rebellion of war in his character Chris Boyce. A failed seminary student, Chris has a love-hate relationship with his father, well played by the great actor Pat Hingle. The scene in which Chris quotes the poem his father thought he had long forgotten is a particularly powerful one. <br /> <br /> Chris gets a job at the Department of Defense and uses his hatred of the US government and his foreign policy. to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the Soviets. He manages to get his friend Daulton, a self-serving hyper-drug dealer, to be the messenger of the microfilm project plans. While Chris is doing this based on his beliefs, Daulton is doing it strictly for the money. The Soviet liaison is excellently interpreted by David Suchet. Penn and Suchet have a real peculiar chemistry and it is a kind of funny set of exchanges between them. But make no mistake, this movie is anything but. It's a serious study of the character about pessimism, malaise, paranoia, and mistrust. <br /> <br /> Again, the protagonists make this movie. Hutton offers a brilliantly understated performance as Chris, an intelligent young man who had a lot of potential. Penn, as usual, makes a tremendous characterization as Daulton, a pathetic loser who acts before thinking, and most often thinks of nothing. The end of this fact-based film is very sad on several levels. A truly powerful character study.
