I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years ago in high school. I thought it was a thought-provoking movie that made you want to look at the power behind puzzles. I think the kind of person who would not like this movie would be those who do not like solving things, or those who get frustrated when they can not solve puzzles. is a good movie based on a true story that happened in my hometown of Toronto, Ontario. So, if you want a real record of things happening in the alleys, watch this movie. And for those who only watch movies to point out faults and character defects, realize that in real life, this same thing happens. but that's all I want to say about it. The puzzles are good, some are difficult, some are not. But the movie also leaves you wanting more, more puzzles, more explanations, just more. Something else I want to add, is that the ideas within this film, the world of the underground puzzle, exist, but there is much more than that. To find it, you can not search for it. Never look for it, there would be no way to find it. Leave your mark and she will find you.
