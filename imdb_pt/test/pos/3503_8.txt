Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film does not reach almost the quality of the TV show, it is still very funny and has some very serious moments! I liked Ali G since the first time I saw the program material. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time ... with Peter Dragon ("Action") and The Blues Brothers. The biggest surprise with this movie was that they really got serious actors for it (Dance and Gambon). After that, I will respect them even more, for having the good sense to take this opportunity. I have nothing really bad to say about this movie, it's very funny. Very juvenile, but hey, so what? <br /> <br /> One more thing for mr. G: SEQUEL, PLEASE! ****
