I do not think I'm alone when I say that 2005 was not particularly kind to the horror genre. While "Cursed", "Hide and Seek", "The Ring Two" and "The Amityville Horror" showed glimpses of interest and potential, there were more mistakes than successes. As proof, see: "White Noise", "Boogeyman", "The Jacket", "Mindhunters" and "Alone in the Dark". Imagine my surprise when "House of Wax," written with brothers Chad and Carey Hayes, turned out to be ... well, a surprise. Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) is a young woman, traveling with her troublesome brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray) and boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki). They are, along with Paige (Paris Hilton), Blake (Roberto Ri'chard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams), hoping to win tickets for the last football game of the season. Along the way, they are faced with some problem in the car, and are forced to enter a deserted city where nothing is what it seems to be. <br /> <br /> Upon hearing this, a remake of the classic Vincent Price B-movie, I rolled my eyes. I did not even want to think about the disaster that the director of freshmen Jaume Serra had prepared for the public. At a time when most high-profile horror films are disappointments, latent with poor writing, static direction and amateur acting, I consider myself lucky for Serra and the Hayes brothers have been in charge of making a good, old-fashioned ghost festival. . Contrary to the disappointments I've named before, this movie does not punch, and uses all the cinematographic tricks of the book to give everyone exactly what they've come up with. <br /> <br /> I'm glad the Hayes really did spend the time. and effort to create friendly and credible characters, making events much more urgent. It also gives the young actors who portray them something. As she did in "The Next Next Door," Elisha Cuthbert demonstrates to the public that she really is a skilled actress. In the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Jessica Biel silenced the pessimists, presenting a raw emotional performance that put the viewer right there with her. Here, Cuthbert does the same. Chad Michael Murray ("A Cinderella Story"), in one of his earliest mature roles, is no longer lazy as Nick. Murray emanates a charisma and a hard edge, as well as an impressive athleticism on top of her. Murray and Cuthbert combine perfectly and have a tangible family chemistry. More than anything else, the press and the American public made a day out on the premiere of Paris Hilton's main performance. As I expected, Hilton is not ashamed. In fact, she's as good as anyone else in the movie (do with what you want). Like Cuthbert and Murray, Hilton has a presence on screen. She's sexy and playful. I can not think of one reason why she received the worst of the hard reception of the movie, unless they simply torment her. Jared Padalecki (TV's "Gilmore Girls") managed to memorize his role. Robert Ri'chard ("Cousin Skeeter") and Jon Abrahams ("Meet the Parents") do not have much to work with, but they do the work. With just one scene, Damon Herriman ("Soar") makes an unforgettable impression, and his presence hangs over the rest of the film. Finally, Brian Van Holt ("Basic") is superb and menacing in a dual role. <br /> <br /> Once again, compliments should go to writers to avoid clich√©s whenever possible. Despite popular opinion, "House of Wax" is quite unpredictable for most of its runtime. Take this for example: it looks like the killer is down and Carly bends down to retrieve something from her pockets. What do you expect to happen? Watch the movie and you'll understand what I mean. It's also refreshing to see a horror movie in which the characters even show a little common sense. <br /> <br /> Unlike most horror scores, the stimulating work of John Ottman never distracts. However, just like the other Dark Castle releases, the visual aspects of "Wax" are worthy of prize and elevate the film above its gender traps. The talents of cinematographer Stephen F. Windon, production designer Graham Walker, art director Nicholas McCallum and editor Joel Negron highlight the macabre imagery. Talking about pictures, I believe that injured dogs will be delighted with the many make-up effects and tricks to come. Each death scene is more twisted of the stomach than the last one. Considering his past in music videos and commercials, it is obvious that Jaume Serra has a keen eye for style. His "in-your-face" approach is a great asset to the success of this film. Only when you think the camera will flip, that does not happen. He is also particularly good at building thick layers of dread and atmosphere. One prominent shot is our introduction to the killer, as he slowly emerges from a trapdoor. <br /> <br /> In a case like this, I would usually admit it when I was in the minority (shut up, okay? I liked "House of 1000 Bodies"!). In this case, I firmly believe that the detractors misunderstood. I'm not sure why people are so harsh with this movie, considering it's a lot better than the recent genre entries. Maybe they're afraid to admit that a horror movie starring Paris Hilton might be worth watching ... Who knows? This is a horror movie, and an elegant and effective style. As a lifelong horror fan, all I can say is that I really enjoyed "House of Wax" in all its sarcastic and sadistic glory. I safely consider it a great achievement in modern terror, as well (along with "Sin City") the first completely satisfactory release of 2005.
