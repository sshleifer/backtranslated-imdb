I rented this gem several times! It is a small but somewhat comprehensive masterpiece, taking the spectator of the Manhattan glow to the beauty of the Greek islands. John Cassavetes on the screen marriage with his wife in real life Gena Rowlands is in trouble. He finds meaning in an adventure with Susan Sarandon whom he meets in Greece while his daughter, played in her oldest role by puberty Molly Ringwald, falls in love with the son of the Greek naval magnate who is courting his mother on a neighboring water yacht. Meanwhile, the immensely talented Raul Julia plays a shepherd who lives in a cave with his Sony Trinitron. He has the hots for Molly Ringwald's character until he is confronted by John Cassavetes. Everything comes together at the end of a classic closing scene, where everything is reconciled. Raul Julia, the goat herder, is seen dancing with his goat. This movie is full of mysticism, beauty, young and old love, humor, sensuality and more. Look!
