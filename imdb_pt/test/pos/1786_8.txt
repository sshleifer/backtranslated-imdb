One year after her first triumphant special, "My Name Is Barbra," Barbra Streisand regrouped with her production team to produce this follow-up special to CBS-TV in the then-revolutionary color. First broadcast in March 1966, "Color Me Barbra" follows a format similar to its predecessor - three segments, the first two with unique concepts. The first takes place in the halls of the Philadelphia Museum of Art after hours, dressed as a period maid, she wanders through the galleries and becomes part of the work of art through music. In many ways, Streisand expresses a variety of modes, from the "Waltz" schtick comedy to the "Non C'est Rien" melodrama in a Modigliani painting to the frenzy of the "Gotta Move" style set in abstract art. . My favorite moment in the special is when she turns into a dead Queen Nefertiti singer while singing an astonishing rendition of "Where or When" by Rogers and Hart. Opening with another comical monologue full of silly sequiturs, this time in French, the second segment is back in the studio for a brightly colored circus headline where she interacts with animals including her beloved Sadie . She finds an appropriate context for "Sam, you made the pants too long" with a bunch of penguins and comically compares your profile to an anteater with "We Have So Much in Common." As with the first special, the show ends with an exciting solo concert in which she sings some nuts, "Where Am I Going?" and "Beginning here, beginning now" between them. Also included is the brief introduction she filmed in 1986, ironically dressed in white, when the special was first released on VHS. The juxtaposition of venue and music is even more effective than its first special, and a 23-year-old Streisand is in great shape.
