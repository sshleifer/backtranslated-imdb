The film is excellent. Performance, cinematography, direction and music are fascinating. It seems to me that the reason so many give the film a low score is because of their devotion to the original 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - has generated an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking to people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something like the first movie "Starwars" in modern times. I saw that. It was and is wonderful. But that does not mean that this version is not worthy. From the first scene, the 1973 version grabs you. The noise and the tumult are fantastic, especially in the way they prepare you for the peace of Shangri La. And the music of Burt Bacharach is beautiful. So - by all means, enjoy the 1937 version. But do not let that disturb your appreciation of this 1973 version any more than you would have allowed the 1935 King Kong to destroy Peter Jackson this year.
