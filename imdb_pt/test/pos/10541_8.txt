I know what you're saying, "Oh man, Pinochio is not scary!" but this film goes beyond much more than a maniac pinocchio. Behind him tells the story of a mother and daughter who is strangely attached to her doll Pinnochio, who seems to talk to her. The strange thing is that no one else can hear the doll except her. In the end, it's shocking the revelation that, like me, it will shock you. Watch. Give it a chance.
