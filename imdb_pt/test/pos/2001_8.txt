Here is one of the most pleasantly scuzzy 70's blaxploitation grindhouse items; is a low-rent pimp opus that appears as a more vulgar version of "The Mack." John Daniels, the hairdressing hero of womanizer Mr. Jonathan in the immortal "Black Shampoo", gives an excellent portrait of Baron Steel, a cruel, business dexterity, forever an all-powerful carnival that to the despair of its bitter Italian rivals and brutal reigns supreme on the Sunset Strip. When you do not lock horns with your fellow criminals or do your best to avoid being arrested by local cops, Daniels is leading a sweetly ordinary existence as his standard suburban garden guy (complete with loving wife and loving children!) In a small, typical Californian town. The grossly absurd premise by itself promises the vulgar grandeur of a decidedly assorted range of class B pictures (George Theakos deserves praise for his ridiculous hilarious script). Matt Cimber's laudable and tasteless delivery delivers the junky products through the viscous bucket, making this film an extremely nice bit of celluloid dirt. Among the numerous squalid pleasures to be tasted here are abounding free female nudity, rude dialogue, gorgeous Me Decade fabrics (tops, felt hats, sparkling Day-Glo jewelry, noisy costumes), an intense R & B of the Smoke, some desperately acted pathetic (the old lady who lives next to Daniels is terribly raucous), a memorable play by Patrick Wright as a sadistic fool, a couple of spectacular action pieces (the slow-motion climax massacre seriously cooked), plus A Sunset Strip than you can shake a good feather in (said the footage supposedly includes "the prostitutes and real blades of the Sunset Strip in Hollywood"), Ken Gibb's effectively somber cinematography, some fetish tableaux, some crude explicit violence prostitute has one of her cut breasts!), and entertaining support presentations per family schlock perennial feature Richard Kennedy and George "Buck "Flower like a pair of racist, corrupt and intimidating police detectives. Of course, this movie is not art, but it certainly is artistic enough to qualify as a deliciously dirty piece of sordid and entertaining cinematic entertainment.
