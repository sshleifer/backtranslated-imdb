This is a wonderful film that takes place during the romantic period of the Civil War. This movie is a must see for Eastwood Fans and Eastwood states that this is one of his favorite movies that he made. I could not agree more. Watch out! This is a spoiler- Eastwood dies in the end. Eastwood and director Don Siegel rightly argued that the ending should be unexpected and should be unfortunate for a few reasons. They wanted to keep the book, for example. Secondly, there can not always be a happy ending. Third, this was written during the Vietnam War - they wanted a negative statement for this terrible war in which people were dying unnecessarily. I agree with all this. It's a wonderfully filmed movie and I love most of the films involving the Civil War. It is yet another picture of how misleading women can be - that they can be more dangerous than men, hence the title has much to do with the claim of the film BEGUILED - to be deceived. The song sung by Eastwood at the beginning and end of the film is another statement against not only the Civil War but the Vietnam War and perhaps indirectly the women he encounters during the film. Wonderful story of love and deception and many memorable scenes - NOTE: This movie is rated R for no reason. There is virtually no language, probably some of the subjects involving sex - but there is really no nudity. Great movie - 9/10.
