This is one of the best and most underrated films for teenagers ever made. <br /> <br /> I've seen it grow and it was, and it's one of my favorites, maybe not as popular as "fast times" but just so great. <br /> <br /> There is a serious side to this movie, as mentioned by other critics, it starts out as a comedy and turns into a drama halfway. That's the beauty of it all and what sets it apart. You get it all. Humor (not unlike "fast times"), Drama, and a great soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I personally think every child about to enter high school should see this, would give an idea about the journey are about to embark. Cmon-what child watching this, would not be able to relate to SOMEONE in the movie? The fact that he becomes so serious in the middle of the road is also cool and simply well done. You do not even see that happening. Definitely lots of surprises. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW. <br /> <br /> Great, slappping humor in the knee. (Who could forget the scene?) Between Gary and Camilla?). I can still hear: "Oh my big and strong burrito !!" Invaluable !! <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes between Gary and Karin are difficult to watch (particularly the final scene of the coarse). There are so many women like Karen out there who would have made exactly the same choice as her. Think about it - how many women reject men with hearts of gold (like Gary) for idiots? I know I've done it already and I have many women I know. This film will inspire discussions and, despite the countless times I've seen it, it still leaves me full of admiration for the filmmakers and artists. Everyone will find someone to relate to in this movie or what is more likely than more than one person. <br /> <br /> Finally, the music used is great (a lot of Cars, u2, many obscure (now) 80's songs. - one of purist dreams of the 80's. But make no mistake, it's not the music that makes this movie unique, it's the story itself, pure and simple. One of the best of its kind and a classic teen movie.
