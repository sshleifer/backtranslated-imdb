A very funny look at some of Australia's current affairs and political events. The Chaser boys really seem to have fun with this show, and what I like is that they all have their strength; some are brilliant (Chas) in making complete idiots of themselves, while Julian can make the kind of humor "I'm interviewing a famous politician and I'm about to suggest that he disguises himself as a pot of jelly." They have great segments in the show, drawing attention to every aspect of Australian culture, such as our current programs, our TV Adverts programs and Early Morning. Some material is a bit tired and predictable, but overall it's a lot of fun to watch, and it will leave you with a smile on your face.
