This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's previous films and it sure has an unconventional theme. She is making money by dancing with men in a dance hall. She really does not like work, but it's a life. Her boyfriend seems to be a really cool guy, but she's also chased by the rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after getting married, it turns out that her "cool guy" is a rich, womanish ferret, and the rich Cortez turns out to be a guy. At the end of the film, Barbara simply had enough, since any SANE woman would come out of this horrible marriage. In the 1920s and early 1930s, Hollywood did pretty much everything it wanted and some of its kids. movies had themes or scenes that would surprise many today - such as nudity, adultery, and bad language. Although TEN CENTS A DANCE is not a blatant example of this morality, it has a theme that would never have been allowed after the hardened Production Code was created and applied from 1934. In a way, the Code was great - after all , parents did not have to worry about what their children saw in the movies (such as nudity in BEN HUR, 1925). However, it also tended to over-sanitize the films - and there is no way that this particular film was produced and approved because it tends to glorify divorce - a serious no-no-1934 and after that. That's a shame really, since I do not think TEN CENTS A DANCE is bad to discuss it - especially since the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a womanizer thief. Even so, allowing the movie to end with her getting divorced and marrying a man who has twice divorced simply could not have been. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. In addition, it was well paced and suited to its relatively short runtime. Take a look at this. <br /> <br /> FYI - Unfortunately, Ricardo Cortez was not Hispanic, but changed his name because of a possible prejudice because he was Jewish. He was a great leading man of his time, but today he is almost forgotten.
