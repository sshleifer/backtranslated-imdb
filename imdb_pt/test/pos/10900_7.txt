This is the way to be a top movie. The opening section, which mimics Hollywood's "social mess" movies, is absolutely brilliant. It's a riot from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The second section, which introduces us to the main characters of the story, is also great. We have a lot of great comic settings, high level performances, and the dialogue is really dynamic. <br /> <br /> The only one that really bothered me about this movie though, is the ending, which I think contradicts everything that happened before. My interpretation was that this movie was taking the mickey out of all the silly biases and gossip hints of small towns and national tabloid sensationalism. I loved that the film defended the cause of a person's sexuality NOT being determined by their hobbies, idiosyncrasies, fashion sense or anything else. And then the ending goes and reinforces all the gossip and stereotypes that the movie successfully satirized in the first place. It turns out everyone was 100% right !!! (godamit!) This was very disappointing for what was really a great story.
