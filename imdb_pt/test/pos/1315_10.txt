This is a film that must be seen and treated as a work of art. This is a love work by the Schrader brothers about the life of Yukio Mishima that is full of truly artistic elements. The film jumps from color to black and white, from past to present, fictional works of Mishima to it. All without being confused at all. The only thing that gets me is that the whole movie, except for the spoken parts of the narrator, is in Japanese. Still a masterpiece that deserves an audience, but did not find it won. Criterion, if you are reading this, this is a movie that should be released under your brand with as many extras as possible. This truley movie deserves more. 10/10
