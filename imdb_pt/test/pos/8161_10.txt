Without a doubt, the most impressive gay film I have ever seen. C. Jay Cox hit the nail on the head with this. The way he handled the issues surrounding faith, family, and sexuality was very well done. Casting was perfect. Wes Ramsey did a fantastic job at taking the character out of Christian and Steve Sandvoss will be hitting his socks in the role of Aaron. Both brought an incredible amount of realism to the roles and impacts these issues have on young gay men. As a gay man who grew up in a very religious (though not a Mormon) environment, identification with Aaron's character was phenomenal for me. Strongly recommend this film to anyone, true or false, who is interested in how young gay people have to deal with family and friends in an often hostile world. By the way, the music in this movie rocks! Another great work by C. Jay Cox.
