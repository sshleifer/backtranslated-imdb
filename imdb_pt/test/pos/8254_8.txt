I provided location services on the movie every Sunday we filmed at Berkeley Square in London. David Niven always the gentleman liked the role, unfortunately, to be the last. We had a moment of panic when a torrent of Krugerrands (released for the film) knocked down a storm drain. <br /> <br /> Imagine a frantic crew opening all the pipes to retrieve the last. If you know and love London, you'll love this comedy joke - also begins Richard Jordan, who unfortunately died of a brain tumor. A good movie, great team, great cast. look at the current street stars of the coronation, then playing scenes of the crowd or extras.The lot of cars and retail companies of Ivan were all filmed in West London, Chiswick the entire shopping parade and lot of used cars Americans were dressed at night, the car lot is still there as are the shops. A restaurant was suddenly transformed into a funeral home. If you see the movie in the listings, make an effort to see it! By the way, Sally Harrison, the Bank's receptionist, was married to production designer Tony Curtis. <br /> <br /> April 2007 I thought I'd like to add some extra comments about the places: <br /> <br /> Pub: next to Berkeley Square. Elke Sommers Cottage: at the back of the road, next to the Twickenham Film Studios, at Ivans Used Car Lot: along Chiswick High Street and all the shops near the roundabout. Workshops (conversion of armored vans) Factory at the roundabout opposite the Fullers Brewery Jail (see the workshops above) Telephone box see the Elke Sommers hut (it was the wooden box used in many movies, look for the floor lighting cable and the hinges Wood Honeywells near Olympia Graveyard - Chiswick - Grave off the boundary in common Interior bench, empty ceiling and strongroom: Twickenham studios <br /> <br /> And just to add David Niven always the gentleman, played and mixed with the crew, extras and so on ...... Niven would dine at the Connaught Hotel bu join the crew for the coffee!
