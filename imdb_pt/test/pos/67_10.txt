This Blake Edwards movie is not sure whether it wants to be a comedy, a drama or a musical. No matter, the mere presence of Julie Andrews is reason enough to see this sitcom comedy and musical espionage comedy. Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired, but he's more than good, like Julie's romantic interest. Authentic World War I cars and airplanes add to the appeal. Overall, the movie is a lot of fun. The DVD release is an edited version (by Blake Edwards) of the original version. Supposedly, this is the only version Edwards would allow; but, Turner Classic Movies showed the full version (theatrical version) recently. Recommended.
