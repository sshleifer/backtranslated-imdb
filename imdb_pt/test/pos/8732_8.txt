CACTUS FLOWER was a delightful 1969 comedy based on a piece by Neil Simon about a dentist (Walter Matthau) having an affair with a free-spirited young woman (Goldie Hawn), totally unaware that her dedicated nurse / assistant (Ingrid Bergman) is in love with him. Matthau can play this kind of role while sleeping and does not disappoint like the rampant dentist, Dr. Julian Winston, who is dating a woman but has no idea he is in love with another. Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for her sparkling performance as Toni Simmons, the flower child who ages slowly and realizes she's stuck on a dead-end issue and not as obscure as she looks on the surface. But the real pleasure for me in this film was the performance of the legendary Ingrid Bergman as Stephanie Dickinson, Dr. Winston's completely dedicated assistant who is willing to bury and sacrifice her own happiness while Dr. Winston is happy with Tony. Bergman is bright in this film, looking absolutely gorgeous (though the camera has always loved her) and showing an unforeseen talent for light comedy. Yes, the dialogue and settings are a bit dated, but the story is timeless and the performances of the stars become imminently watchable.
