"The Cell" is a rather difficult film to sort through. If you read the outline of the plot, "a psychotherapist travels within a serial killer in a coma in the hope of saving his last victim," you may think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that does not really do justice to the movie. There is a fantasy aspect inside the subconscious minds that is impressive with luxurious visuals and incredible active mind scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez before she becomes an exclusively romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child inside and witnesses her terrifying upbringing. And there is definitely a facet of terror due to the unhealthy actions of the serial killer's evil persona. The film attempts to function on many different levels and crosses the boundaries of the genre at will. While I feel like it's a fairly bizarre experience, I think it's completely fascinating. <br /> <br /> From the opening credits, with Lopez riding a horse across the desert unbelievably dressed in a white dress, you'll know you're in for a visual treat. Every time the public leaves reality and follows it into the subconscious depths of their "patients," they guarantee a feast of visual and auditory pleasure. Fantasies are wonderful creations of angles and colors. The camera leaves regularities at the door and crosses a world where the ups and downs are the same. The characters become rulers of their own realms and become creatures worthy of such stature. If you do not like anything else about "The Cell", you will certainly be impressed by the work put into these scenes. <br /> <br /> The cast is also top-notch. Jennifer Lopez is at her element here, using her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities, while blending her own striking looks with lush surroundings, makeup and fantasies. She is incredibly sexy and I personally would like someone to find another role for her out of the world of the rom-with which she was shaped and that would allow her to experience more. Vince Vaughn is quite convincing as an FBI agent who will do anything to save the life of a young woman. But it is undoubtedly Vincent D'Onofrio who has the biggest impression here. It is an extremely difficult role, as it must bring multiple emotions within the viewer. We were disgusted with his actions, but sympathetic to him because of the trauma he experienced during his lifetime. He seems magnificently powerful within his realm, though unsafe and vulnerable within the real world. It's a great performance for an underrated actor. <br /> <br /> While "The Cell" does not work so well on all levels, it ambitiously tries (some of the characters' actions are not believable) and although it's all based on some rather fragile scientific logic, it's a journey occasionally shocking, visually striking head that rewards various visions.
