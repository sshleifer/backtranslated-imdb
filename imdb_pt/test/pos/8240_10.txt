This little-known comedy from Ruth Gordon's hit piece is a delight. The script, based on the game, is spicy, rich and completely undated. Ditto the cast, but I must emphasize the work of the protagonist, Irene Dunne. Irene is simply superb - as usual - and illuminates the screen with every frame she's in (and she's very into it, thanks to the sky). In addition, director Vidor has given her some unusual close-ups that are fascinating. What a heartthrob! I do not know of any other Hollywood actress of any age who has versatility and is so compelling in every movie. Why it remains so little known is a mystery. I've seen most of his films and this was a surprise, even for a solid ID fan like me. See, everyone!
