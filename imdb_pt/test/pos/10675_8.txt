'Doppleganger' (or 'Journey Away from the Sun' as it is best known) was written (with the contribution of the late Donald James) and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, better known for his television 'Supermarionation' shows how 'Thunderbirds '. <br /> <br /> The international space agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun, and proposes that a manned flight be sent there. The committee rejects the exorbitant cost and files the project. But when a security leak in the agency is discovered, fearing that the Russians may arrive first, the project gets a green light. <br /> <br /> American astronaut Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) joins British scientist John Kane. (Ian Hendry) After weeks of exhausting training, the Phoenix takes off into the unknown. <br /> <br /> Three weeks later, the ship falls into what appears to be a mountainous and gloomy landscape. Ross survives, but Kane is seriously injured. A light is seen moving towards them ... <br /> <br /> I'll leave the synopsis here. Up until this point, the film was thrilling, with excellent special effects (by Derek Meddings) and music by Anderson's resident composer Barry Gray (why it was not issued in C.D. is a mystery). But when Ross and Kane fall and we discover the secret of the alien world - it's a duplicate of ours, they're all the same, the only big difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting and ends with a shattering anti-climax. I think cinema was the wrong place to make that idea, actually Gerry & Sylvia later did something similar on their 'Space: 1999' show. Ross risks (and ultimately loses) his life in an effort to return to Earth - his Earth. But why? The new Earth is so similar that he might not have bothered. <br /> <br /> Roy Thinnes recently made the television series 'The Invaders', and makes a competent presentation (sorry that there were no more scenes like the one where he queues with his wife). Ian Hendry is good as 'Kane', but disappears from history too soon. Several actors appeared at Anderson's 'U.F.O.' like Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and you'll miss Nicholas Courtney ('The Brigadier' ​​of 'Dr.Who' in a small role). But acting honors go to the late Patrick Wymark as "Jason Webb," head of Eurosec. The character is not far from 'Sir John Wilder', which he played in 'The Power Game' of A.T.V. Webb is such a torturous character that he is wonderful to watch. Herbert Lom's contribution (as a spy with a camera hidden in a fake eye) amounts to little more than a tip. <br /> <br /> As I said, the special effects are wonderful, just like the sets. So the movie is worth watching, but do not expect too much to happen when the action moves to the mirror of the planet. With a stronger script, this could have been another 'Planet of the Apes' or - I dare say - '2001: A Space Odyssey'. In Anderson's productions, it made the future look like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had smart cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women and absolutely no suggestion that something was seriously wrong with the world. We are in the future now and people are still watching 'Coronation Street' every night. How disappointing. If a mirror Earth actually exists somewhere, it is expected to be a better place than this. If all the women look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I'll be on the next flight!
