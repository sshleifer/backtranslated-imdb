I do not remember the series, I think it might have been "American Masters," but it was aired on PBS around 1980. Most people have some knowledge about the development of the A bomb, and those who have little, if any, I think it's a very dry subject. Anyone who has seen this 7 part series does not feel that way. You know the turbulence in Oppenhemiers' mind and how development has changed your life forever. You understand the tragic figure he has become and why. With 7 episodes, you know the main players and intrigue and backstabbing. I contacted PBS about the chance to get a video, or DVD, but I never got a response. Too bad, I'd love to see it again.
