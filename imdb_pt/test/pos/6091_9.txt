As can be read in many comments here is a movie that you love or hate - apparently not much room for opinions between. I think that's a good sign. <br /> <br /> I've always liked this movie, although the genre is not my typical style (I've never watched the Titanic, for example, and I'm not planning). <br /> <br /> The English patient grabs because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment, unlike when they are at home (Katherine), it shows how destructive love can be slow, strong and extremely painful, excites because of the extremely passionate affair, the pain (s) that leaves behind, as a sense can feel to move on. <br /> <br /> The photography is simply stunning, not to mention the acting of the actors. The rhythm is slow but timely, and it does justice to the book, the timeline, and the depth / development of the characters. Putting it in 110 minutes (as some seem to suggest here) would amputate the multilayers from that movie. People tend to struggle with the rhythm of the movies ... like they're in a hurry to get to work ... hey - make a living! ;-) enjoy ... <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4.5 out of 5.
