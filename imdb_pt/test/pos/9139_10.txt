Having not seen this movie for some time, we caught up with it not long ago on the well-transferred Criterion DVD. "Le cercle rouge" is a film that owes much to other films, since it reminds us of "Rififi", "The Asphalt Jungle", among others, because they all deal with capers that occupy the center of the film and reproduce. in great detail. Unfortunately, it is known that the old saying that crime does not pay, and from the beginning, those men involved in it are doomed from the start. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Melville was director of few words. He did not fill his photos with much dialogue, as is the case here. However, not being "Talky", they had their own style as proven with "Le Dolous", "Le Samurai", and his masterpiece, "Bob le flambeur", among others. Mr. Melville had a sense of style that shows up in everything he did. In this film, working with his director of photography, Henri Decae, he takes us on a stroll through the streets of Paris, which shows the vibrant city mainly at night and the cold winter in France. The score is by Eric Demarsan that emphasizes a jazz music that accompanies most of the action. <br /> <br /> Although the film shows Alain Delon, like Corey, in the center of the action, it is nevertheless the intelligent inspector Mattei, who is the true hero of the film. As interpreted by the great Bourvil, he is a man who shows a lot of patience because he imagined from the beginning how to get Vogel and in the process he gets involved in investigating the theft of jewels in which he meets the man who escaped. it is following behind you. Bourvil performs extremely well, with Mattei showing equal parts of determination and tenderness, as is the case of the three cats he adores. <br /> <br /> Alain Delon has always responded with interesting performances in his appearances in the Mellville photos. Here he is Corey, the man who is first seen coming out of prison and promising himself that he will not return, but he can not pass up a good thing when he decides to go ahead and participate in the robbery. Their association with Vogel and Jansen compensates for the way they do the work, but it will also prove a mistake in how they will not be able to get rid of the loot, since the fence on which they trusted has a change of heart. . <br /> <br /> Gian Maria Volonte and Yves Montand are seen as Vogel and Jansen, respectively. They were excellent actors who blend well into the action of the film. Both actors were at their best when they took the roles in the film and it shows. Mr. Montand has the most complex character to interpret as we witness him at his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons inside his head. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Mellville has achieved wonderful results from his life. cast and crew in a film that although feels a little more, but still manages to show his style in one of the director's most memorable images.
