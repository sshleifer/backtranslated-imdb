I love to love love this show. If you say it's because I'm crazy in the brain or not. I think this show is very funny and fun, although sometimes Bam's uncle Vito scare me .. so overall I give this show a perfect review. And then I really think that if you enjoy the kind of humor "omg .. idiot", this show is for you. It's very funny to see the look on people's faces and there are many musical guests coming to Bam's house. Buy this cause rocks! You should buy it. yea. And Bam's brother is in the CKY band and they are very good and sometimes appear on the show. <br /> <br /> The result is .. please watch the show.
