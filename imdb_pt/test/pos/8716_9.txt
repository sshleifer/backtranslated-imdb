I have to agree with all the previous commentators - this is simply the best of all the sparkling comedies, with Bardot as sexy as Marilyn Monroe, and definitely with a more handsome face (maybe there's less mystique, but see how Marilyn paid for it Eu I guess I've never seen a woman so juicy-looking on the screen, so perfect that even a gay man like myself got excited about it - and not just for purely aesthetic reasons (if evangelical idiots really want to do their number) convert it -queer ', they really will need to improve their standards, since no church mouse needs to apply here ...) Her breasts, the rest of her figure, her lovely voice, the hilarious way She shakes as she walks through a room ... just to get in front of a man, breasts literally pointed out as if in a delightful confrontation ... <br /> <br /> I think Boyer is one of the greatest male leaders in all movie history. m played against great female stars of it: Garbo, Dietrich, K. Hepburn, Colbert and here Bardot, among many others. And he was also in 'Fanny' with Leslie Caron, and had small roles in 'How to Steal a Million' with A. Hepburn, as well as being in Deneuve's 'The April Fools' movie (though not contrary to it). The only thing I could disagree with is that even the loud and nasty song about the opening credits is appropriate - I mean, Bardot is not to be subtle on top of everything else, and its essential volume (I do not mean his voice) is part of his irresistible and, one might say, exemplary charm. <br /> <br /> Vidal is quite handsome, even though Brigitte says, "I do not know why I'm in love with you, you're not even handsome. <br /> <br /> Dear and dear Bardot! Truly one of the wonders of the 20th century, not to mention the joy that she is still with us, when so many of the truly characteristic are passing so fast, in all their eccentric glory.
