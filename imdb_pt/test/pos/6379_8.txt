I think it was in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and I saw in the papers that one of the theaters was playing 'teen deviyan'. We decided to just go to hell without expecting anything good. But we were in for a pleasant surprise. The film was made in 1965, but even by today's standards, the plot was absolutely modern and far ahead of its time. The music was wonderful and Dev Anand as a city created and acted his best. I still remember that feeling of joy when we left the theater after the movie was over. <br /> <br /> Who thought of this story of a man falling in love with three very different girls at the same time? No, he does not have three or tricks, but he really likes all three for different reasons. One is homely, one is an actress and the third is a "high society" girl who can also help Dev in his career as a poet. The question is which is the "One" for him. What makes the problem worse is that all three like it too. When things come to a halt, a hypnotist takes him in and into his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each of them and comes to the right decision. <br /> <br /> This dream of him being the only colorful part of a black-and-white film is the crux of the movie, but surprisingly it is edited from most versions available today. If you want to watch this movie, make sure this part is intact. If you watch this movie without that part and get confused, do not worry because you just see an incomplete movie.
