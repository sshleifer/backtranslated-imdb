In many ways, the movie is perfect. The "Incredible Journey" and Horatio Alger's tale come together to take a positive turn to the generally depressing subject of existentialism. In essence, the muppet's difficulties come down to the final song of the movie: "Life is like a movie, write your own ending, keep believing, keep pretending." They create their own reality, which has all the pitfalls of every epic story: a grandiose goal at the end of what is necessarily a journey fraught with obstacles; an ever-growing group of like-minded fellows; an unpleasant array of villains who are beyond all redemption; and a big-budget Hollywood final because, all of this, they CAN. <br /> <br /> Only Jim Henson could do that. He walks in the line between sentimentality and philosophy without straying too much or too much for it. Of course, it seems strange to invest this weight in a movie starring dolls, but in the end, maybe they're perfect for those points. The atmosphere of the film allows the pure enjoyment of Hollywood's dream, the final "happy", unnecessary appearances, and music explode in the fall of a hat. Generally, these aspects are anathema to the quality in the film, but the self-deprecating way in which the story is transmitted favors guilt-free viewing. One of the few movies that can really be called "suitable for all ages". The other muppet-related films (including "The Empire Strikes Back"), though palatable, do not touch simple grace. of this film. Take, for example, the musical number "I Hope Something Better Accompany", Kermit's and Rowlf's duet. Amused in his vaudevillian goofiness, he still makes a raunchy point about the motivations behind life choices. Bright.
