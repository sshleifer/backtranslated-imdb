However, the short-lived "The Amazing Spider-Man" was one of the best made for TV versions of a famous comic book hero. Only "Wonder Woman" (Lynda Carter) (the best of the genre and "The Incredible Hulk" (Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno) were better. <br /> <br /> "The Incredible Spider-Man" surpasses that of 1966 1968 "Spider-Man" outclasses all three television interpretations of "Superman" - "Lois and Clark", "Smallville", and of course George "The Amazing Spider-Man" was an action drama, during the late 1970s, the pre-CGI era when acrobatics had to be performed. "Spider-Man" had his own very talented stuntman to perform the daring acrobatic defying death, his name was Fred Waugh, who wore the clean suit for the action sequences. Hammond, better known as one of the children of Julie Andrew in the all-time classic "The Sound of Music" was Home m-Spider during the dialogue scenes. Hammond Spider-Man also had his own film t identity as Peter Parker, similar to Christopher Reeve - Superman / Clark Kent, Adam West-Batman / Bruce Wayne and of course Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman / Diana Prince. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that the series only had thirteen episodes. Because when the first episode hit the radio waves in November 1977, the whole country was watching on CBS that night on Wednesday. In all fairness, CBS should release this pilot episode, as well as "The Deadly Dust", "Captive Tower" etc. on DVD soon. "Spider-Man" was short-lived but had a follower cult, and in my opinion it was far better than the movie's interpretation of the famous comic book hero starring Toby McGuire. <br /> <br /> CBS may hesitate to release these episodes for two reasons. (A) There may not be a broad market for them based on the series' lack of longevity and a generation of children who were not born when the series aired in the 1970s. (B) One of the first episodes of "Spider-Man "dealt with a terrorist with drawings in the World Trade Center, which was attacked twice many years after this program went off the air in 1993, and of course the devastating attack on this country on 9/11/01 when the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost. <br /> <br /> However, I do not think it would be in bad taste to release this episode of "Spider-Man." even if the show was adventure, derived from a comic book and camped out in nature. The live action "Amazing Spider-Man" does not have many followers, but has cult followers. If and when CBS launches on DVD, this next cult could be explained along with the episode in which Spider-Man saved the towers in 1978, but as in September 2001 real-life proved to be different from the movies. I like to keep up with the news, but I also like science fiction / fantasy. So, I am eagerly awaiting the release of "The Amazing Spider-Man on DVD".
