All I can say is that, I was expecting a movie wick and "Blurred" surprised me in the positive way. Very good teen movie. All this kind of situation is normal in school life, so all I can say is that it all reminded me of school days and sometimes it's good to watch that kind of movie because it entertains us and transports us back to those golden years , when we were young. It also leads us to think better of how we should understand our children, because in the past we were as they want to be in the present time. Try this movie and you will be very satisfied. At the same time, you have the guarantee that your time has not been wasted.
