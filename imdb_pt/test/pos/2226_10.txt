I saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in Pablo CO. I had just dropped my biomedical engineering work in a hospital. I regard the script as an exaggeration of the real kind of things that happen in hospitals. <br /> <br /> Idiots who lower production value do not understand and probably never were hospitalized. And never worked on one for sure. Billy Jack (same time) was very poorly produced, but had a significant social commentary and was a very good film with a true social message. <br /> <br /> I've been looking for this movie this is the first site. I found where it is mentioned.
