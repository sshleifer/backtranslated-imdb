My partner and I had never heard of this movie and decided to give it a shot by choosing the title from a list of movies on the cable without knowing a single thing about it. When it opened and revealed the cast, we thought: well, how bad can it be? - Kathy Bates, Jonathan Pryce, Rupert Everett, Lynn Redgrave, Dan Akroyd and more. As the story unfolded, we became more and more enjoyable with our selection, and the film soon made us laugh out loud. This is not a "great" movie, but it is one of those rare movies that has such a great combination of memorable characters made through surreal events "truth is stranger than fiction" that I could not help but love. I had no problem "hanging on to my disbelief" on some of the weirdest elements in the story, because the intentions of the filmmakers are so warm while they still manage to mock everyone involved. As others on IMDb said, this is a comfort movie and I would not be surprised if it became a cult classic.
