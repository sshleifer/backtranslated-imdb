OK. To enjoy this short silent comedy you MUST suspend disbelief over the main starting point for the film. If you can not, you will probably have a better chance of achieving a much lower result. Charlie Chase has a HUGE overbite and his wife has a nose big enough to have her own area code. Unknown to each other, both have saved up to have surgery to correct these defects. Apparently, plastic and dental surgery was better in the 1920s because neither seemed to have any need to recover from these major surgeries and they just looked dandy immediately !! Okay, remember I told you to ignore this, right?! Okay, well, you also have to ignore the idea of ​​believing that both could meet and have no idea that the other is your spouse. Okay, ... now that you have allowed yourself to accept these two foolish premises, the film was very, very good. Charlie gives her a pass and she gives him a pass. Both are shocked and excited because no one considered them attractive. So, because of this new vanity, they agree to go on a date. But the two of them sneaked back home - not wanting their spouses to know! Anyway, they meet later and are quite attracted to each other. But what about poor spouses supposedly at home? Well, both learn that the other is married and both anticipate that their marriages will result in divorce because they really want to be with each other! At the end of the movie, Charlie discovers that the woman is really his wife and he goes through a very funny sequence where he plays her boyfriend and husband - changing clothes and putting fake teeth when interpreting her husband! It's really a laugh to see him jumping in and out of the room as he seems to be struggling with someone else! You really have to see it to believe it. However, the wife sees an advertisement with pictures of Charlie before and after and knows what is happening. In the end, both feel very foolish!
