This is a well directed episode of Columbus, with some good character as well, but the story simply does not know much interest and does not appear as well layered and built as was often the case with a Columbus movie. This also holds true for the assassin's plan to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and does not look so well thought out. Perhaps this film has not become serious enough, since the atmosphere of the film is lighter. At least when compared to different Columbus films. <br /> <br /> For example, the film features a lot of comic relief, especially coming from Columbo himself. This makes the film enjoyable to watch, but it also gives the impression that they exaggerated, mainly because it does not match most of the other Columbo films. <br /> <br /> The characters are good and fun. This helps characterize Martin Landau in a double role. It's always funny to see how different he still looked when he was young, while, for example, a person like Peter Falk hardly changed over the years, he only grew grayer. The film also features Julie Newmar, among others, who is best known for playing Catwoman in the 1960s action-adventure series "Batman." It's funny how she still moves like Catwoman in this movie. Intentional or is this just your way of acting? <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure and good to watch the movie Columbus, but also gives the feeling that everything could have been much better with a script best thought. <br /> <br /> 7/10
