Note: This should probably only be read after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> It is very rare to find a documentary or film that focuses on the loser. Deep Water does just that, making it one of the most provocative movies in a long time. It does not provide us with a hero to admire, but rather an anti-hero who forces us to look within ourselves. <br /> <br /> The film is about a group of men trying to navigate around the world. , alone and without stopping. Only one does, several die, one decides not to return home, each on a psychological journey intriguing enough to deserve entire movies for themselves. However, the most interesting is Donald Crowhurst, or rather, the way he is portrayed by the filmmakers and our reactions to him as spectators. <br /> <br /> By any standard, this man should be considered a despicable character, but why did he describe it heroically? Why are we so friendly to him? From the beginning he made all the wrong choices. He risked his family financially to catch the boat, he came out at a more dangerous time to get more publicity, he ignored all warnings, despite his lack of experience, he chose to lie rather than admit defeat, these snowball choices to the inevitable and final one: suicide. Why all? A place in history? A sense of accomplishment? Possibly. What is important to consider is whether this situation of man was inevitable. Each individual must wonder whether his natural human motivation for fame and achievement would bring him to such recklessness, and I believe that examining his own reaction to the story of Crowhurst will offer at least some answer to that question.
