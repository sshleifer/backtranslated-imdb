Flic hot hearted portraying arch-angel Michael as a hustler, brawling, overweight, cigarette who loves to dance and cavort with the opposite sex. He has a good side, however, as he struggles to get things right in the life of a couple of losers before being called to heaven. Funny and well-played movie; very nice, although a bit flippant.
