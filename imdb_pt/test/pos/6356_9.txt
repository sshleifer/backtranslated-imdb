This film is a prime example of what an independent film can be. The director does an excellent job on the line between emotional and physical violence. But in the end, he remembers what so many independent films forget - he tells a good story. Watching this movie, I remembered how Hollywood's mundane, timid, mundane films really have become. <br /> <br /> Particularly remarkable, it is an exceptionally strong performance of the film's lead - Jorge Cordova. As a villain villain (on his way to the top of the crime pile) Cordova plays a conniving, brutal, vain, dishonest and sloppy S.O.B., but he is so friendly that he keeps entertained all the time. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that these guys were part of the New Wave of Latino Filmmakers in Los Angeles - called La Nueva Obra, or something like that. Either way, this movie makes you eager to see more of your work. <br /> <br />
