You wear only the best Italian Armani suits, hand-stitched and tailored to your exact measurements. Your car is the best that German engineering has to offer and is equipped with as many devices as horses under the hood. You are a member of the best polo clubs, often dine at restaurants like Spago, and are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. Your pocket watch works like a nuclear explosive, while your trusty pen can also be used as a semi-automatic .22 caliber weapon. You ski in the snow in the Alps, do deep sea dives in the Caribbean, plunge into the Andes, and all the time your hair is never out of place. You are Bond, James Bond, the world's most renowned spy, the Queen's favorite son, the British SS bad boy, and perhaps the most desirable man in the world. The James Bond character was created by Ian Fleming, and is the most enduring icon in the film industry, being the subject of over fifteen films over four decades. The last man to play the role is Pierce Brosnan, who took on the role of Timothy Dalton's James Bond in 1996, and made his debut at Goldeneye in 007. <br /> <br /> This is the setting for the first major title developed by a third party on the Nintendo 64. Goldeneye, developed by Rare for Nintendo, has been on the market for some time. His continued mastery of sales charts is just a testament to how good the game is, and no review library would be complete without it. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - most of the time, licensed games are flops. Although the two look like a good mix, the results, for the most part, were horrendous. Games like Cliffhanger, True Lies, Lethal Weapon, and not to mention all Star Trek failures, are enough ammunition against this mix. And for the record I'm not a fan of licensed movies, especially if I saw the movie. At least that's how I used to think. In the Goldeneye case, I had more reserves than usual. While it's not a bad movie, Goldeneye does not have much appeal for it, and I do not rank him among the top ten among Bond movies. As a game, however, let's just say it's a completely different story. <br /> <br /> The game is a first person shooter game, and to be successful, you will need at least as much brain as muscles. . For those who have seen the movie, which I imagine most of you are reading this, the story is very consistent and follows the path of the film with little variation. A plan to control the world's most dangerous satellite, the Goldeneye, began in the USSR and in the process a beautiful woman was captured. Your missions will be many, the extreme danger. You will have to rely on your intelligence and experience to lead you through the most strenuous missions the world has ever known. M will inform you as soon as it is ready. Good morning, James.
