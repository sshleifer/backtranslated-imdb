The plot is predictable. This has been done many times in other films. You have summer camps in competition: the rich versus the loser boys competing for the "boast" rights in the typical camp contests, while the boys and comforters play tricks, sex and "a good time!" "Are you ready for the summer?" Meatballs are the first (and best) summer camp movie for well-being comedy. As others have posted, it's not Citizen Kane, but this kind of movie is not meant to be. The film works because of the wonderful comic timing and classic one-liners of Bill Murray. His scenes with a camper where he tries to increase the boy's self-esteem are very good. Bill's one-liners throughout the movie are very funny. <br /> <br /> I also like that this movie is not dirty or explicit like so many other teens at camp movies today. There are some mild sexual innuendoes and maybe one or two swearing all over the movie. But meatballs are the kind of teen movie that is really appropriate for the younger crowd. It is classified as PG. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you have to see a few times to get all the jokes! When Bill Murray is on the screen or doing one of his classic "PA Announcements", you are attracted to the movie. Bill seems to take the film alone. But he does it so well, that when you see Meatballs, you will realize that this is the movie that made him a star! A side note for this review is to avoid all the sequels of the movie meatball. They are horribly bad.
