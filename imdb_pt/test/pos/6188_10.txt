<br /> <br /> There's something about watching a movie in a good old-fashioned movie house that adds huge appeal to all the photos. I was fortunate to be able to see at the Film Forum in New York a couple of comedies by Ernst Lubitsch during his three-week tribute to the legendary director. The double feature I attended was an exhibition of Lubitsch's 1938 comedy, Bluebeard's Eighth Wife, and the classic pre-Code Design for Living, none of which I had seen before. Everything I read about Design for Living praised the film, but I could not find a good review anywhere for Bluebeard's Eighth Wife. Leonard Maltin did not like it either. VideoHound, too, gave comedy a low rating. Your IMDB score was not courtesy. And Pauline Kael (not a big surprise) criticized the film in its blunt criticism. So when I went to town that day, I was hoping to enjoy just the eighth wife of Bluebeard and love Design for Living completely. Bluebeard's eighth wife (who was appearing first) began, while the eccentrics that populated the movies sat down and the music of the 1930s subsided. "Adolph Zukor presents Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper in Ernst Lubitsch's Eighth Husband of Bluebeard," the title card read. Then the photo opened with a hilarious scene: Cooper wants to buy a pair of pajamas, but he does not want any part of the bottom! He enters into a dispute with the clerk, who seeks help from his superior bosses, and there seems to be no end to the argument. Enter Claudette Colbert, one of the most beautiful, charming, and talented movie personalities of the thirties. "I'll get the bottom," she gently intercedes. And there you have maybe better crazy comedies to meet cute. The film kept my interest wonderfully. I found myself laughing almost constantly. When Colbert discovers, shortly before a family portrait is drawn, that his future fiance has been married seven times, the whole theater has entered the story. When she bargain for money immediately after overcoming the shock, the laughter (which has not yet ceased) intensifies. And Edward Everett Horton also drew some hilarious reactions from the screenplay. When Cooper takes inspiration from Shakespeare's The Taming of the Dagger, by disciplining his wife by slapping him in the face, I could not control my laughter when she slapped him. And the drunk scene with chives is one of Claudette Colbert's funniest comedy scenes. The film's greatest comedic moment came when Colbert climbs a boxer to "teach a lesson to his husband." In sheer shit, he knocks down the wrong man, putting his friend David Niven in a cold sleep. He wakes up when Cooper is coming. To cover up the situation, Colbert herself, in a moment of strong sensuality, puts her fist in the direction of Niven, asking: Where did that man hit you? On here? Right here? Right here?' and then BAM! hit it again! The film was wonderful, from start to finish it was a perfect treat. I also loved Design for Living, although I would dare say that I think out of sheer laughter and entertainment Bluebeard's eighth wife was the best and most enjoyable film. There is some charm to seeing a vintage movie on the big screen. And in the presence of others laughing, you feel more comfortable doing this for yourself. This is perhaps because I felt the way I did about Bluebeard's eighth wife.
