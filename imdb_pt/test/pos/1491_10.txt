Mr. Bean, by Rowan Atkinson, is on the same level as Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and other comedy greats. I have never seen people laugh so loudly and literally fall from their chairs as when I introduced them to Mr. Bean via my videos and now DVDs. I will never forget the first time my brother saw him. He had just finished a visit and I asked him if he had ever seen Mr. Bean? "Who?" he said. So I took my video and showed him where Mr. Bean is in church and starts to doze off. My brother laughed so hard that he fell from his chair and was holding his stomach from laughing so hard. He became an instant fan of Mr. Bean. We all know how hilarious these episodes are, but the fun is to share them with others. I've seen so many people laughing until they hurt! The favorite episodes are: the Queen's visit, the stay in the hotel room, the end of the consultation with the dentist, the Christmas episode (a classic ... more kids love!) And the New Year's Party. Rowan Atkinson is a comic genius!
