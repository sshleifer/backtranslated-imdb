Running Out of Time is probably as close to a perfect movie as you'll probably see outside of Hong Kong. All elements click on: a great screenplay (by French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtiaud) that still manages to subvert the strange clich√©, Johnnie To's trustworthy direction, and excellent central performances by Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan, the latter exhibiting his A great comedic timing for a wonderful effect without ever crossing the line in parody (especially in your exasperated reactions to your boss's abysmal trading skills). The support cast is also good, with Yo Yo Mung making a strong impression on a tiny paper, and even the histrionic Waise Lee (who looks remarkable and very deftly, like a bald Andy Lau) controlling it with good results. Is it better not to know much about the storyline going beyond the basic set-up ?? with only a few weeks to live, Lau engages in a criminal match with Wan's cop for no apparent reason? and sit back and enjoy the ride: it's certainly worth it. He also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent films, and has played in only three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of filmmaking I've seen in ages). There is also a good score by Raymond Wong as well. The most fun to play cat and mouse in movies in years.
