Forget the plot of this movie. Forget the fact that it is beautifully represented by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget the fact that it's one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can tolerate. Although the story is unbelievable and much of the dialogue seems artificial, the only important thing to remember when watching this movie is that it contains some of the most surprising and disturbing images ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decides to make a criminal drama. A must see for anyone seriously interested in cinematography and the use of the film cell as a canvas on which to display true works of visual art. I would have to give this movie a 9/10 for its amazing visuals.
