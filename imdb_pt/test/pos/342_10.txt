I am a big follower of Indian films, especially Malayalam and Tamil. What a shame in India for not sending this movie as an official Oscar entry. I saw this movie and it clearly showed me the maturity that Tamil cinema has in its script and narrative that Bollywood best achieved. For all of us westerners, Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood, which is all about glamor and promotion. <br /> <br /> Coming to the point where India was thinking when they sent a movie like 'Devdas' to the Oscars? This was really a masochistic movement. I think they are trying to punish the Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas since the judges overthrew Lagaan last year. <br /> <br /> 'Devdas' is just a melodrama of love, destiny and destiny. I would stay away from that. Anyway, not sending a movie like Kanathil Muthital shows how much of a reform the Indian administration needs to save them from poor managers who lack intelligence. Now I know why this country has so many problems. They are very talented but are not displayed properly.
