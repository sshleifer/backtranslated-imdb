One of the most magnificent films ever made. The performance of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply exceptional. This is the crown of director Winner's career, which was often quoted as saying that this was his masterpiece. The storyline has been copied many times but has never been surpassed. Wildey J. Moore, the arms manufacturer, often stated that the growth of his brand since the mid-80s can be fully credited to the DW3, and rightfully so. This is not just a movie, it is an art that many generations will admire and appreciate. Although this film has never been fully enjoyed in the US, it has found many followers in Europe and Asia where the film is regularly screened in film schools and is still a popular success in student cinemas across Europe. All in all, a true classic.
