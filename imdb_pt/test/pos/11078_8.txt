This anime tells the story of the Battle for Mamodo King. Every 1,000 years, 100 children of Mamado are sent to Earth to fight to determine who will be their next king (in the original Japanese, the creatures are Mamono, which literally means magical / evil object). Each Blowjob is paired with a Human partner and receives a spell book. The Human can use this book to release incredible powers in the Mamodo, and when a Mamodo is defeated, his spellbook is engulfed in flames (alternatively, a Mamdodo's book can be captured and burned directly). After that, the Mamodo returns to the Mamodo world. <br /> <br /> The titular character is Zatch (Gash in Japan), a mamodo of 6 years with electric powers. He is paired with Kiyomaru Takamini and a 14 year old genius. Zatch is initially reluctant to fight, but learning that some Mamodo are evil and deciding that the battle for the king is wrong, he decided to fight to become a 'gentle king'. <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell attracted comparison with Pok√©mon. , but a better comparison is with the Digimon. Like Digimon, the Mamodo and the Human have a symbiotic one-to-one relationship. Also unlike Pokemon, both shows have a real plot. <br /> <br /> The Zatch Bell features growing characters and evolutionary relationships, and some very adult stories (such as love vs. racism, slavery, mind control, etc.). It still has some decent twists and mysteries.
