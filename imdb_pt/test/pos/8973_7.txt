Well we definitely saw it and myself and many other people were really expecting worse. It also had some good parts, but I did not expect it to fail in other areas. <br /> <br /> First, the performance was above average. I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman in this movie and I liked Tom Hanks. Hoffman was the glue for this movie. If it were not for him, this movie would have collapsed and reached the bottom of the pit. His performance was by no means impressive but absolutely necessary. He gave a good spirited and cynical performance in that most other actors could easily turn his character into a clich√©. Tom Hanks really gave a good performance loose and did not disappoint, but he certainly did not impress. What I could not stand was that Julia Roberts was involved in this movie. She was as big as I've ever seen. For one thing, she's a bad actress, at least for me, she was young for her character and it was fake, even for the character she was playing. <br /> <br /> The direction was average for me. I'm not really a big fan of Mike Nichols' recent movies and I'm not impressed either. It was made with a Hollywood caricatureural touch hat that I could not stand. The worst part was that he tried to make it a really meaningful movie in the end. I love meaningful movies, but not when a movie tries to rush a scene or two at the end and show something that tries to justify the rest of the junk scattered throughout the film. This is something that Mike Nichols seems to have done a lot in his recent history. <br /> <br /> The impressive part of this movie was the writing. The dialogue was very well organized and allowed the story to unfold. The writing was what was able to really take this film to an above average level. In many scenes I found myself laughing in part at the writing. <br /> <br /> Well, that's a bit of what we've seen at least. Much of the setting was good in the movie, if you understand what I mean, but not much different from that. I liked that this movie did not glorify everything that America did. It is obvious that throughout this war in Afghanistan, the US has given weapons to the people who are now against us. This movie shows that we are very much to blame for this. This shows that what may seem good in the short term can turn into something terribly wrong in the future. This movie had a good original message but was not delivered correctly. Overall though, it was fun.
