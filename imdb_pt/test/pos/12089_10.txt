I've been away from Istanbul for the past 10 years. During this time I lived constantly in London. When I saw the movie, I realized how much I am Istanbuler. I'm not just from Turkey, I'm a part of Turkey. One of my part is Istanbul, the sound of Istanbul, the people of Istanbul. <br /> <br /> Faith Akin probably thought she made a great musical documentary, but I must say it's more than that. It's about putting good mix of songs, cultures, approaches, politics, very different ethnicities in a delicious pot ... <br /> <br /> As we all know that Turkey is accurate, Istanbul always comes and goes between being Eastern or western town. As one of the band members said that Istanbul is a bi-cultural city. But much more a city of the east because we always try to be a western city. It shows that we were never one. <br /> <br /> This movie will catch from the first second. The music is great, the people are fascinating. Especially Aynur and Sezen Aksu. Singers, band members! It's good to see you all in a little movie at Wood Green.
