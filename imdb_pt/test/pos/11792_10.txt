Another brilliant portrait of Kiefer Sutherland, who plays Mickey Hayden, a cop who deals with psychic visions of murdered victims. I absolutely love movies dealing with the psychic realm, and I was not disappointed with "Eye of the Killer" (AKA After Alice). I just wanted the movie to have been released first theatrically.
