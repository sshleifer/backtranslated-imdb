The second live action presentation for Asterix is ​​far better than the elements pasted together from ten different stories that was called the first movie, instead of getting quite close to the original comic book. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, Queen Cleopatra has made a bet with Caeser to build a palace in Egypt to show that the Egyptians are a great people. The Real Architect Edifis seeks the help of Asterix, Obelix and the Druid Getafix to complete their task. There are several moments of laughter aloud, some jokes that only the French can receive (jokes in the week of 35 hours) while others that are more universal. The special effects of big budget are spectacular, but obfuscated by the jokes of the original comics. <br /> <br /> Depardieu and Clavier still work brilliantly as a pair, while Monica Bellucci does the perfect casting as Cleopatra. In addition, for comic book fans, the hilarious pirates take a look to make up for their absence in movie 1.
