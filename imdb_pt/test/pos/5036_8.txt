This is one of my favorite comedies "Capra-esque". This film is intended only to be appreciated, not deconstructed, analyzed microscopically. It's not a religious comment. It's fun. It's fantasy. The surprisingly negative comments (IMHO) reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think should be part of all the films. <br /> <br /> Others have described the role of Travolta (the reason you will watch the movie over and over) and the excellent support cast (including Sparky!). <br /> <br /> Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; sometimes a movie is fun. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
