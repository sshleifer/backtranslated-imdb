"River's Edge" was one of the most disturbing films of 1986, and for a year it also saw "Blue Velvet", you know you're saying something. Seen today, it has lost little of its power and continues to be much better than overrated Kids. The previews of "Kids" touched to expose the deterioration of the nation's youth. In reality, it was little more than an exploration film based mostly around shock value. "River's Edge" was promoted as a teenage exploration film, but actually it was much better. The only time that goes from disturbing to unpleasant is the constant image of the naked dead body. Other than that, the film is thought-provoking and, despite all its minor flaws, quite realistic. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves, known for being a particularly wooden artist, gives his best performance as a burnt adolescent. . Ione Skye is equally friendly and personable. Dennis Hopper (on the return track with this, "Blue Velvet" and "Hoosiers") gives a great performance as the frightening but pathetic hippie generation. Crispin Glover, although always fun to watch, seems a little out of place as the maniac and leader of the group. The best performance however is definitely Daniel Roebuck. As the killer John, Roebuck is frighteningly unemotional. It's a shame he has not become a bigger star, since he's a far better actor than Reeves. <br /> <br /> The film is generally fantastic and daring. Do not confuse this with another John Hughes clich√© movie like "The Breakfast Club". This is a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer. Fans of this film are advised to check out a 1981 Canadian film called "Out of the Blue," directed by Dennis Hopper. It's another shockingly grim examination of the gap between generations, and in spite of its obscurity, may have been an influence on River's Edge. (7/10)
