Anna Christie (1930) <br /> <br /> Anna Christie has some wonderful parts and some amazing performances, and yet it should be even better than it is. There's drama. Some of the scenes are really atmospheric, and if the inner planes around the table are boring, other scenes at night and at sea are really very exciting. Then there are the almost historic and lively scenes on Coney Island (up to a brief bustling roller coaster) and the episode in which two women are behind a hammock in separate beds, and visitors in the middle can throw balls to try and knock them down . It's over, and the women (dressed scarcely) ovem the men are strangely sexual. All the time Garbo (in front of the crowd) watches. <br /> <br /> Garbo, of course, is what makes this movie more than just another good early talkie. She touches all sides of your character. She is shy and skeptical and in some sort of inner anguish. She laughs and cries, withdraws and pushes out. In a way, it's a remarkable, forward-looking film (directed by Clarence Brown, which has a whole series of significant films from that pre-code sound age). <br /> <br /> Although based on a successful Eugene O'Neil play, it is writing that struggles a bit, as the actors sometimes seem, sometimes. Marie Dressler is great in that exaggerated way that almost registered. And then there's Greta Garbo, who actually has a natural presence, even though it seems she's overdoing it, sometimes a little (but then everyone else too). Garbo is, of course, famous for the first time as a silent actress, and this is her movie debut. The public loved her enough for her to make a German version the next year.
