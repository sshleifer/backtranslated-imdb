I liked this movie. I was not sure what it was before I started watching, but I liked that. It was about a girl (Meredith Monroe) whose mother did not want her to leave as she did. She meets and falls in love with a boy (Riley Smith) who is the city for a charity football game. And a good movie. I just hope it's back again or out on video.
