There was a video in the United States called 'Cartoon Scandals', which featured about an hour of banned cartoons. <br /> <br /> Most of them were from World War II. That's where I first saw (and heard) this one. <br /> <br /> The rooster during the broadcast of opening news turns into a vulture with an Asian face saying 'cock-a-doodle-doo please'. After that, it's eight minutes of propaganda played as a newscast. <br /> <br /> Visibly racist, but when you look at how the story is, it can (and should) be forgiven. <BR> Cutting ration cards to make sandwiches. <br /> <br /> Showing the ruins of Rome as he called Moussolini's Ruin # 1. <br /> <br /> A minesweeper using a broom. <br /> <br /> A manned bomb with the pilot saying 'RET ME OUT HERE'. <br /> <br /> Of course, the stereotypes. All the Japanese were drawn with big teeth, constantly bowing and saying 'please' at the end of each broken sentence. <br /> <br /> The funniest? The air-raid siren was two men bending over each other stabbing at the tips of the pins. "oooo-OOOOOO" <br /> <br /> Hey AOL. Leave it out. That deserves warning. My wife laughed at this. And she's 100% Japanese.
