Actor Paxton's director accompanies his promising debut, gothic horror "Frailty," with this family-friendly drama about the 1913 US Open where a young American caddo rises from his humble past to play against his British idol in what was dubbed as "the greatest game ever played." I'm not a fan of golf, and these sports movies are a penny a dozen (most recently made to great effect with "Miracle" and "Cinderella Man"), but somehow this movie was fascinating nonetheless. The movie begins with some creative opening credits (imagine a Disneyfied version of HBO's animated opening credits for "Carnivale" and "Rome"), but it's moving slowly for its first hour per hour. Once the action moves to the US, open things fit nicely. Paxton does a good job and shows a special talent for effective directing flourishes (I loved the rain-soaked montage of the action on the second day of the event) that further boosted the plot or added some unexpected psychological depth to the process. There is a development of compelling character when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of aristocrats in black suits and hats who destroyed his family home as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually describing what goes on in the minds of players under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought alive here. Credit should also be given to set designers and the costume department to create an engaging atmosphere of London and Boston in the early twentieth century. <br /> <br /> You know how this is going to end up not only because it's based on a true story, but also because movies of that genre follow the same model several times, but Paxton has a better-than-average show and may indicate more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of her. Despite the stereotypical nature, this is a nice and easy-to-create movie that deserves to find an audience.
