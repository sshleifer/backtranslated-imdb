Absolutely the best thing I've ever seen on TV. It was fun and informative. The reason I found this site is an attempt to find out how I can see it again. <br /> <br /> In light of the current understanding of history, we have to sympathize with Gen. Leslie Groves, who was responsible for the sows. and bolts of execution of Project Manhattan. Certainly, he was not as paranoid about security as most thought about the past. <br /> <br /> The cast for the real life people portrayed was excellent. It was the first time I noticed Sam Waterston as an actor. Except for the height, he looked a lot like Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> The first scene in which Oppenheimer is leading a class of graduate students was especially intriguing to me.
