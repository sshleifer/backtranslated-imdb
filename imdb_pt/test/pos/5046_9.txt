This movie has just won the Best Film Award at the Cleveland International Film Festival. It's apparently American title is Autumn Spring. The acting is superb. The story takes you into the life of an old man who takes what life gives him and increases a little. Aided by his best friend (and partner in not-so-serious crimes), he puts people at every opportunity, yet reveals his heart of gold. His long-suffering wife has come to her final judgment and makes a life-changing decision that is heart-breaking to watch. The resolution of the story is beautiful.
