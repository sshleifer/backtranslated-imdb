I saw this movie when it was broadcast on television in February 1983. I was in the hospital, having just given birth to my first and only son. I will not tell you how much I've moved. Suffice it to say that the film's memory remained with me to this day, almost 23 years later. I hope to find a copy of this movie if such a thing has already been done. This film should be remembered fondly by anyone you have ever seen. However, I must admit that staying a little dark is good for me. In this way, it will always be a little secret for me and those who have also been moved by it. I've never seen Ms. Margaret play a better role. I did not even see her in a more convincing role. I will always respect her just for accepting such a lovely part.
