The "hunting trilogy" of fire rabbit (1951), rabbit seasoning (1952) and duck! Bunny! Duck! (1953) is to be considered the comic high point of the collaboration Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese. While they are rarely mentioned in the lists of the "biggest" or "most important" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly the FUNNIEST cartoons I have ever seen. Michael Maltese never had the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery received, but it's his dialogues and situations that make the Warner Bros. cartoons, and those three in particular, some of the most fun ever made.
