I went straight to the big screen to see this kicker. This is the only movie I know Tarsem Singh directed, but boy was intense. This film was a total mental enhancer and one of the best special effects of its kind. <br /> <br /> The characters were vibrant and nothing less than beings created in their own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombards the senses with fear and joy. This movie compares to no one else I've seen, except for the level being beautifully weird. In that regard, it is a rather large step above "Mechanical Orange". Definitely watch this movie on the big screen and do not expect it to go out on tape. It will not be anywhere near as good on tape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not to scare easily. It will mess up your mind and leave you with images that are slow to forget. But for those who like to scare ..... ENJOY!
