I liked many others who saw it as a kid and I loved it and they horrified me into adulthood, I have been trying to find this movie and even looking for it to play again on TV someday, since it originally played on networks from the USA. Does anyone know where to buy this movie, or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? Also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again? Maybe all of us fans should write a station in the hope that they would broadcast it again. I do not think they've done a good job promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows, people only know Stepford's wives and Stepford's husband films. No one is familiar with the fact that there was a children's version. Maybe they should also do a reworking of this, since they seem to be doing a lot this lately with many of my favorite horror / horror movies. Well, if anyone has any input Please I beg of you to write me with information. Thank you Taira tcampo23@aol.com
