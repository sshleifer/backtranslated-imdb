Sacchi is Bogart's best imitator ... dry and funny like Sam Marlowe. The music of award-winning composer George Duning from perfect-location cinematography [including the famous Ambassador Hotel] is well on target, as famous TV director Robert Day [Kojak, Streets of San Francisco, The Avengers] guides the most captivating group of actors of characters known through a parody of every dark detective film all done. See this if you loved all the old serious movies and have a sense of humor ... this is a hoot.
