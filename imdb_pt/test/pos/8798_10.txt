the movie itself is absolutely brilliant, it's that buzzing, that rush that makes you just want to get out, blow your wages and get lost. It is what is the weekend, it is our sanitation, where we can unite as one and be ourselves without a care in the world. The film is plunged in depth and the dialogue in places is very visible, especially with the Jip. The characters themselves are instantly enjoyable, one in particular is obviously a crooked character and his visions about what is really "Star Wars" genius. <br /> <br /> If you ever have an hour to kill before you leave, continue with this, you will feel more and more confident, definitely recommend.
