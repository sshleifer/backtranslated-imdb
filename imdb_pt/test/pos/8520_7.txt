Yes, it's Sean Connery playing Bond again, looking more alive and on his side than any other time since the first time they made this movie in 1965 when it was called "Thunderball." But the language is so firm that one wonders if Connery is not employing some observed tricks of his friend and more humorous successor, Roger Moore. <br /> <br /> Moore is my favorite friend, but Connery makes a strong case for himself on this unusual ride. The only serious Bond movie not made under the aegis of the classic Eon Bond series, "Never Say Never Again" is an irreverent return to the well. Smooth in action, it is nevertheless strong in character and intelligent dialogue. <br /> <br /> Bond, of course, is a man of disgrace. No matter how many times he has saved the world, his new boss thinks little of his fat lifestyle. "Many free radicals, that's your problem ... Caused by eating too much red meat, white bread, lots of martinis." "Then I'll cut the white bread, sir," Bond responds smartly. An early fight sequence at a spa represents the high point of the movie in terms of action, with Bond and an attacker plowing through a kitchen, a bedroom and a laboratory before Bond finally extinguishes his opponent , ironically without the help of free radicals. Humor is liberally applied in the film, much smarter than most of Moore's outputs, although Connery seems to be enjoying himself more as a result of Moore's less selfish example. <br /> <br /> Was it because he was making a good chunk of the brute? Or were you working for less stingy producers? Whatever it is, the script serves its laid-back style well, and the result is richer and more fun than Connery's first two Eon Bonds, "You Only Live Twice" and "Diamonds Are Forever." <br /> <br /> The '80s were not a good decade for Bond, whether it was Connery, Moore or Timothy Dalton. Leg warmers, video games and ugly sports cars are all in evidence, and Bianca Jagger's sunglasses, Klaus Maria Brandauer, are seen using in their first scene without any favor. Forget first impressions. The role of Brandauer as the main villain, Maximilian Largo, is one of the best in any James Bond movie, with Brandauer playing with the threat and mania of his character. At one point, he allows Bond free to wander from his situation room, with a martini to boot, and his dancing eyes and crazy and engaging smile make convincing company everywhere. The best thing in this movie, other than Connery, is Bond's girls, filmed with more attention to personality than usual in the Bond films, a testament of director of photography Douglas Slocombe and director Irvin Kirshner. Barbara Carrera was nominated for a Golden Globe for her role as the villain Fatima Blush, as crazy as Largo and even cooler to see. She does not last the whole movie; <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger's breasts and buttocks should have their own agents for the screen time that appear in this movie, but I'm not complaining. Basinger is a rare beauty who, in this opening role as a lover of Largo, mixes an incredible attitude with a childish vulnerability that brings Bond to me, and many others that I suspect. (Her lips and cheekbones are very sweet as well.) <br /> <br /> It's not a well-built movie. It's an imitation of a better Bond movie, with a sloppy plot, a terrible score and a flat ending. But there's Connery, proving that he was the definitive definitive secret agent of cinema, even though he steals a page or two from my 007, Mr. Moore. The end result is fun enough, so I'm not complaining.
