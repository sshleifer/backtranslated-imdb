Nynke is a class filmed movie in the same style as the Oscar-winning character Character (1997). But this comparison immediately leads me to add that the latter was much more exciting ... Of course, Nynke is a beautiful historical and costumes drama (with a fantastic performance by Monic Hendrickx!) In which you witness the drama. personal growth of 'Nynke van Hichtum' in his marriage to Pieter Jelles Troelstra. The subtitle of this movie is 'a lovestory'. So start and end with their marriage. <br /> <br /> But that's where the director makes a crucial mistake! Nynke's exciting and independent life began when the marriage was over. She wrote several children's books and traveled the world. What a great life she lived. But Pieter Verhoeff puts Nynke back on the trammels of the convention that depressed her, and that she struggled: the idea that her life prolonged her marriage to Troelstra, being none other than the mother of her children. <br /> /> Let's all wait for Nynke II!
