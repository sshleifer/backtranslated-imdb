A genius. My genius. I remember the second exact one in 1994. I was sitting in a pub in Shropshire, England. I remember the exact place. "Bill Hicks dies of cancer," the NME headline said. I felt as if someone had punched me in the stomach. Buy this DVD. If you do not find something one way or the other, I'll be surprised. <br /> <br /> RIP Bill, I so wanted you to still be here.
