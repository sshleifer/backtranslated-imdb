The main attraction of Anywhere, but here is the excellent performance of Natalie Portman. She gave her somewhat ungrateful character a lot of much appreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon, a good actress, is adequately honest as a maternal figure. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable, a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more engaging script. I'm not saying that the script was bad in any way, I'm just saying it looked underdeveloped at times. I do not think it was the writer's fault. The film suffered a lot of time, and was sometimes blurred in the longest scenes. The film looks beautiful, with good direction and great performances. All in all, certainly watchable, but perhaps more so for an older audience. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
