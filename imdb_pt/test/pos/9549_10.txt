There are movies that make careers. For George Romero, it was the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD; for Kevin Smith, CLERKS; for Robert Rodriguez, THE MARIACHI. Add to that list the incredible DING-A-LING-LESS from Onur Tukel. Impeccable movie production and as safe and professional as any of the movies mentioned above. I have not laughed that much since I saw THE FULL MONTY. (And anyway, I do not think I laughed that much ... so to speak.) Tukel's talent is considerable: DING-A-LING-LESS is so full of double senses that one would have to sit down. with a copy of this script and take a line-by-line examination to fully appreciate the width and width of it. Each scene is beautifully composed (a sure sign of a certain director), and the performances around are solid (there is no exaggerated scenario one could expect from a movie like this). DING-A-LING-LESS is a movie whose time has come.
