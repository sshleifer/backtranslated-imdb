I loved this movie! Markie Post is really great at it. I've seen it all my life, and it's in the same fun class of movies like "Betty Broderick's Story," "Locked Up: The Rage of a Mother," etc ... {which by the way are also very good, fun movies!} It's an exaggerated drama about a single mom trying to get away from her predictable middle-class personality. This movie is pure entertainment only! It does not have to be a realistic view of heroin addiction. But, it shows how any "regular" middle class person can (and they do!) Get addicted to heroin. Addicts are not just homeless people on the streets. {By the way, if you watch, check out how the kid tells your mother! 8 out of 10 stars.
