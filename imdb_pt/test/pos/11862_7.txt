One Night at McCool's is one of those movies that starts with a huge amount of promises, but as the movie continues, it becomes silly and wastes its time. Liv Tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to get her own way, displaying her body to all the men she meets, all under her spell. There are some funny moments in this, but they get less and less as the movie deteriorates. a farce of comedy. Michael Douglas, who plays the killer, is good, as is Liv Tyler, although she seems to have gained some weight since Armageddon. That's ok, but it's just memorable for the scene in which Liv Tyler was washing her car, you'll know what I mean when you see him fella! Shwing !!!!! 7 out of 10 (only).
