Adorable little Hitchcock thriller, with many cool antics around a murdered spy, a kidnapped kid, a nasty church, a foreign conspiracy, and some random taxidermists. Jimmy Stewart is as always a great hero to Hitchcock, the story extends to the cold climax at a function at the embassy, ​​but does not have the threat of Hitchcock's low budget black and white original. However, another wonderful film of the stable of the great master.
