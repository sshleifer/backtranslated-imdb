"Four Daughters" introduced John Garfield to the public, and that's what's most remembered about this movie today. Unlike some actors who appear in several films before their on-screen image gels, Garfield established his immediately, with a cigarette coming out of his mouth and talking about fate being against him. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is the story of four girls, his father a widowed musician (Claude Rains) and his various suitors, one of whom, Felix, is played by the handsome Jeffrey Lynn. He's the guy that they all have a downfall, but he's in love with Buff (Priscilla Lane). Then she meets Mickey Borden, who also falls in love with her. When Buff realizes that one of his sisters is in love with Felix, she leaves him at the altar and marries Mickey. <br /> <br /> This is a rather stereotypical story given life (and sequels) by acting. Garfield has already been mentioned, but Priscilla Lane was by far the strongest of the daughters, the most interesting and the best actress. Jeffrey Lynn was a new and good-looking protagonist, and this movie took him off with Warner. However, true stardom was not to be. Like many others of the time, he entered the service, and when he left, he had a bronze star, but not much of a career. He later entered the television and real estate market. Claude Rains is warm and wonderful as the patriarch. So popular was "Four Daughters" that inspired "Four Wives" and "Four Mothers" as well as reunited much of the cast again in "Daughters". Courageous, "where the actors played different characters. Very enjoyable, a pleasant memory of the simpler and probably happier times, and a chance to see John Garfield in his first film.
