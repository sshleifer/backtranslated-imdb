I was prepared not to like this movie, and the first 10 minutes did nothing to calm my fears. It starts with two high school gangs competing with one another with bad kung-fu. A scenario found in countless other Korean films. Ho-hum. Add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote "He Was Cool" (which was almost passable) and, well, I thought I was in an indescribable 2 hours. <br /> <br /> But do not give up so quickly! "A Romance of Their Own" was directed by Tae-gyun Kim, who also did "Volcano High" (which I found very entertaining). Anyway, "Romance of Their Own" soon gives a turnaround for the better. A high school girl, having moved to Seoul, finds herself in the midst of the attention of two potential suitors. Each face has its own merit, and it is not clear which one (if any) would be the right choice. <br /> <br /> What follows is not your normal teenage triangle. Emotions are complex and although you may not agree on certain choices or actions as the movie unfolds, you can certainly understand why the characters do them. <br /> <br /> The film asks questions to the characters and the audience. Who chooses one? At what point is one forced to make a choice (and it's unfair to one if it looks like it's being tied)? After you (or your heart) made a choice, how do you react (and how * should you react) when new information comes up that sheds new light on the situation? There is a scene, near the end, which is very subtle but captures perfectly what I think would be a real-life reaction rather than over-the-top "reaction to the cinema". The subtlety is in a character at the bottom of the scene. Recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed. Basically, he does not know what to do with things. Instead of making him "conceal" something, or look like an open-mouthed idiot, he just looks at some fixed spot unable to react or say anything. It's as if someone just pulled the plug from him. His reaction seemed true to me and I enjoyed the scene. <br /> <br /> Like most Korean films, there is a mix of action, bravery, slapstick and melodrama. Korean films often take abrupt shifts (see "Sex Is Zero," for a prime example), which can be a big shock for the uninitiated. Go ahead and start with this one. Like, love or hate, I think most viewers will be able to relate and appreciate the actions and reactions of the characters.
