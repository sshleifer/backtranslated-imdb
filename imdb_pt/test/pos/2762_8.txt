I have seen so many negative reviews about the Survivors of the Andes that I felt compelled to defend it (or at least I will try). First of all, of course it looks dated, it was made in the seventies on a very low budget, but that's part of its charm. I like contemporary movies, but I also like the old ones for what they are worth. I'm not the only one who feels the desire to just watch or enjoy movies with modern treatments and effects; In addition, almost every movie fan likes old movies (who does not like El Santo or Plan 9 space movies, does not matter the overall quality?). In the rhythm aspect, it is just a tool to cover (again) the low cost, and I think the constant dialogues are in order for a better development of characters and situations. Of course, Alive has a better FX, but I will not despise the old one just because of that, and I do not feel very attracted to English speakers at an event involving people from Uruguay and to me, this gives an advantage to Survivors of the Andes. It's like even Canoe of the seventies and based on a real event too, would have a better remake now due to the advancement of technology, but I think I'd stick with the one based on the thrills it offers regardless of the production date. is based on the impact I had on me, because the first time I saw this was on TV, and nowadays I do not think it has lost any of its prime force. Of course it's been a long time and I've seen thousands of better movies in every aspect of cinema, but that does not detract from its real value. It's not a bad movie, and I put it above Alive without hesitation. Just take a break.
