Stupidly cute. This movie symbolizes the 'bad' genre of the movies. <br /> <br /> The only two talents are Richard Boone and Joan van Ark, and only Boone is good. It's kind of sad that the man who came to fame like Paladin should end up in this ugly pile of celluloid. As he turns into a fantastic performance, I could not help but feel that he overcame all his fellow actors in this play that he should not even be there. <br /> <br /> The effects in this movie are laughable, but fun. The idea of ​​a dinosaur being buried in the wall of a cave and suddenly coming back to life is the gold of movie B. When the triceratops is killed, watch as it falls. Of course, the stunt double in front of the suit knows the best time. It falls to the ground, well before the dinosaur's back half does the same. Speaking of 'suits', there is nothing good to say about the purple tyrannosaurus in this movie. It seems to have some sort of furtive technology, since Bunta (supposedly the best tracker in the world) fails twice to catch him until he's within range. I do not know how all the prints are, but in the version I own, the roar of the Tyranno contains the trademark of Godzilla below. <br /> <br /> This is so much fun to watch if you like bad movies. I love them, and especially bad monster movies, so I consider that to be the jewel in my collection. If bad movies are your thing, definitely take this one.
