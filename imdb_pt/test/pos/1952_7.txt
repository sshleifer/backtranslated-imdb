Joshua Miller (as Tim) tosses his sister's doll into the river while Daniel Roebuck (as Samson) howls and smokes a cigarette after killing Danyi Deats (as Jamie). The doll washes, but the naked girl stands by the river, for any passer-by to see. Seeing the corpse are a group of teenagers in their twenties, mostly classmates of the naked corpse. Stoners Keanu Reeves (as Matt) and Crispin Glover (as Layne) are best suited for cameras. Friends wonder what to do with their culprit, killer friend who drinks beer. <br /> <br /> Veteran cast member Dennis Hopper (like Feck) keeps young people's heads fed. Mr. Hopper once killed a woman. He lives with one of those life-size sex dolls, with a mouth apparently ready for action. Ione Skye Leitch (as Clarissa) is a more living doll, and she's waiting for Reeves to kiss her. His copulation is notably cut with a flashback of opening throttling. Real teenager, in her first feature film, Leitch is the daughter of the 60s singer and singer, Donovan. Make other peculiar connections on your own. <br /> <br /> You can read a lot in the movie, or not, depending on your mood. Some of the character backgrounds may be a bit too subtle. More obviously, the murderous teenager was provoked; note your weight, attitude and "hygienic" nickname. Some of the characters' relationships and motivations are vaguely defined, but the cast certainly keeps the material interesting; and director Tim Hunter, photographer Frederick Elmes and writer Neal Jimenez are obviously adept. <br /> <br /> ******* River's Edge (27/8/86) Tim Hunter ~ Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover Dennis Hopper, Joshua Miller
