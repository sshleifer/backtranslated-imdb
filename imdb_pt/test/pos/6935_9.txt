I just finished with Zombie Bloodbath, part one of the fantastic Zombie Bloodbath Trilogy DVD from CAMP Motion Pictures. Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage of the Undead is next. Now this has puzzled me a bit because of some plot holes and some confusing twists here and there, but it's a better movie on many levels. Director Todd Sheets really shows a great leap in style and talent between the two films. Again, this is not for people who want gloss and Hollywood-style horror movies, this is for people who like their bloody, raw and grainy zombies. The story, as far as I knew, was basically about two thieves who in 1945 tried to steal an elderly couple and found that the couple is a member of a cult. One guy is simply dead and the other, the perpetrator, is basically turned into a scarecrow and crucified and they put him in the next camp, still alive, but dying. Cut to the present day and a van full of college kids collapses near a farm. At the same time, a group of convicts escapes from a nearby prison. Both groups end up in the same house. The house was where the elders got used to living, and when one of the damned people knocks the scarecrow out and picks up his jacket, makes the scarecrow wake up and in turn brings the cult members back from the dead. Wow. And that's all in the first half hour. There is another plan also happening in the city where a couple of serial killers took some workers to a deli as hostages. This really works, however, as the people trapped in the house finally escape and end up in the same Delhi. Most of the twists works just fine, but it's obvious that the film was very complex at some points for its own good. It all ends in a huge confrontation with the remaining heroes finding a delivery truck or something full of meat eating jars of bacteria. Of course they play the undead and cause a lot of melting and a few heads to explode and then we have a strange and thought-provoking ending. First, let me say that although it was not always easy to follow, I still had a lot of fun with this movie. It was fun and the acting was very good for a low budget effort. It was obvious that Todd Sheets was really trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie movie, and in that sense, he did. It had better special effects than the first film, great rhythm and some cool music and visuals, plus a real show-stopper from a shot of INSIDE a mouth while a knife is stuck through it. Care was taken here and it shows. The weakness is in the script and in some of the more lazy performances. Again, I recommend listening to the comment track. It was even better than the first and I learned a lot. How to find out that some of the scenes were filmed in the Super 8 movie for effect and that the movie came back ruined from the lab and they could nit use it. And they were already editing the movie the moment they got the movie back, so some of the confusions are from some scenes that are not in the movie. Also, I learned that Todd Sheets really has a passion and love for making horror movies. It shows. The film is a good example of budget-less cinema that could have used a more rewriting but still shines with more style than most of the DV movies I see. It's not as much fun as the first film, although it's a better film technically. I really admire Sheets as one of the real innovators and pioneers in the DV movie industry ... and this is a great addition to the cheapo zombie genre!
