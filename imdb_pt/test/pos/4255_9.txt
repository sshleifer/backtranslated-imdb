I thought I might be disappointed seeing this movie again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my inexperienced youth with his honesty and brave humor. In 1969, the transition between African-American groups from a predominant policy of reconciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still rather new and more than a little controversial. It took courage and gentleness to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures that often approached in real life. A special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided his character falling into sociopathy or buffoonery. I'd rather watch it than "To Sir With Love" any old day!
