I saw this in a theater in 1982. I was expecting a stupid T & A movie. This is not what I got. <br /> <br /> Basically, there are about three teenagers trying to have sex. We get the expected jokes and sexual scenes - but for once, they're really really funny! <br /> <br /> Yes, they are stupid, but I liked them anyway. In addition, there was a surprising amount of male nudity. <br /> <br /> Then the movie, half way, takes a dramatic turn when one of the boys (won by Lawrence Monoson) falls in love with a girl. . So the jokes stop and things get very dark. I will not reveal what happens, but I was very surprised at the sudden change in events. The film addresses some very important issues and treats them realistically and intelligently. And it has a real heart-breaking end. <br /> <br /> I'm giving 10, because this is probably one of the best sex comedies / dramas of all time. Blends fantasy and realism together and works! What else can you ask for? Also has a great soundtrack.
