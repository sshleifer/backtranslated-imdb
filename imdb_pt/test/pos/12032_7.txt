Hollywood has transformed the Mafia into a production line that goes from banal to excellent and despite some good acting and a reasonable script (a lot of it is - for a change - true!) This "home entertainment" effort has to fall slap bang in the middle. <br /> <br /> The script is not only obvious (all the checkboxes end up being marked), but it spends a lot of time trying to create a pastiche of the best of other people's work. . The godfather is the most obvious, but there are other references as well. I will not bother naming you. However, it is a good-tasting borrower! Does the producer seem to set a quota for shots and murders (one at least every twenty minutes?) And the end is weak and "so what?" They say there are several versions of this production, so maybe that's just the version I saw. <br /> <br /> Gangsters do not make money with money. Usually by fear. Some seem more tied to murder and business chaos than making money. They were the ones who were the first to go (in real life and here). "You can not make money with a gun in your hand," says Charlie "Lucky" Luciano on an internship. One of the smartest gangsters, though all things are relative. He was a white slave trader and a drug dealer before being packaged at home to Italy. The old school "Pete's mustache" was chosen by the new bloods who wanted power and money for themselves and free themselves from the straight jacket of Italian / Sicilian power (rarely doing business outside of them) . The young Turk knew that he needed to be allied with other groups (most notably "the Jews" who knew how to launder money) and this is at least referenced and acknowledged. What is not so clear is that most immigrant groups had their own mafias - but most of them made money and was legitimized. And why not? Who wants to die in jail? Joseph Bonanno was a ruthless man, prepared to kill if necessary, but not unjust or stupid. His story was tragic as he could have made money in the world and showed a special ability to avoid being killed. With a bit of luck attached, of course. <br /> <br /> Despite the variety of respectable names and three actors in the title role (Bruce Ramsay, Martin Landau and Tony Nardi) there is no charisma or talent. to bring us and feel anything. We are - merely - passive watchers in a life we ​​are glad of not having leadership. The people shown here were born in a cruel world, but their only mark was to make it more cruel. <br /> <br /> If you do not get bored of the gangster genre, it will be better than watching Godfather 1 & 2. for the tenth time and it's even better - as basic entertainment - than the horrible ignition that was the godfather 3.
