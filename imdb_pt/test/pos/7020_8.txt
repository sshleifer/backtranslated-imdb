Dirty Dancing - I think everyone has seen this movie at one time or another. I remember as a kid, I loved this movie and watched it several times without getting tired of it. <br /> <br /> Now that I'm a little older, I bought the DVD recently and have not yet been disappointed. With performance. Swayze and Gray create the atmosphere for this movie, although they say they do not get along, the chemistry of the film is unbelievable! As the movie progresses, we are sucked into their relationship and believe in each of their actions. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is incredible, the music only adds to the romantic mood of the movie and increases the relationship between Baby and Patrick. <br /> <br /> The last scene makes this movie, which can forget the famous phrase "Noboby puts Baby in the corner". The music is perfect and the dance is incredible! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone, at any age, it's just a fun movie that anyone can enjoy 8/10.
