This is a classic American movie in combination with comedy, romance and dream. you may say, 'There have been a lot of such films already. but believe me, you will find a good one because it is well directed, scripted and played. Amanda Bynes is just madly amazing! she is humor, cute and charming inside and out of the screen. she is the man indeed !!! the message I receive is for you to follow your own fairy tale. What I mean by "fairy tale" is not that of prince and princess but indicates "faith." that is, tells us to keep your faith, dream and things that make you regret your whole life if you do not. one of those movies you can not miss in your life.
