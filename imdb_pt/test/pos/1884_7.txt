This was a funny movie. Just seeing the Evil Dead trilogy less than a week ago (and still wanting more), I got as many Bruce Campbell movies as possible, including the bad ones. This is funny, without being exceptional, but as sure as the original hell. I mean, you have mad scientists, superhuman cyborgs, half-brainwaves, gypsies, ex-KGB taxi drivers, jealousy, passion killings, love, romance, sex, action, and what else, all with the same 6 actors :) <br /> <br /> You really have to see and have fun, I can not explain it in a text box. I think it's not so much a cult movie as Evil Dead, but it certainly has that Bruce Campbell touch that I love. Ted Raimi lends a hand, Tamara Gorski looks beautiful and interesting (she was very far from the prostitute on Friday the 13th) and Vladimir Kolev also shows a lot of promise as an actor, although he will likely be chosen as a supporting character in Hollywood films all his career. <br /> <br /> In short: funny movie. If you liked Evil Dead, you'll enjoy it, too.
