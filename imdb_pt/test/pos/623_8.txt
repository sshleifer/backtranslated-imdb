Superb low budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a bat, and lots of macabre humor along the way as well. <br /> <br /> The cast plays very well, although Richards' self- centered film director is a bit difficult to take sometimes. The minuscule appearance of two scenes by Sir Alec Guinness, exuding threats like the Moscow crime czar, is simply the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Worth watching again and again, but not on the dark nights when you are alone!
