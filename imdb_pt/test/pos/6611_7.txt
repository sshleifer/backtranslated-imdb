This film for me deserves a lot of praise, because even though I'm not a surfer or skater, I was inspired throughout the documentary. <br /> <br /> The depth of the history and development of these two extreme sports emphasized what they were able to do for two groups of individuals. The dedication these individuals had is truly inspiring and it was because of them that others now can enjoy and do what these guys founded. <br /> <br /> Unlike most other documentaries, this one has been expertly assembled, o The amount of footage that was recorded and survived over the decades is excellent and it was because of this that some of the biggest issues I've ever vi were put together and resulted in the focus of the subject. Without the desire that they portray recent images of the most famous surfers and skaters who are still popular nowadays. <br /> <br /> The film explores areas such as success, performing new tricks, winning competitions and gaining fame. As well as failures like injuries or burns. <br /> <br /> It was also gratifying to hear that the experiences come from skaters and the surfers themselves and not second-hand information. This resulted in a better image to be drawn. <br /> <br /> Overall, a truly remarkable effort.
