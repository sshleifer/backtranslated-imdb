This is another good western, which I liked. it's not an epic or anything, but it's good for what it is. There are about three fur hunters, led by a man named Jed, who is rude and uncivilized. Jed and his two friends see themselves as beaters from a fortress that is the only thing between them and the Indian band, who resent the Americans on their lands, and want to get them back. That is the essence of the story. What follows is action, excitement, even a bit of humor and forbidden romance. One of Jed's friends, Gus, reminded me a lot about the character Quint (played by Robert Shaw) in the movie Shark. Both have that rude and grumpy behavior. re a western fan, you must find much to like about this particular entry.I think it deserves a 7/10
