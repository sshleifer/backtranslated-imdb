Gymnast (2006) was written and directed by Ned Farr. Dreya Weber plays Jane Hawkins, a world-class former gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified masseur. <br /> <br /> Promotional material leads you to believe that the plot revolves around Jane's accidental meeting. with a former teammate. Although this encounter takes place, this plot is secondary to the main plot, which involves Jane, her husband and a professional dancer named Serena (Addie Yungmee). The two women perform an act of the kind performed by Cirque de Soleil. The two complement each other - Jane has more experience with heights and has tremendous strength in the upper body. Serena is more elegant and artistic, though obviously also capable of incredible physical deeds. <br /> <br /> The movie works because we can understand how Jane would turn to Addie, who is affectionate and compassionate, while Jane's husband <br /> <br /> Both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and Dreya has lean body and well defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. They are clearly performing their act, and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would, in fact, be a hit in Las Vegas, or anywhere else they traveled. <br /> <br /> Sexual tension between women is obvious, and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while they are suspended in the air. A woman with a negligent husband and an attractive woman makes an explosive situation that is not resolved in a clean and tidy way. <br /> <br /> Of the six films we saw at the Rochester NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival, we thought this was the best. It will work on DVD and definitely worth searching on large or small screens. NOTE: Stay for the credits!
