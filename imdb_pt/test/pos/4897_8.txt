I just saw "The Gentlemen's League: Apocalypse" at a special screening in Manchester with Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith of the League present. <br /> <br /> In the back was Peter Kay (who has a brief participation in the film) lovingly fighting in the back during the question and answer session after the movie. <br /> <br /> The film was complicated (in a good way) and very, very funny. It follows Geoff Tipps, Hilary Briss and Herr Lipp while trying to save the fictional Rosyton Vasey from the disinterest of its creators. <br /> <br /> The league plays with a wide range of characters and themselves (or characters based on themselves). ) and are ably supported by the cream of British comedy actors and characters such as Bernard Hill, Victoria Wood and David Warner. <br /> <br /> Warner is a special highlight, reminding me of his smooth and cutting edge in Time Bandits. <br /> <br /> The film swims in and out of various realities and allows some of Rosyton Vasey's residents to have some room to grow beyond the usual limits of their comedy. <br /> <br /> Steve Pemberton's Herr Lipp has a great Bretchian moment near the end of the movie and has to make a decision about its purpose and meaning in life that brings a lump in the throat at an unexpected time and surprises you with your affectionate suit by the characters. <br /> <br /> This echoes something that Mark and Reece said in Q & A after that the league plot weary of their famous characters is spurious and that the whole movie is really a love letter to them. <br /> <br /> For a format that began as a radio character. Based on the sketch show, these guys really developed the idea to the point of sustaining a movie that takes you on a journey through fiction, 'reality', comedy, tragedy, and a pleasant journey for two of the less obvious characters to carry a long way . history of its 70 odd existing creations. <br /> <br /> Fans of the show will love it. Dedicated dedication and attention to detail in spades, the uninitiated may be a bit lost, but the joy of LoG has always been the ability to almost instantly tune their characters observed keenly and make the stylistic leap into farce and homage to the expressionist film. <br /> <br /> There are many honors in this, including 'The Shining' and 'La Belle et la Bete', to name but two who have seen and demonstrated their love of cinema and history with a segment The England of 1690 does all the way when you're involved with the movie. <br /> <br /> What I can say, I was amazed, confused, full of emotions and laughed all the time and they definitely got what many failed. A British TV comedy hit for film translation. <br /> <br /> If you've watched and enjoyed 'The Gentlemen's League' in the past, go ahead; If you do not have it, rent / buy a DVD and then go see it. Very well staff and thank you for the charming and fun Q & A.
