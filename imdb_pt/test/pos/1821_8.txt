I really enjoyed this movie, it totally reminds me of my college days. The soundtrack is incredible. I'm a big fan of cage and this is my favorite movie that it is. I love the plot, it's a total love story, against the kind of thing. I think anyone who graduated in the early eighties (1980-1984) should see the film. Totally brought back high school memories for me.
