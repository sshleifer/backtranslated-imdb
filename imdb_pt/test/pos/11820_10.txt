Very good movie! I was browsing through the channels on my TV and I generally ignore the channels that broadcast drama movies, but then I saw that channel that shows old school movies and that's where I saw that movie. In the beginning, when I saw the title "The Cure", I thought it would be annoying, but I got hooked when I saw Brad Renfro in this movie (because one of my favorite movies of all time is "The Client" where Brad also stars). Then the scenes were getting better and better. The story is so beautiful and very touching! I cried a lot in this movie that I usually do not do. Great casting! and there are so many beautiful lines / quotes in this movie that is very striking and made me cry a lot! Now, I bought my copy on DVD and I always recommend it to everyone!
