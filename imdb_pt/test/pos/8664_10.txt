Den Brysomme Mannen is one of the best films of all time and it is about a man trapped in a world where there are no senses, no feelings, no love, no truth and no freedom. A world where people get scared when someone says what they think, express or show affection, a world where no one is free and no one has the slightest idea of ​​the meaning of it all. Just like the world we live in, the world in Den Brysomme Mannen is a world of lost souls trying to be realized, but focusing on the complete opposite of what fulfills them, materialism, social acceptance and mediocre satisfactions. <br /> <br /> Den Brysomme Mannen deserves all the attention of all human souls because we could all use a new call Wake Up.
