I had not planned to leave a comment, but seeing some of the other terrible reviews for this movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the ending or anything, but I give some important points in this review, so you should be aware of this. The short spoiler version of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis kick in this movie, and it's a lot of fun. Watch. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my all time favorites. Geena Davis is perfect as the action heroine, torn between her current life as a housewife and mother, and the memories that are reemerging from her former life as a CIA assassin. Her performance is superb, as she interprets the two facets of this relatively complex character perfectly. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson's performance is, as always, excellent, as the Private Investigator that Geena Davis's character hired to investigate his forgotten past. He does a great job of playing Geena Davis's unwilling helper of hard character. Some of the lines he says in this movie are the best he's ever used in any movie he's in. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you have not seen it, do it. It's a fantastic story with many unexpected twists, and it's extremely well-driven and acted.
