In the second of his Historical Martial Arts films, Chiba portrays his real life sensei Mas Oyama. The film even recreates Oyama's incredible feat of killing a furious bull with his own hands (Oyama did more than 50 times in real life). Dynamic fight choreography with authentic Kyokushinkai techniques. Ironically, this is one of Sonny Chiba's rare films in which he does NOT tear or tear away opponents' body parts. A must-see for Sonny Chiba fans, definitely one of their top 5 movies
