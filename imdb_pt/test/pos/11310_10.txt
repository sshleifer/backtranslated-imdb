"Medusa: Dare to Be True" is an outrageously funny parody that is a great companion to the original, "Madonna: Truth or Dare." The brilliant creation of Julie Brown skews the highly entertaining documentary of Madonna (though not exactly audacious, insightful, sincere or true) with a fidelity to detail, up to packaging. I recommend this to fans of Madonna, fans of Julie Brown, or anyone who likes a clever and smart parody.
