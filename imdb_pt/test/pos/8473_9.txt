A masterful performance by Jamie Foxx is just one of the highlights of "Ray," a 2004 film starring Kerry Washington, Regina King, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Sharon Warren, Patrick Bachau and many others. The film has several major focuses: the first is Charles's childhood - the drowning of his brother George, who haunted him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him, and the strength taught to him by his mother. Do not bend, do not break, never be a cripple. She finally sends him to a special school where the gift of Charles's music is discovered. The next focus is Charles's artistic evolution as a Nat King Cole singer, his arrangements for gospel music, his foray into country music and the unique sound that became Ray Charles. The third focus is Charles's personal life - his marriage to Bea, his many subjects, his heroin addiction and eventual rehabilitation. <br /> <br /> As Charles lived a world full of 74 years, many things were ignored. Although Charles was orphaned as a teenager, the death of his beloved mother, his rock, is not in the movie. While he is shown on the chitlin circuit and refuses to play in segregated clubs, his near starvation as a musician is not covered. At one point, he found a pot of jelly and tried to eat it, but the jar broke. He was discouraged. Bea is shown with him when the State of Georgia, which forbade it, adopted "Georgia on My Mind" as the theme in 1979 and receives Charles back to his home state, but he and Bea divorced in 1977, which is not mentioned . . She was probably there, though. Besides, she was not his only wife-he was married once before he met her; This marriage is not covered. In the movie, we are told of an illegitimate child - it was 12. It would be impossible to get all of this and more in a movie. <br /> <br /> What is not overlooked is his glorious music. , which seems to continue steadily throughout the film, continuously reinforcing its genius and art. <br /> <br /> Charles's story is compelling and holds the interest of the public everywhere. Those who scoff at it like a movie made for TV do not give the credit they deserve. The direction of Taylor Hackford gives "Ray" a good rhythm, and the film has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the several decades beautifully. <br /> <br /> As Ray, Jamie Foxx inhabits the character and makes him forget that he is a comedian playing a part. Foxx wore prosthetics, made his own piano, and spent a lot of time with Charles preparing for the role. He blinds you, but it is not an imitation - he is a flesh-and-blood man with hallucinations standing in the water and finding his brother's body; a man full of denial about his addiction, hating the word drugged and believing that he is not addicted; and he is in denial about his home life, thinking that his wife does not know about his various subjects and illegitimate children (in the movie, child); and a man took a terrible advantage early in his career because of his blindness that refuses to be stepped on later. He demands to be paid in $ 1 bills so that they can be counted; when he discovers that it is a sauce train for the owner of a club and his partner and was almost robbed of a contract with a record company, he does his own business and leaves the job. <br /> <br /> No one marvels at this. Foxx's performance has accepted him as Ray since the first time he appears in the camera. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent biography, which, like "Walk the Line", is punctuated with the artist's fantastic music. Whether or not a fan of Ray Charles, "Ray" is something to experience.
