I admit that I may have missed a few moments when I was not paying attention, but I've told enough of the story to agree that it's a great family movie from director Lionel Jefferies, who played the part of Grandpa Potts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. It basically starts with a happy middle-class family living in Victorian London. One night the Father (Iain Cuthbertson) is visited by two strangers, and he goes out with them and does not return. They move to a hut in the field and here the children; Bobby (Jenny Agutter, whom I first saw in Child's Play 2), Phyllis (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) keep their spirits up with their fascination for the nearby railroad. Every day they faithfully beckon passengers on the passing trains, and with courage and vigilance they also avoid an accident and are made heroes. His kindness makes them friends, including important people who can help find the mystery of the missing father. Also starring Dinah Sheridan as Mother / Mrs. Waterbury, Bernard Cribbins as Albert Perks, William Mervyn as Old Gentleman, Peter Bromilow as Doctor Forrest, Ann Lancaster as Ruth and Gordon Whiting as Russian. It was number 29 of the 100 Greatest Family Films, and was number 24 of the 50 biggest British films. Very good!
