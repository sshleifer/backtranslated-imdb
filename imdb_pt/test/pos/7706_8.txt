Tracy and Matt, Michelle and Sebastian: These are the two couples whose lives of addiction, crime and misery are brilliantly captured in this gross and honest HBO documentary. They are petulant, charming, repulsive, surprisingly stupid and dedicated shifts: to drugs and to each other. They are also very different: Matt is a working-class kid who clearly has fun with his shrewdness while Tracy supports the couple with their father's Western Union money, which makes a surprise appearance at the end of the movie. . Meanwhile, widow Michelle (whose husband died of otolaryngology) earns her daily bread by posing as a NYPD cop willing to cut off her alleged Johns agreement to avoid prison time, and sad fellow Sebastian lives off the rent. You will be drawn to their stories and you will wish the film lasted twice as long. Unlike most documentaries of this type, there is no coda providing us with an update on their progress (can Matt and Tracy actually maintain that apartment in Brooklyn? Is Michelle going back to Bellevue for more detoxification, and can Sebastian become more pathetic?). As a result, the film seems incomplete, but that may have been the goal. Essential vision, as long as you are not totally averse to scenes of people shooting.
