This is an excellent B movie horror film that borders on horror and comedy. It's about a genetically mutilated scorpion in outer space. Can it get more unreal? It is a hybrid between "Alien" and "Chain Saw Massacre". The film was filmed in Stockholm with a mixed cast of Americans and Swedes interacting beautifully. Director Martin Munthe does a great job finding the comic highlights on this screenplay and gets a good laugh from the audience. The film was filmed with little or no money and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources. Stinger has all the qualities of a B movie horror movie. It's comical and scary at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause. It's great to see movies like this can still be made! I would recommend seeing if you like this type of movies.
