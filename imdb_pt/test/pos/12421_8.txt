This is a surprisingly large low budget Horror / Comedy, it's funny and very well done, with good performances and a really cool twist! Eric Jungmann (Adam) and Justin Urich (Harley) all had fantastic chemistry together. One of the funniest moments of the movie for me is when Adam is stuck in the bathroom, and Harley wakes up to find the monster truck sitting there, and decides to take a p * s in the truck, and Aimee Brooks is simply sexy! Also, this is one of the best low budget Horror movies I've seen in a long time. It's very bloody, but in a comical way, and I thought it was very well written, plus Michael Bailey Smith be fantastic as the Monster Man and have a perverse makeup! It's similar to movies like Joy Ride, Duel, Jeepers Creepers etc etc and has a few moments of suspense here and there, plus the gore effects are very well done for the most part. This is a surprisingly low budget Horror / Comedy, it's funny and very well done, with good performances and a really cool twist finish, I highly recommend this! The direction is very good!. Michael Davis does very well! work here with excellent camera work, good angles, good use of colors, and using a great scenario, in addition, he kept the movie funny and at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> There is so much horrible! . We have extremely bloody nose bleeds, bloody impalaments, bloody stabs, face is cut in half by a monster truck, human remains in a boiled stew, guts all over the place, guts bowels fall, eye pencils, bloody split throat, bunch of people walking without limbs, bloody dead squirrel, crushed heads, severed limbs, bloody and mutilated corpses, decent amount of bloodshed, a very bloody scene at the end, and more. <br /> <br /> Acting is very good for a low budget movie. Eric Jungmann is fantastic here like Adam, he was a nerd but very nice, he had fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich, he had some cool lines, and I just loved his character, he also seemed to be having fun, and he was especially good at Last !. Justin Urich is excellent as the best friend, however I could not help but love him as he was very funny, and often stole many scenes, I really cavei! Aimee Brooks is beautiful, and did very well with what she had to do, she had good chemistry with Jungmann and how Jungmann was especially good in the end how I loved her mysterious character. Michael Bailey Smith is wonderful as The Monster Man, he was very scary, had an incredible makeup and now is one of my favorite slashers! Rest of the cast do well. <br /> <br /> Overall, I highly recommend this! *** 1/2 of 5
