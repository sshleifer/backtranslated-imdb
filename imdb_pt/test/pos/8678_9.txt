Andreas arrives in a strange city. He does not remember where he came from and how he got there. He is ordered to get to work and receives his own apartment in the city. All his co-workers are friendly and polite to him, they say hello and smile as they pass by. But, later, Andreas discovers that the city is not as pleasant as it seems. Going home from work, he sees some people wearing gray suits, cleaning up the bloody dirt of a corpse, apparently a suicidal victim who threw himself out the window. The procedure is done with a calm mind, as if they were emptying a bin. The next day, Andreas finds the suicide victim fully alive at work. More and more Andreas discovers the unfeeling atmosphere of the city. <br /> <br /> Den brysomme mannen may be the best Norwegian movie I have ever seen. The original artistic direction is lacking in the Norwegian films, with few exceptions. The plot is also very original, and could even be called postmodern horror, since the film presents us with a terrifying thought of having to deal with a world that is completely without feelings. and the more you try to fill your life in this city with a meaning, the more insignificant it becomes. I am fascinated by how the director manages to create the feel of a dismembered universe, a nightmare, from which you simply can not escape, not even death. <br /> <br /> Go see, it's worth it! I gave 9 out of 10.
