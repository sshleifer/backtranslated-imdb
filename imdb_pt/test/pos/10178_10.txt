A SUPERMAN Cartoon <br /> <br /> A huge shipment of gold is being shipped across the country by train. Using ultra-modern techniques, a sophisticated gang of hooded thieves tries to use gold. With intrepid reporter Lois Lane as the only passenger on board, Superman is the ransom. But now that it has become a runaway train, can it even stop the BILLION DOLLAR LIMITED? <br /> <br /> This was another in the series of excellent drawings that Max Fleischer produced for Paramount Studio. They feature great animations and fast, firm plots. Intended to appear in cinemas, they are miles ahead of their Saturday Morning counterparts.
