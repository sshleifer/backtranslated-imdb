I am amazed at the questions and issues that this documentary has brought in the reviews here, especially since they are in fact interesting questions. Of course, those who could handle it would be the film's own producers. However, I think I can shed some light on something that I think has been overlooked, which is, in my opinion, the purpose of the film, about what it is and what it is trying to convey. What is your message after all? At the risk of pointing out the obvious, I will start by saying that the filmmakers have an intention. They are trying to tell a story, draw meaning from it and get a point of view. With that in mind, we can overturn many of the points criticized, particularly those involving what people expected in contrast to what the filmmakers were really trying to show. Causes and consequences of violence? The movie is not about that. Is it not "enlightening non-Brazilian public" on the issue of the Brazilian favelas? Well, who wanted to do that? Is AfroReggae this or that and supported by whom? It does not matter in this context. There are not enough women in the movie for your taste? It is not about equality or the feminist cause. Every little detail about Anderson's life, mother, son, family and all aspects and functioning of the AfroReggae movement? Well, do not be so picky because it does not matter. There is so much that a story can have before it becomes a movie. If the authors showed everything that everyone is expecting, they would have to do a 6-month series on TV. If you're expecting all of this, you approach the movie the wrong way. <br /> <br /> The film is actually about two individuals who started a movement. Two individuals full of ideals. Two individuals who thirst for change. Two individuals trying to do something about all the mistakes that surround them. Individuals who went to the bottom of the pit and wanted to get up again. It's all about finding a purpose in life, inspiring oneself in misery, changing fate and becoming something other than what they were meant to be - criminals and drug dealers. It is about achievements and hopes, not about the cruel reality of violence in Rio de Janeiro, although it is an integral part of the film that is what the characters are constantly surrounded. Unexpectedly and not without reason, the film ends up focusing much more on Anderson's course through life's difficulties. That's because they were confronted with Anderson's accident while they were filming the movie. I'm not sure about this, but they may even have seriously considered finishing the footage right there, leaving behind all the effort expended. But Anderson wanted to continue. And so they did, risking losing in having a film with an identity crisis, considering the sudden change of course, but winning in showing someone overcoming such a devastating event. It is very evident to those who watch that the film begins on AfroReggae and ends at Anderson. It's very original in that sense (the plot change). Perhaps their only sin is not being evident beforehand, which may initially raise expectations that will not be met. As for the importance or vulgarity of Anderson, I would say that not everyone wants to change the whole world. , put an end to all violence, feed all the hungry, whether as Mahatma Ghandi, be as known as Mother Teresa or any other known personalities that exist. It is much easier to relate to and inspire someone who is, like everyone else, trying to turn your hard life into a problem child, dealing with permanent injuries or illnesses, and even managing to pay the bills. end of the month. Understanding the movie you have to do is leave a past of involvement with drugs and crime, offset that, and try to persuade others not to follow the same problematic path. Although you may criticize if the way they have chosen to do this is effective and doubting the ideology of the method, you can not deny their intentions. Also, the perception that Anderson is special or chosen may have something to do with the fact that the filmmakers became very involved in the lives of the characters they were playing. As much as they become friends with them. There is no way not to leave the whole movie with a more favorable light on Anderson. If a dear friend gets paralyzed in an accident, it's not just a fact, you make a big deal out of it. And this is not necessarily bad. It is not much that they treat you as a "chosen one" as much as they strive to try to show you as a seed for transformation and source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, do not watch this documentary for the scenes of the reality of poverty and crime that it contains, watch it for what is so much more, an inspiring story. <br /> <br /> Nike-Ad-like? It looks very nice and professionally made for me and does not affect or diminish the movie's intentions. Romantic? Speculate about your credential as a documentary if you want, but why not when it should cause reaction and inspire? Are not you trying to improve people's lives through music and dance - the essence of what the guys are trying to do - romanticize their own reality? Forgive me, but showing just the facts is what reporters do and you can watch it on TV every night. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to become a filmmaker, I would like my first film to be great, too.
