This is one of the classic episodes of TWILIGHT ZONE, where, with the simplest of situations, the viewer was drawn into an apparently symbolic conflict, only to find the solution surprising and strangely acceptable. Five figures are inside a container / prison: a Major, a ballet dancer, a piper, a clown and a tramp. They are certainly a strange choice of types to be in this isolation chamber, but they are all in it (however) and they are trying to figure out why they are there. What do they have in common? Nobody can figure it out. But gradually the major organizes them to work to bet, leaning on each other's shoulders. And the Major, going to the top of the line of numbers, arrives at the entrance and ... I leave like this, although one of the other critiques on this topic really gives the story. <br /> <br /> The title seems to be suggested by SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR, the famous play by Pirandello. If the real purpose of the show was to pretend that the play is questionable: the characters of Pirandello analyze their roles and relations with each other. But the five characters here, while trying to understand their situation, are totally in the dark - they are not in the situation of the six characters in Pirandello who know their current situations. This uncertainty of what is happening allows viewers to think it is an abstract drama. <br /> <br /> The actors, William Windon as Major and Murray Mattheson as the Clown in particular, give good accounts of themselves. And the conclusion, planned as a parody or not, is quite effective.
