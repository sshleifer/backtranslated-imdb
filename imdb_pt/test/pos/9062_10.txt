Peculiar, vulnerable, raw, honest and a pleasure to watch. I'm not here to give a summary or synopsis of the movie. I would simply like to congratulate this little film with the GREATEST GREAT HEART. I take my hat off to the filmmaker and he's an excellent cast. If you want to know what happens in the movie ... then go see. Michael Parness, writer / director, dealt with a very sensitive and emotional subject, Suicide, with great compassion, comedy and empathy. I see a great career ahead for Mr. Parness. This movie works. From the scandalous opening sequence to the tender and honest moments between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. As in all the movies, we need to suspend some disbelief, but I found that with MAX AND GRACE I was easily transported and completely convinced with their "surreal moments". I just wanted them to have pushed some of those moments even more. Mr. Parness "pulled" some wonderful performances from this already talented cast. For example, the performance of Guillermo DÃ­az as a patient in the asylum was hysterical and also in movement. The colossus Ralf Moeller, formerly Mr. Olympiad, like a terrified patient ... perfect. I can continue and continue ... This independent feature has the star power of a big-budget Hollywood movie, yet you forget the STARS onscreen as it flows along with this wonderfully written story. The real star here is the brilliant script. I look forward to seeing more of the writer / director Michael Parness.
