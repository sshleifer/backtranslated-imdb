Many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare, however, from time to time a movie can come honest, funny, entertaining and memorable. The Last American Virgin is a special film that has found its place and has stood the test of time by mixing all four ingredients together. This film follows three misadventures (Gary, Rick and David "The Big Apple") misadventures to the world of sex for the first time and true love. Along the way, they learn difficult lessons and the value of true friendship. We follow Gary (the main character) hopelessly romantic on his journey to conquer the girl of his dreams, which leads him to an uncertain road with an astounding twist in the end. If you have not yet been lucky enough to see this movie, take a look ... peppered with many memorable songs from the 80s throughout the film to keep things at a uniform pace. L.A.V. truly is an original film, a rarity among films of the genre.
