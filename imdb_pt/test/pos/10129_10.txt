Radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt, in his heart, it was the right thing to do. The viewer will be forced to imagine what he or she would have done. The adversity that coach Jones and Radio faced was tragic and predictable. People did not understand; nor did they want to understand. But in the end, the power of circumstance forced people to understand and appreciate much more than before they happened. Radio is a young man with mental problems who understands very little, plus three of the most important things that are often forgotten when we mature: intuition, compassion, and love. Coach Jones is a high school teacher who can not ignore the situation of the oppressed who is just trying to play a bad hand of cards the best way he knows. It was sad how Coach Jones and Radio met. The practical joke that terrified life off the radio was enough to make you want to punish severely, not just the boys involved, but every kid who knew what was going on and did nothing about it. However, on the positive side of the scale, the incident led to a friendship that would influence so many lives in the way that most of us believe only happens in movies. This movie is a real-life fairy tale and should not be overlooked. Ed Harris was his usual brilliance. Gooding was flawless. Radio is an inspiration.
