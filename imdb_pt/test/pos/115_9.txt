It is a very sensitive portrait of life with uncut or restricted desires. What is done with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? A husband finds the immigrant's exit - because immigrants do not belong or are not accepted, they do not have to conform and repress their desires. The other husband seeks solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness. He fails - of course - and he breaks into the last scene for several reasons. Sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for his devious exit to his blocked wishes. Her mother still could not find the strength to destroy her myth. She sees him as a child who is glorifying himself in his control of lust, but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow? Both wives find courage and unity through their rejection shared by their husband. <br /> <br /> But the final act of rejection was Grandma's - she could not break free of her rusty mentality to accept Sita's desire. A decade and more of receiving care was not enough to break the shackles of their culture. <br /> <br /> It seems that it was easier for the house to help their desires to flow - since it is doomed by their culture - to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. Since there is no respect and expectation, you can also taste sin.
