I had the privilege of watching Mar Adentro last Friday, and I'm still shocked by its beauty, the powerful work of each actor and actress, and the incredible ability of Amenabar to tell the story of Ramón Sampedro, who was well known in Spain for asking for a legal euthanasia, lost the cause of the court and ended up dying in front of a camera drinking a glass with poison, freezing all our hearts with his determination not to continue living forever immobilized because of an accident. Before watching the movie I was already hypnotized by the strong symbology in its title, which I would translate as "Into the Sea" and not as some suggest "Out to sea", and which is taken from a original poem written by the man this story is about. So I watched the movie. Oh my friends. This is the Cinema with the capital letter C. The narration flows to take you to the heart of each character: Sampedro, reincarnated in a Bardem that you forget from the beginning, is at the center like a man full of sense of humor and full of hope, and his hope is to die, because for him, the life he is living is not worth living. The rest of the characters, except one, dance around him and respect his decision because he sees him as an independent human being (forgetting that he depends on others for everything), even though they love him very much. And that's what the movie is: love. You can feel it, you can breathe in the skin of all the characters. You witness the growth of feeling within three women who know you in the film: Gené, the member of the association that defends your right to die with dignity, your friend, your story in the movie is the hope for us, the lucky ones that can live a normal life in this world; Rosa, the woman who finds a good man in the middle of her list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who have used and despised her; Julia, the woman who shares a tragic destiny with Ramón, and eventually acts in a way that we can not help but understand. <br /> <br /> However, before meeting these women, Ramon knew what love was, because you can not know it. without loving him, and he is deeply loved by his self-sacrificing family: Four characters unique in his humility and bravery, each with his own thoughts about his decision, every thought respectable in his own way, because the terrible thing about this story is that no one is guilty of what happened. That, unfortunately, life is sometimes so terrible. From this familiar quartet I especially liked the work of Mabel Rivera as Ramón's sister-in-law, Manuela: a fantastic performance. <br /> <br /> I would like to draw attention to three episodes that are to me the best climatic points I have seen in a long time, and if you have not yet seen the movie, read this paragraph and read it again from next, starting "Inland", let the movie show its secrets to you. The episodes I loved were: 3. The best love scene I've seen in a movie, when I really felt the love invading the screen, is when Ramón dreams awake that he is flying to find Julia on the beach and they kiss. 2. Gené on the phone with Ramon the day before, and says they'd better say goodbye at the moment, so as not to get her in trouble with the authorities. And then she knows it's the last time they'll talk, and she fought for her right to die ... but she does not want to lose him, because she loves him as a true friend, and even though she respects his decision at all costs. 1. The best A young Ramon on the beach, looking at his girlfriend in the sun, jumping into the water from the rocks to a sea that is retreating. We see the accident, we hear his voice remembering what happened and claiming that he should have died at that very moment. Bardem's face, turned down, showed us from the bottom. And the hand of a friend who pulls him from the forehead and brings him back to a life that will be hell for him in the next 30 years. There are many others, such as the impressive finale, despite the fact that in Spain we know very well what Ramon did. <br /> <br /> Offshore did not fool me, Amenabar never does, but this time he has to thank the actors who participated in the project, and who perhaps took him personally, because this is not just a movie, it's a elegy for a man who died alone when he was asking to die "legally," which meant to him as Bardem pointed out, dying with the people he loved and who loved him around.
