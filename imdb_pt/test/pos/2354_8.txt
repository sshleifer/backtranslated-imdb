I remember seeing this movie when I was very young and several times on TV since then. I always liked that. I noticed in the impression shown on the local TV that a scene reversed the movie. It is the place where they are hiding behind the rocky outcrop (looks like Vasquez Rocks near Los Angeles) watching the Indians pass by. If you look carefully, you will notice that all soldiers are suddenly left-handed! It's just a short segment and I have to admit that it took me years to figure it out. As far as history was concerned, there were often expeditions to rescue white prisoners from the Indians. The direct connection to the final battle scene is the Battle of Beecher Island. In that action, a group of volunteer scouts equipped with repeated carbines (Spencer carbines and not Winchesters) were surprised with the Indians and retired to an island and made several accusations. On the last charge, they killed Roman Nose, one of the most famous Indian chiefs. I have no idea if the screenwriter had this in mind, but this fits in very well. <br /> <br /> There are several Guy Madison movies that I hope to get out on DVD someday and this is one of them.
