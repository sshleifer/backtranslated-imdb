We loved this movie because it was so fun and out of fashion - it's not your usual Hollywood trick. <br /> <br /> My husband won a Blockbuster coupon and broadcast a series of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to leave when he saw this and decided to give it a try. There was only one copy - and with some flaws on the DVD, we finally had to switch to the widescreen version and then go back to the full screen version so that it would stop working. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role. And she can sing too! <br /> <br /> If only Hollywood learns from independent filmmakers! Maybe we could go back to the real movies. But for now, we have really short movies and really fun like this! Other examples we have enjoyed include: A box full of moonlight, pieces from April, delivering Milo, The Celestine Prophesy. Most by Christopher Guest, such as: Best in Show, by his consideration, a powerful wind and waiting for Guffman
