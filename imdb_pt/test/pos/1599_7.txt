I do not know where to start this. In short, it was a disappointing movie. Having taught the novel, he was aware that it would be a difficult story to turn into a movie. The film has some interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach), but does not represent the debate about art that basically shapes the novel. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I was expecting an older Aschenbach and a younger Tadzio. In the book, Tadzio is fourteen, but is described as pure, ideal, innocent, while in the film he smacks of sexuality and is provocative. He is Aschenbach's accomplice, he always looks at him, almost provocatively. In the book, it is Aschenbach who steals glances at the boy. As for Aschenbach, I imagined something closer to the teacher who became a clown in The Blue Angel (based on a story of Thomas Mann's brother, Heinrich) than this forty-year-old with almost no gray hair. In all fairness, I think Dirk Bogarde did a good job, but someone should have done it, or should have looked older in the beginning. <br /> <br /> I know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story, but the film minimizes the talk about art and the duality between Apollonian and Dionysian inspirations and focuses on Tadzio's obsession with Aschenbach and does not justify this. I liked the fact that Mahler's music was used, because in the end he inspired Mann to write his story. I am not sure that turning Aschenbach into a musician was a particularly good move. Or the creation of Alfred that I do not remember in the book. <br /> <br /> And one thing that really got me was the sound and how it did not match the lips of the actors. I wanted to know if it was nicknamed because I expected it to be in Italian. But then I remembered that every Italian film I watched has this problem. This only bothers me because these directors (Fellini is the other person I'm thinking of) should symbolize perfection in Italian cinema, and here are their characters laughing without sound, so you hear a noise that does not match their faces. (I'm thinking of the scenes where Aschenbach nearly fainted and starts laughing. This scene could / should have been the strongest, but it was annoying instead.)
