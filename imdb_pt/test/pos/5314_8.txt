I loved catcher in the rye, happens to be my favorite book. JD Salinger, the catcher's author, has rights over the book and made a person not be able to make a movie about him with his permission. <br /> <br /> With that said, here is the "United States of Leland." Beautiful movie with a lot of meaning and depth in emotion. but a lot of that reminded me of catcher, I almost remembered a lot of catcher. The few stories that Leland recounted in the film, such as visiting New York and his adventures, were very similar to Holden's, and the way Leland sees people and emotions is also similar to Holden's, both are simple and true to themselves . others. superior performance credited to don Cheadle and Kevin Spacy. great edition, everything falls perfectly together, and loved the story all together. I recommend it as a purchase or at least a rental. good movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing he does is drag on some points, but it pays off in the long run. give yourself time and enjoy a good movie.
