Luchino Visconti became famous for the world after his wonderful production THE LEOPARD. Film fans knew the style of the director who introduced himself as one of the new postwar realists, an aristocrat who developed his individual free thinking and consequently expressed them as an artist. However, when applied to this film, MORTE A VENEZIA based on Thomas Mann's novel, is a slightly different story. The whole movie is at first glance so unique, so psychological and very influenced by the various thoughts of an artist (the director and main character Gustav von Aschenbach) that seems to be "unattainable" to many viewers . So such opinions about the film went up as being "too slow," "unbearable," or "boring without end." Because? The reason seems to be in a widespread insight nowadays: "GOOD MOVIE IS PARALLEL TO ACTION WITHOUT FUCKING". Here it would be appropriate to say: "GOOD MOVIE IS PARALLEL FOR NOT ACTION". In fact, everyone could say one sentence about the content of the entire movie and that would be enough. All that we find in DEATH VENEZIA has a vague sense of reality, full of depth and superficiality that seem to be significant for the benefit of each moment. And that's when we notice the psychedelic scenes in Venice, when we see Gustav at the train station, when we receive his intensely emotional memories. The insight in his decaying mind is sometimes so intense that the only way for the viewer to continue watching the film is to do the best to feel and experience than to see and think. Everything is bound to disappear, to wither like flowers in the meadow when the time comes. In other words, everything has a sense of loss and death without many events or even dialogues. As a result, you are very unlikely to get the idea of ​​the movie after a single preview. It should be seen more than twice with the mind constantly open. Whether you like it or not ... it's a different, very personal story. <br /> <br /> Artistic values ​​are the factor that is perceptible at first sight and stays with us everywhere. Beauty as something very significant for the main character who seems to come and go; rest as something that is going so badly and comes to it in the most unexpected way; feeling that he finds in a teenager who appears as a model of all dreams and desires, as a forbidden fruit of the homosexual lust that disappears. Costume designer Piero Tosi does a splendid job in this film. Through a wonderful wardrobe, he provides us with a very realistic view of 1911 when the action happens. The director of photography Pasqualino De Santis offers us a fantastic visual experience that can be called a real feast for the eyes. And deep down comes the music of Gustav Mahler, the composer whose life inspired Thomas Mann to introduce the character. <br /> <br /> The performances are of a high level, particularly of Dirk Bogart as the main character, Gustav von Aschenbach, who wants to rest after a hard work of art and in vain tries to find him in crowded Venice. For most of the film, we get a great insight into your thoughts, feelings and acts of anger, exhaustion and despair. Although at times depressing, he keeps us on the right track to the end, not losing hope of the least tragic end ... Tadzio (Bjorn Andersen) describes the model of decadent homosexual desire, but also a model of beauty and purity that seems to last very short ... "Adieu Tadzio, it was all very short," says the main character. A great, though very controversial, work is done by Mark Burns as a sort of "super-ego" Alfred with whom Gustav quarrels over ideals like beauty, justice, hope, human dignity. For Alfredo, beauty belongs to the senses. How Freudian, but how dangerous the idea can be! And always present in the Italian artistic films of the time, Silvana Mangano - here as an elegant lady from Poland, mother of Tadzio. <br /> <br /> Memorable moments indeed constitute the strengths of the film; However, not all viewers will find them unforgettable. They, like any strange film, require a lot of effort to get in the right path of the director's individual ego and within the four walls of his psyche. Among these scenes, I consider the sequence of the beach very important, particularly the way Gustav observes Tadzio. Physical distance accurately represents the lack of courage to approach ... I also appreciate the shots when Gustav is sitting on the gondola and the view of the city moves in the background - how memorably this can lift existential thoughts of transference. We are not people, a kind of "passenger" in the world, in the journey that life is. <br /> <br /> In the end, I must tell you something important. I had found it extremely odd until I began to look deeper into what the director is really trying to convey. So every scene ended up being significant in your interpretation that you do not have to agree with (I hardly agree with anything the main character does), but you should at least tolerate it as something the author wanted very much to say. Listen to your voice, allow you a few words on a page of reality ... So there is a long way to understand the film, since not many movies like this were made in 1971 and are being made now. Paradoxically, it seems we are all doomed to have the correct feelings about this movie in the long run, just as we are doomed to once experience a strange, inevitable and usually unexpected reality that death is ... 7/10
