The Youth In Us is a perfect gem. I saw this stunning short at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. History has led me to a profoundly transformative journey. The direction of Joshua Leonard, the performance of Kelli Garner and Lukas Haas, the direction of art, cinematography, soundtrack - each element was faithful to the bone. We can only hope that this exquisite and excruciating film is the prelude to a greater work of this talented director. Just as a short film is screened before a feature at Sundance, commercial cinemas have used a similar format in past times. It would be wonderful if miniature masterpieces like The Youth In Us could reach a wider audience in this way.
