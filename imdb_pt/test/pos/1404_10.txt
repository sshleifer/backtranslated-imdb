I was impressed by how even the acting was everywhere. William Haines had a range of acting that is wonderful for silent movies. Not over the edge. There are times when the camera work is excellent, and combined with the story, like when he is waiting to see the superintendent, very well done. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie. <br /> />
