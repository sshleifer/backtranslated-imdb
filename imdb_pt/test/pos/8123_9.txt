For the acting in this film, sometimes it is difficult to NOT imagine that the cast is who they portray. Rampant passion and acting sometimes make this a very enjoyable and engaging film. I would not even know that except HBO late at night. And the biggest reason I like movies in the UK so much better than the Americans is that the actors are not afraid to interpret what is needed.
