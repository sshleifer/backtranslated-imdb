Man with the Screaming Brain is certainly not a perfect movie, but I'm sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, which means that it functions as a sort of career-long resume: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven - there are many things in history that do not make much sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts simply because a female brain was implanted in it?), And some of the scenes look like retreads of other better incarnations the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William fight for control of William's body, comes out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, many little touches and no strings that look quite bright, as when William is at the height of his panic and shouts at a statue: "What are you looking at?!" The film looks like an original Sci-Fi Channel, probably because it was. The acting is really very good. I particularly liked Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was relentless and cunning, yes, but she seemed to have a tragic air about her at certain times that history never explored. Ted Raimi dealt admirably with the role of "clumsy assistant," and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sarcastic, condescending American idiot. (Now that he's writing his own films, you think he'd give himself a role in which he has not been labeled already.) Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre, nonsensical B-movie that should be enjoyable Any one that can avoid taking a cinematic experience very seriously.
