A courageous presentation of the decadence of family values ​​and human dignity in the wake of Soviet communism, Verla's 1988 film Vasili Pichul is a milestone in modern Russian cinema. Pichul's brutal drama marks a sharp departure from the images of hygienic idealism promoted in Soviet times (as in Aleksandrov's Circus), impetuously moving the social chaos of his time into the public spotlight. A contemporary Ukrainian scenario further intensifies the effect, first by the immediacy of the film in its time period, second by its use of a place not only fighting for identity rather than a Soviet system, but also as a distinct nation of the Russian language. who dominated the USSR. <br /> <br /> Vera, protagonist and protagonist of the film, is a rebellious teenager with a "dysfunctional" family, including a father who drinks a lot and a mother who cares for you. Rejecting her pretended Andrei, Vera begins a destructive (and mostly sexual) relationship with a college student named Sergei. Despite his parents' aversion for the lazy Sergei, and despite Sergei's gruff contempt for his parents, he moves into the tight apartment. The tensions increase until Vera's drunken father stabs Sergei. Vera must decide whether to remain faithful to her intolerable family by testifying that her father acted in self-defense, or continue to support and defend the ever-outstanding Sergei. Unsustainable in almost every imaginable way, little Vera captures and communicates with mastery the inescapable emptiness left in social life after the collapse of communism. The sexual aggressiveness of the film (the first film to show explicit sex) combined with the relentless presentation of social reality (a striking distinction of socialist realism demanded by Stalin) effectively confronted the conditions of life prior to that of the Soviet Union. The most interesting, however, was the public reception. While many wrote hate letters to the director and star, the film was very popular. Here the double-edged nature of "film as social criticism" emerges: if done correctly, the film will leave the audience uncomfortable. As no easy solution presents itself, some viewers will hate the film and the filmmakers for "bringing" the issue. Many movies come to mind as something comparable in this regard: Larry Clark's Kids, Harmony Korine's Gummo, popular movies like the John Hughes Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to those viewers for whom the prospect of nearly two hours excruciating domestic conflict and social miasma is not overly scary. The film is absolutely gorgeous and incredibly challenging. Despite the difficulties of watching the film, some moments are deeply beautiful. It is clear that the socio-historical and cultural significance of the film can not be overlooked and, in fact, it works as an even more assertive reason to watch this film.
