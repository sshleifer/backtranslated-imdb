IMAGINARY HEROES is a great movie! Written and directed by Dan Harris this story is classic theater, weaving comedy and tragedy together with such force that the climax of the film takes its breath away. <br /> <br /> The Travis family is a strange group: no member is who each one seems to be. Beginning with the suicide of reluctant swimming hero Matt (Kip Pardue), father Ben (Jeff Daniels) collapses and isolates himself and his family while his mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) turns into marijuana and anger. sarcasm, daughter Penny (Michelle Williams) returns from school repelled by her family's behavior, and the remaining son, Tim (Emile Hirsch), carries the weight of all above avoiding his classmates, girlfriend and teams with his neighbor Kyle ( Ryan Donowho) to jump on drugs and sexual experimentation. Throughout the movie Tim tries to hide bruises on his body that has a secret all his own still take his girlfriend to feel the rejection, his mother the rage against the bully garbage parking lot she believes is the cause and finally open the window to the bottom scars that this family has endured for years. Secrets and lies here, and their resolution is painfully dramatic. <br /> <br /> This may be the best role of Sigourney Weaver, though Emile Hirsh, Jeff Daniels, Ryan Donowho and Kip Pardue (despite the brevity of their role) all contribute top-level performances. The story begins slowly and seems to wander and this fact may lose the attention of some viewers, but stick with that little film of driving force and the impact of the work will stun you. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
