Anyone who has seen the trailer for this movie would be forgiven for thinking that this movie is a comedy. In fact, it's a laid-back, if not overly funny, joke about some robbers. <br /> <br /> There are countless flaws in the movie. The script and plot are weak and the love aspect of the story is strangely monotonous. However, despite all this, it's quite enjoyable, thanks in large part to the two protagonists Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller. These two great actors, Carlyle in particular, are always good to watch and here there is a good chemistry between them. Director Jake Scott is the next generation of the family whose brothers, Ridley and Tony, have given us films like Alien, Blade Runner, True Romance and most recently GI Jane and Enemy of the State. His debut is directed with energy and enthusiasm, which keeps the film failing, although without the strong cast he mounted the results may not have worked well. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are looking for an easy nice movie to spend an hour and a half then you could do a lot worse than Plunkett and Macleane. If, on the other hand, you like something subtle, historically accurate and thought-provoking, go somewhere else. 7/10
