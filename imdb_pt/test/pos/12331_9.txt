You have to see this movie ... I saw, at the age of 13, in the theater, on my first date ... Fast forward more than 20 years and now I'm gay (Thank you very much One Dark Night !! RI MUCH!) . This movie scared me like a kid (mausoleums still do!), But as an adult, the excitement of this movie is not in the storyline, but rather the hysterical laughs it keeps ... Highlights are listening to the movie Teen names call one another others, from "nerdlebrain" (my personal favorite) to "turkey". Also, keep your eyes open for the scene where Carol (the blonde, head sister) tries to hang the phone in a soda can (I can not believe they did not rephrase that!) ... Other highlights include the excessive attitude of Adam West. dramatic explosions and sticky bodies. If you're a true horror fan, I'd suggest this movie just because, to me, it's almost a parody of horror. There def. a scary factor and the plot is good, but do not watch if you want to be afraid of your intelligence (unless you're 10 or something).
