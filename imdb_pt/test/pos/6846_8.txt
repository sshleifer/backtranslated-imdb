I loved this movie !! Great performance by Carla Gugino. Interesting story about a kidnapping that goes terribly wrong (not all of them?). Some surprising twists and turns in the film and plot were easy to follow without being so complicated as to be totally incomprehensible. It was a totally unexpected pleasure. More "Quentin-ish" than most movies try to be.
