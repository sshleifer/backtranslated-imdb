The Hookers was for me a great story of ordinary people, as someone you may have met. Just trying to do this, my big break is just around the corner. Then Life's little temptations infiltrated, the spoiler stumbled again. How much, your love can lead, and give, to the guy who really is not so bad, after all, only human. I liked it, I also paid an extra in the movie. I played drums in the photos of the bar, with the band, made several hiking photos, my green 66-foot corvette was in the shots of the motel party. Wonderful cast and crew, top notch people, down to earth movie. I had lunch with James Coburn on Mother's Day, what a wonderful man, as I've known him for years, I'll never forget him. My dad spent the day with Slim Pickens, and exchanged stories of horses, Slim was also really down to earth, love these guys, we really missed them. Real people making movies about real people, Thanks Levy, Gardner and Laven.
