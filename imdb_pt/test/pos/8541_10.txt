You know those movies that are blatantly horrible, but you can not help but love them? Well, that's what Evil Ed is, possibly the best horror movie in the world. The sound is rubbish, the dubbing is crap, the script is absurd and the special effects are pap. However, I can not help loving this movie and I have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years. Sam Campbell (or the guy who plays him) should be featured in the actor's Studio Series as he is memorable. Possibly the greatest villain in the movie not named Tony Montana. Seriously, if you do not expect much then you will not be disappointed. Keep a carefree approach to watching this movie and you'll soon evaluate the 10 afterwards.
