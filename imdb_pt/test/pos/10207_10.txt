I saw this movie for the first time in the movies in the 1940s when I was a kid and I always remembered the ending. There is nothing like the first impression, but some movies are always a pleasure every time they are seen. Something just resonates with them. This is one of those films and I agree with another reviewer who said Fritz Lang should have directed more westerns. To add, I always liked Randolph Scott and Robert Young. In fact, Robert Young stars what I consider my favorite movie if I have to name just one, it's not an easy thing to do. This movie is Northwest Passage. This led me to Kenneth Roberts' marvelous historical novels. Western Union also led me to read Zane Gray's novel, which in this case turned out to be one of those rare cases where I like the film more than the novel. Not that Gray's novel is bad; I just like the story of the movie best. The movie does not look like the novel. It's a completely different tale, one of the biggest deviations from a book I've seen. <br /> <br /> I can not add much to the other comments, except to say that I agree with many of them. I also wish it was released on DVD. "What happened to Randolph Scott happened to the best of me."
