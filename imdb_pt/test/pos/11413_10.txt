Do not listen to most of these people. ill give you a better review of this movie that my friend and I love! It's about Jill Johnson, played by Camilla Belle, who is nanny in the Mendrakis house and someone invades. If you're wondering how he got into the house, he went through the most likely garage. Anyway, do not listen to "the worst performance". has incredible acting. with a great story. I think there are 2 benefits Jill has. 1. She is a fast runner and is on the athletic team. 2. she left alive! lol. <br /> <br /> It's a cool and rather scary movie. check it out, you'll be happy with this masterpiece. Do not listen to other people on the site. it's very good. Trust me, I'm good at reviewing movies. I am a future film critic. I totally want to buy this movie. and you also go when you see. is incredibly incredible.
