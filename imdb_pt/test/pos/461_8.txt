A very learned and intelligent drama about a group of international travelers held virtual prisoners in Hungary in 1956, invading the Russian communist regime. Kerr and Robards play lovers, she is a British baroness, he is a Hungarian freedom fighter trying to do his part for his country. Other stars of the New York theater of the period Anne Jackson and E G Marshall play an American couple traveling with their two children, including Ronny Howard in his movie debut. Jackson's character is immensely pregnant and is not eager to give birth to a future communist country; she makes a passionate appeal in the third act of this film that foreshadows the naturalistic acting styles we know today from Redgrave, Fonda and Streep. Leading the pack of Soviet wolves is Yul Brynner, magnificent as commander and sexiest ever since he played Kerr in "The King and I". He is petty and unpleasant and terribly conflicted by his attraction to the lovely, patrician and heroic Kerr. This is one of the great transition films of the latter part of the Golden Age of American cinema. Do not miss.
