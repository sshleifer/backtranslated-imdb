I totally loved this movie, I tried to buy it and could not find it. A must see, a movie you can watch again and again, funny, but also a tear jerker in one. very good album for the movie. is a really good 80's movie, I would like to find a copy to buy this movie because I would, the actors in it acted very well. There are many people out there who could probably relate to this movie. That's what makes this movie so good. so get out and try to rent this, you will not regret it. is an older movie but worth watching, I would not be surprised if they did a remake of that movie soon, but I'm sure it would not be the same. who has not seen it, will rent it.
