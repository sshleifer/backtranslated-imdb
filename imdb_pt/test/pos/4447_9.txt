What a surprise this movie was. I saw some of the horror and zombie films of Fulci and I was amazed that it was from the same director. He also wrote the screen game which shows that the subject was able to elaborate a detailed and complex plot. The dubbing on this is not good, but away from the terrible slop that only hampers later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'. <br /> <br /> The picture in this movie is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic road appears throughout the film, which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered. A scene involving the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to watch, but refreshing compared to the usual movie violence. <br /> <br /> What went wrong, Lucius? Perhaps there is a strong argument to suggest that it reached its peak with this film, and was slowly descending after that.
