If you like horror or action watch this movie as fast as possible. If the opening scene does not excite your adrenaline, someone should check your pulse. Great Action, great casting and top one-liners. This is the only movie I saw in a movie theater where the audience applauded every blow, kick and punch played. Not perfection, but who cares when the movies can be so much fun. It's a pure race of dark comic action. 9/10
