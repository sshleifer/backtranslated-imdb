This is a scary understated Gem with creepy performances and a fantastic ending!. All the characters are great, and the story was amazing, plus I thought the ending was really cool! The plot was great, and it never bored me, moreover, while the child actors were bad, they gave me shivers! This happened to be in the space channel a while ago, so I decided to take a look and record, I read some good reviews of horror fans, I must say I agree with them, it is very scary, and suspense, in addition to Strother Martin , was fantastic in his role as the worshiper of Satan. It has tons of scary atmosphere, and you're guessing, plus all the characters are very friendly, and you really start to cheer for Ben and his family! It has many disturbing moments, and the movie really shocked me at times, moreover, it is extremely well done with a low budget! This is a scary underrated jewel, with chilling performances and a fantastic finale !, I highly recommend this! The direction is very good!. Bernard McEveety does a very good job here with excellent camera work, creating lots of scary atmosphere and keeping the movie at a very fast pace! Ther is a little blood and blood. We have a severed leg, lots of bloody corpses, bloody throat, cut and cut, decapitation and impalement. The acting is excellent! Strother Martin is fantastic here! as the worshiper of Satan, he is extremely scary, very convincing, very cold, extremely intense, seemed to be enjoying himself, and only did a fantastic job in general! Charles Bateman is great as daddy, he was very affectionate, very nice, and gave a good show!, I really liked him. L.Q. Jones is amazing as the sheriff, he was funny, on top of things, looked very young, had a cool character and just did an amazing job in general! Ahna Capri is good as the girlfriend and did what she had to do very well. Charles Robinson overcame himself as the Priest and did not convince me at all! And his laugh was especially bad. Geri Reischl is really decent as the daughter, she was kind of nice, and just got on my nerves a few times, I liked her. Alvy Moore was goofy but very nice in his role as Tobey, I dug it! The rest of the cast is good. Overall, I highly recommend it!. *** 1/2 of 5
