This is not a bad TV movie. Shtrafbat is the abbreviation for Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means Penal Battalion. These battallions were formed due to increasing demand for soldiers, while the Soviet Union was suffering heavy casualties throughout the war. These battalions consisted of condemned soldiers and dishonored soldiers who had a chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat. They were despised as slag and were easily expended during the fighting without much regret or much honor on the part of the military. They were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties. Those who refused to fight were executed in plain sight. Needless to say, their lives sucked. <br /> <br /> There were some very nice performances from the cast, especially from Yuri Stepanov who represented Antip, Aleksandr Bashirov who represented Stirah and Roman Madyanov who represented Major Kharchenko. However, the series is not really as addictive, partly because it is too long, could have been much shorter and more effective. <br /> <br /> Although it is about war, Shtrafbat has very light violence and virtually no gore. It depends solely on the actors to make it work, and after all, it's a TV series, so the producers did not want to scare the viewers and the sponsors. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat explores the cruelty of the movie. Soviet regime, and explains why so many men chose to fight against the Nazis instead of joining them. Personally, I'd rather be a fascist then a communist, given the circumstances presented in the film. One character explains that the Soviets left their farm clean and their family starved to death. Out of anger, he burned, which arrested him for destroying the property of Kolhoz and he ended up in the criminal battalion as a criminal. Antip remembered how his mother killed his youngest son to feed the rest of his family. The two men explained that they fought for their country, not the Soviets. <br /> <br /> The criminal battalion had a Marine who raped a girl, killing her comrade in prison, threatened the other. comrade to keep his mouth shut over the trials, and then pretended he was hurt when it came to fighting. After all, the girl committed suicide because of the shame. I imagine that if enough marines watched this movie, they would pick up banners and protest on the streets for a boycott or an official apology from the producers. <br /> <br /> To say the least, I recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in the former Soviet Union or in World War II. I do not think I've lost more than 500 minutes of my life.
