Where this movie differs from the traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe, for example, we had years of war and, although one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended up living close to each other or with each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the white immigrant population exterminated the Aboriginal population until near extinction. the American citizen never had to live with his enemy. This explains, in my view, the often simplistic nature of the Hollywood movie when they try to explain the dispute of a foreign country. But in this film, the director and script do not fit into this clich√©. It turns out that everyone in history has some right and some wrong. It's a great story of hidden morality, truth, and commitment.
