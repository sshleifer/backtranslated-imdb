I really can not see why people do not seem to like this movie. I found it a lot of fun (of course the fact that starring the beautiful Laura Fraser is a bonus!) When I heard about it, I thought it would be along the lines of a "Weird Science" reversed by the role and for one In fact , this is true, however, there is a twist that I did not really see coming. Having seen the trailer on the DVD (which I had not seen before watching the movie), I saw that the "twist" is actually shown in the trailer! Very strange. <br /> <br /> As the movie progresses, the comparison "Strange Science" fits in less and less, and I think that's the best of the two films. Certainly there are some scenes that do not work wonderfully, but these are offset by the enthusiasm of the young cast. <br /> <br /> In summary, I suggest this is a good example of a Sci. -fi girl movie, and I guess I have not seen too many of them!
