I know this movie took a pretty hard ride from the critics, but I have to say that I enjoyed it a lot. The real star here is the fantastic Dylan Moran. He never ceases to be hilarious and convincing in all his various guises. He can also radiate a sweet charm that belies his outrageous pratfalls. Special mention should also be given to Michael Gambon, who plays with laughter with a brilliantly accurate yet comical Dublin accent in the center of the city. The only weak link is Caine, who, although obviously has a great laugh, plays the less interesting and less unfriendly character. It probably will not play so well on the outside, but it's worth watching anyway.
