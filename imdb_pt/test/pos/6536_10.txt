wow is all I could say that I really loved the movie and one thing I could tell Aaron Carter is that I really think you should be in a lot more movies making you rock. I love Aaron Carter so much he is hot and so I say thank you for making this movie great. I really wish he would be able to do a lot more movies because he is a great dancer, actor and singer. I also wish I could sing the best I could. and I'm a fan of him as always and I'll never stop loving him. I rented the movie and had it for two days and literally saw more than 10 times. laughing loud you could call me crazy, but this just proves that I liked it a lot. If you want to talk, you can give me a tip at dvlbab300@aol.com, then send me an email if you want. I LOVE YOU AARON CARTER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
