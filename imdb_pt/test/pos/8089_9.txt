This satire is really very, really dead and no one is spared. But even though this film has a lot of laughter within the silly story and grotesque imitation of Hitler (here cleverly renamed "Hynkel", and speaking in a hilarious pseudo-German type), the general tone is quite sad, perhaps because of the place of the film in history. And the actors are not exaggerating that much, I suppose. One of the greatest moments of all-time cinema should be the closing speech of the Jewish barber, if things could have ended that way. It's not even the character talking any more, it's Chaplin saying something he really meant. If you ignore the technical aspects, the movie does not look dated or old, it actually moves at a pretty nice pace. And the sharp humor that we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing I do not care about is the slapstick, but this just comes with the era, I suppose. This is an incredibly bold and hard approach to fascism, it is so blunt even after all these years.
