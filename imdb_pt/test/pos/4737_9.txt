Waco: Rules of Engagement does a great job of not drawing conclusions for your viewers. He simply presents interviews, filming the deadlock, shooting congressional hearings, phone conversations, testimonials from experts, etc. and allows you to draw your own conclusion. <br /> <br /> I hardly intend to suggest that the data presented. here was done with 100% objectivity, but it's very convincing. You will not like Koresh any more after seeing this than before, but I tend to think you will come to believe, as I do now, we have not been told much about what happened before and during the impasse.
