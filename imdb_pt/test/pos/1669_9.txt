A recent reissue of the French crime film (Du Rififi Chez les Hommes), with its famous 20-minute sequel to silent jewel scandal, now arrives in the US in a beautiful new print from the Criterion Collection with improved legends and some extras. Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin in Middletown Connecticut) who was forced to make movies in Europe because he was blacklisted. Rififi was well publicized in the US and did well in art houses. Later, Dassin became much more famous in the US for "Never on Sunday" (1960), starring his wife, Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri. (Greece was again glamorized and popularized by Americans and others with Anthony Quinn in Mihalis Kakogiannis' 1964 'Zorba the Greek', which went to a big hit in Cairo.) The new Rififi DVD includes a recent interview with Dassin. I did not realize before that one of the main thieves, Caesar Milanese, was played by Dassin, who came on the scene when the original actor became unavailable. He is one of the most memorable characters, a dandified and safe Italian biscuit that does not speak French. <br /> <br /> Although this classic has all the ornaments of the French film noir - the black and white twilight world of brightly lit apartments, shiny black cars, men in suits, nightclub scenes, including a title song dramatically filmed and played in the club, the stone faces and the Gauloises in the hand or the mouth - I do not think it's as atmospheric or as distinctive as a style like Melville's movies. But there is the hypnotizing assault, which still stands today as a tour de force. It's like a clock, with a good sense of skill and teamwork among thieves. Some meddlesome cops are treated efficiently. Things quickly go wrong after they go home and hand out the loot when one of the players gets sloppy and gives the lady a ring with a million dollar bracelet on it. Has there ever been an assault movie whose criminals lived happily ever after? <br /> <br /> It is the sequence of speechless assaults that ensures this special place, and Dassin, an American director who has had an extraordinarily varied and exotic career, deserves all the credit for it. He took a novel so conventional that he would reject it, and added some key elements that make it special. In the event, he could not fail to make the adjustment: he needed the money a lot. Jean Servais, who plays the protagonist Tony le Stephanois, was an actor far inferior to his luck. His dark face is perfect for the role. He later starred in Dassin's He Who Must Die (1957), which used French actors in Greece for a political tale. 'Topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 film that was also distributed in the United States compared to 'Rififi'. It has a good scenario, but it is wasted, it was all bland, bright and beautified. From Dassin's post-hollywood play, 'Never on Sunday', with its captivating theme song and charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won the Best Film Award at Cannes 1960); 'Who should die' political choice; 'Rififi' the choice of the genre. A strange piece is his "Phaedra" with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). Hollywood hardcore purists would avoid this and favor Dassin's early films, which include a prison drama, "Brute Force" (1947); a crime thriller, "The Naked City" (1948); and two noirs, 'Thieves' Highway' (1949) and 'Night and the City' (1950). Personally, I like to like French noir spinoffs and American neo-noir better than the original source of American noir material - hence my permanent fascination with 'Rififi'. But Dassin is quite unique in not only having made Hollywood noir but then having gone to Paris and produced a memorable example of his French derivative of the 1950s.
