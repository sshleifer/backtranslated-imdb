I wonder why I've never heard of this movie before. It really is a magnificent comedy (I would say farce, but it is very well acted and I would hate to denigrate its quality). A study of a comic character about the hardships of middle-age crises, inequity for gays who can not have their long-recognized unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can not fit very well into society, uniting Kathy Bates and Rupert. Everett for a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should make another movie together. The frightened, bitter and scandalous daughter-in-law, Maudie (Meredith Eaton), is a truly wonderful character. If you liked the movies of the city tales, you would like this enchanting charm.
