"Tipping The Velvet" is one of the modern television productions that prove that some television can be as good or better (as it is) than you see at your local theater. <br /> <br /> If you want to read the plot, read this and if you want other details, go to the next paragraph. This is the unforgettable portrait of an unconventional girl named Nan, who works as a naive oyster girl until she discovers her repressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named Kitty, who dresses as a man for her stage profession. The young soon joins the act as another male imitator and they are a great success. Soon the two embark on a tender subject. Kitty eventually engages in a marriage of convenience and spoils the heart of young Nan. Nan works as a prostitute personified as a man for men who want to have sex with boys, and then she becomes the private sexual slave for the evil and sadomasochistic Diana, where Nan suffers severe emotional abuse. When this ends badly, Nan is back in the streets, where she remembers a young woman named Florence; a good-hearted socialist who had the true potential of being a wonderful partner. This is where Nan will discover the power of socialism and learn to return to fame. <br /> <br /> The transfer of Region 1 is of exceptional picture quality, there is a selection of very good scenes, an eloquent photo gallery and a fun interview between novelist Sara Waters and film writer Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> The scenery, costumes, cinematography and music are beautiful. The acting, writing and direction are extremely strong and full of realism, class and originality. I loved the movie and the romance. Section III of the film is very different in the film than in the novel, because section III of the novel is very well written, but it is not screen material. I will be brave and I will say that I love the interpretation of the movies very much. <br /> <br /> This breathtaking historical artfully combines Drama, Comedy, Erotic and Romance to vibrant perfection in a way that is both deeply moving and spiritually uplifting. For every mature and open-minded adult who has ever felt the joys, sorrows, and power to fall in love and live life to the fullest. A revolutionary production; an absolute must-see!
