This is undoubtedly the most exciting and satisfying film I have seen in years! The plot seen in the print is almost banal - a ship falls on a desert planet with three suns, the survivors have to adjust to the landscape and to each other, then the darkness falls and the monsters appear. Pilot Fry, after a moment of cowardice during the descent by the atmosphere when she almost threw the passengers on the ground, takes care of the group and asks the aid of convicted murderer Riddick to lead them through the darkness to the escape ship - he is the eyes surgeon improved that can see in the dark. But it's not that simple - each character is complex, three-dimensional, with conflicting traits, so you never know who is good and who is bad. <br /> <br /> The performances are uniformly superb - Radha Mitchell shows that Fry is getting stronger. by leadership, overcoming his own fears, and trying to avoid further bloodshed, while Cole Hauser, as the man taking Riddick back into custody, shows that he has his own agenda and his own idiosyncratic standards. But the film belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - it has the most magnetic screen presence I've seen in years. For much of the film, his face is in shadow and he does not talk much, but he still catches the eye. Sometimes he gets your attention by not speaking - or by not moving. And Diesel does not trivialize the character, as it could be done easily, giving him a "golden heart" - Riddick is still a cruel and evil man as they approach the ship - it just lets us glimpse the hesitant first steps of caring only of self to care for others. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is very good. Lighting effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum - triple sunlight and darkness of hue. Special effects showing the points of view of both Riddick and monsters increase suspense, as well as the sound effects of flying monsters and using ultrasound to "see" (monsters themselves are anatomically plausible and properly scary). The editing is so tight that it's sometimes shocking - there's literally no upholstery in this movie, no fade, no time to reorient. <br /> <br /> From the opening to the end of the credits you have to keep your intelligence on you. Each scene, every line of dialogue, every photo in the camera is important. See three times to understand everything. <br /> <br /> My only caveat is about science - the solar system, as shown in the model, is impossible (the planets revolve around the suns, not the other way round). However, this does not affect human history, so I did not take points for it.
