The Elegant Documentary - <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie ... if you are a selfish student of physics. This much less than one percent (tiny fraction) of the population may find that this spectacle only tells them what they have already learned and already know. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie! - If you are one of the vast majority of people who fall into more than 99% of the population who does not study or already have a good knowledge of physics theories, including relativity, quantum, strings and M theory. /> What a brilliantly architected documentary. Beginning with some useful historical background, you will be led by an elegant step into a Universe of pure magic - and dimensions beyond. I've always had a huge appreciation of math. This film can easily give you an idea of ​​what an exquisitely beautiful language math is without making you feel like you are about to fail the series. <br /> <br /> The show is repetitive at times, since the original format was a miniseries divided into three shows. Therefore, it makes sense to give us small educated reminders of the principles presented. I found this immensely useful as I kept reminding myself of the multiplicity of questions and possible answers that make up this incredible tapestry of our own existence. <br /> <br /> We are all (and everything around us) is vibrational energy. with a natural tendency towards harmony. This film may explode your mind - or at least help you realize that the universe is much larger than what we see around us (even with the Hubble Telescope) and much smaller than the protons and neutrons in the atoms we learn about high school. The M-theory has many magnificent magnitudes of 'possibility'. It seemed so appropriate that all this elegance should, by its very nature, be moved (by the admission of many brilliant scientists presenting) out of the kingdom. of science and for the realm of Philosophy. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be religious to feel like this movie brings you one step closer to God. Bravo Brian Greene. Well done indeed. <br /> <br /> PS If you are interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the Universe and want some more ideas about the 'possibilities' than quantum mechanics combined with Spirituality (of all things) can bring, I recommend you also watch "What the Bleep! - Down the Rabbit Hole". Yes, I know they make some silly mistakes suggesting that a shaman may not be able to see a boat if he has not seen it before (my eyes process light reflections very well - I see things I've never seen before) brain are cells of the body that do not actually divide. But if you can get over those little obstacles and put things that you do not like and cling to the ones you do - there's a lot to like about this movie. <br /> <br /> Then watch "The Secret" (2006 documentary on the Law of Attraction - look for the IMDb title "tt0846789"). This information can profoundly change your life - forever. If you dig deeper, you might even think that the Universe is talking to us with thought (if you listen) - and some are - and that's really incredible. There is a modern day Jesus / Mohammad / Buddha (those, among others, whose story suggests having communicated with the non-physical) alive today and she lives in Texas. I know some of you know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> I do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition, but I have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the Universe as now.
