'Thriller' continues to be the biggest pop promo ever to have a plot, great visuals and a cutting edge song to wrap the film around. Michael Jackson was at the top of the tree at this point (and not so altered in his plastic surgery regimen for that matter). Here he is in good shape - the music is great, he leads the zombies in the dance like no other. <br /> <br /> Ola Ray plays the girl who watches in disbelief as her sweet boyfriend (Jackson, natch) turns into a werewolf! Then to the pulsing rhythms of the opening line "It's near midnight," he steps around the graveyard with the other zombies and creatures of the night. <br /> <br /> The greatest glory of all this is the fruity voice of the great horror star Vincent Price speaking in the middle of the album. Formidable.
