George Sanders playing the Saint for the penultimate time does a good job with a good script - with the usual good RKO thrown around. It's a non-Charteris story too, full of murders and good clean fun. Topic 1: In New York, police inspector Fernack, a friend of Templar, is framed in a corruption scandal and dishonored - ST comes from London to try to fix things. Nice and simple so far - but is there really more than $ 90,000 in the world? Topic 2: Another tale of a woman taking revenge on the people who murdered her brother, Wendy Barrie does well to hit some nasty men and have the Saint fall in love with her. Including a villain who was under his direct protection and in the basement of Fernack - there is a scary shot of him (dead and looking) and they in a car when they are taking him back to where they caught him. Paul Guilfoyle as Pearly Gates must have been supposedly homosexual in that - witness the robe at the start, and ST's latest seductive comment that he was thinking of keeping him as a pet - and also did for "Palm Springs"! Fernack was played by Jonathan Hale as usual, but this time with such a discouraged attitude that what he really needed was a good slap of the Templar to cheer him on. <br /> <br /> The Hays office has also ensured that you picture it right, all segments are tied together without any shaggy pieces. It's worth watching for all of us who like this sort of thing, but if the Val Kilmer version is your yardstick, then do not bother.
