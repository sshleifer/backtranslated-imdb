Robin Hood; It's worth seeing Men in Tights, recently watched, because I've just become a fan of Cary Elwes, and that's one of their main roles. Some moments really made me laugh a lot! I was not expecting you to know, it was so funny. Even the second time you still fell out of the chair. The cast is great, of course, especially Locksley's own Robin, Cary, but Blinkin and the sheriff and little John. cheat you, it's too big! Lol) and everyone! <br /> <br /> There were a few moments, of course, the movie tried to make a comedy scene, but you do not necessarily laugh at it, .... but OK. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Cary Elwes and Patrick Stewart appear in a film together, by the way, both worked on "Lady Jane" in 1986, and it was fun to see them, 7 years later, more old, awwww. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching, really hilarious!
