Bed of Death: The bed that eats. Judging by the title, you can guess what this movie is. And there's still a lot more (story) story for this movie then one might suspect. <br /> <br /> Ok, so the main plot is about a bed eating people and food, but there are also some subplots. I will not spoil them for you, but they are a nice touch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the acting in this movie is very mediocre. The fact that most dialogues do not get talked about by the actors really does not help improve the quality of the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> Because there is so much narration work. The thoughts of the characters are also revealed to the observers. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. <br /> <br /> The effects are fine. Of course, it could be so much better if you compare it to the movies of today. But you really should not; just judge the movie as it is and do not take it too seriously. You have to admit that a killer bed is quite creative. If you're easily scared, do not watch this movie. You may never want to sleep again ... <br /> <br /> Death: The bed you eat is a strange gem of horror on a low budget, but I still recommend it to horror movie fans. <BR> In conclusion, I give this film 7 out of 10 stars for its creative story and unexpected twists here and there.
