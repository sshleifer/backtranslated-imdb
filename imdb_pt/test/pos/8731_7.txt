I was very surprised to hear that Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for this movie. She seemed very lifeless and completely educated by the 54 (!) Bergman Years in the scenes where they stand side by side. If it had been written today, I think Bergman and young Ivan would have ended up together (Ingrid is much hotter than Goldie ...) and the two selfish characters played by Matthau and Hawn would be left out. the cold. But it was written in the late 60's and feels like Plaza Suite or Barefoot in the park. However, Matthau's one-liners, Hawn's innocence and Bergman's elegant performance make it very enjoyable to watch.
