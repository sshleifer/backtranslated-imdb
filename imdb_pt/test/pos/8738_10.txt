Cactus Flower is what I call "pizza movie" - a personal favorite that never fails to satisfy. Perfect for an evening at home with a pizza. Knowing all the lines (and which lines!) By color only enhances the pleasure. <br /> <br /> Since many others here have told the plot, I will simply add the correction that Bergman's character, a nurse-receptionist, which meant she was a skilled nurse - and therefore an educated person - not "just" a receptionist. <br /> <br /> Bergman's performance in this film - and the film itself - was largely discarded at the time. , but today's audience will marvel at its reach; not just the impeccable comic timing, but the ability to make us believe that his character is not aware of his own feelings, at the same time he reveals them so clearly to Toni and us. While the overall plot increases credibility, Bergman's performance is compelling: honest and absolutely believable. <br /> <br /> Also highlights the performance of Jack Weston as Matthau's old friend and co-conspirator Harvey. No one could deliver a zinger like Weston, and I.A.L. The diamond script gives you enough. For example: "That's such a big, dirty, rotten lie that has class." Weston stood out in slightly decadent characters because it exuded a warmth that allowed to forgive the faults of its personages. <br /> <br /> The film is a rather direct adaptation of Abe Burrows's play (which was adapted from a French play by Barillet and Gredy). On Broadway, the role of Matthau was played by Barry Nelson. From Bergman, Lauren Bacall, and Hawn, from Brenda Vaccaro. He ran for 1,234 performances (three years) and was nominated for two Tony Awards (Vaccaro and Burt Brinckerhoff, who played Igor). <br /> <br /> For me, the soundtrack of the film, written and adapted by the legendary Quincy Jones. is another highlight. The main theme (A Time For Love is anytime) is by Sarah Vaughn about opening and closing credits. It is also hinted at in different arrangements throughout the film, most notably as romantic piano music highlighting Berman's speech to Hawn at the record store. Jones also created covers of popular songs from the period (To Sir With Love, I'm A Believer) for the scenes of the nightclubs. As with all elements of the film, there is an enormous amount of talent, taste and professionalism evident. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, few modern romantic comedies can hold a candle to this classic. It's great to finally have it available on DVD. Time to order a pizza ...
