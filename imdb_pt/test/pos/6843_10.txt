The efforts of a new group of young talents supported by Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, two extremely talented actors, create an exciting and engaging night of entertainment. And I should add that Hal Holbrook shines like the senator. This movie deserves five stars. I'll give you ten on your scale. And the end is PERFECT. I am constantly amazed at the ability of British actors to master our American accents. I was convinced that all the actors were born in Louisiana. And what a more refined place for a mystery than New Orleans! Big Easy, also known as the Crescent City, pervades every scene. As a writer and director, Sebastian Gutierrez deserves praise.
