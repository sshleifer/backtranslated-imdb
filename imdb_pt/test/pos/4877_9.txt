I saw the SEA OF DUST as part of a NYC viewing audience several years ago. I liked the movie at the time, so I was a bit confused by some of the changes that have been made since then. Maybe it's my memory, but there seemed to be pieces of exposure missing in the version that was shown at the Rhode Island Film Festival. I'm not really sure which version I prefer, but I can honestly say I've found something to enjoy both. <br /> <br /> Let me start by letting everyone know that this is not a popcorn movie. Although it was promoted as a tribute to Hammer Films, people expecting a confrontation between Van Helsing and Dracula will be very disappointed. There is some décolleté, but no nudity (one of the most recent films of the British producer). And while the SEA OF DUST is full of gorgeous sweet eyes (it's filmed like a 1960s movie), and features Hammer star Ingrid Pitt, it's not like any of the company's photos in tone or execution. This movie is very dark, very confusing and (sometimes) very funny. I do not remember the previous version being as crazy as this, but that's not a bad thing (especially the Black Forest showdown that plays like a Three Stooges short). And some of Mrs. Pitt's complaints are a lot of fun. It's as if someone has hurt her and released her. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this film is not in the details borrowed. It's in ideas. As an occasional Sci Fi Channel viewer, I regularly link to the network for variations of a note on a theme (the CGI monster kills and then is destroyed). SEA OF DUST is so full of ideas that you start stumbling on them after a while. <br /> <br /> But do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. Anyway, I applaud these guys for making such an enterprising low-budget image and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts. It will not be a picnic for people who hate to think about the movies (you know who you are). But for the rest of us, those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror movies, predictability, lack of respect for the public, this may just be their ticket.
