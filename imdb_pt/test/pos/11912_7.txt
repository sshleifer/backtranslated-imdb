I'm sure the film contains certain gaps in logic, but I was so delighted with it that I did not really care. The film unfolds as a cheerful and entertaining teenage joke combined with a Schwarzenegger-like action movie. It is full of action, full of emotion and has some good moods too. Sean Astin is fun to watch, and I have not seen Louis Gossett Jr. since I saw "Diggstown" in theaters. He's a great understated actor and I love watching him on the screen. I just wonder what he's doing now. Unfortunately, he may be starring many of these direct movies for the video. I hope my guess is wrong. Anyway, this is a high end thriller from your seat and I definitely suggest you take a look. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (of 10)
