The timing of this movie could not be better, particularly in light of all the turmoil in this world today. The film is a touching, captivating and witty piece. If you have siblings and still have living parents, this will come well at home for the viewer. If you have lost your parents, then it will touch you deeply. Laughter comes often, the cast works very well together and are believable. This movie is intelligently written and the lines that come from each of the actors make the viewer laugh out loud frequently. There are moments that will bring tears to your eyes as well. I would recommend this movie to anyone who respects the importance of family and can follow a clever film.
