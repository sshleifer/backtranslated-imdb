A very potent drama from the small southern town of Faulkner that deals with the murder of an innocent black man on the spot. Impressive cinematography and good narrative (through flashback) lead us through the uncomfortable relationship between the suspect and his lawyer's son. A still powerful story that predates Sidney Poitier's films of racial prejudice. Porter Hall has a great role as the father of the murdered man. Trivia: In fact, it was filmed in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Miss, with many of the residents being used as extras.
