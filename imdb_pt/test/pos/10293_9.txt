When I saw L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed: "How complicated!" And she's right, of course. When you are accustomed to simple and linear plots, especially violent schemes of hero vs. crooks, L'Appartement is difficult to follow. A couple of the negative commenters here have also missed one or more important points. Others complain about the confusing flash backs. Let's go! This is not the kind of movie from which you can go out to visit the bathroom, come back and get hooked again in a few seconds. This requires total concentration and a close look at the details. So it's not so hard to figure out what's going on and when. The director left enough clues in every scene. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the film focuses on the question: why did Max and Lisa split up? The film, as my girlfriend remarked, begins as a romantic novel, suggesting that two lost lovers will meet again. Having experience with French films, I predicted that the story would soon be sick and I was right. At the end of the first part, it is clear, after many twists and turns, that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max did not know Lisa had left and why. Lisa did not know why Max had not contacted her in Rome and left her without a trace when she returned to Paris. The only person who did was Alice and she had her own reasons for keeping her mouth shut. After Max and Lisa have discovered the truth, the question is: can Alice's manipulations be undone? Well, of course not, time has passed and things have changed. <br /> <br /> Many European films use a storytelling technique that I like very much. There is no exposure of the basic conflict at the beginning, after which two (or more) stakeholders try to decide for their own benefit. Instead, the viewer is gradually fed with pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. In the first half, Alice seems to be a minor character; slowly, it becomes clear that she is the key figure. <br /> <br /> Acting is simply great. Vincent Cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character who risks a safe life only to hunt for a dream of the past. Monica Belucci is very beautiful, of course, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey provides the necessary comic touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, plagued by feelings of guilt and regret. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give you a 10 is the somewhat unsatisfactory end. Of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events, Max is just at the point where the movie started, just wiser and sadder. Alice paid for her sins. But still the little twists at the airport are a bit artificial. Max easily trades Lisa for Alice; Alice decides very easily to reject Max, who has been his dream for so long; Max returns easily to his bride. But again, I do not know how this could be achieved without sacrificing elegant symmetry. I think sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.
