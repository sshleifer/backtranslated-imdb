I've seen what I believe to be the best Australian film of the year so far, the Acolytes of Jon Hewitt. <br /> <br /> Acolytes is an elegant thriller with a killer premise. Do this - two intimidated and harassed teens discover a local serial killer in their suburb and then start blackmailing him to kill the bully who molested them. Hewitt chose a top-notch cast including excellent newcomers Sebastian Gregory, Josua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence to play the teenagers. Add to that three, yes, that's right, three great psychopaths! Led by Joel Edgerton in an exceptional serial killer du jour performance, Belinda McClory, his crazed wife and Michael Dorman as the teenager who rapes the bully with swastika tattoos. After you add these teens and those menacing adults, will all hell break loose? Hewitt has created a ball for the wall thriller that is very original and perfect. You can see the influence of Twin Peaks, Larry Clark and David Lynch, but Hewitt does everything on his own, in a lake of calm waters, always playing with the drones of emptiness. The screenplay for Shayne Armstong, Shane Krouse and Hewitt is tight. <br /> <br /> If marketed correctly, this movie can be a hit among teenagers. The next Wolf Creek? Well it could be. It makes all the right moves. The teens are real ala Larry Clark. They do not suck and have a PC agenda attached, they are not communicative, beautiful and modern. The killers are dark with real threat. Joel Edgerton steals his scenes as the gentle local Ted Bundy, who sports a butterfly on his four-wheel drive John Fowles The Collector. Dorman's gasoline rapist pours over the threat heading Suburban Mayhem and provides a scary villain that you can not wait to see buy the farm. <br /> <br /> The movie is fast, hard and brutal. Not only that, it demonstrates a domain of trust and direction from Hewitt that will surely give you an indication for IF or AFI, if not prize! Its subtle, poetic scene, brilliant sound design, excellent cinematography, and tight structure clearly mark one of the best Oz movies I've seen so far this year. <br /> <br /> The movie leaves you shaken, thinking and restless. It's a truly great edition for the return to the genre going on in Australian cinema right now. It will certainly attract Hollywood's interest. Oh, and did I mention you went into Toronto? What other Oz movies can say that? The world should prepare for a new author, Jon Hewitt.
