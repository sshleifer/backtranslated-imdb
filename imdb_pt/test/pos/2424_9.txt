This is another of Robert Altman's underrated films (let's be honest, the only movie he did that did not really work was Ready to Wear), and Sandy Dennis gives a fascinating performance in it. She's much better here than she was in "The Out of Towners ". The stuff, I admit, is below the great director Altman and the extraordinary actress Dennis, but that hardly matters. As long as there is permission to do their thing and do it well, almost any story will do.
