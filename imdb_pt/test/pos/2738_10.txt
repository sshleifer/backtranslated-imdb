During the brief Golden Age of Super 8 Magnetic Sound Home Movies, we purchased a GAF Projector for $ 148.00 at the close of a Camera Store in downtown Chicago. It seemed that the GAF was leaving the business of cameras and projectors; though they continued their other endeavors, such as Sawyer's old Vue-Master 3 color slide show viewers. <br /> <br /> We hardly knew, nor anticipated the rapid approach of the Video Camera, the Betamax, the VHS. and the possible revolutions of the DVD. With the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Camera we also bought, we took out some sonic records as our daughter, Jenn's first communion and her younger sister, Michelle's Graduation from Pre-School. That was all around 1979-82. <br /> <br /> During this period, we also bought some toys for Dad to accompany; such as some Super Magnetic Sound LAUREL & HARDY Films and W.C. Shorts from Blackhawk Films FIELDS, Davenport, Iowa. We also chose a Columbia Pictures home movie soundtrack of some sort of forgotten classic cartoon, the UPA GERALD McBOING-BOING (United Productions of America / Columbia, 1951). It was the success of our Home Movies Time! Being members of the Baby Boomer Generation, the Wife (Deanna), and the self remembered the Character of Gerald McBoing-Boing; for Gerald had a network TV show on CBS, early Sunday Evenings, ca. 1955. Bill Goodwin was the Announcer / Host. But we had never seen this original theatrical drawing of the UPA; nor was it known that young Master McBoing-Boing was a Dr. Seuss creation of "Grinch", "Horton" and "Mulberry Street" famous. <br /> <br /> The assembled team was very rich in talent and deep. Pending production figures are apparent. Director Robert Cannon and supervising director John Hubley were veterans at the top of their ranks. The writers were Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss himself), Phil Eastman and Bill Scott. <br /> <br /> Scott is remembered not so much for his written contributions to UPA, but for being a partner of Jay Ward on properties like ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, MR. PEABODY, FLICKERS FRADURED, GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE, HOOPER HOPPITY and FRACTURED FLICKERS. With Jay Ward Productions he was writer, voice actor and Kibitzer-General of the entire company. <br /> <br /> The cartoon gets its only "voice" from the Narrator, Radio / Movie / TV Actor Marvin Miller. Remember him? He was Michael Anthony on TV Ssries THE MILLIONAIRE (Don Fedderson Productions / CBS Television Network, 1955-60). Schematic scheme of bold colors and imaginative design went on to give the UPA animations a special feeling of solitude, fear apprehension and eventual triumph. And, we might add, the animation is definitely of the "Limited" Variety. <br /> <br /> As with so many great stories, ours begins with a simple premise; is born different. In this case, it is the boy Gerald McCloy, who was born to make sound effects in communication, instead of talking. The children can be ruthless and soon he is dubbed his not-so-flattering nickname by a group of young insults chanting, "Nya, nya, your name is not McCloy, it's Gerald McBoing-Boing, the Noise Boy!" At this point the animation team does an excellent job at changing the emotional gears of the young outcast from happy and carefree to isolated and lonely and finally to depression and despair at not being able to turn to someone to help and understand; not even to his mother and father. A frighteningly fashionable dark scene involving a UPA stylized escape scene involving a train and an equally stylized blizzard brings Gerald to the brink of utter despair. But then he is interrupted by a gentleman announcing that young Gerald is approached by the producer of some radio program to provide the sounds for the show in the studio. <br /> <br /> Once the premiere show is done with Gerald starring in the Sound Department, he rides on an immense limousine (which seems to have anticipated the Stretch Limos of our day) to the applause and admiration of his colleagues and the world. <br /> <br /> It has been said that there are only so many plots, and in that case, this story is probably a variation of The Ugly Duckling; for after all, a sad and solitary boy finds his place in the world and true happiness. <br /> <br /> NOTE: United Productions of America, or UPA, was a center of exceptional creativity in the field of Cartoon. They were responsible not only for GERALD McBOING-BOING and several sequences and a TV series, but also the highly popular MR. MAGOO Theatrical Cartoons and subsequent TV show (with the voice talent of Jim Backus), FROSTY THE SNOWMAN's classic TV original design and the rather bizarre DICK TRACY Cartoon Show (with the voice of Tracy provided by Mr. Everett Sloane! ).
