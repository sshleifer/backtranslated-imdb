This is a remarkable film so it is not shown as much as it is for what it is. What is shown is the incredible poverty in Sicily, as the 19th century gave way to the 20th, a lifestyle that made people dream of the "New" World of America. The Mancuso family lives in a place that is not even a village, just a stone house nestled among the hard and inflexible stones of a country that can not even offer a single leaf of green grass. An opening sequence shows the Mancuso males climbing barefoot down a steep slope, stones in their mouths to offer in a shrine at the top in exchange for a "signal" that they should either leave for the New World or stay where they are. In addition, it shows life aboard the liner, masses lodged in fact, eager to breathe freely and conditions on Ellis Island, where their journey is not yet over, they are interrogated and examined to prove their "aptitude" to enter America. What is NOT shown is the ship at Longshot, or even ANY outlet that identifies it as a large oceanic liner; what is also not shown is anything that would identify America, no clich√© view of the New York harbor and the Statue of Liberty, so Ellis Island could be anywhere in any country. Perhaps the most notable shot is that of a Camera Crane looking at hundreds of people huddled together; slowly, almost imperceptibly, two-thirds of the people on Screen Left begin to separate from the third on Screen Right and realize that those on the left are actually aboard the ship and those on the right are in the dock, a powerful statement of the society being fragmented . There is a strong documentary over time, as if we were following a real ship full of immigrants, even though it has been carefully scripted and is clearly an amalgamation of families / conditions typical at the time. With almost nothing happening in dramatic terms, it's not for the Popcorn brigade in Multiplex, but for the rest of us it's a great movie.
