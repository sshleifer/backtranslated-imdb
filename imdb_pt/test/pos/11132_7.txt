A recent survey of children in the UK reinforced the notion presented by this film 27 years ago. That being more than anything else, young people want to grow up to be someone famous. I used to be doctors and firemen the kids wanted to be. Now, everyone wants to be famous. Fame is a story of a group of children accepted at the High School for Performing Arts in New York. We saw them at the first audition, then we had lessons and we learned about life for the next four years. The film has many qualities, but it leaves you a little dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Alan Parker's daring directing style fits the story very well. The film was classified as a musical, but above all it is a drama. Musical numbers and dance routines come up here and there, and Parker keeps them as close to realists as they really could have been filmed. The acting is mostly from the top, with a few exceptions. The pace is a bit off, particularly at the end of the movie, but by then the story has taken some twists. <br /> <br /> First of all, the auditions at the beginning of the film. should have chosen some of the main characters. It seems unlikely that someone will show up and audition for one department, then stumble across admissions to another. Some of these people simply do not seem talented or interested to begin with. Once the first year of school begins, the film fits into a good rhythm. The interaction between students and teachers is very well managed and leaves you wanting more. The movie begins to get lost later, as we see more and more of the lives of students out of school. Some of these people simply are not worth worrying about. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake of the film is to make the character of Ralph Garcy so prominent. This guy is rude; egocentric thrust. A "professional hole" as he proudly declares on stage during his comedy routines. The public must feel somehow about this guy and his tragic personal situation, but I was just waiting for them to throw their butt out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people you will care about when the movie is over. As much as I try, I still can not seem to develop sit-ups like Gene Anthony Ray had in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is good. It is memorable, interesting and full of daring scenes or performances. It may be a little too long, and maybe some of the wrong characters are fully developed while others are in the background. The musical numbers are great, and there are even a couple of surprises waiting to be discovered when the movie is over. Although not perfect, Fame will be a movie that has lived one way or another for many years. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 stars. The Dog.
