There are questions that sometimes override us and have no answer. Two women are progressively entwined in each other's arms (as tacky as the expression sounds, that's exactly what happens) and fins that can not answer their own question about what defines their relationship when their own society has no name for it that is. The somewhat erroneous FIRE of Deepa Mehta is the first of a loosely connected trilogy, linked here by the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than consuming. Fire as an uncontrolled erotic passion does not appear here, as women - the older and more feminine Radha (Shabana Azmi) and younger, more masculine Sita (Nandita Das) realize that they share much more than common ideas. and affection for each other and represent what they believe to be their passion for each other despite the opposition faced by their very traditional husbands and families. As in WATER, FIRE is deeply spiritual, even though it technically falls into the mode of sentimental melodrama (where WATER, as well as the weight of the word, carries a stronger meaning that ultimately transcends its definition). Even so, it is a very beautiful image and a strong voice of a strong director.
