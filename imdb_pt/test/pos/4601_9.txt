This movie was a pretty nice surprise. I had anticipated this for a long time, and was scared to go in that he could not live up to my expectations. <br /> <br /> Exceeded them. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> Hilarious from beginning to end (staying up after the final credits!), it's absolutely remarkable how a movie about stupid and annoying characters can be so clever, witty and engaging. With its obvious matte paintings, the future Earth of the film recalls the Planet of the Apes series and other science fiction films of the time. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie is essentially Planet of the Apes. , but with people who are the mental equivalent of monkeys. <br /> <br /> He moves at a fairly fast pace, and Luke Wilson takes the film very well, with a character reminiscent of what he played in "Bottle Rocket." "(There is even a not-so-subtle nod to Bottle Rocket in an opening scene.) Maya Rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former" painter "who was also frozen. of all his forces, "Idiocracy" has the distinct feel of a film that was taken from the director / editor before it could be adjusted. <br /> <br /> I can not for life. funny would be played in some movie theaters without advanced projections, without trailers, without marketing. <br /> <br /> It's as if the studio decided that it would not spend any more. <br /> <br /> And maybe they thought the movie had the ingredients of a classic of worship, and the only way to become a true cult classic was to mount it to fail? <br /> <br /> Whatever the case, it's a shame because Mike Judge and this particular movie deserve better . <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie will have real legs on DVD, and word of mouth will propel it to pa the success it deserves. <br /> <br /> Maybe the Fox executives saw themselves in the characters, were confused and thought it was a documentary?
