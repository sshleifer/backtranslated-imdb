I heard an interview with the lead actor who said the film was not meant to be a horror movie, but he himself would describe it as a mental horror. I strongly subscribe to this. <br /> <br /> It is not clear why he travels to this place, but everything is monotonous, with no bright colors, no honest smiles, nothing personal. Everything is ordered and everyone seems to be satisfied living this kind of life. Our "hero", though from the outset seems to be out of place and feels himself. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so important and good is the striking resemblance to life in many large cities or even countries today. You have to work, you should not let your colleague know your weaknesses, show your wealth, your car, etc., and above all you do not have the true love of life that children have. Of course, in this movie you see neither children nor the elderly - they just do not fit into a society of strong workers. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone - and make sure this utopia does not come true!
