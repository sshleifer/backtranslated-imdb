I do not see much wrong with this movie. Granted, the main singers may not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they certainly can carry a song. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented composers and I happen to love their songs, especially "The World Is A Circle", "Things I Will not Miss", and "Question Me An Answer". Some people claim that the choreography of Hermes Pan is ghastly and that the snowy mountain scenarios seem made of plastic; I disagree on both accounts. I've seen snow powder before and the snow in those mountainous scenes seemed realistic to me. And most of all, in the defense of this film, it is appropriate for a family audience (at least I remember it was like this when I saw it on Christmas day a few years ago.) With all the clamor about sex and violence in the cinema Nowadays , I find it refreshing to note that this movie deserves the G rating. And they do not say that impertinent "F" word every ten minutes like some movies I've seen. Thank God. So although this movie may not be everyone's cup of tea, it has some redeeming value and I give it ten points out of ten. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
