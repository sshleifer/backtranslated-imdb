Hello all of you, lovely Dirty Dancing fans !!!! I came across this message board when I was bored one day and I think it's cool. I absolutely love DD! I first saw it at my friends house when I was 13 (now I'm 17) and I got hooked !! I saw there at least another 10 times and soon after, I bought the DVD for myself. At this stage, I've memorized most of the script and can recite it whenever someone asks me about it. 'Did I carry a watermelon?' '' It was so bad that I bought the soundtrack and recorded the music of Micky and Sylvia, and now it's the ringtone on my cell phone !! Most of my friends think it's a bad movie, but I do not care what they think, I know it's wonderful! I was reading the comments before and I have some questions for you - 1. Why are you asking trivial questions like what the Lisa and Baby ages are? I do not think it matters much. They are teenagers in the 60's, is not that enough? 2. Where did you get this special edition that all of you are talking about? It seems very interesting ... Please respond to this. I would like to see other fan reviews ... Congratulations! charliesangel415 xxx
