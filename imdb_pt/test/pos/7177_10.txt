In 1968, when, "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" was released, it came out of nowhere, and struck like a psychedelic thunder. African-American actor and filmmaker William Greaves intended to forever change the style of documentary production, and to this day there has never been anything like it. The film is a film about 'making a movie', and intentionally written and directed in order to create as much controversy and contradiction as possible. Set in New York's Central Park, sparse action and dialogue are about a couple who fight and fight over homosexuality and abortion. The woman wants to get out of the relationship and the man wants an explanation. Towards the end of this interaction, a drunken homeless man interrupts the process and offers his personal comments and stories. So, after the main footage was filmed, the film crew adds their own views of the filmmaker and what they feel is their inept manipulation of the film. And throughout the film, several cameras are used to record the action within the scene and strange comments from the cast, staff and viewers. I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in Avant Garde filmmakers such as Andy Warhol, John Cassavetes or Jim Jarmusch. William Greaves tries to show that something can not be truly observed and understood because the vision itself would change reality. "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" can be viewed as a cinematic representation or application of The Uncertainty Principle. This is only a possible explanation, and Greave's true intention is certainly open to speculation. Above all, this movie seeks to confuse, confront. and stimulate, and undoubtedly achieves admirably.
