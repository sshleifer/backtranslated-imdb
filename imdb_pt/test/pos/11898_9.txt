I just want to say that this movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> I loved it from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> The performance was great. The director did an incredible job and I would like to see him again. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly did a very good performance, the guy who played her father (Manny) was another great actor, BUT I CAN NOT WATCH HER NAME. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for The Godfather II. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa looks so good and I think he is one of the most talented actors out there. There are a lot of Latino actors who do a great job as shown in this movie! <br /> <br /> Rent It !!! For rent !!! For rent !!!
