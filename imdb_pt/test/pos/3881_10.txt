For those who like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love movies, have good attention to detail and enjoy independent films with a funny and well written dialogue, then this is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> For those with little attention, high expectations and no brain .. well .. um .. you can get bored and find things dragging sometimes. <br /> <br /> This is a charming, modest and well paced film with the actors giving a real feel of depth and warmth to their roles. I laughed at myself pretty much all the time ... <br /> <br /> This movie is a little gem.
