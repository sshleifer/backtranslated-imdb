The third film in a cycle of incomparably brilliant exploration films, and the third masterpiece in a row, "Joshuu Sasori: Kemono-beya" aka. "Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable" (also known as "Sasori: Den Of The Beast" where I live) 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some respects but that equals (or unmistakably overcomes) them in brilliance. The entire Sasori original series with the wonderful Meiko Kaji stands out as the absolute highlight in WIP cinema, and all the films, especially the first three, combine exclusively exploration and art-house movies like no other film does. "Beast Stable" is the third and second to last film "Sasori" with Meiko Kaji, the last to be directed by the brilliant director Shunya Ito and, in my opinion, the greatest of all. The first film "Joshuu 701-gô: Sasori" of 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of the cinema of exploration and simply The definition of art-exploration. In the equally brilliant first sequence, "Joshuu Sasori: Dai-41 zakkyo-bô" Ito added more surrealism and symbolism. The third film "Sasori", "Beast Stable", maintains surrealism (though not as much as the latter), and presents even more social criticism than its predecessors. Topics such as poverty, forced prostitution and exploitation of the poor are central themes of the film. <br /> <br /> This third film "Sasori" is ingenious and sublime in all respects and arguably the largest of the cycle, usually brilliant (for me this is with the first as a next second). Again, "Best Stable" is very artistic and very much like holding. The visually stunning film features a tremendous amount of brutal violence and sleaze again, as well as sequences of enormous surreal beauty. The beautiful Meiko Kaji is once again brilliant in her role of Nami Matsushima (also known as Sasori). I absolutely adore this wonderful actress, and I'm sure I'm not the only one doing it. The rest of the performances are also great, especially Mikio Narita is great as a police inspector obsessed with capturing Sasori. The musical score is the same in all three films, with "Urami-Bushi", sung by Meiko Kaji herself, as the main theme, which is great, since the result is simply pure perfection. Like its predecessors, "Beast Stable" is an absolutely brilliant art-exploitation masterpiece that no serious movie lover can afford to lose. The whole Sasori cycle is at the top of my all-time favorite list. "Beast Stable" is undoubtedly the most brilliant masterpiece of all! 10/10
