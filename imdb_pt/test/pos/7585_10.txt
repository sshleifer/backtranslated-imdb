Horses on Mars is a wonderful journey made by very small creatures. You do not have to strain your attention and the characters are truly memorable. Most of the credit should be given to Eric Anderson for his choice of visual style and for writing an interesting story, but credit is also deserved by Anuj Majumdar for the narration and the wonderful soundtrack. These choices obviously were not an accident. If you can, look at the 35mm scope for the biggest impact. It's a beautiful movie!
