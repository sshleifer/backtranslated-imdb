Like all good art, this movie can mean different things to different people. To me, this means that failing to open your heart to others can steal happiness and leave you with an empty life. The convenience of selfishness is like junk food: it feels good, but it can eventually make you sick. <br /> <br /> Almost everything I see in the US is a mass commercial production of action trash, shallow dramas and stupid comedies, and this sensitive, deep, poetic film really touched me. Thank you, Nuri Bilge Ceylan (and everyone else in the cast)! <br /> <br /> Ivan Yanachkov
