I am absolutely disgusted that this movie is not being sold. Everyone who loves this movie should send an email to Disney and increase the demand for it. They would eventually have to sell it then. I would buy copies for everyone I know. Everything and everyone in this movie did a good job, and I did not understand why Disney did not put this movie on DVD or VHS in a video store. At least I did not see any copies. This is a good movie and should be seen by everyone. The kids of the new generation can not see and I think they should. It should at least be put back into the channel. This movie does not deserve a cheap download. It deserves the real thing. I'm sending them now. This movie will be on DVD.
