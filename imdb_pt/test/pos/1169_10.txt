A movie that I've seen and enjoyed, possibly, more than any other movie. I first saw it as a child and loved the drama and the great climactic battle. When I got older, I enjoyed it as much or more than before, but now because of all the components that work together to create a true classic. The acting is great (especially Keith as T. Roosevelt), the spectacular cinematography, the script is full of gems, and the direction pulls everything wonderfully. It is loosely based on a real event, and shows the race of Europe and a newly emergent America to split the 'Sick old Man' (Ottoman Empire), since it collapses in a different way from any other 'historical' film that I already saw . Humor, drama, action, love ... has everything and deserves much more acclaim (much like The Great Waldo Pepper).
