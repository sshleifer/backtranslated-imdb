I watched this movie on a big screen a few months ago. I did not know exactly what to expect, and in the first ten minutes I was afraid I did not like this movie. It started very slowly, in silence and almost banality, which was much less exciting, since the sound was very bad and the legends sometimes impossible to read. <br /> <br /> But I definitely do not regret having moved on. watching this. It is one of the most beautiful films of Bergman that I have ever seen, at the same time human, relentless and psychologically convincing. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I seen actors playing so beautifully, so intensely faces: Liv Ullman's interpretation is unforgettable and Sydow is also excellent. <br /> <br /> There is always psychological violence in Bergman's films, and this may be the most physically violent of them all. The tense relations between man and woman evolve in parallel with the physical violence that surrounds them ... <br /> <br /> Finally, this sober, violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly impressive human depth. An excellent Bergman. <br /> <br />
