A delightfully nasty black comedy about a middle-aged schlub (Danny DeVito) who wants to get rid of his mother and creates a plan to do so with a bitter divorcee who wants to get rid of his ex-wife. The film is completely remorseless in its cynicism, and does not give it to anyone who likes it, but at least once this works in favor of the film and not as a shutdown. <br /> <br /> Anne Ramsey, as the mother of DeVito's war ax, steals the show in a grotesquely funny performance. Even though she's a horror, you end up cheering for her because it looks like she could kick DeVito and Crystal's asses at the same time with both hands tied behind her back. <br /> <br /> Note: B +
