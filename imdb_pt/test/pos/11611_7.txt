Karim Hussain's dreams must be feared. When the right hemisphere of his characters dominates the left, shocking images of blood, dismemberment and various abominations are released. Religion will not save you, not the mother or your own family. Hussain's dark poetry, because that's what this movie really is, destabilizes all the institutions of the sanctuary. <br /> <br /> `Subconscious Cruelty 'is a treat for all those present in the circuit of horror / fantasy festivals. The movie's opening meditation on madness is well written and deep. The protagonist's desire to desecrate the process of childbirth that led to the hell he inhabits unfolds with a horrible and credible lack of logic. From here, the film goes deeper into the subconscious and approaches mother nature. Hussain offers depictions of lush pagan fertility and wriggling mushroom madness. Nature is exposed as blood-soaked and violent in Hussain's scary lighting. <br /> <br /> "Subconscious Cruelty" is disturbing to all and rewarding to those who see beyond the shock the mature themes of life, lust and madness. very worthy movie explores. CJ Goldman deserves praise for his special makeup, as well as David Kristian for an unnerving sound design and Teruhiko Suzuki for the soundtrack.
