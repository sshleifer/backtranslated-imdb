This is a video version of a stage production, with extra recording for video editing. The result wins both the stage drama and the impact of the well-produced film. The scenery of George Tsypin, with sculptures and masks by Julie Taymor, is superb. <br /> <br /> Jessye Norman is fantastic, and you get to hear (and see) the young Bryn Terfel. This production is impressive, emotional and majestic. If you do not see it, you've lost it.
