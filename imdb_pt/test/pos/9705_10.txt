Johnny Knoxville and the boys of Jackass go over "Jackass Number Two". At a press screening, the laughter was so loud and loud that it was difficult to hear the whole dialogue. The acrobatics are exaggerated and the jokes are funnier and more outrageous than ever. <br /> <br /> All the guys put their members on the line to make a great movie, and they were successful. If you like this genre, you will love this movie. If not, do not bother. <br /> <br /> Some of the funniest parts are the jokes guys make about themselves, and they do not care what happens to them. They will do anything to do a trick. Many critics have criticized Johnny Knoxville for a less active role in the first film, but do not worry, he's in front and center of Number Two, and they have enough material to be halfway there. a Threee number. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for fans of this type of mood. <br /> <br /> Chris Sansone, entertainment editor, Fort Bend Herald
