There are a few aspects to Park's films, and particularly to Wallace & Gromit, which I would say make them so good. The first is subtlety and observation, whose flagship is Gromit's character. He does not talk, he does not make noise, all he has are the eyes, the forehead and the body posture, and with these he directs the film. Park can give us all we need this silent character through his expression. Comedy and emotion are transmitted through the subtlest of movements and work superbly well. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie, you should be aware of the entire screen. Usually, you will be guided to things in the movies, the screen will not be too confusing, there will be many things to take your eyes off the lane or main action. Park seems to need to look the other way with his films. It throws extra content to your audience, there is action in the background, next to the screen, even off the screen, and there is always something in the foreground to get their attention. His films are about multiple visions and discoveries, they are steeped in jokes and ancillary actions. <br /> <br /> Throughout this movie, there are layers of things happening on the screen, jokes in the foreground, maybe on a jar label and background. shadows that give action. You can imagine that for Park, movies have always been an event, and the movies he loves are those he wants to watch again and again. That's what shows in your movies, and in your most beloved characters. <br /> <br /> Then there are the bizarre and crazy inventions that Wallace does, something that is reflected in the plot and twists of the film. plot, everything is bizarre and off the wall, but it seems so perfectly normal in this world. You can imagine that inside Park is the mind of Wallace. <br /> <br /> There is also one more thing that makes these films so unique, and this is the modeling and animation of the hands. I must admit I was worried when I heard that Dreamworks was involved in the production of this film and I thought they would bring their computer animation experience to the foreground. What startled me was that Wallace & Gromit became CGI entities, or at least CGI being used to clear the feel that the modeling brought to the film. <br /> <br /> It's not like that. You can still see fingerprints and tool marks on the characters, and far from distracting the movie, it just adds so much real feel to it and a sense of physical depth to the characters and the onscreen scene. <br /> <br /> So what happens to the movie? Well, I must say that the plot twist was something I had thought well before the movie was in the movies and it was no surprise, but it did not affect my pleasure a bit. In fact, watching the turnaround unfold and the comedic timing of discovery and reactions was everything, and it left me as sucked as if it were a thriller, but all the time I was laughing. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was fascinating in many ways. To see the animation complete, how savage are the inventions, how Wallace will get in trouble and Gromit get him out, where all the cross-references are in the movie, and where are all the jokes! I must admit that after talking to my friends I could not believe how much I had lost. <br /> <br /> There is something different in this movie than with others, there is a new level of adult humor here, and I do not mean rude jokes (although there is a couple who are so British that you can not help but laugh), I mean jokes that just go over the heads of children, but slap the adults' faces. The kind you're used to seeing comes from somewhere like Pixar. This only adds even more appeal to the film. <br /> <br /> Ok, let me try and be a bit negative here. I did not notice the voices in this movie, do you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognize them? Well, I was too involved in the movie to care or realize who they were ... okay, that's not negative. Let me try again. The main plot was not as strong and thrilling as I'd hoped, and I found myself being caught up in the side stories and the characters themselves ... again ... this is not a bad thing, the movie was so much I honestly can not think of something bad to say about this movie, probably the worst thing I could say is that the title sequence at the end is pretty repetitive ... until final title! Really, it's the worst I can say. <br /> <br /> The story is very fun, well structured, well written, well executed. There are many fantastic characters here, not just Wallace and Gromit. There's so much happening on the screen, so many references and jokes (check out Lady Tottingham's dresses), cheese jokes everywhere, jokes for the whole family. The characters are superbly absorbent and you will realize that you captured them before you realized them. There's so much in this movie for everyone. <br /> <br /> There is so much I could say and write, but I know this will quickly turn into a backslapping exercise for Park and Aardman, which would also become a series of "this bit was really funny" and " there's a bit when ... ", and what I'd rather do is tell you that this is a superb movie, go see it and experience the whole thing by themselves. I'll say though the rabbits are great!
