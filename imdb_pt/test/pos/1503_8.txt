I honestly have to say that A CAT IN THE BRAIN is one of the most fun and hilarious movies I've ever seen. This film is filled with stupid dialogues, ridiculous scenes and a self-engrossing plot starring legendary horror director Lucio Fulci. The exhausting plot is about an elderly director (Fulci, who is also called Lucius Fulci in the movie ...) who is starting to freak out and hallucinate because of all the cruel things he has put in the movies in the last years. He goes to a psychiatrist who hypnotizes Fulci, and tells him that he will believe that he is a killer, but that the psychiatrist will actually be the one who is killing. The rest of the film is made up of photos of the "movie" Fulci is directing throughout this action, murder scenes killing all-the-time people smiling like an idiot and some of Fulci's hallucination sequences. Oh, and some breasts thrown in for good measure as well ... <br /> <br /> A cat in the brain is completely over-top and ridiculous in every way. Blood is classic Fulci - nasty and strong with some really decent scenes. Cutting a chainsaw from a female corpse is pretty cool, just like beheading a small boy. Many stabbings, gingas and other killing scenes make this a bloodbath without stopping. The ridiculous dialogue (LAMBA-O !!!! LAMBA !!!), as well as some of the insanely goofy scenes (the Nazi orgy, the operatic tapa party and the death of an innocent hippie come easily to mind ...) Make it fun like hell. It's not as gloomy as some of Fulci's other films - CAT is more of a self-indulgent comedy / horror that if it was not supposed to be funny, it's kind of sad. I say to get a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle into that. I watched CAT with some friends and we laughed all the time. This is the feel-good summer movie ... Recommended 8/10
