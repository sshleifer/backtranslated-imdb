Gulliver's Travels is, at first, a satirical novel written by a great misanthropist named Jonathan Swift. Therefore, it is not recommended to judge this film by itself. We have to delve into man's consciousness to get to the point where Swift would lead us. Gulliver lived a journey of truthfulness, of solitude, of apprehension of what can be his true life. We can not just sit and watch this movie, saying it's so cute or boring. The subject is far beyond that and I would like everyone to expect it. This is the best film of all time, as far as you can feel the truths that emerge from the character of Ted Danson: the unforgettable Lemuel Gulliver.
