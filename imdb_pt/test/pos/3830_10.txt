I did not realize how much of this episode was taken from The Enemy Below until I finally saw the movie (it became my favorite war movie). Some elements of the Run Silent Run Deep were also raised. Nothing wrong with stealing ideas, as long as you do something cool with them. And the boy made Roddenberry and company do something nice with this one. <br /> <br /> The story begins when the Romulans violate a 100-year treaty crossing the neutral zone and destroying a number of Federation outposts along the zone. , ostensibly to test their superior weapon and invisibility screen (and subsequent change in the balance of power between the Romulans and the Federation, in their view) as a prelude to a total invasion. Kirk has to decide whether it is worth risking the war to try to stop the Romulan ship, or whether, in fact, the greatest risk lies in letting the invaders leave after destroying 4 military outposts. Kirk wisely chooses the latter. <br /> <br /> This is our first look at an enemy of the Federation, the Romulans, a warrior, but in their way an honorable race who are distant relatives of the Vulcans. However, unlike their peaceful cousins, the Romulans did not renounce their violent and imperialist emotions and forms, even as they advanced technologically. <br /> None of this matters to Mr. Stiles, the ship's navigator and boss of this episode. (the Romulan commander has his own problems with a junior officer). All that matters to him is that he hates Romulans and Spock looks like a ... to the end, when Spock saves his life (naturally). This contrasts sharply with Captain Kirk and the Romulan commander, none of whom has any personal malaise over the other. Both men are simply doing their duty. In fact, there is mutual respect. This is the first episode of Trek to deal directly with prejudice, and does it skillfully (as opposed to the less subtle "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield") of the third season. Like the Enemy Below, we have a classic chess match between two ship commanders who are actually very similar. You immediately see that both captains are good. Very good. If you were going to battle, you would like one of these men as your leader. Both are honest and decent men who are obliged. However, even if the Romulan commander is bound by duty to his home world, he still finds himself desiring destruction before he can return home instead of initiating another interstellar war. However, he still does everything he can to get home, just as Kirk does everything he can to stop him. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, one of the top 5 of Trek. It has everything: lots of action, suspense, great dialogue, good acting (I still keep the Romulan Commander was the best Trek role by Mark Lenard), and he manages to make his social comment without being overly preacher. Too bad that Roddenberry had forgotten the last part when he made TNG. <br /> <br /> Watch this episode, then watch The Enemy Below.
