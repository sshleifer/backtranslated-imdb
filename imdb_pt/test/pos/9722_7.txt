Despite their pedigree, the most interesting things about this series are not the animatronic or the puppets, which, though charming, are little more than sideshows, at least in the story I saw, A STORY SHORT. In fact, loathing though I admit, the main pleasure of the program is in the older art, in the narrative. John Hurt in Rowley Birken QC-mode, grotesque, medieval makeup, storytelling, sitting by the fire, accompanied by a cynical dog. One winter day, hungry and poor, he sees a beggar expelled from the royal kitchen by the unpleasant cook. The narrator deceives the latter by giving them an excellent soup. Furious, the cook begs the king for permission to boil the villain, but, satisfied with the wit of the History Accountant, the monarch offers him a relief - for 100 nights he must tell the king a new story: if he does not, he will deliver it to the cook. <br /> <br /> The story may be old, but it is told with great enthusiasm. Anthony Minghella's script is extraordinarily dramatic (as befits a playwright), witty and with some disturbing preoccupations under the fun, as fears per se, or the culturally self-generating power of storytelling, linked to the continuation of ideological power. For a children-oriented program, it is stimulating and self-reflective (with little nonsense about the film being the new oral culture); despite the Americanized style, there is a charming sense of medieval agitation, its grotesque and arbitrary terror, as well as its magic and power.
