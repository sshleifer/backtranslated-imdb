John Cassavette decided as his first film, obviously as a film with little money in New York, to not even have a script with dialogue, and offers an equivalent in 1959 of Curb Your Enthusiasm, of Larry David - all the actors know what to do and say and even have the right look in their eyes when they speak. In other words, it is one of the most realistic appearances of beating generation, animated sweetly in its score and telling a tale of racial tensions. A group of black siblings is the focal point, with one trying to get better shows than the regular strip club, and has a sister, much lighter than him, who intertwines with a white man in a relationship who splits both sides. The film, however, is not exclusively about this; Cassavettes likes to make her characters wander around New York City (which was not many movies in 1959/1960) and her style of storytelling is like that of the improvised jazz artists of the time. Dated, for sure, but worth a look for movie buffs; Martin Scorsese called it one of his greatest influences.
