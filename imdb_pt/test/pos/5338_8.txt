If you have not watched the movie yet, enjoy comedy, go out and buy or at least rent it! The fact that you won, the animated Oscar, is not a coincidence! I have not watched many other Wallace & Gromit movies (actually, I think they just watched one another), but the mood is very distinctive ... and some would also say very British. In a good way, of course! <br /> <br /> The story will only be an excuse for all the jokes that will come, but although it is not the most elaborate, it still works (by the way, my niece guessed to see one of the big surprises coming). , I did not, praise her, the)). I think after watching this, you'll go out and look for the other W & G movies out there. Have fun!
