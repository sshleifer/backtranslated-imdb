If you like movies that will make you think, this is absolutely one of the good ones. I've always liked David Lynch and Cronenberg. They have always made high quality movies. <br /> <br /> Iain Softley drove the K-PAX brilliantly. The film rips feelings and philosophy of mind and world. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges offer excellent acting skills. He got me, I did not take my eyes off the screen during the movie. On the other hand, if you're waiting for a special science fiction movie, this is not for you. The story is being dragged a bit, which can be a bit tedious, but it also works as a way to build the movie theme. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this movie, I did ..
