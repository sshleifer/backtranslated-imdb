In my personal opinion, I think this is the best video game ever created! I played this game for the first time at my friends' house years ago, the next day I went out and got mine. Since that day, almost seven years ago, I have not stopped touching him. I can not help it, I can not get bored of it. I've been addicted to other games on far newer systems, but I keep coming back for more Goldeneye. Each mission is incredibly fun and challenging, the multi-player mode was like no other. I hope you are fortunate enough to have played in multiplayer four player mode because I had brothers and friends who joined and played this game all the time.
