The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. Yes, they may have been the original rock band manufactured; a trick that has certainly reached an exaggeration in the 21st century. However, his music stands as one of the best that the 1960s had to offer. Last train to Clarksville, believer daydream, I am a believer, (I am not) his Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by such good composers as Boyce / Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen / King and John Stewart . While they were not great musicians or composers, they had a nice screen presence and lots of feature and some of their own things were really decent. His TV show is dated 2007, but I still watch the show from time to time as a time capsule for life in 1966-1968; this magical and dangerous moment in US history. <br /> <br /> However, as we all know, as a portent of things to come to the likes of Kelly Clarkson, The Monkees did not want to be considered fabricated and just puppets for his label. In spite of their average talents, they wanted to write their own songs, produce their own albums and give the letters when it comes to touring. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a disaster; especially when Peter Tork's choice of Jimi Hendrix as an opening act was nixed due to his show stealing and heavy sexual cues in his music compared to The Monkees G-Rated content. <br /> <br /> However, the final nail in the coffin for the Monkees (until 1986) was the infamous movie Head. Head was written by Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson while they were supposedly on top of Mary Jane. The film received bad reviews and only won $ 16,000 at the box office. Today, the film is a cult classic, ahead of its time and conveys a message of what was in the minds of young people in 1968, the summer of wrath. <br /> <br /> The head really has no plot. Basically, one to four of the Monkees walk from scene to scene without any rhyme or reason. They go from eating in a restaurant, to watching Davy Jones being hit by Sonny Liston, to a Westerner, to being sucked into a vacuum, to performing at a concert and so on. The film basically offers oblique views on what was wrong with American society. The Monkees beat commercialism, the war in Vietnam, American politics, censorship, establishment and greed. You have to read between the lines to see which were the targets of scorn. Monkees spend a lot of time in boxes at certain junctions of the film, symbolizing how they felt their label saw them; as nothing but toys for them to play when it came time to record another hit album. A scene in which they are at a 16-4 disadvantage in the western scene could be a symbol of them against session musicians, songwriters, record producers and others who controlled their careers and the cannon they shoot at them is their way of saying " Begone! " The film is truly a psychedelic journey to contemplate. The flashy colors of tie-dye, the hypnotic scenes of concerts and belly dancing and drugged images are everywhere. The performance is really good but this is being biased when I like The Monkees T.V. A small soundtrack features "The Porpoise Song" and three songs written by The Monkees themselves. <br /> <br /> The movie has some hilarious scenes from time to time; though maybe they should not be. Mickey Dolenz banging on a Coke machine that did not give him a soda or his violent punches on the boxing scene (I mean, he was a skinny guy who probably weighed more than 135) made me laugh. /> <br /> All in all, this movie is an absolute must-see for any Monkees fan. I think many people will feel that this movie is really "over the head", but for those obsessed with the 60's and with society at the time, it will be a great time capsule.
