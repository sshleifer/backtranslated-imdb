Bwana Devil is supposed to be the first big studio, a feature film entirely filmed in the 3D process. Supposedly, producer Oboler went to Africa to film a different film, but after hearing the story of two male-devouring lions, terrorizing the railroad builders, we decided on this one. It's a good story too, almost like Hemmingway; fear, redemption, the great white hunter and all. It is the story of the story that seems to drag on, almost as if filming in the new process was too heavy for the team. The action scenes are harsh, almost staged. But these technical problems seem small in light of the film's dramatic conclusion.
