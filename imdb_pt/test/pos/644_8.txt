I just finished this movie and my only comment is "OH! WOW!". Jennifer Beals is ok as the bride but Yancy Butler as the female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite! Having watched her at WITCHBLADE, I was not prepared for the sheer sensuality and pure sexual excitement she casts on the screen. <br /> <br /> I have to see THIS movie again ... if only for Yancy Butler like Corrinne!
