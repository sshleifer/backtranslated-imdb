LIFEFORCE is an extremely schizophrenic film, based on Colin Wilson's novel The Space Vampires, the script ignores most of the concepts and structure of the novel (in fact, it owes more to the QUATERMASS series than to the novel), but the novel scenes are almost identical to the movie. And talking about the script must be one of the most unequal in film history, although it has been written in chapters by several different people. Take for example Carlson, he disappears after the first scenes of the space shuttle that led me to believe he was dead, so he appears again in the middle of the film to explain the plot to the besieged Brits and it is this lack of attention of the writers. which spoils the film. And there are many other clumsy scripts like the heroes returning to London in a helicopter and not realizing that he has been run by zombies until they are flying over him. <br /> <br /> I could continue great length on these plot holes, but LIFEFORCE is really nice to watch as long as you do not use your brain. It's good to see a science fiction horror movie from a time when aliens were portrayed as cute creatures that children hid in their rooms so that nasty human adults would not get their hands on them. The special effects and pyrotechnics are very good, there is a lot of action and acrobatics and the LIFEFORCE presents one of the most memorable aliens in the shape of the space girl. When we mention LIFEFORCE in conversations with males, it's always a race to say "Seen the alien in LIFEFORCE? It can suck the life force from me at any time." Surprisingly, looking at the demographics of the votes that this film is most popular among the female men <br /> <br /> "Do not worry, a naked girl can not get away from here" Can not she? Penalty <br /> <br />
