Bob Cummings is excellent at it, since this technically brilliant Hitchcock movie does not really get fame like some of his other films, but it's very watchable to this day. Priscilla Lane proves in this case that she can keep up with other blondes who worked with Hitchcock later. She just made a handful of movies after that, which makes her almost forgotten today. <br /> <br /> There are sequences in them that will remind the viewer of mounts in later director films. The acting is so well done and the story so well done that this movie is still a lot of fun today. Everyone in the cast performs well. There are several great scenarios in the film in black and white. <br /> <br /> This was the first Universal movie for Hitchcock. In the long run between the films he made at Universal as well as the television series, Hitchcock would do as much box office for the studios as anyone who worked there. This fact is lost in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Norman Lloyd is well chosen as the real villain in this movie. The story moves very well, including Hitchcock's only western sequel filmed. This movie is very good, with a lot of excellent work for everyone involved.
