Goldie Hawn's portrayal of a simple young woman wrapped in a love triangle with an older man, a dentist, played so fondly by Walter Matthau, that she won the Oscar for best supporting actress in 1969. <br /> <br /> film, however, is another tribute to Ingrid Bergman. Rarely have we seen her in a comedy and she literally lifts her heels here as a dedicated dental nurse who is pushed for a scheme for Matthau to tell Hawn that they are married. <br /> <br /> It's a joy to see Matthau and Bergman fall into each other here. This is a case of accidental love in training. <br /> <br /> As a friend of Matthau, Jack Weston is fabulous as his partner in the scheme as well. Rick Lenz gives ample support as the newly found boyfriend of Hawn as well.
