I can not comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I liked it. If there is a God, the soundtrack will be released, Ilona Sekacz's work is truly enduring. Twenty years later, I remain touched by the astounding themes of this production and return to it frequently. <br /> <br /> The story involves entry into Catherine Moreland's society. A little clumsy and possessing an unhealthy interest in gothic stories (early police fiction?), Catherine descends in Bath in the company of Mme. Allen, where he meets Henry Tilney. She is invited to visit the Tilneys at Northanger Abbey, the home of the formidable (and somewhat financially challenged) General Tilney, who has the unfortunate misconception that wealth is on the way. <br /> <br /> Where mutual attraction blends with family Finance, dispute is inevitable. This, combined with Catherines' vivid imagination, leads her to fear for her safety. Its eventual exit is marked by accusations and counter-accusations of deceit and connivance. <br /> <br /> But the attraction between Catherine and Henry is in these trials. It returns to provide a happy ending. This final scene is especially compelling given the incidental music of Ilona Sekacz. <br /> <br /> It may well be a "bad" production from the point of view of the purists, gaudy costumes and unstable presentations that can not resist, but for me it is 88 minutes of happiness.
