"Love is a very splendorous thing" is set in Hong Kong in 1949-50, and tells the story of the relationship between Mark Elliott, a white American journalist, and Han Suyin, a middle-aged Chinese physician. This story of a mongrel love affair was a daring theme for the 1950s, and as it always was, Hollywood tried to soften the blow by casting a white actress as the supposedly non-Caucasian woman who falls in love with a white man. man, something that would be considered politically incorrect today, but that was quite acceptable at the time. (Consider, for example, Ava Gardner's cast on "Show Boat" or Natalie Wood in "West Side Story.") The story setting in a British colony was also perhaps a way to explore racial issues in a way that would cause less controversy In america. Suyin loses her job at a hospital in Hong Kong because her British superiors oppose the fact that she is dating a white man whom she is unable to marry because her ex-wife will not grant him a divorce. As was sometimes the case, European colonialism was turned into a whip for some of America's failures. Imagine the fury that would have been unleashed if a similar movie had been made about a black or mongrel doctor at a hospital in Alabama. In addition to racial issues, the film also raises questions about international politics, referring to both the communist takeover of power in China and the outbreak of the Korean War. Han Suyin was a real person and a well-known author of the period; in fact, it tended to support Mao's communist regime, but here it is shown as firmly anti-Communist. This is not, however, mainly a "question" film about racialism or politics, but rather a novel, a good example of what would be known at the time as a "woman's image." Such films, although made mostly by male directors, were mainly aimed at the female audience. They dealt with love and romance - often unhappy romance - from the woman's point of view, and had a strong female personality in the lead role. The genre often provided roles for older actresses than the heroines of standard novels. Earlier examples were usually monochromatic, but in the fifties they generally, like here, wore lush, sumptuous colors. <br /> <br /> Although a Chinese or Eurasian actress would have been more convincing in the role, Jennifer Jones, a very good job as Suyin. I found William Holden, as Mark, quite charismatic, but that does not matter much, since Suyin is the dominant figure. She is much more than Mark, and the film examines her family and her professional life much more than his. Although Jennifer was still incredibly beautiful, she was in her thirties, older than most of the romantic movie heroines of that period. Holden was about the same age, exceptionally for the fifties, when "boy-girl" used to mean "old man meets girl". <br /> <br /> The film is not particularly deep, but it is well done with some attractive photography, particularly from Hong Kong itself, reflecting the growing trend in the 1950s to shoot on location rather than on studio sets. Rarely does Hong Kong look so beautiful; the view of a hill overlooking the city takes on special significance as it is here that Suyin and Mark go about their romantic chores. The overall mood is a poignant and doomed romance, a mood intensified by atmospheric photography and music, including one of the most memorable film themes ever written. 7/10
