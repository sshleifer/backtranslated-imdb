Very dependable entertainment, like Las Vegas has fun as well as intrigues, very light and very enhanced by Josh Duhanel !! I like this television show and I think many people see it as a form of voyeurism escapist ... The voyeurism in this case is very positive, and many women in this series are very cool to see ... This show incorporates Las Vegas legends like Wayne Newton as intermittent characters to authenticate the Vegas genre !! There have been copious representations of Sin City, this is one of the best efforts ... Producers and directors are fortunate enough to have James Caan on the show, as he is a fully accomplished actor !!! Overall, I like the Las Vegas TV show and watch it on Fridays, I watched Mondays too, but with Monday Night Football, I could see why NBC switched to Fridays ... a lot! !
