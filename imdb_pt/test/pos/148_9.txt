The director of 'Oldboy' Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the most legal and at the same time more serious vampire movies in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Relying on the latest Hollywood fad, today's vampires should be a bit non-violent, asexual, love-lorn chevaliers instead of rampant sexual bloodthir sucking blood suckers manipulating humans from once. This is the movie you want to see if you want to remember the sticky emotions of the past ... well, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> "Headquarters" begins with a long exposition of characters culminating in a slightly different love story. The vampire transformation of a priest is, over time, sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story, which contributes to an uncomfortable sight. But the last 40 minutes are surprisingly bloody. Well, maybe not so surprisingly if you know 'Oldboy' and 'I'm a Cyborg, but that's okay,' but I think it's fair to say that 'Thirst' outlasts Park's previous films in terms of in-the-face violence . <br /> <br /> All in all, be warned that this is neither an art cinema nor a horror movie. It can be very disgusting to many and too much to some. 'Thirst' is original, entertaining and, fortunately, a little less odd than previous efforts of Park Chun-wook.
