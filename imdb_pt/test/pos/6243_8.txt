"Tourist Trap" is a bizarre horror movie from the '70s. The film is about a group of young adults, Becky, Jerry and Molly, who are traveling in a jeep through a deserted area. Her two other friends, Eileen and her boyfriend Woody, are in a separate car. When a wheel flattens out, Woody takes her to a gas station nearby - and finds a terrible destination for some bizarre telekinetic chaos and some scary mannequins. Friends get tired of waiting for Woody and go to a local mannequin / wax museum "tourist trap". In front of the entrance, the car breaks randomly, and the girls find an oasis area for swimming, where they are approached by Mr. Slausen, who directs the attraction of the road that is now closed. He leads them to the old western wax museum, and the girls are left behind as he and Jerry get the car cleaned. Eileen, the curious of the two, wanders to an old house nearby, where she also falls into the hands of a mysterious masked killer and a lot of life as mannequins. After waiting for Eileen, Becky and Molly will look for her. It is when the real horror begins, and the kinetic telepathic brother (can move objects with his mind) masked by Mr. Slausen begins to kill the teenagers one by one while controlling his large amount of human mannequins. <br /> <sound like the remake "House of Wax" of 2005? Well that's. I had heard of this movie but never saw it when I saw "House of Wax", but now I can see the striking similarities the two films share - "Tourist Trap" was obviously a big contributor to the remake of House of Wax. The manikins in this movie are scary to begin with, some with moving eyeballs, some without eyes, and some with mouths that also sing. The chanting was extremely scary if you asked me, and the mannequins were oddly drawn. Dummies are scary to begin with, they are so real, but in fact they are not. The film combines elements of the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (the masks the killer uses are similar to those of Leatherface), with a bit of the original "House of Wax," and the telekinetic powers displayed in "Carrie." The result is quite satisfactory. Telekinesis was a beautiful touch to the film, made the killer even more menacing and inescapable. The masks were terrifying, and the plastering scene was really disturbing. <br /> <br /> The movie soundtrack was very well made, if not a bit overused in some scenes. The acting may not be particularly important, but it really was not that bad. Chuck Connors was really good as the obscure Mr. Slauston, giving the character a dark but friendly feeling. The young Tanya Roberts is also in the movie, she is best known for her role in "Charlie's Angels" and more recently on the sitcom "That '70s Show," playing Donna's mother. Robert A. Burns is the art director, he did phenomenal work on the original "Texas Chainsaw" and also does a good job here, creating a messy and musty atmosphere for both the decadent museum and the old house full of mannequins. I found it a bit odd that the original rating for the movie was PG, it seems a bit scary to have such a tame rating, but the movie really is not too violent. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Tourist Trap" is an extremely unique, fast and extremely underrated horror classic. Full Moon gave it a decent 20th anniversary release, the comment was interesting and the image was clear and crisp most of the time, better than the video versions. If you like horror horror movies from the 70's, "Tourist Trap" is an understated retro gem. 8/10
