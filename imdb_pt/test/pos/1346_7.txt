I saw that last night in Fort Lauderdale. Overall, it was funny and I liked the characters, especially Sabrina. The acting is good and the plot was OK except for the ending that left the way for many hanging strings and we were like (what?) I wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been made much better. <br /> <br /> The film portrayed the life of rules very well and we laugh everywhere. It has flaws that sure, but for the first time movie for Ash Christian I thought it was good. You may want to wait for the DVD on this one. But if you get the chance to see, take a chance
