I remember when I saw this movie for the first time. I was taking care of a friend of my mother's, and one of the children suggested we attend. Thinking it was the downright laughable 'Prince of Thieves', they were entering the video recorder, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom. What I had came as a shock, a pleasant one, I admit, but still a shock. <br /> <br /> Now, you all know the legend of Robin Hood, do not you know? I'll explain a bit. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, giving money here and there and giving it to people who needed him, all the while seducing the beautiful Lady Marion and irritating the sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John. That's the basics! Now with the review. <br /> <br /> This movie was released in 1993, and is a takeoff of the entire Robin Hood legend and an episode of Prince of Thieves in particular. Following loosely the legend, Robin of Loxley is first encountered in an Arab prison during the crusades of the third century, and along with a 'Moor' as they were called in those days, he performs an astute escape with a companion of After escaping, Asneeze asks Robin to find his son Atchoo, an exchange student in England, and take care of him. This Robin promises to do! Robin swims back to England. <br /> <br /> He returns to his home, Loxley's castle to find him being carried behind the car by stagecoach officers, and goes through the sad revelation that his father, dog, cat and even the goldfish gold are all dead. Desperate for a familiar face, he meets the blind blind Blinkin family sitting in the bathroom with a Braille Jazz magazine. The hilarity continues throughout the film. Like all Robin Hood stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the sheriff of Rottingham, who are wreaking havoc and charging exorbitant taxes on King Richards' kingdom. he is out. <br /> <br /> Those who are familiar with the films that Mel Brooks has already directed will have a small idea of ​​what to expect. After all, this is the man responsible for Dracula and loved by young Frankenstein. All the jokes, ranging from visual jokes to wonderful witty comments, are exactly in the right places throughout the film, with never more than a minute between laughs. <br /> <br /> Cary Elwes (by the way, the only Englishman to play). Robin Hood in a movie), which many of you will know about the Promised Princess, brings her presence of bright, cheeky eyes to this movie, and does a wonderful job. From strange heroic poses, to a wickedly sexy look, he is incredibly funny. And the man looks better in tight pants than I do! <br /> <br /> Richard Lewis is hilarious as prince John weeping and arrogant with the ever-changing mole. He makes tide-boy behavior reduced to a tee, and his American vocations are great. Throughout the film, a mole on the face constantly changes position: it starts on the left cheek, then on the right cheek, then the chin and then the forehead, before returning to its original place. This is a subtle joke based on Alan Rickman's mole when he played the sheriff in Prince Of Thieves. <br /> <br /> Roger Rees as the despicable sheriff of Rottingham is wonderfully slimy and unpleasant, and has a few large lines throughout movie. <br /> <br /> There are some faces you know of from other Brooks movies. For example, Robert Ridgely, playing the executioner in this film, also played the executioner in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He also likes to add subtle references to his previous films; with several in this film that Brooks fans will find easily. Those who watched part of History of the World 1 will recognize the song for the song 'Men in Tights'. In addition, when Patrick Stewart arrives and laughs Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) utters the phrase "it's good to be a king," one of his lines in World History. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is wonderfully comical, even those with just a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humor to them <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so wonderfully hot and funny in the my opinion are all impromptu scenes. Although there was a kind of screenplay, some scenes were completely improvised by the actors themselves, such as the scene in which Latrine (Tracey Ullman) prays for Rottingham in his bed, and he falls on the ceiling, landing exactly where she wanted him, which was totally invented and thought by the two actors. <br /> <br /> There are few special effects, and those that are there are small but fun times of computerized tricks with cameras. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is memorable, with some very funny songs and a couple of cheesy love songs. You will be singing 'Men in tights' or at least humming to yourself for weeks. <br /> <br /> The classification is Pg, to which I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the movie except in the use of double meaning, and an expression of sh! T, and violence is minimal. In fact, I would say non-existent, plus some comedy scenes. <br /> <br /> A very entertaining movie that adults and children will love!
