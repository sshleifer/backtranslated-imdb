This is a movie that is much nicer than its rating of 7 suggests. In many ways, it's like a 50's version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS - with much of the excesses and sloppiness of VALLEY polite a bit to the public of 1959. Like this later movie, both are about three young ladies standing on the fast-track to success - though this time in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the girls in THE BEST OF ALL has Broadway aspirations). <br /> <br /> The film begins with Hope Lange joining the company for her first day of work. She is cast for tough boss Joan Crawford, who is appearing in her first supporting role in decades. Despite how unpleasant Crawford looks, Lange is determined not to give in - to do this in this work. And over time, she quickly rises from secretary to editor. At the same time, his two new roommates also try to climb the ranks - one on stage and one for a relationship with a rich playboy. Like VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, they all have their ups and downs (mostly lows), but by the end of the movie there is some hope that at least some of them will - abused and bruised, though. <br /> <br /> In this movie, men are mostly pigs. The only guy who looks decent is played by Stephen Boyd, so of course Hope Lange neglects him for a well-done ex-boyfriend. As for the faces played by veteran actor Brian Ahern and the rest, they are a sexist scum and eventually you understand how Crawford has become so bitter and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all - adultery, premarital sex. , abortion, etc. and certainly not an artistic triumph. However, thanks to excellent production values ​​and a juicy script, this is a pleasure to watch. Just do not expect Shakespeare !!
