I just watched this movie in an advanced view. I had not read the book, and knew nothing of the story, but it was because the book was voted "Book of the Year" by two local colleges. So I can not compare the book to the movie as others have. <br /> <br /> In short, I thought this was an incredibly exciting story. The performance was plausible and the perception of Afghan political culture and history was interesting and shocking. My oldest friend is Iranian-American, and so I felt an affinity with certain Middle Eastern values ​​and traditions that were portrayed in the film, as they reminded me of the times I spent with his family. themes of friendship, family, human values ​​and courage under fire are universal and are well developed in the film. I will not list the details of the plot as they can be obtained elsewhere. But based on the technical aspects of the film, in acting and, above all, in the story of cutting my heart, I would definitely recommend this movie.
