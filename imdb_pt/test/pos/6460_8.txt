The reason why this film is no longer known and more appreciated seems to me due to its subject. Because of its controversial subject, this movie never received a great release and still remains quite unknown until today. Not that this is a matter now is more controversial now. <br /> <br /> Basically, in essence, it's a movie about a white man making friends with a black man. The friendship does not seem forced or unrealistic, but the way it is portrayed in this film makes everything seem very real. We see these different ethnicities mingling with each other, as if it were completely normal. Unfortunately, of course, in those days, it really was not considered normal. Seeing a black man talking to a white girl and just having fun with her as a friend must have been a difficult thing to watch, for example, in some proportions of the public of 1957. <br /> <br /> You can really understand why Sidney Poitier has always been and continues to be highly respected by Hollywood society and the black community in general. Of course that's one of the reasons he also received an Honorary Award at the Oscars in 2002. In his films, he often fights against discrimination and prejudiced issues, with, of course, "In the Heat of the Night" as the best example of this . . A real model that certainly inspired many African-American actors to this day. But in addition, he was also a great actor. Yes he is still alive but he pretty much retired completely from the movies now it seems since his last credited role is 2001. This movie was the debut in the direction of Martin Ritt and he was not given either. a lot of movie to spend on your movie. The studios were probably also a little reluctant mainly because of their concept and / or because it was Ritt's first film. Or maybe it was simply due to the fact that MGM was not that big anymore and had left its best days behind. Since the 1950s at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had a reputation for making not very good and cheap movies, whereas in the early years before that, it was actually one of the largest studios with many acclaimed stars and directors attached to it. , which made many award-winning classic films. Luckily for them, their reputation is starting to change again and whenever the MGM logo appears in a movie, people are no longer expecting a smaller movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, even with their limited budget and limited resources they managed to make a great movie with that. The film is very simple, with just a few characters and a simplistic plot. However, the film still manages to capture it with its history and subjects, without ever starting to become a preacher or anything about it. It makes the film also effective with its themes. <br /> <br /> Really a movie that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10
