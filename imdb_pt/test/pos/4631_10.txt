I think this movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I think Debbie Reynolds is hilarious and the chemistry between her and Glenn Ford is perfect. There is not a dull moment in the movie and Debbie looks beautiful as ever. <br /> <br /> The story is about a dancer Maggie (Debbie Reynolds) who meets a cashless soldier, Joe (Glenn Ford). She feels an instant dislike for him, but after he accidentally tears the dress, he returns to her on condition that she goes on a date with him. They end up getting married the night they have a date after just a kiss. Joe and Maggie move to Spain and find they have nothing in common but physical attraction, so Maggie proposes that for a month they live, but not as husband and wife, which means that Joe can not kiss or sleep with Maggie , to Joe's frustration. A hilarious plot and a wonderful film. To not lose.
