I would say this movie is disturbing. Brutality is described in a very unhealthy way, it's like a psychosis in 40 minutes. At the same time, it is a cruel insight into human behavior. The scenes are fierce, starting with the horse slaughter and ending with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen. Every emotion is exploited to the extreme, the frustration of the butcher, the love for his almost incestuous daughter, the anger when he finds out she was abused, every feeling is so natural and so wrong. This film shows the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way. The movie's message is that a person's life can change in a second as a consequence of someone's behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the most powerful and can determine one's performance. I loved the unique way of filming, simplicity and brutality accompanied by the silence in which only inner thoughts penetrate.
