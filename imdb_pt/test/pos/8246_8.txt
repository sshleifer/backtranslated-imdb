There is an interesting split in the voting for this movie (currently at least). Those who are waiting for a documentary are impressed, or at least not disappointed. I anticipate that those who gave the film 1 in 10 are those who expected a war movie or a re-enactment of the Gallipoli invasion. <br /> <br /> So - if you want to see actors, shots and blood, this movie does not suit you. If you want to see an independent documentary about Gallipoli, with no preconceptions about a single side (the only enemy in those events was the War itself), then you will be impressed and sober. I found a very moving film, and I really enjoyed Captain Guy Nightingale until the end.
