Spoiler Alert <br /> <br /> I've never seen reviews in a movie, which I disagree with more than the comments people have made about it. One can learn from critical views of this film. As an educational film, I rate it a lot because it teaches "how to succeed"! We do not watch movies to learn; we usually watch the entertainment. As entertainment, I rate it as low: the ending is negative and cerebral / intellectual. This conflict results in my rating of eight stars. The film follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The network executive presents Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), to study for the position of anchor news on the air. Tom immediately delights people with humility. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his chance on the air, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all the news, inside and out. <br /> <br /> The Network executive wants Grunnick in the air and Jane argues, saying that Grunnick is not ready, he does not know the news. They do not hear it. Forced to put Grunnick in the air, Jane contacts Altman for information on the news and conveys Altman's comments through a headset to Grunnick while Grunnick speaks. We note the strong contrast between the words of Altman / Jane Craig and Grunnick, as Grunnick cleverly rewrites all that Altman and Jane Craig say in their ear in order to make it understandable, enjoyable, and entertaining to the public. Altman has a chance on the air and network executives require him to seek coaching from Grunnick, the new guy. This new (ingnorant news) face coaching it? This is something that Altman does not see justified, but he agrees reluctantly. <br /> <br /> Grunnick trains Altman and gets excited by observing hundreds of Altman deficiencies in appearance, audio, and vocabulary. Altman never considered these things before when he became a specialist in the news itself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him causes Altman to have a panic sweat attack ("Flop Sweat") when he is on the air. Grunnick eventually becomes the main network anchor and Altman resigns before being fired. But Grunnick fails in his attempt to romance with Jane Craig because she learns from Altman that Grunnick sometimes fakes the circumstances to make people like him. That drives her away from him. This sends the message that in relationships we want genuine people who do not try to make us like them. <br /> <br /> This movie sends the message that making people like you is the most important skill in a job, but this is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people commenting on how this is the doldrums of TV News and how Grunnick represents a handsome but dumb guy or any style but no substance. The opposite is true, Grunnick possessed very complex abilities and intellect, to get people to like him, including the presence of spirit to know exactly how he appears and sounds, when he is on camera (he trains Altman to Punch a word in every phrase ). Grunnick's fault that costs him the relationship with Jane Craig is that he is very motivated to be kind and will fake a situation. Many people are calling Altman very intelligent or brilliant. Altman played by Brookes is not as clever as Grunnick and the "Flop Sweat" scene shows that his mind can not handle the complexity Grunnick manipulates when he is in the air. Altman is infuriated by the fact that he knows the news and Grunnick is more successful in making people like him. There are also people commenting that these things are unique to the TV News industry. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job is obviously not popular, but my experience indicates that this is true in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, though unpopular. Educational, yes, but it has no uplifting end.
