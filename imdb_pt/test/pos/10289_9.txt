This is a clever story about relationships and a display of three major categories of players in the relationship game: playboys (Max), manipulative women (Alice) and fools who may be really in love (Lisa, Muriel and Lucien). Max and Alice are very unpleasant and perhaps despicable characters, but who are always in control of the game leaving their partners in the dark. But as the heavily contested finale tells us, as veteran players like Max and Alice were, they would be happy to break up any time they thought the game had just been announced and that each of them did not mind receiving with his own life and play another game with some other anonymous people when another opportunity presented himself. Lisa, Muriel and Lucien may be the ones who wanted to invest something real in a relationship, just not being able to realize that they were the bait in the game and the ultimate losers (with regard to what was shown to us .... who knows if they are also advanced players of some sort in their worlds not shown to us onscreen). <br /> <br /> This is a very fast story, delicately crafted and seductively spirited with a compelling execution by the cast. It also deserves some deeper thought: how much is real in a relationship game?
