This film offers a fascinating journey through one of today's most exciting cities - Istanbul - and its musicians. Do not expect a compilation of Turkish folklore or something like that. Alexander Hacke, a German musician and member of the cult band "Einst√ºrzende Neubauten" travels to Istanbul to see the musical scene. His sparse voice about what he experiences is a guideline through the film. But mainly, the Turkish-German director Faith Akin allows several Istanbul artists to speak - and, of course, their music. <br /> <br /> You know a variety of personalities, big stars and street musicians, young and old, people playing many different musical styles. But this film not only presents the sound of Istanbul. It also draws a compelling picture of Istanbul today and how Turkey has advanced in the last decade. The film characterizes its protagonists with subtle humor, but never without respect. They all share a passion for music and a belief in their power. <br /> <br /> Akin again shows his talent for portraying diversity lightly when approaching completely different musical scenes. After his award-winning film "Gegen die Wand" (Head on), Faith Akin proves with "Crossing the Bridge" that he is equally capable of playing, entertaining and guiding his audience in a documentary. If you've never been to Istanbul, you'll want to go there after you've seen the movie.
