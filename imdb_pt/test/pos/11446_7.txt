Much more than any other film of that period, Night of the Demons represents the pastiche of brainless terror and extremely pleasant. It's fun and undemanding, with a bunch of nasty make-up effects, gorgeous teens (and horny) and adorable clich√©d elements. A group of party animals, led by the alternative Angela, will celebrate Halloween in an abandoned funeral home carrying a strange urban legend. It all starts out typical and "innocent" with dancing, drinking and occasionally flirting among young people who can not keep their hormones under control, but soon a bloodthirsty demon possesses the hostess. In the most ingenious forms you have ever seen, the rest of the cast is violently slaughtered only to return as horrendous creatures prowling for blood. The thing that makes this movie better than most 80's horror films is finding a good balance between light-headed camp and atmospheric horror. Some sequences really are scary and the funeral home setting provides Night of the Demons with an excellent tone. Director Tenney makes great use of the scenarios (coffins, a crematory, endless dark corridors ??) and his young, enthusiastic, obviously loves what they are involved. The fantastic makeup effects of a whole team of artists and designers. Of course, the obvious aspects for the love and terror fanatics will love the large number of severed limbs, bulging eyes and crushed skulls! The final highlight, however, is the trick of Linnea Quigley with the lipstick that is fading! This bimbo nymphomaniac tucks an entire tube of lipstick into her nipple and continues her wave of sexual murders! Formidable! Night of the Demons received two sequences during the 1990s and, while still worth checking out, they focus more on comedy than shivers.
