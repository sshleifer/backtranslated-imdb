This was one of the best horror / thriller / half hour fantasy shows of the 80's, no doubt. Granted the show had a badly capable cast with each episode, and it stank as much as the production values ​​(ie the sets) was, but damn, I have to give some credit for being brave with the tangles. I mean, the plot of each episode was so daring that even me, a horror movie, shock film and a 1970s millimeter chandelier got a little sick and scared. Great show, great, no matter what the other reviewers said here. My favorite episode was called "Bug House", yes, that was the title I think? Anyway, that still gives me the will every time I think about it until today, almost 20 years after its first debut. Other shows like "Tales From The Darkside", "The Outer Limits" and (of course) "The Twilight Zone" were definitely better in terms of production, but in my opinion they have nothing to do with plots. when compared to this sick little show! It definitely paved the way for the classic graphic cult phenomenon that was, "Tales From The Crypt."
