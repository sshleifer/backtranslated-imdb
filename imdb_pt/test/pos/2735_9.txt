This is a multifaceted, insightful and daring story about the people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, his (and our) perception and realities. Although the main theme revolves around a delirious young woman, the story flirts deliciously with physics, medicine, religion and even politics, questioning our perceptions about what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma conveys beautifully that the world in which Mithi is living is as real to her as ours is to us. Within this world, it is logical and their thoughts are internally consistent, not the jargon they seem to us in our world. <br /> <br /> Here are some remarkable scenes to watch while watching the movie (do not worry, these are not spoilers). I loved the way Aparna Sen made those comments in the story. <br /> <br /> References to quantum mechanics and relativity mingled with the sorcerer ("ojha" in Hindi) performing his religious rituals that he believes. will drive away the "ghosts" sitting in Mithi's brain. <br /> <br /> The doctor prescribing shock treatment as a solution that "is believed" to work - Perception windows - The scene about reviewing Anu's book. <br /> <br /> - Allusion to the illusion in a conversation about a director looking for "maya". <br /> <br /> - News footage of George Bush telling the world that "there is no doubt in his mind" that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (now, it is not so much about Bush's perception that I suspect I know the truth, like the naive public's perception of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.) <br /> <br /> - One of the best scenes in the film is where Mithi tells Anu that "Charu sent this man to me beat "and Anu dismisses this as a matter of course. Konkona did a fantastic job, bringing up the strange mixture of confused thoughts in the brain of a schizophrenic when his world and the real world collide. Aparna Sen was bold but not bold enough to ask a big question: Is almost all mankind delirious believing in God? She could have inserted some scenes about "normal", "healthy" people praying and sacrificing themselves for a Being that no one has ever seen or heard in all of human history (the ritual scene / exorcism does not go far enough). That would be the final question: what is normal? Who is the truth, the believer or the atheist? IMHO, this film is a much more complex exploration of the schizophrenic mind than "A Brilliant Mind." It looks at the minds not only of the sick but also of the healthy, and it does so from many different angles and illuminates our understanding of our own minds and our world. If the first one has 4 Oscars, it deserves more - at least one for each story, script, direction, Konkona and Shabana Azmi. It was really a pleasure to watch this movie and I'm glad I bought the DVD for my collection. <br /> <br /> This was a story very well told.
