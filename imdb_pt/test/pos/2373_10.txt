I love this kind of movie. Blood, revenge, lots of action, very dark, tacky and more. But this does not offer the kind you could expect. When I saw Kite Birds and Ichi the Killer before, I had fun watching those, but why not? Dead or Alive: Final is a decent anime and is not hardcore and does not even expect nudity in this movie. At least add some more actions to entertain the audience. Even the drama was not so good. Well, I do not want to ruin the movie or the plot. But I felt that Dead or Alive: Final is a bit nerdy. So no more to do. I do not recommend this movie to everyone, but I recommend it to people who love decent and well run anime. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine and University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
