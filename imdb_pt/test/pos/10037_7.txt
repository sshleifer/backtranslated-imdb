This movie is good for entertainment purposes, but it is not historically reliable. If you're looking for a movie and thinking to yourself 'Oh, I want to learn more about Custer's life and your last position,' do not rent 'They Died with Their Boots On'. But if you would like to watch a movie to enjoy an old western movie, with a bit of romance and just for a good story, this is a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the first day of Custer (Errol Flynn) at West Point. Everyone loves their charming personality, which allows them to get away with almost everything. The film follows his West Point career and his many battles, including his Civil War battle. The film ends with his last participation in the Little Big Horn. Among the battle scenes, he finds love and marriage to Libby (Olivia De Havilland). <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays the arrogant George Armstrong Custer well. Olivia De Havilland plays beautiful and sweet Libby very well, especially in the flirting scene that Custer and Libby meet for the first time. Your on-screen chemistry made you believe in your novel. The acting overall was impressive, especially Callie's comic (though stereotyped) role played by Hattie McDaniel. Your character will definitely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The heroic war music brought the thrill of battle scenes. Beautiful fantasies set the tone of the day. The script was sometimes tacky, although the film was still enjoyable to watch. The portrait of Custer's director was like a hero and history shows that this is debatable. Some will watch this movie and see Custer as a hero. Others will watch this movie and learn to hate it. <br /> <br /> I give a joinha for this film of 1942 in the occident.
