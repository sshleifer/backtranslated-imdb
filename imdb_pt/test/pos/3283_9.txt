Alright, so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it annoys some liberals. The thing is that South Park makes fun of everyone, much like the Simpsons did. If you are offended by a politician you like, you may need a better sense of humor and are taking the program very seriously. With that said, this episode is hilarious and one of the best. The portrait of Al Gores is hilarious, Cartman's scheme is terribly wrong and the results will make you roll on the floor. It's basically all you could want from an episode of south park and it's easily one of my favorites. I will not comment much more on the plot because I do not want to give anything away.
