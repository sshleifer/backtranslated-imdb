This story of the problems caused by an overly possessive, overpowering, domineering and unscrupulous mother (Laura Hope Crews) for her two grown sons and their girls, is a strong vehicle for stellar performances by Irene Dunn (the new daughter-in-Joel McCrea (son number one), Eric Linden (son number two) and Frances Dee (boyfriend of son number two). Here is the spectacle of the pure tyranny of jealousy and mother's possessiveness when four good people find their own lives her plans changed and her own identities threatened.Irene Dunn is stellar in her role.The performance of Joel McCrea is open and clear and Laura Hope Crews is masterful as the mother. <br /> <br /> However, this Critic thinks Frances Dee's performance is the best of all.Her is the first character in the story to show the strength of her inner feelings.His picture in her broken-hearted engagement scene is distressing, and even c Dee pulls the viewer around and takes you to his pain without even showing his face! <br /> <br /> Frances Dee, like Laura Hope Crews, has long been neglected and is almost forgotten as the magnificent actress she was. No actress who started in the movies after World War II had something to say about Frances Dee. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky enough to see The Silver Cord, which was never released for TV, you will find "old fashioned drawing-room drama" is an excellent film that shows very well 74 years after the its release in 1933, because it is filled with superb performances.
