H.G. Cluozot had difficulty working in France after making "Le Corbeau" in 1943, which was produced by the German company and later judged by the French as a piece of anti-French propaganda. Louis Jouvet, an admirer of Clouzot's work, invited him to direct a thriller "Quai des Orfevres," where he played an ambitious police inspector investigating a murder at the Paris Music Hall. Without knowing each other, seductive cabaret singer Jenny Lamoure (Suzy Delair) and her jealous husband, Maurice, who is madly in love with her (Bertrand Blier, father of director Bertrand Blier) trying to cover up (without the knowledge of the other) What do they believe to be their involvement in the murder? Enter the tenacious cop (Louis Jouvet) who is determined to find the truth. Jouvet pretty much stole the film with wonderfully cynical and sentimental at the same time of performance. "His character, eagle profile and unique way of speaking made him unforgettable." "Quai des Orfevres," a witty and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses was a great return of H.G. Cluozot, the excellent director, "French Hitchcock."
