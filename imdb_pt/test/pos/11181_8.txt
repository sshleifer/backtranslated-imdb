Because of my unfortunately not being able to find them anywhere, I did not get to experience any of the other entries in the series, although I certainly would not mind, and trust me, I looked. For those who do not know, this is a point and click adventure title. This means that the mouse is what you use to interface with everything you can do with it, although there is a specific case where this is inaccurate. I will not ruin here, for those who have not tried. However, regardless of how little experience you have with computers, you can sit back and experiment. There are not even a few pieces of it where you need to be quick or have quick reflexes. Heck, you can adjust the speed of the text (if you have subtitles), and so, talk about it, and it is not too strange or forced when slow. Accessing your inventory is easy, as well as combining or using items. Clicking and holding the button on anything you can affect gives you three options for what to use with it (be it a person, a specific part of the environment or an object): Hand (push, catch, open, etc.), eyes examine, look, etc.) and mouth (coma, converse, etc.). All this contributes to a warm and friendly environment where you can tackle the many puzzles (the amount of them is varied, based on which of the two difficulty settings you try this) at your own pace, and explore and absorb the dozens of individual and creatively made characters and areas in this content to your heart. The duration of this will be determined by how long it takes you to do this (you will not hear guilt from me, they are worth it), and your ability to figure out the solutions. There are some points where you decide whether you want the hardest way to complete this or not. This can be enjoyed by anyone, of any age. There is no material that is not acceptable for children. This is one of the products that help prove that this fact does not mean that it is intolerable for older audiences. Animation is a quality, smooth work, everything moves as it should, and the third dimension honestly is not so painful when you try it. Storytelling is well done, and you're never clear about what's going on. There are numerous well-targeted cut-scenes, kept in the same colorful and bright 2D world of the rest, with a well-made camera movement. "Cartoony" is an appropriate word to describe this, not just the visual style. It can be applied to all of this. The whole world of this is very similar, but not exactly like ours, with a mixture of past and present, inhabited by people and full of things that we can recognize or understand at least portions, but the absurd makes it funny. That would have to be one of the greatest forces of this, right there: it is hilarious. Much of this comes from the lines (what is said and how it is), and those who exploit British efforts with verbal focus, the likes of 'Allo' Allo or the BlackAdder franchise will want to check out this sucker. However, there are several different types of jokes including, but not limited to, the following: Satire, cleverness, obscurity, fakes, irony, gross comedy (not exactly my favorite aspect) and more. There is self-awareness, with the leader addressing you personally, and for example, explaining why he will not do what you asked for. There are references to pop culture in a few decades. Almost everything works, hardly any joke falls, and if you are not in points during this, my best guess as to the reason would be that it simply is not compatible with your sense of humor ... a situation that does not guarantee judgment, and if someone suspect that might be the case, and want to find out, I suggest the demo version, where you, for free, can see if you care about the brand of play and / or laugh. The plot is well written (almost all of it is, in fact), it develops very well and holds well its interest. The audio is great, fresh and well done. The sound effects are perfect. The music is well composed without exceptions. The dubbing is flawless, with a celebrity or two. Armato is fantastic as Guybrush Threepwood (who loves that name), whom you control. Boen is incredible as LeChuck, the late (and still menacing) zombie villain. The designs are immensely well made, highly imaginative and appropriate. Despite the relatively limited disposition of our hero when it comes to pirate actions, you get to get involved in some. Guide a ship, board it in the others and combine the blades in a unique and wonderfully invented way. Re-gameplay mainly lies in choices, during dialogue, etc. This is linear, with a bit of freedom with respect to order, so the buccaneer who sits with it, at least for the second time, does not have that great amount of possibilities, despite being challenged by it, unless that he or she has forgotten what to do in the meantime. Ah, nothing is perfect. Anyone who wants to dig deeper into a fictional, well-crafted and fascinating universe, and breaks down over and over again, should enjoy it. The good guy, not those who hurt and potentially leave bruises. Do not forget, kids, do not * eat books ... that's just beg for a paper cut. I would bet a guess that those who like others appreciate this too. And they are not the only ones who can get into it. I recommend that, in addition to the members of the above mentioned group, any fan of this genre of VGs, as well as anyone to whom this review appeals. 8/10
