This is a movie that everyone living in Sweden should watch. The film shows the political turmoil that occurred in Gothenburg in 2001 from a new perspective. He presents interviews with those who were convicted where these people got the first chance after the riots, to tell their side of the story and why they think the world could be a much better place to live and be a part of. I react emotionally when I see this, since I feel so angry about how these people were treated during the riots, but also after the riots. <br /> <br /> I hope as much as possible can see this movie, how it really makes your mind think: is this possible? In Sweden, a democracy in 2001?
