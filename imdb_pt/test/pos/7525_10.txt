The brilliant Chuck Jones, master of the cartoon comedy of Warner Bros., brings us the first cartoon of Pepe LePew. A street cat, tired of being pushed, paints itself in the colors of a skunk, and with a healthy dose of Limburger turns the tables to his tormentors. Then Pepe and you know the rest.

This 1947 toon is one of the few examples of Mel Blanc putting his absolutely crazy voice in his mouth by Pepe.
