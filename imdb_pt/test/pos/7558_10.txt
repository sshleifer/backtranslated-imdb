A great look at the 60's through the eyes of four friends from their student days in 1960 to the reunion 10 years later - a Yugoslav immigrant passionate about the American dream and struggling to deal with the often violent reality; a prematurely bald undertaker's son; a soldier; and the crazy hippie girl that everyone loves. Good direction and a strong cast do justice to Steve Tesich's brilliant script; the dialogue is not as agile as in Breaking Away, but the issues of growth and parent-child conflict are treated the same, and there are still some wonderfully comical moments between shocks and drama.
