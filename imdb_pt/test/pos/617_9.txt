This is one of the movies that one has to start watching with an open mind. It is known that it will be a mute, one can expect or be afraid of much feeling. <br /> <br /> Well, forget it. The movie begins with a bit of black humor and then begins. From then on, it takes you on an always scary ride through the gloomy centers of Moscow. All right, it must be said: unexpected twists are expected, and the mute is used primarily as a plot tool or fear builder. But this movie does not let you go. <br /> <br /> It's like the old gangster movies, but without any glamor and in Russia. And this is one of the most important aspects of this film: it is situated in Russia. This has a big impact on the film, according to my performance. Everything becomes simple and basic, life is no nonsense. This could be great potential for more movies in the future, gangster movies about the Russian mafia. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful and terrifying movie. It's horror, but you can feel nothing but sympathy for the little dumb. One last tip: do not look for it late at night if you want to sleep well.
