The Stepford Children is Stepford's second best film in the Stepford series. I saw the original The Stepford Wives in the theater when it came out in 1975. I was absolutely blown away, it was fantastic. I saw all the Stepford movies, and I like them all . I think The Stepford Children is such an exaggerated and entertaining film. I just watched it recently on tape, and I enjoyed it immensely. The cast of this movie was really good to watch. Barbara Eden did a good job as usual. Every role she has ever played was very good. Barbara Eden is very good at playing roles where she is kind of kind and caring person. Don Murray as husband and father was just perfect in this film. He was particularly effective at being the angry father to his two teenage sons. I am sure that I have all the Stepford movie on tape to enjoy. If you have the chance to see this movie you should.
