Very good movie about a man and his wife who are caught in murder and the police investigating the case. It starts wonderfully, but kinda hits a wall at a certain point. We are sure we know what happened, so a little plot that seems at first like a red herring appears back and disappoints. Still, Clouzot's direction is great, and the performance is very good. Louis Jouvet, who also co-starred in Drôle de Drame by Marcel Carné, gives the best performance as the smart detective. I wonder if the Coen brothers were influenced by this movie when they wrote Fargo. Much like the movie, the cop does not appear until almost half, and then he becomes almost the focus of the film. There is also a lot of fun comedy around him (though sometimes his methods seem a bit fascist).
