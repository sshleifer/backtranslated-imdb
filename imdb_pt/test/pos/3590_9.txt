I admit to being amazed at the Sea and having spent several years in the Navy, so I'm a little biased about this. I missed this documentary when it came out, but I called several people to buy me a DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Part of the movie is incredible and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, seeing 200 ton Blue Whales 'cruise' across the sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines. I like the level of information and facts conveyed through the narration, it's just right, I do not want to know a lot of science just a few of the basics, to see these things is enough for most people. The BBC has the gift of putting things at the right level for the target audience. <br /> <br /> A really fantastic documentary, up there with 'The World at War for', the DVD is of excellent quality. If I had a minor criticism, it would be one of the obviously added sound effects here and there, I think they hurt some of the scenes. But well done to the BBC and Discovery.
