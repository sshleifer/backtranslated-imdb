especially when looking at the amount of crap that made for the DVD. I found this movie very funny. Rip Torn is classic with his barbs; Rob Schneider, whether it is hilarious and annoying as the overcompensating Ensign; Bruce Dern makes a great "villain". The whole cast seems to be having a blast, and it's not at the expense of the public. If you like comedy just plain fun, and are not looking too deep for meaning, you may fall in love with this.
