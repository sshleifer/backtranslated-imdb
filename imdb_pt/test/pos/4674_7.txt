I went to see this movie with a friend of mine, who does not like assault movies. But she liked it. I missed pieces of the movie throughout the movie. It's a story about Edward Norton and a team stealing some gold, and Norton deciding that he wants everything for himself. Then the people he betrayed want to go back to him. It's a well-assembled, intellegent, funny, action-packed movie that I need to see again ... the whole way. One of my best summer movies so far. <br /> <br /> One great help for the entertainment factor is Seth Green. I do not know anyone who does not like Seth Green, and he adds to the taste. He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his colleague stole it. He is a genius computer that is a wonder to watch. <br /> <br /> They said that Norton did not want to make this movie ... but if I were him, I would have wanted to sign. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that it is very predictable. Any movie will be able to say in its own mind what is happening before it happens. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint about the film is the choice of facial hair by Eddie Norton. The mustache thick but thin, and a small bump on the chin ... he looks like a porn star of the 80's for the love of God.
