I really like the North and South. I think it's one of the best and most expensive TV shows I've ever seen. The caliber of the cast is incredible, you have actors from the "golden age of cinema," people like James Stewart, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons with other actors who were the new faces of the 80s like Patrick Swayze, James Read, Jonathan Frakes, Genie Francis, Philip Casnoff and Lesley-Anne Down. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men, there is Orry Main (Patrick Swayze) who is from the south and George Hazard (James Read) who is from the north. Throughout the series, their friendship is constantly threatened by differences in their origins, particularly in the treatment of slaves in the South (especially in Orry's plantation), but when one needs the other, they forget the arguments and go to help their friend. I really enjoyed the chemistry between the two men and was really interested in seeing if their friendship could survive the war. <br /> <br /> I liked how the series showed how life was before the war so that the public could see what were the factors that led to the war, what was happening at the time, then the devastation of a nation that was being torn apart and then the nation having to rebuild the country again. The war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic for me. <br /> <br /> I think of what is fantastic, has so many elements to go through, romance, history, battles that would interest you most of the time. audience, there is something for everyone. I particularly enjoyed the romance between Brett (Genie Francis) and Billy (Parker Stevenson / John Stockwell), especially when she confronted her sister Ashton for the first time. The other novels were interesting, since they were not all the same, each had something different from the others, which kept me looking particularly at the story of Madeline and Orry to see if they would be together at the end. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best American miniseries I've ever seen, the story had the right balance between romance and the more serious side of the story that was happening in the country at the time, but it's the right rhythm. The characters are very watched and the locations are beautiful and the music particularly at the beginning and end of the episode is so good and works with the mood of the story.
