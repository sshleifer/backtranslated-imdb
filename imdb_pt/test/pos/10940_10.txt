The Twins Effect is a Vampire Martial Arts movie available in Cantonese with English subtitles. It is a production of Jackie Chan and he makes a special appearance, although not for those who liked Shanghai Noon / Knights and the other recent Hollywood movies by which he became known, this film is much more special than that. It was originally called The Vampire Effect, but as a very popular Chinese pop duo called The Twins (Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung) took over the two main roles, the title was changed to profit from their fame. The film will appeal to three types of audience: those who love martial arts movies, those who love vampire movies, and those who dislike Hollywood trash films often get agitated. <br /> <br /> The premise for the movie is that vampires are on and a secret society seeks to hunt them down before they all become snacks for the undead. This bloody work is performed by some martial artists who drink a little vampire blood to give them the advantage they need, well, should be thirsty work! Things are going very well for the course until a particularly nasty European vampire discovers that if he gets a set of keys held by all vampire princes then he can walk in the sunshine etc and generally eat whenever he wants. To say more about the plot would ruin the pleasure of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The twins consist of a designated vampire slayer (Chung) and sister (Choi) of another. It's the twins who really make the movie; with some of the coolest and funny acting. The fight scenes they perform are fast and furious and well choreographed with a mix of genuine athletics and wire work. To add the cherry on the cake, the twins are lovely to watch as well. <br /> <br /> The direction is clear and the script is clear. There are only 3 things that leave this movie aside: makeup for vampires is very poor, Jackie Chan seems to be in the movie just for fun and adds nothing to their content, and some of the comedies comedies by the male vampire hunter is quite lame. Fortunately the twins save the day by bringing originality to the film normally only found in European films. The best scene for me was one of them (Choi) communicating just by screaming, his ability to convey his thoughts through that medium was a comical delight. <br /> <br /> Its many other touches of originality in this movie - I particularly liked the coffin complete with stereo surround sound and TV screen! And it's the many original touches and performances from the movies that keep it from being an old tired flop and turning it into a must-see movie.
