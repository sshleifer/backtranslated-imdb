Some cowboys help a group of Mormons cross a difficult country on the way to a new settlement. This discreet idle is unusual for Ford, as it lacks big stars. Johnson gets the most billing, but his role is basically supportive, though he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do besides providing the love interest. The best performance is given by favorite Ford Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a major role in the long-running Western Wagon Train, before his premature death at age 57. Featuring beautiful cinematography, Ford considered it to be one of his favorite movies.
