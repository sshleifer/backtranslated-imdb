The main criticism of others to this film - namely, that Macy suddenly seems to be Jewish wearing his glasses - is out of place. The glasses are just the small change necessary to CONVINCE others that he is Jewish. The scene in which he tells his boss, (paraphrasing) "but you know what my past is," along with another argument with his mother, suggests that he had to fight against this same assumption in the past. The glasses now make him look just Jewish enough to "confirm" the existing suspicions of his neighbors and co-workers. Then there's the big nose of his new wife and I like noisy clothes, which, COURSE, means she's Jewish. The main point of the film is how these little stereotypes do not become the whole basis for judging others. <br /> <br /> If he has a lisp, he must be gay. If he has long hair, he smokes marijuana. If he is Hispanic, he has a knife ... and if he has round sunglasses and he is small, he must be Jewish. All these statements sound equally (im) plausible to me. If the conclusion to which people were going to Focus was reasonable, the whole purpose of the story would be lost.
