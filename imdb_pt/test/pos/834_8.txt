Well, it's a good movie. However, you have to admit that the Van Dame films have not been so good lately. On the other hand, if you are a hardcore fan of Dam Dame, you should watch this as there is a great improvement in the fight scenes. Also what I really liked is the beautiful song. I'm sure this will kill time if you're an action fan. As for Isaac Florentine, director of Undisputed 2, I do not think he did a good job as he did with Undisputed. I can not wait when Van Dame films one day hit theaters before the DVD. Maybe one day :) <br /> <br /> In the end, it pays to watch if you do not have other action movies to watch, this can make your time and fun.
