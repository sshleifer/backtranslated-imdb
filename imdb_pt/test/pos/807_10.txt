Excellent work all around especially by the actress who played the wife Gerda (Claire Price), as David Suchet. I've really discovered whodunit, but that's irrelevant. The end, which I will not divulge (someone describes it on the board in response to someone else's question if you are interested). I found it very sad. Despite Agatha Christie's reputation for writing cardboard characters, I found them very well rounded. <br /> <br /> The pace of the story was good and I enjoyed seeing Sarah Miles as Lucy and Edward Hardwicke (Cedric's son I believe besides being a known Dr. Watson.)) as her husband.
