My first Ichikawa in many years, and the first of his war movies I've seen, this was thrilling and brutal from the start. In the first scene, the nominal hero Tamura is informed that he can not continue with his unit, to which he returned from the hospital. Does he apparently have tuberculosis? but he is not sick enough for the hospital to take him, given the amount of war wounded they have. But your old unit will not take you back; his CO gives him a grenade, and tells him that if he really feels hopeless about blowing himself up, it's the honorable thing to do. <br /> <br /> The Philippines, 1945, and the situation really seems hopeless, to the PFC Tamura and all others. Nobi is an odyssey through hell, or rather hells? bare forests, dead rocky plains, and Japanese soldiers dying and dying waiting only for an end, through peace or death. Ichikawa's film is photographed in a dazzling B & W scene that serves to highlight both the desolation felt by Tamura and those he finds on his journey to his perdition, as well as to show how truly small and naked they are amid the immensity of mountains and forests? This little matter of humans will end soon, the earth seems to be saying, but I will survive and barely notice. Tamura travels back to the hospital, but is (not surprisingly) rejected there. and spends the rest of the movie trying to stay alive, stay human and get out of danger. He can not do very well on any account, slowly starving and eventually commit some quite repellent acts. Eventually he connects with two other desperate men who have lost or survived their units, and resorted to cannibalism - and in his weakened state facing other armed men, he thinks the only way to live is to break everything he believes. in. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is as brutal, uncompromising and intense as any war movie I have ever seen. There are moments of humor and tenderness, but they are fleeting and not memorable, like the scene with the man at the top of the mountain who practically begs Tamura to eat his flesh - the sudden black comic with Tamura changing his ragged shoes to the best hides of a fallen comrade - the degradations that humans will endure to survive - the truth that this is any war, all wars, all humanity as long as we continue this way. A masterpiece I probably will not watch again for a long, long time. Watched through the beautiful DVD Criterion Collection.
