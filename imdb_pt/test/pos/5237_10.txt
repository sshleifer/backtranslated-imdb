If one ignores the technical problems of this early sound film (1930), such as John Wayne's sound quality and occasional stiffness, he will find that this film is a more realistic epic than any film ever made. Starting in Missouri, a large caravan of Conestoga carts, people, and animals heads west. The wagons are pulled by huge cliffs and cross a flooded river, with considerable risks to the horsemen in the wagons. The Indians meet with Wayne and allow the train to pass through their lands. Later, the Indians gather west of the train to fight them. The carts form an enormous circle with horses and cattle in the circle, and shoot their rifles creating with the Indians circling a veil of smoke. <br /> <br /> When the battle is over, the dead are buried in the place and the people and wagons depart. This scene is remarkable, because the camera stays with the dead when the alive ones depart. It is unique in the way it connects the viewer to the dead and separates the viewer from the living. The wagons encounter a great storm with torrential rains and mud everywhere. They finally arrive at their destination near a sequoia forest or sequoias in Oregon. The film is made in 70mm widescreen at a ratio of approximately 2.0: 1 (in 1930!). <br /> <br /> I did not mention the plot because it is secondary to the scenic grandeur and the huge amount of work. involved in making this film. Filmmakers will never work so hard again to make a film or movie like that. Given the technical limitations of sound, the music sometimes moves, as when Wayne leaves his girl to hunt down the killers of his friends and in the end. <br /> <br /> While all critics praise The Searchers and Wayne's Psychology, racism, short temper and complex characters, The Big Trail gives us a story of simple people facing extraordinary difficulties. One of the best westerns I've seen.
