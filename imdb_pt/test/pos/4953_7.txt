In the 1980s, patriotism, and in some cases jingoism, was very high. "We can win this time" a famous line from Rambo: First Blood part II, could almost sum up how many people felt at that moment. A desire for the style of movies they grew up with, flat balls on the wall "we're good, its bad ... now let's blow something up and go home" While Rambo, Rocky, and most of the time Gun seemed more focused on attracting an older crowd. Iron Eagle went straight to the kids. Canadian writer and director Sidney J. Furie reveals everything you love and hate in that period of time. The kick in the pants rock out 80's hymns (never say die, Road of the Gypsy, etc) to the top, and action adventure sometimes almost unbelievable. Iron Eagle was successful for a reason ... it was FUN - Fun. It's the kind of movie you can turn on and sit back and enjoy every ridiculous moment of the 80's. You do not need to think about whether this would actually happen, or whether acting is really believable, it's just fun ... and that's all you can really ask for in this kind of movie ...
