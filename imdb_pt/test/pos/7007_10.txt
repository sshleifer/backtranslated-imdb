Since the first 10 seconds of Pitch Black I've been hooked. I got into this movie thinking it would be just another ugly science fiction movie. Instead, I found it very amusing, at the edge of his place, I thought of provoking an action movie. The film goes beyond its basic special effects film. The actors are incredible, Radah Mitchell (High Art, Love and others ..) as Fry is really a joy to watch on the screen, while Vin Diesel as Riddeck is so captivating that you're dying just to hear him speak again. <BR> The look of the film is breathtaking, the contrast of blues, yellows and oranges due to the three different suns is incredible. Followed by the total darkness of nightfall. I would really recommend any lover of the films ALIEN or Radha Mitchell (that's why I went to see) to check out this movie. I'm sure in the end you'll look into the dark in a whole new way.
