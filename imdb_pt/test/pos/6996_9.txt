As a fan of science fiction movies, I also like Alien. But Pitch Black is definitely better than Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. It fits well in the Alien series. But it's not alien, it's something else. OK, enough comparisons. This movie, but I think: Why people are afraid of the dark. You can not escape the dark. It's impossible. You have to face the darkness and with that, what is in the dark. In this film I also liked that the character of Vin Diesel, Richard B. Riddick, was not typical of a good boy. He had a secret and did bad things in the past. For other people, he is a hero who tries to save them all. First of all he wants out of that planet. There are also other metaphors in this story. Every big fan of science fiction should see this photo.
