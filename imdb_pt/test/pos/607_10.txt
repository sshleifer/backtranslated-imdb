This film is about the aging of the geisha in the post-war Tokyo. Okin, played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara, lends money to two other former geishas, ​​Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki), and they resent the way she is smug about it. Tamae has a son, Otomi, a daughter, who during the film announces that he leaves them, while Okin, who is never a mother, receives visits from two men in the past who apparently only want money from her. It is a compelling tale about the choices you make, what you do to overcome life, and whom you are responsible for and thank you. Haruko Sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest characters actresses of all countries and she interprets Okin almost all infallible, less than compassionate, with an air of superiority that makes you not like her, but at the same time almost envy. At a time when great films were made by Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinoshita and Kurosawa, among others, Mr. Naruse is up there with him. If you have a free DVD player from the region, you should try to find the two Naruse box sets released in England. I think this movie was a great study of characters from women who are in danger of being irrelevant. That they are not really makes this film a real masterpiece.
