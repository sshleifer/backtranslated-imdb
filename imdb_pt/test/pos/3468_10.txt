I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I first got the trailer, and I'm so happy now that I have it. It really is a wonderful film. The actors are superb, the writing is new and real, the whole thing was just punctual. I love James McAvoy in that, and I can not wait to see him in the movie "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" in December. Romola Garai is wonderful too. Be sure to see it in "I Capture the Castle" or "Nicholas Nickleby," two of my favorite movies. Overall, I think I liked this movie because it did not work out. It is a difficult subject to tell a story, as you are very likely to offend many people or get in the way and turn into a festival of overly sentimental and sweet love. But they avoided doing it completely and instead made a movie that is real, honest and touching, yes, but never exaggerated. Well done. Surprisingly well done. Get out and see, and you'll know exactly what I mean.
