An absorbing exploration of virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended. This movie deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues about which virtual reality layer you are in, postulating an ontological confusion for the viewer to ponder. <br /> <br /> It can also be seen as a satire of video games - the whole movie can fall into the fallacy of imitative form here. He seems incapable of escaping from the video game genre he imitates; Thus, satire becomes problematic. <br /> <br /> Several interesting ideas intersect everywhere: the biological mutant is one; the interface between technology and biology, the cyborg desire to transcend reality - and philosophical allusions as the title to Heidegger, along with existential questions: that is, the characters in the game are partly scripted or determined and still partially free to change their destiny; They wonder how strange this is in the game. A character then remarks that this existential confusion is like real life, thus erasing the distinction between the virtual and the real. Likewise with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble into a world where you do not know what will happen next and you are not sure how to play because you have to stumble only to find out the goal and the unknown rules. A virtual in-game game is titled "Transcendent". Also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence. Even heroes at all levels of ontological existence are confused about violence. They do not like it, but it's exciting and part of the "game" they fear is real. <br /> <br /> The creator of the game, the god of the system, is assassinated in the end; however, this same scenario happens in parallel to a video game we just watched - and viewers believe that it is still only part of the virtual reality. In the end, the movie does not resolve the question of whether or not this is "real", but the point is clear (to me anyway). Existenz means Da-sein: You are there. You are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries on all levels. Ontologically, virtual reality recapitulates reality. And their common motives of play express, as a real road to the unconscious, our own fascination with violence. <br /> <br /> However, while Cronenberg states these philosophical allusions in an interview about the film, he states that he is very much against the "Reality ... {subterranean name of the terrorist group} portrayed in the film both in play and at the 'real' level. " It seems that Cronenberg himself did not think so much about the film, despite his impressive upbringing. The interview in Cineaste gives the impression of a middle-aged intellectual who is trying to be avant-garde by inclination. Cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination - the cliche bourgeois modernist creed - despite the acknowledged ambivalence there. (My impression here may be due to a limited interview.) Still, Cronenburg seems to miss the point of his film betraying the fallacy of the imitative form (here imitating computer games while making a satirical critique of them, but a criticism that is incapable of "transcend" the same way) probably because he really thinks he is "imaginative" and radical. However, the imaginative world of the film is less bearable and more jejunum than our own too real world. He remains trapped in the worldview of computer gaming.
