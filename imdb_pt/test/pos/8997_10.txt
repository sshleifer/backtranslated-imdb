This movie made me a fan of Rugby and Coach Larry Gelwix. The characters of the story slipped and fell before they began to grow as they struggled for incredibly strong conflicts. Those were understandable and completely believable. Like life, there were no easy answers to the problems faced by all of them. Excellent actors and an excellent script have brought this true story to life. I wish there were more movies like this. Nowadays, I watch almost exclusively true stories, because they are much more interesting than fiction. Also, this is inspiring and teaches us not to give up on anyone very quickly.
