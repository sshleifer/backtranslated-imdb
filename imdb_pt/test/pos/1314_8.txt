Paul Schrader and his brother Leonard wrote Mishima and in doing so clearly drew parallels between the life of Yukio Mishima and his work. The film is divided into four sections: beauty, art, action and the fateful day when Mishima held an army hostage and spoke to the garrison, only to ridicule him and his Bushido ideals of the samurai code. Mishima committed seppuku ritual on November 25, 1970 and planned this as an interweaving of beauty, art and action. Schrader edits scenes that recreate that day with three different scenarios from the Mishima novels: Golden Pavilion Temple, Kyoko House and Fleeing Horses. The moment of seppuku is perfectly perceived in relation to its shocking climax, pulling the camera back and at the same time zooming in. <br /> <br /> The black and white sequences blend into the colorful moments described in the Mishima novels. The black and white scenes represent memories of Mishima's childhood and youth. Schrader correlates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from novels that often resemble Mishima's real life, such as his stuttering, developing his bodybuilding obsession, and his promotion of the samurai code. Each of the three themes of beauty, art and action is exemplified in the chosen representations of their respective novels. The color sequences are reminiscent of the first Technicolor films, giving the film perhaps a surreal quality intended for the subject. Ken Ogata interprets the true Mishima with unwavering determination by going into the general's office. on that fateful day and resembles the true Mishima. Schrader took tremendous risks with this film by focusing on his novels and thematically linking them to Mishima's personal life and his literary ambitions. The film's editing between the three main sections of November 25, 1970, the black and white growth segments and the colorful scenes of the novel clearly point to the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty, art and action in the life of Mishima. Sometimes it is difficult to follow, and there may be little to recommend to the uninitiated viewer. *** of 4 stars.
