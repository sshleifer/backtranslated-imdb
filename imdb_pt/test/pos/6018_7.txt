"Gypsy" is possibly the greatest musical ever written, so it's a pity that the film version was a disappointment. To compensate for this, we have this re-make that, if not flawless, is a nice, well-made adaptation of the musical. The script is completely accurate, all songs included, and the staging remains close to the original Jerome Robbins scenario. Bette Midler is a skilful choice for Rose, her singing and personality Merman-esquire, and her splendid performance. Peter Reigert is a good Herby, if not a great singer, and Cynthia Gibb is a simple and natural Louise. In fact, a live recording of the 1989 revival with Tyne Daly may have been a better idea, even though "Gypsy" is simply more exciting on stage, but this movie is a good translation of a great musical.
