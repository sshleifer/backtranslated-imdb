I watched this movie in a theater in Singapore yesterday (February 4, 2006) and came out with a better understanding of what patients with schizophrenia and their loved ones go through. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Aparna Sen should be congratulated not only for this. take on a difficult subject but also treat the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of your situation that is needed to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turbulences that rage in their minds. <br /> We had Hollywood movies on this subject, like "One Flew Over the Nest" where Jack Nicholson took the honors. Since then, the research has helped to provide more information about the problem and to clarify some misconceptions about treatment. In "cuckoo's nest", for example, shock therapy has been portrayed as barbaric, but in "15 ..." the point is that it is not as bad as it was made. <BR> Another misconception is that childhood abuse is a cause for schizophrenia. But scholars such as Dr. E. Fuller Torrey have emphasized that studies have shown that childhood schizophrenia is a brain disease and is believed to have some genetic roots. <br /> <br /> It is now established that schizophrenia can be treated as any clinical disease and its advancement can be verified if detected early. Even at fairly advanced stages, regular medication and counseling can be effective. <br /> <br /> The same understanding Sen shows is evident in the way actors perform their functions. According to the seriousness of the theme, the acting is controlled with silences and evocative eyes of Mrs. Konkana Sen-Sharma mirroring the impotent confusion of a disturbed mind speaking louder than some of the complaints we are accustomed to in most of the films that have included mentally challenged characters. Like me, most of the audience in the theater seemed confused by the abrupt end. It leaves many questions hanging in terms of the plot. <br /> <br /> Did Meethi's search end? Why is it not found in # 15? Were the children really joking when Meethi walked past the gates with eyes shining with recognition? Can someone solve this puzzle?
