007 Goldeneye is one of the best releases of the N64 of all time. <br /> <br /> Better than this game? Well ... Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Episode I-Racer and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time are much better and superior games. But I still love Goldeneye. <br /> <br /> This is the best adaptation of a losing movie just for the adaptations of Star Wars. The story is perfect. It's like you're in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> The graphics are excellent. The movements are extremely realistic. Artificial Intelligence of enemies is the best part in this game. I loved playing on the stage where James and Natalya separate from Janus's base while Goldeneye prepares to burn him. Running away without sounding an alarm was very difficult. Praising cameras and controlling your fire are great aspects in the game. <br /> <br /> It's also the hardest game I've ever played. N64 games are usually very, very easy. Goldeneye is the only exception. I'm still trying to beat the difficulty level of 00 Agent, but to beat the easier levels has already been a great victory. I loved it when Alec Trevelyan asked, "To England James?" I replied, "No, for me!" It happened the moment I blew it to death. Just like in the movie. I love accomplishing all the goals. <br /> <br /> The multiplayer game is even better. At first I was killed with every sacred second. Now I know how to win. I love forcing my teammates by playing License to Kill. <br /> <br /> The music and the sound are amazing. Super Mario 64 looks like an Atari next to it. The only thing I still wanted to hear was Goldeneye's theme song, which plays at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> After the release of Zelda, I almost forgot that I still had this game. Still excellent, even if it's over. I hope other 007 games are produced. <br /> <br /> Fantastic work Rareware! Nintendo was very clever to launch this game exclusively on the N64. Great work from Nintendo!
