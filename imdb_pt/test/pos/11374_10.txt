Boogie Nights follows a theme that is extremely familiar to gangster movies (though it does not fit into this genre itself) - the rise and fall. We see the ascension of several individuals, some of them from complete obscurity, to reach great heights ... and then fall from grace because of their excesses. <br /> <br /> I believe this is the first characteristic of the writer. / director Paul Thomas Anderson, and it's a great start! I've seen elements of influences from other directors, such as Robert Altman, but the film retains its originality and plot development. <br /> <br /> The development of characters is the best feature of the film. I really identified with all the characters and felt their pain and their success with them. All performances were brilliant. (It was especially nice to see a small part of the real-life veteran, Nina Hartley). <br /> <br /> Basically, this film combines comedy and tragedy, being the result one of the best films of 1997, was despised at the Oscars (probably due to the "daring" subject - as they say) and the general conservatism of Academy.
