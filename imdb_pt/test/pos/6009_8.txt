We all know bits of Gulliver's travels. Tiny people, yes, of course. Giant Liliputians too, some of us may remember. Some may remember the word yahoo comes from here. This is for most people. <br /> <br /> Swift's book is ubiquitous in school libraries. That was when I first read it and there were a lot of people who read it last. It is treacherously written, like many of the old adventure books. Children can read it. Still, he is dripping with satire, black and uncompromising. This is something I think most writers forget when they adapt this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie recalls, though. Our hero, Ted Danson, gives a credible and serious performance as the man adjusted to the world that is played in mysterious countries so similar to ours. Gulliver's travels criticize everything. Theists, scientists, government, common people, ethnicity, humanity itself. Few are spared, and most of the satire is so fresh today. <br /> <br /> Although very faithful to the story, the film also dares to add new angles, everything works very well. The writer deserves all the credit for having managed to balance so well between time and activity (not boring, of course). <br /> <br /> The values ​​of production are far beyond a TV movie. With some marketing this movie would have gone well at the box office. All the fantastic worlds that Gulliver visits are well made, explained in detail and often very funny, much like Swift's book. <br /> <br /> The actors are all professionals, since this is a British production. Mary Steenburgen stands out, along with Dr. Bates, of James Fox, the frighteningly cruel doctor who, like the nurse Ratched, only wants the best for the patient. <br /> <br /> So, a modest proposition, if you get the chance to get this movie, do it. It is a real treat.
