* Need some further proof that Tsai Ming-liang ranks among the most original and provocative filmmakers working anywhere today? Watch this movie. Working from small variations of a theme that goes through most of his work, THE HOLE represents a study of alienation and loneliness - in this case between a man and a woman who are upstairs / downstairs. - and how various (real or psychological) structures of modernity push people away from one another. Here, the woman (the downstairs neighbor) tries to resist while her apartment is flooded by a prodigious leak from upstairs. A plumber tries to locate the source of the problem and disappears after creating a large hole in the ground. Already isolated and desperate (both characters are among the few residents of a housing project that did not flee before a mysterious and almost apocalyptic epidemic). The hole connecting the two apartments works first as another in a long line of indignities, but soon begins to assume a meaning of almost mythical proportions. Tsai's sense of humor and sense of cinematic history. is displayed with a little more openings than usual - as the woman's occasional daydreams around her upstairs neighbor are visualized as musical numbers (set in the music of Grace Chang) that explode from the screen in brief moments of romance and sensual and surrealistic humor reminiscent of the large screen PENNIES FROM HEAVEN. And, despite all the boredom and alienation exposed here, Tsai's boredom over the pre-millennial tensions of the late 1990s is funny, absurd and gives this film a dizzying appeal. The final scene is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tsai - typically - subverts most of the expectations or prejudices that Westerners bring to Asian cinema with a casual, casually revealed frankness, focusing on both the absurd tendencies of Asian cinema. the human mind and the most absolute of worldliness. There is a complete and indifferent demystification of almost everything about his characters, bypassing the background story or most of the cultural signifiers (which amplifies the isolation of the characters), making THE HOLE - and his other films - rather disorienting but always fascinating and insightful.
