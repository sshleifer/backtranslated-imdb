There is a lot wrong with this movie. I'm not going to lie. I will say that most of the problems seem to have originated from a budget that was cut underneath the film, and a poorly made edit of a work. <br /> <br /> This is not Office Space. Do not expect Office Space comedy levels. It's very funny though. It's a mess, but very funny at the same time. A funny mess of a movie. The way Caddyshack is funny. A mess of unrelated funny scenes, full of very unpleasant scenes. <br /> <br /> It works as a whole, and certainly deserves a great release. This is the best comment about the nation's Wal Mart / Starbucks / MTV that you would expect. The very fact that a movie is exploring the idea that dumb people are breeding at an alarming rate, while smart people are not, is great in my book. It's not very politically correct, but it's worth at least some debate.
