This is not a movie to impress you with high-tech photos, high-tech, fast camera moves or flamboyant costumes thought by an overzealous and hungry director. But it's a movie from a director who is also a great photographer, who has a good sense of seeing things as a human, not as a half-god unlike most directors. This is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best 'performances' with unrealistic or, at best, gestures and imitations learned. On the contrary, it is a movie in which they act as real as possible. In fact, they are not professional actors. The dialogues between the main characters, their expressions, their feelings are as real as they can easily be yours in real life. You tell the same lies to the people around you with the same regrets you avoid expressing in words. You show the same signs of annoyance to an unwelcome guest. This is the same sense of disconnect you get in modern city life. And this is your chance to see yourself from the outside, represented by the main characters. I've seen all of Nuri Bilge Ceylan's films, incl. her short Koza (Cacoon) thanks to who puts it on the DVD. Many would compare him to Tarkovsky, Ozu and perhaps Bresson or Bergman, while he is emerging as a true author. And he is sincere in saying that his films are not to make money, but to make sense of your life. That's the kind of sincerity you'll find in Uzak.
