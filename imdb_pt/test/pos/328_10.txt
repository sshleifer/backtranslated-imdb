Kannathil Muthamittal is certainly a great movie. I have to give Mani Ratnam a great job of directing and A.R. Rahman for great songs. The camera work is simply excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I'll be shocked if this movie does not win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or even Best Work of Camera.
