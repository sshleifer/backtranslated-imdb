With all the shoot em up, blood horror movies that came our way in the last little while "Saw, Hostal, Saw 2, The Hills Have Eyes" Yes, they have their place, do not get me wrong! I went to see "When a stranger calls" with my friend the other night! Because? Because it's a remake of the 1979 classic, which was excellent at the time and scared the you know what out of everyone! I did not know what to expect. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It was a movie made of humor, atmosphere, suspense! Because remember people, what you can not see, what you think you see, what you can not hear, or what you think you hear, is much more scary than you do! If you love movies with humor, creepiness, suspense and atmosphere !! You will love! Brought back to the original Halloween roots. Thumbs up, a solid 8.5 out of 10 Remember personal, it's well done! imperfect! It's scary, not bloody, it's scary, not bloody! It was good to see a movie come a time like this. Our minds have been conditioned and deformed by the brilliance and shock value of modern horror films, we forget what is really scary.
