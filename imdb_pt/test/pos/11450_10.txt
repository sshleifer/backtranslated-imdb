I neglected this movie when I used to go to the movie store, but then the curiosity came to me and I decided to take a look. I loved!!! The film begins with Judy and Jay going to a Halloween party at the abandoned funeral home Hull House. Then we found a few more characters, Angela and Suzzanne (the hosts), Frannie, Max, Rodger, Sal and Helen. So of course they start the party and when they are really in the mood they decide to have a session that awakens a demon. The demon possesses Angela and she begins her horrible slaughter. Will they survive the Night of the Demons? <br /> <br /> The movie was great. The blood was fine, but the nudity provided by Linnea Quigley (Trash from ROTLD) once again spoils everything. I've never been a fan of her and never will be.
