I just saw this movie at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, AL, which was a really fun festival, and I was impressed by it. It was the best movie I've seen all day. A school-aged prostitute meets a middle-aged man and tries to end the deep depression together. It is an interior look at the darker parts of human sexuality. The story stems from real-life occurrences, plucked straight from the headlines. Gross and forceful dialogue and a murderous twist in the end. The film contains graphic sexual dialogue and nudity. Definitely not suitable for children. Too depressing for some people to like. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion though.
