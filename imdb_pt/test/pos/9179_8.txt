I really liked this comedy. Will Smith does not do anything slow. He is always on target with the best scripts and comedies that keep him laughing and involved in the plot. You're watching a skilled comedian, who interprets well all his parts. It is fully believed that he is who he is playing. I loved him and Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black. This comedy accompanies this movie. The mood is moving fast, and Will Smith is as sure of himself as he was in Men in Black. Curious, and very skilled in the art of making others punctuate each time, but doing it in an elegant and delicate way. <br /> <br /> Will Smith seems to have perfected his comedy routine well. He was so funny. I loved the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he ate, and his face swelled, and he looked more like Cassius Clay after a fight, so he did it himself. Then watching him sipping on the bottle of benadryl trying to bring his head back to the right size. I laughed so hard. He knows how to make us laugh.
