Darr, although it's a copy of some Hollywood movie, is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Not only is it beautifully portrayed, but it also has great music and beautiful scenery. Shahrukh is your usual self. Your expressions and voice match your character. I was pleasantly surprised by the picture of Sunny Deol in the film. He's a bit romantic and lovable in the movie, unlike his other characters in his other films. Sometimes you feel that justice has not been made for your character. Sunny was meant to be portrayed as the good guy in the movie, but ends up looking like the villain in the end. Juhi Chawla is beautiful and bubbly. She is your usual self. In short, a great love story with passion.
