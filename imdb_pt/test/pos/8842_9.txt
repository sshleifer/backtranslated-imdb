"The Thing" is John Carpenter's best film. By uniting his talents to build tension and clashes with decent production values, he created a perfectly crafted horror / science fiction film. <br /> <br /> Filming in truly difficult conditions, it creates a very reliable stand-alone research foundation that sets the tension. before anything has happened. The set cast work well together with Kurt Russell proving a charismatic leader man, even under all that beard. <br /> <br /> Building tension slowly with moments of bloody horror (courtesy of meister Rob Bottin's effects - currently directing Freddy vs. Jason) Carpenter creates a film that has rarely been matched. Considering this came out the same year as ET, it could not be more different! <br /> <br /> Worth a watch / re-watch. 9 out of 10. <br /> The DVD is excellent. Lots of extras plus the best DVD reviews going (with Carpenter & Russell). In addition, remixed into Dolby Digital for even more scary sound effects.
