If you liked the TV series, Diagnosis Murder, you'll love Murder 101. It's great to see Dick Van Dyke in a murder mystery again. If we're lucky, this will be the beginning of a TV series or at least a series of movies. <br /> <br /> This movie definitely had some great and notable actors filling the roles. But it did not look like a "face" movie. It was really a story that drew you to make you forget the fame of those on the screen. <br /> <br /> I guessed the ending and was pleasantly surprised at the end I had to watch. this again! This is a must see for any mystery fan or Dick Van Dyke lover!
