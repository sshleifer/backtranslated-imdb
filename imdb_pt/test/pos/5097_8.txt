"Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is a superbly written and photographed musical version of the classic 1939 film. In addition to the discreet and beautifully controlled performance of Peter O'Toole as the pedantic teacher who finds love and is transformed by it, the film contains hundreds of dazzling visuals, from the Greek ruins to the side streets of London and an extended montage in the countryside. The music and lyrics of Leslie Bricusse have been criticized for being dull or non-alike for movie musicals, but are used to improve the story rather than narrating it. Many songs are used to underline montages or scenes; the few who are not relegated to "show biz" numbers. In this way, the songs do not intrude on this delicate story, but increase what the characters are thinking or feeling. "Where did my childhood go?" "Walk the world with me" and "You and I" are especially effective. An absorbing film, brilliantly represented, directed and written.
