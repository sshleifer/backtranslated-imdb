This has to be the best movie of all time (in my opinion). This really taught me when I watched when I was 10 (in 2000) that the freedom to be a child was gone earlier than we expected. Also Joseph Mazzello has to be my favorite actor, and I think he and Elijah did a great job on the roles of the brothers. This movie is very sad, and some people do not understand the ending. But the story itself is pretty incredible, the thought of a poor 7-year-old boy (bobby) being abused by a drunken stepfather is awful, and what the two boys do about it is sad and important. My favorite part of the movie is when Tom Hanks (Old Mike) lists the 7 things about being a child that is lost to the adult world. However, there are some parts that could have been made better in this film, such as the casting of the mother (lorena braco), which I think is a horrible actor. "the king" played his role well, since it is a difficult role to play. Jose and Elias were definitely the stars of the movie. I could not believe how well they played victims of an abusing stepfather, being the age they were (7 and 9). But overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves great kids actors and a great movie. :)
