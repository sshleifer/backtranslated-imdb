As in the last ten years, or even more, the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (actually, very few deserve this title because they are so predictable), King of Queens is a very original, unique and incredibly fun alternation. It is about the daily life of a delivery man and his wife who works as an assistant to a lawyer in Manhattan, Queens, NY. With them lives the father of Carrie, Arthur, an extrovert of the book of images, that is interpreted by the fantastic Jerry Stiller and that steals the show of all the others whenever he appears. Other important people are his best friends Deacon and Kelly, a couple and their other friend Spence, who is almost 30 years old and still lives with his mother. What makes this program so unique and fun is, above all, that each character seems so real and Carrie's cynical and sarcastic attitude is the opposite of Doug's slightly stupid and stupid nature optimism. And Arthur is the one that makes him absolutely unpredictable. their strange ideas and habits. He often gets into trouble and Doug and Carrie have to drag him out of the mud. Even though, in my opinion, the quality of the show has dropped somewhat in recent years, it's still one of the best daily sitcoms of all time. It takes a little time to get into the characters and relate to them, but after that, you get some uncontrollable laughter. Although I do not think I could survive a day with Arthur in an enclosed room without hitting him, I really love him in this show. Watch and have fun, I give 9 out of 10.
