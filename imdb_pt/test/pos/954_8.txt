Ghillie, a Telugu remake of "okkadu", is fortunately an enlightened version of the original. It has the same impact and Dharani true to its cinematic brilliance the delivery with style and style. Vijay's career with the entry of names like Surya and Vikram into the fray has garnered much-needed improvement with this film. This may very well be the best film Vijay ever made considering the choices he has made since then. worker seems to have lost his way with talented new talents being accepted by both industry and the public. The well-adjusted, spinning script, a speed-breaking neck revolves around Velu, a willing young woman aspiring to make a mark on the Kabaddi game (a game popular with boys in India) The events that followed the casual encounter with Muthupandi, his rescue of the girl in danger and how he reconciles the aspirations of his friends and his own, form the fulcrum and the end of the game. movie. Vijay fits like a 'T' on paper and rehearses a submissive and credible picture of the boy next door. <br /> Trisha has more than a stereotyped Tamil heroine's mantle to play. The role is much more complex than just a girl in trouble. With limited dialogue, Trisha explores her occasional expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the paper. This is a classic case of a hooded girl to become a professional actress. Trisha became my favorite after this movie. <br /> <br /> The film ends in predictable lines, though credit should be given to the director for keeping the audience guessing at many things, including Trisha's move to leave. Prakash Raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect balance for Vijay's role. His almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent cracks in the hero's armor form a perfect maneuver to keep the public guessing. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great movie that deserves at least a single view. I give a clear 8 out of 10.
