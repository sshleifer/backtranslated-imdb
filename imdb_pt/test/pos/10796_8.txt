*** SPOILERS *** For some strange reason, Oliver Stone's "Talk Radio" based on Stephen Singular's book "Talked to Death" and movie star Eric Bogosian's play about the 1984 murder of the talk show host of Denver Alan Berg, I never received the recognition that this deservedly deserved. The 1988 film was prophetic enough to recognize the subterranean movement that was developing on the farm and in the interior of America. A movement that sparked, about seven years later, an angry and disgruntled Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh, who hates US government actions in Wacco Texas, got his friend Terry Nichols to detonate the US Federal Building in Oklahoma City. on April 19, 1995, which took the lives of 168 people, the worst terrorist act on American soil until that time. The film is, as far as I know, the first time any major branch of entertainment media mentioned and elaborated on the rural militia novel "The Turner Diaries" by the late William L. Pierce, who since then became a chilling underground clandestine. "The Turner Diaries" predicted a national and utterly disastrous terrorist attack, such as the bombing in Oklahoma City at a federal facility of the US government that was the FBI's building in Washington DC. Dallas radio KGAB talk show host Barry Champlain, Eric Bogosian, is the most voted program in the Dallas listening area and is poised to become national. Barry has his high rating for his sharp wit and abusive behavior when he's on the air. Taking all the chants and not dodging any problem, no matter how unpopular or taboo they are, made Barry the most heard, just as he hated the man on the radio. Barry being a showman at heart and not thinking that his conversation can lead to violence keeps his aggressiveness to his listeners while his rating goes up to the celling. But there are those in the public listener, especially the ultra rightists, who do not very gently accept their attitude of face. One of them decides to put the matter in hand at Barry's expense. Powerhouse performance by Eric Bogosian as the tragic Barry Champlain who crossed the line of entertainment into harsh reality in his actions on the radio. Thinking that he is not so important to be sought and murdered for his opinions that enemies do not like, he has discovered too late that there are people out there who are crazy enough to do with him from the outside. Also in the movie "Talk Radio" is a young Alic Baldwin as head Dan of Barry who tries to make him soften his tone but in the end goes along with his talk show style as he is killing the competition not realizing that in the end it is he who will eventually be killed. Ellen Green and Leslie Hope are the two women in the life of Barry, his ex-wife, Ellen, and now talk show producer Laura, whom Barry uses in his favor and almost ends up losing the two at the same time. The 1988 Talk Radio is so far ahead of time that even though you see it now in 2005, you still find it very disturbing to be shown to a sensitive and delicate American audience.
