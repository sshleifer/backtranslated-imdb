This film takes a very deep view of the relationships between a mother who grew up in a Christian environment and learned that appearance is everything. She and her son, who have just returned from Vietnam, collide on very tense issues. The relationship has no connections intimately and is a great accurate portrayal of what it's like to live with someone who is fake and just looks at the surface of problems. Kathy Bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is oblivious to her cruelty, forgotten or simply does not want to be confronted. Jeremy's wrath is never feared and this leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his father's love for him. This is a very honest view of some family dynamics after a traumatic event leads to despair.
