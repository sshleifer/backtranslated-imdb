I watched this movie at the NFT in London, where it was appearing as part of John Huston's BFI season. I was not sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the movie gave very little. In fact, the rest of the film continued to give little! No real plot, no action, no suspense, very little drama, and except for a short section at the end, no scenario. <br /> <br /> The result of the lack of all these features was, however, a wonderful film. I do not completely understand why, but I think his discreet nature made the film almost perfect. The acting, screenplay and, most important of all, the cast were all in place and I do not remember leaving the movies feeling so good, but I still can not figure out why. I just know that I'm going to be getting the DVD (this is one of those movies that I'm sure will be as good on the small screen as the movie experience as long as you can find a quiet place to watch it!) And I'm going be watching again soon. I will also be interested to find out what my family and friends think of it. I am sure it will not be everyone's choice, but I am convinced that a large number will agree with my opinion. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
