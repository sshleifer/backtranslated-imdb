I just sat down again in this movie and can only imagine if we will see more films like this? The timeless music, the tender voices of William Holden and Jennifer Jones leave this grown man crying in romantic and cheerful scenes and I'm not the one who cries so often in life. Where has our William Holden gone and will they make such wonderful and exciting films? It's sad to have to realize that they probably will not, but do not think about it, just try to block it from your mind. Even so, they will not have Holden in it and it will not appear on that hill again as well. You can only enjoy this movie and watch it again.
