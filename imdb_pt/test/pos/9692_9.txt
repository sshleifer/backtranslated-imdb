First of all I want to say that most people who give poor review do not like this kind of comedy, the movie is great if you have an open mind and are not afraid to laugh at some stupid things. > <br /> This movie is filmed as the TV show with many short clips compiled into a long movie. Some of the scenes do not even have dialogue someone will come out and do something unexpected and it's funny !! The only negative I had is that I felt like I had lost money with my popcorn and Icee, there was no way I could eat or drink anything during this movie I was constantly laughing. I was honestly nervous about drinking some Icee and seeing something that made me laugh and shoot everywhere. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind male nudity, and you enjoy the Jackass movie, the TV show and live it bam, then, for your SAKE, go see this movie. <br /> <br /> And if you do NOT like the first movie, or the TV show. Do not see it, and if you do see it, do not post negative criticism about it. Unconditional Christians who see it and strike it do not seem right to me.
