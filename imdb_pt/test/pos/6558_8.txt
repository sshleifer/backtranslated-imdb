Anyone who likes the quirky Lynchian of Twin Peaks, or any fan of HP Lovecraft who knows that the scariest things are the familiar stuff, will really enjoy this movie. Do not watch it as a horror movie in the "traditional" Western sense, but more like a Grimm fairy tale. It's bloody and definitely for over 16 years, but once you start watching it, you'll also be drawn to the vortex. Definitely one of those movies that stays with you for a few days after watching (I'll never look at my snails the same way again!)
