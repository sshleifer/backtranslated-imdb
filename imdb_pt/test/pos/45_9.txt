Just a great soundtrack. Really nice music. Excellent cast, great lead performance. It's worth watching. <br /> <br /> It does not really explain what happened to the neighborhood. You get the feeling that it's the fault of the integration or that, with the exit of the main character, the neighborhood has disintegrated. <br /> <br /> This movie looks well researched and extremely well crafted. I especially liked some of the smaller characters like Jeffrey Wright. <br /> <br /> The cut during the opening sequence helps to express that lively, engaging and desirable experience that the nightclub would have been with jumping music, food, drink, dance, gambling and sex.
