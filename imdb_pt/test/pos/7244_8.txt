As always, Joan Hickson is wonderful as Jane M. Sutil, sharp and conscious. I do not want to dwell on their acting skills because they are praised enough on this site. I'd like to criticize some of the smaller parts, since the rest of the cast seemed to be handpicked by director David Tucker. <br /> <br /> The performance of Liz Fraser as Mrs. Bent (the mother of the missing daughter Nora) It is a joy to watch. Subtly and profoundly moving as the alcohol-dependent bereaved mother who loves and misses her daughter desperately. A good picture of your monologue (thank you Tucker!) So that it can be enjoyed to the fullest. I moved when I first saw it when it was broadcast and I moved again, now I have it on DVD. Brava. <br /> <br /> Joanna Hole as Madge, the tour guide I find very entertaining. She is on the verge of over-action, but her role can have it. She's as funny as the super-organized guide who wants to do good with everyone on that bus, I think she's hilarious. Her reaction after she got on the bus is all great ... As always: to do comedy you have to take this very seriously, and that's what Miss. Hole does. <br /> <br /> I hope these two ladies have good careers (as I live in the Netherlands I do not know if they have, not all theatrical productions can be googled ...) -your screen performances deserve this . <br /> Pieter
