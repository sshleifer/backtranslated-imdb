I love the TV show. I hate to see it stop. There are so many talented competitors. It's a shame that only 2 are chosen. I love watching the judges too. Sometimes they are just as much fun as the competitors. I've watched the show faithfully every Sunday night. He would not miss the world. It's the best reality show that's ever been on television. Good luck to all of the contestants, although I've already chosen the two that I'd like to see play Danny and Sandy on Broadway. I look forward to seeing if my decisions are correct. I'm not aware of how long the contest will continue until a Danny and Sandy are chosen, but I'll keep watching until the end.
