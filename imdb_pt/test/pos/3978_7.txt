A great movie. The film was even better than the commercials. And believe it or not, it was very inspiring. I really think anyone who leaves the movie at the end will be inspired in one way or another. <br /> <br /> It was kind of tacky at first, but quickly bounced back. I laughed. I laughed a lot in parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better than average. I can safely say that it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (the funniest being the CLERKS II). So, after all this, I give 7/10 (a high seven, but not an eight).
