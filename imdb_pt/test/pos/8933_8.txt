I've been wanting to see this movie for a long time. I just bought it on E-Bay since it's so hard to find the state side. But the wait was ... a little worth it. <br /> <br /> I can not say the movie was great. And I can not say the movie was hilarious. But it was good and has some very funny points. What aside the shots in this movie are simply beautiful. And the whole cast, especially Brenda Blethyn (someone I had not seen before, sadly), was excellent. <br /> <br /> In the end it's a very good romantic comedy and I recommend you check it out unless you've just had a death in the family. <br /> <br /> If anything, the last chapter is worth it. >.
