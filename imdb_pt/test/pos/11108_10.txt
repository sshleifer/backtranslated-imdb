I really fell in love with the characters. They were very down to earth, but each of them had a dark side hidden. More or less a mystery. David Graysmark, himself, was an enigma. The secret fears and only secrets in general he had. There was a whole side of him that the other characters did not know and left the audience wanting to know or take over. There was always a part of this man that he would keep hidden, but he would also share a little of himself. He was the strong main male character and I admire this type of character. Billy Moses himself is an incredible actor who could do almost any kind of piece! He is an incredible talent and a good man. His fans love, respect and support him non-stop. <br /> <br /> Since this show, he has participated in many other projects and expanded his acting ability a little more and very well. Lots of compliments to him and all the other actors in this show for doing a great job! I wish you well. I wanted the series to continue! Too bad not!
