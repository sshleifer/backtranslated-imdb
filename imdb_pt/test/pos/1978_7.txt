Now being a fan of science fiction, the trailer for this movie seemed a little too much, as I put it, hollywood. But after watching it I can say with pleasure that it impressed me a lot. Jude is a class actor and misses Leigh does it better than she did in Delores Clairborne. It brings movies like The Matrix, 12 Monkeys and The Cell in mind, which may not look so appealing, but it really is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
