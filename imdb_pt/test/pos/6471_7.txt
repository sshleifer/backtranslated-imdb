Alex North (John Cassavetes) has problems in his relationship with his father and flees home to join the army, from where he soon deserts and arrives in New York with the intention of starting a new life, taking advantage of the fact that no one knows about your past. He finds a job at Waterfront, where he meets Tommy Tyler (Sydney Poitier), a young and lively man who is well-married and is a stark contrast to the sad and unfortunate character of Cassavetes. They quickly become good friends and Tommy does his best to help his friend. The only problem is that his superior at work, a hard worker, Charles Malik (Jack Warden), is envious of his friendship as well as Tommy's constant and happy disposition and success in personal life. He really manages to make his life difficult when he comes to know the truth about Alex's past. <br /> <br /> A good drama expertly directed by Oscar-nominated director and producer Martin Ritt (The Hud) and with marvelous performances by Sydney Poitier and Jack Warden. 7/10
