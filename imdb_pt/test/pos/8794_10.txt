This movie is too good for words. It's so incredibly big and funny and true to life. You just know to see that the person who wrote this, DEFIANTLY, felt the way Jip and his friends do through the movie. It was my life at one point and I trusted to come home to watch Human Traffic one night before I could think of going to bed. I think you get so loved with the characters and your lifestyle. Of course this movie would not be for older people between the ages of 16 and 22, I think. There is nothing wrong with this movie, and you will get points at all times. There is no particular plot for this. The general idea is a weekend in the life of older teenagers in London and what they do. The places they go, the people they know, the drugs they take and the experiences they have. You have to get this movie on DVD, do not mind watching it, you have to have it !!!
