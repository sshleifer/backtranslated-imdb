From director Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, The Seven Year Itch, Some Like It Hot), I can see that this is an under-shown and underrated film, one to be seen. This is the biographical story of Charles Augustus "Slim" Lindbergh (James Stewart), who in 1927 wanted to be the first man to cross the solo flight from New York, crossing the Atlantic Ocean, to reach Paris, in a small cabin. The first half hour or whatever Lindbergh is being given permission to do, and the construction of the plane, called "The Spirit of St. Louis," and making all the necessary preparations. Then, of course, the rest see their dangerous journey through the journey, overcoming fatigue, loss of fuel and moments of loss of sense of direction, but he succeeded. Also starring Murray Hamilton as Bud Gurney, Patricia Smith as Mirror Girl, Bartlett Robinson as Benjamin Frank Mahoney, Robert Cornthwaite as Harry Knight, Sheila Bond as Model / Dancer, Marc Connelly as Father Hussman, Arthur Space as Donald Hall, Harlan Warde as Boedecker and Dabbs Greer as Goldsborough. Apparently, Lindbergh was a little younger, so Stewart was a little too old to play him, but then again, you can not think of anyone else who could do better. It's a witty and emotional drama, with Stewart (as always) being fantastic, great soundtrack of Frank Waxman, and good direction of Wilder, a little known gem. It was named the Oscar of Best Special Effects (the only prize that has already been indicated). James Stewart was number 12 in The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 3 in 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 13 in The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!
