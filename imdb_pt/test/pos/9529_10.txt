I have watched this movie countless times, and have never failed to delight in its home-made simplicity, sincerity and kindness. Great characterizations throughout the cast, and the lovely steam trains that play such a supportive role. I confess that I fell in love with Roberta in 1970, and she still plays me today. Shown on TV in New Zealand on Christmas Day, the best gift I could have had.
