that a refreshing change from the PG films that have teenage girls in and out of bed, high school kids counting on how many girls they can hook up with, kids drinking, using drugs, etc., etc., etc. Hiaasen wrote so many books that are enjoyable, but hardly the classical literature. but he finally wrote something that high school kids want to read. And this movie sends a message to children that maybe they can make a difference, that maybe their voices can be heard. Filmed in South Florida, the scenery is beautiful, natural and REAL. Who cares if it's predictable and a little tacky? Then it was FREE WILLY and see how it happened. This is a good family movie .......... a rare breed.
