Lovers of the original movie can really love this show if they simply stop complaining all the time. The Emperor's New School brings some old jokes from the movie, like pulling the lever to Yzma's lab and Kuzco stopping the episode. But since it's a children's show, it's just classic and it's in the right places. Even though the style is so much simpler, the animation and characters keep their personalities very well and this really surprised me. Eartha Kitt does excellent dubbing for Yzma and J.P. Manoux does a wonderful job for Kuzco's voice, instead of David Spade, who played Kuzco in the film. Great plots, hilarious moments and the incredible looks of Kuzco make this show worth watching. (Just stop complaining about everything!)
