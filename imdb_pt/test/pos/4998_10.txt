I should have seen a different version of the first person in the user comments section. <br /> <br /> It's very, very good ... Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are great together. Val Kilmer's character is very similar to him in the novel, although the emphasis is on Gus and Call and the Comanches. We can also see what happened to Call and Newt's mother. I'm not going to ruin everything, but it gives a good idea of ​​Call's character. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a really convincing job. Steve Zahn had the biggest challenge, I thought, to follow Robert Duvall! There is a lot of action, humor, tragedy. There is something for everyone. I can not wait until it is aired, my family is jealous I have to see this early!
