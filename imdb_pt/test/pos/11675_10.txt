<br /> <br /> First, I reviewed this documentary because I was interested in the subject he portrayed, the LA punks. I listened to this song and I loved this song and I read many of the little zines that were made in the early 80's and that were not so easily achieved in Finland. <br /> <br /> So if you do not like this kind of music, why do you write about it? I like this kind of music, it speaks to my soul, so I know punks from all over Europe and the Americas, so why do you guys, who find this song "disgusting", bother to comment? <br /> <br />
