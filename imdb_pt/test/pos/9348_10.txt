Outer Space II is a very good film that has a good cast that includes Brian Kerwin, Elizabeth Peña, Jonathan Carrasco, Adrian Sparks, Bill McKinney, Dean Norris, Dawn Zeek, Lauren Tewes, Mickey Jones, Iilana B'tiste, Jerry Giles and Howard Morris! The acting of all these actors is very good. Kerwin and Norris are really great at this movie. I thought they performed well. The emotions are really good and some of them are amazing. The film is shot very well. The music is great by Shirley Walker. The film is very interesting and the film really keeps you to the end. This is a very good and exciting film. If you like Brian Kerwin, Elizabeth Peña, Jonathan Carrasco, Adrian Sparks, Bill McKinney, Dean Norris, Dawn Zeek, Lauren Tewes, Mickey Jones, the rest of the cast, Mystery, Sci- Fi, Thrillers, Dramas and interesting action movies, so I strongly recommend you watch this movie today! <br /> <br /> Nuttball Movie Note: <br /> <br /> I've noticed that this is the second movie that Dean Norris and Mickey Jones were together in one movie. The other is the classic violent epic Total Recall! Funny to see them in another alien movie! <br /> <br /> If you like alien movies and / or aliens, I also recommend the following films: The Thing of Another World, The Day the Earth Stood Still, War of the Worlds (1953 and 2005 The Horror Express, The UFO Incident, Invasion of the Thieves of Bodies (1978), ET The Extraterrestrial, The Thing of John Carpenter, Krull, The Return of Foreigners: The Deadly Generation, Time Walker, My Scientific Project, Howard, the Duck, John, Carpenter's Starman, John Carpenter Lives, Mac and Me, Explorers, Mars Invaders, Alien Seed, The Abyss, Communion, Suburban Command, Fire in the Sky, The Arrival, Mars Attacks!
