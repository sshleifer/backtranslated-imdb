There's a new killer on the loose and he's doing God's work. Okay, right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like an idiot, and Freddy Krueger looks like a rag doll to this guy. He is Jacob Goodnight (the WWE Glen "KANE" Jacobs), a 7 'monster wielding an Ax, and a hook and chain. These weapons are nothing to him, his true finisher is tearing eyes from the orbits of the victims. This is totally methodical! When the meeting happened four years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and mutilated the veteran after putting a bullet in the head. How on Earth Goodnight survived after 4 years? Now he's at the doomed hotel called Blackwell. And this hotel has many stories to tell. I thought this movie was astonishing and interesting. I liked the part where Goodnight checked one of the girl tattoos on her back. And Goodnight himself is really disturbed thanks to his manic mother. If you think Friday the 13th was something, you'd better think again. This movie will leave you at the edge of your seat. And I think the tear in the eyeball was scary. This movie proves this, and it was not a waste of my time. I liked. The title does not lie! Rating 2.5 out of 5 Stars!
