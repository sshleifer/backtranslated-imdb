I've seen this movie more than once. In fact El Padrino was one of the best movies I've seen in a great deal of time. <br /> <br /> There was a great cast of Jennifer Tilly, Faye Duanway, Brad Dourif and Damian Chapa who really shone like a real star in this part of Kilo. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie was shot for less than two million dollars. I've seen movies filmed for 33 million that can not be compared to the quality and value of production. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa, why are not you getting offers and more movies! EXCELLENT JOB!!!!!!!!!! I can not wait to see the sequence, and I hope it has the same action. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly made a cult classic character with Sabeva. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa moves coolly in every scene very much like the movie stars of the 40s and 50s. So tired of seeing these uncharismatic actors like Ben Stiller getting all these movies when there is talent like the one he has something to show. a great movie. <br /> <br /> GO GO TO DEAD MORE TO SELL THE FATHER!
