I do not have cable vision and I do not have "DirecTV" anymore. So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a blonde lover, but not blonde, of course not only have "Barb Wire", but also have "Stripperella: The Complete First Season". I have not yet found "VIP" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the DVD "Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding". I have the "Playboy" problems that Pamela Denise Anderson posed. I could go on. I love Pamela! There is no one or anything that can make me feel guilty for liking Stripperella. But there are certain elements that I do not like, but live with, for other series portray smoking and alcohol consumption too, sometimes. But those are my personal feelings and I try not to let them ruin the fun of such a series for me. I was also surprised by the change in the style of animation, but I adapted. However, the amount of female nudity has subsided, and that is a big disappointment, as much of this is expected in a series with a premise like that. But then I adjusted again. One of my favorite episodes of "Mork & Mindy" was when they met Robin Williams! So of course one of my favorite episodes of "Striperella" is when Pamela and Tommy visit the club and begin comparisons! If there really is a "Season 2", I hope to find it, because, as a complement, I need to complete my collection. I recommend this to other admirers of feminine form and lovers of blondes. (Hey! Psst! "Blonde" and "blondes" are the feminine form of spelling "blond"! Your software should already know that!)
