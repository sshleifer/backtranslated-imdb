If you have not seen this movie yet, do so. It's a genremix like I've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some fun and hilarious things, a movie noir felling, musical numbers with swing, sex scenes (The second best orgasm played in the film, surpassed only by Sally), a tone of Orson Welles mixed in a work of art . As a work of art, it does not have to be logical in the end, at least it's not logical at all ;-). I owned a copy of the TV on VHS but lent it to an ex-girlfriend and now I can not get it back. But the film should be out on DVD in Austria on 10.06.03 and make sure, I'll buy it.
