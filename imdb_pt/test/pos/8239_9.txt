The beautiful, charming, extremely versatile and talented Irene Dunne is one of the top 5 or 6 actresses in American cinema. In more than 21 years - as in all her films - she illuminates the screen with a natural but glamorous presence. She is both authentic and human, and a charismatic and inspiring model. This role is quintessential Irene Dunne, full of pathos and wit and a bit of malice. I love all of your movies, and this movie was a fantastic find for me when TCM aired last night. I hope they do not wait years to exhibit it again. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Charles Coburn is one of the greatest actors in all American movie films. True, he often portrays variations of the same theme, but I never get tired of seeing his soft-hearted grumpy. Here his character is the perfect contrast to Irene Dunne, and he is portrayed perfectly by Coburn. Your conflicts in this movie are absolutely fantastic. They never miss a beat. In addition, they represent the film's central conflict and the moral conflict of Irene Dunne's husband portrayed by Alexander Knox. <br /> <br /> I'm not so familiar with Knox's work. He was recognizable, but that was all. However, cast with Dunne and Coburn, he retains his own. It offers a fine and differentiated performance. His character has noble motifs that are made available to us by Knox's performance and have never held us as a Holy Grail. He is noble but conflicted and doubts his ability to successfully complete the OCS. His interaction with Dunne is always convincing as well. Dunne supports him without being syrupy or becoming a martyr, and he responds in the same way. Your scenes are very well done. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a fantastic snapshot of a moment and an environment not portrayed in other films. I do not remember the top of my head another movie that portrays America still fighting World War II but with an end in sight and focus on the establishment of the postwar world. Not the usual WWII movie! This in itself is interesting; is also essential to the storyline and message of the film. In contrast to other commentators, I thought the climax speech was fine, but not great. It was delivered very well by Knox, but it was not as "rigorously" written as development led me to expect. I've heard better cinematic speeches addressing very similar topics. He served his purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the film's greatest value was the depiction of the life of Dunne and Knox, reflecting the typical OCS experience. The sense of community among the wives who lived on Palmetto Terrace seemed absolutely authentic - as did Palmetto Terrace itself, despite the fact that it was obviously a solid stage. The incredibly brief encounters between the wives and their SCO husbands. The rigors of the OCS candidates, dominating the difficult and complex material they had to learn. The "basic accommodation" wasted - obviously built in haste. The furniture tired and worn. The constant and distressing deadlines - to return to the base, to learn lessons, to catch trains for the subsequent posts. Tenants constantly ran into their predecessors and successors at the base housing as they were coming in and out. Yes, I suspect this was a glimpse of a true World War II experience - dressed in some comedy but very real at its core. I loved it and highly recommend it.
