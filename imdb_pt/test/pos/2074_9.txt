Let's face it, there is no perfect Hamlet production, it is simply too long and varied and cerebral to be completely perfect along the line, especially with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue. In any scenario, there are certain moments, scenes or intonations with which someone disagrees. I have seen many Hamlet productions filmed: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott and now this BBC film with Jacobi. In terms of faithful and complete productions, this is one of the best in the world. <br /> <br /> Most of Hamlet's productions are cut drastically because the performance of the whole show takes four to five hours. hours. This production seems to be complete - that is, ALL of Shakespeare's original dialogues are intact - and so it is essential for Shakespeare's scholars and lovers. And although the lines seemed to rush on rare occasions (to those least familiar with the text), most of the script is well-played, well spoken and well performed. Captions are available and are very useful, although from time to time they are a little late. <br /> <br /> Jacobi does a pretty admirable job with the longest and most impossible role in the theater. I really cried when Hamlet died, and I do not think I did it before. Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the cast very much on point. Sets are minimal so that we can happily focus on the game without distraction or attention to the non-essential. <br /> <br /> At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this complete Hamlet is a long way to sit, but again, if you want the real deal, it's worth 100%, even if you have to stop the process yourself same. I recommend this production to all lovers and scholars of Shakespeare.
