This was a very good surprise. I was up last night and could not sleep. Not thinking twice, I turned on my TV and HBO was on, and this movie was just beginning. Luckily, I saw the whole thing and I'm really glad I saw it. Because this movie was really good. The actors were well-formed and did a surprisingly good job. Kris Kristofferson made a solid performance, there was a lot of substance behind his lines. This film made me realize that he is a good actor. Brian Keith was great as his father, just as Trey Wilson played the Colonel (this was the last role of Trey Wilson before his untimely death.) He was a quality actor and he looked like a nice guy. Jobeth Williams also did a good job as Kristofferson's American wife. As for the direction, I had no idea that Franklin J. Schaffner was the director until I read the review in Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide (this was the last film he did). Now I understand why this movie was so good. Schaffner also directed Patton, a really great film (I did not see his other great film, Papillon). While I was watching "Welcome Home," I said to myself, "this director really knows what he's doing," unaware that Schaffner had directed him. There is a really beautiful scene in an orphaned Thai refuge, enough to bring tears to my eyes. Not only was this targeted, but it was also driven in a very economical and tense manner. There is nothing squandered in Schaffner's effort. The script was one of the reasons why this movie is so good. The writer does not weigh actors with many lines. It was written in a very simple but very effective way. It just shows that much can be said with few words. This film also made me proud to be an American, while showing him how beautiful ALL people are.
