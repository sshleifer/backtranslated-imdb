This movie was not great cinema, but definitely a good movie to watch with your family, especially kids from 10-15. There are good discussion topics created in this movie, such as bullies, ambiance, and work to get things right. Jimmy Buffett's music was a plus, and the setting was wonderful ... The young actors were great, and this is a movie I'd expect to see on the Family Channel or the Hallmark Channel. With the exception of a few words in the dialogue, a middle school could show this movie to start discussions in the classroom. I hope it shows up on Drive-ins this summer, so more people can see it. He followed Carl Hiassen's book well, and it was fun to see him in a special performance.
