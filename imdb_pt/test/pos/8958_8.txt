Extremely good cinematic story of former gay teenager star, bitter, now waiting tables. Sexual ambiguities are explored here realistically and with a real human face. That, and throw a serial killer on the loose, and you'll have LOVE AND HUMAN REMAINS. A well-portrayed drama, a strange sense of humor and a mystery. The script is fluid and believable. The performances are well above average, and the twists in the story are clear. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not the ideal notion of a movie for everyone, but for those who appreciate something different and well written, it is very worthy of their time. Highly recommended.
