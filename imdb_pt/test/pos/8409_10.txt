First of all, nothing compares to the original movie, but, for God's sake, they are not trying. It's just a personal opinion about what could have happened after Rhett left Scarlett in Tara. I at least thought it was a great movie and would like to add it to my GWTW collection. The scenery alone would make me want to watch the movie. Just watch this movie as an extension of the original and do not think they're trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark Cable and you're going to have a lot of fun. They actually captured Scarlett's spoiled selfishness in many of the scenes and you can see from the longing in Rhett's looks that he is still clearly in love with Scarlett. The fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the movie is another advantage, although some of them have only been seen on TV. I always wanted them to have other kids after Bonnie Blue died in the movie and that satisfied my need perfectly. <br /> <br /> Lore60
