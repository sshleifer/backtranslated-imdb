I had the pleasure of watching Saltimbanco live before seeing the video version of the program. While nothing can be compared to being there, the people behind the video did an incredible job of capturing the taste, sensation, sensation and more. The marvelous performances of the incredibly amazing Saltimbanco troupe are beautifully captured everywhere. The video flows as smoothly and artistically as the production itself. A wonderful experience.
