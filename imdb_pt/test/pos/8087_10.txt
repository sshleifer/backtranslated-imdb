I just saw this movie in the Children's Program of the Berlin Film Festival and it just killed me (and practically everyone in the audience)! And make no mistake about it, this movie belongs to all-time 250! Let me tell you that I am in no way associated with the creators of this movie, if that is what you believe to read it. No, but that's it! Nevermind the label of "children's film", "Klatretösen" ("Climber Girl") is in almost all accounts a classic (as in "biblical")! The story concerns Ida, 12 (magnetic: Julie Zangenberg), who is devastated to learn of her father's terminal illness. Special surgery in the US would cost 1.5 million and, of course, no one could afford it. So Ida and her friends Jonas and Sebastian do what every good kid would do - and rob a bank! Does it sound tacky? Do not forget: this is not America and "Klatretösen" is by no means the Robin-Williams-multiplex-plat-du-jour that no one takes seriously. Director Fabian Wullenweber decided to make a great budget comedy for kids and he succeeded! Let me put it this way: This movie rocks like no children's movie and few others have done before. And there is much more than just "action." After about 20 minutes of "by-the-numbers" exposure, it speeds up into a monster that: <br /> <br /> effortlessly puts "impossible mission" to shame (the numerous action sequences are masterfully staged and looks real expensive - take it, Mommy!) <br /> <br /> - dwarves almost every other movie in terms of suspense (not easy-them-only-kids-antics here) > <br /> - easily throws a dense story with enough laughs to make Jim Carrey look for career alternatives <br /> <br /> - wave to damon runyon and karate kid within the same seconds <br /> <br /> - comes with so much wicked humor on this side of the pc that I can hear the American ratings board wetting the pants from here - <br /> <br /> - can really be tender and serious and sexy at the same time (ohmygod, what am I saying they are children! they are children! - never mind, watch the last scene!) <br /> <br /> - stars Stafan Pagels And erson, who since last year "Mirakel" is everyone's favorite actor. What a ride!
