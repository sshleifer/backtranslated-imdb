When I went to the movies, I thought it would be a great movie. And I was not disappointed at all. WOW! This movie is brilliant! The emotions felt throughout the film are extraordinary! Great performance by Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman This is probably the best Tamil movie I've seen in ages. Mani Ratnam once again proved that he is the best at making meaningful and sincere films. <br /> <br /> This film is basically about a young girl (PS Keerthana) who is in search of her biological mother (Nandita Das). who abandoned her in a refugee camp to fight for her country as her husband (JD Chakravathy). A young novelist (Madhavan) discovers the story of this young woman and decides to write a story about her. He and his wife (Simran) decide to adopt this child, but one day she discovers that they are not her real parents and decides to look for her biological mother. <br /> <br /> This movie really screams EXCELLENT. The way Mani Ratnam introduced the film is magnificent. My rating - 10/10
