In my opinion, directing, editing, lighting and acting (minus Franco) were very good. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by this movie. I was not expecting much in terms of camera angles, sound, etc, but in those areas the movie was not bad at all. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I personally felt frustrated with both characters. because I wanted so badly that these two characters approached. And I felt that the character of Travis (Franco) was not really affected or changed at the end after Terri committed suicide. Although this is probably due to the lack or inability of James Franco express emotion (of any kind) very well in this film. I've seen some of Franco's other films, and for me he just can not do it when a scene requires real emotions or facial expressions. The only positive thing he brings to the movie is the possibility of more people watching this movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Terry's interpretation of Rachel Miner was well made, and she seems to have a bright future ahead. . I could actually see and feel the sadness and emptiness in her character, and it made me feel for her. I just wish I had seen more in Terri's life before the movie ended. <br /> <br /> For a short film, this movie was good, but leaves you wanting more in the end. I just wanted it to be a bit more, to see the characters develop a little more. Despite this, I hope to see more director and staff films in the future. :)
