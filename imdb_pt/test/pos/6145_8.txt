I, as many IMDB users seem to have, came across this little movie when it appeared on the Canadian "Showcase Network." I was, like many of you, also sucked and watched the entire movie. I was hooked, at first, by the learned dialogue and ironic sense of humor with which the film is rich. I was navigating comfortably in a kind of "Kevin Smith meets Killer Films" halfway through when the film really tuned and explored their themes in more detail ... with a decidedly darker and poignant edge. Far from being drawn from experience, I was brought in. This is not the best film of the genre and certainly will not have universal appeal ... so I understand some of the most negative reactions to it. But I bought in ... and enjoyed it immensely. The "flash back" movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well performed and the issues raised were human, accessible (to my experience anyway) and interesting. I was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet, fun and entertaining, without straying from the controversial subject and emotional language, dynamics and situations. This film is a great antidote to many things that permeated the intelligent and intelligent romantic genre. A sort of male Brigitte Jones for the literate sect. Take two hours out of your busy schedule and get into Wirey's world ... or you could rent "You've Got Mail" because if that appeals to you, you will not like that anyway! Those of us who like it will be fine without you on our side ...
