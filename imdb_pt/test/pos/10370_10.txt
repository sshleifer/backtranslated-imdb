By the time we see Monica Dolan (in a truly cast genius) delightfully enjoying as Cora at first we are already addicted, but it's only later when she reveals herself in her wonderful screen-making, that insane, intriguing, evil queen of murder and deception posing under the guise of tense Miss Gilchrist, that she not only steals the entire telemovie effortlessly to herself but simply expels who comes near her, including the already well-measured David Suchet who seems to be a bit dazzled with her acting talents and, very gently, allows her to occupy the center of the stage. Dolan is the true engine of the film and its Miss Gilchrist a genuinely well-made character in this Christie version, aided by a spicy script and animated direction - and also by the rest of the cast led by Geraldine James and Dominic Jephcott, who all show signs of sympathy for the given material and play with pleasure accordingly. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are in place as usual, and if there is any weak link, they may be located on the soundtrack comparatively below standard. most of Poirots later, and also perhaps in the absence of a genuinely Italian actor for the role of Cora's husband. Other than that, this is an hour and a half of pure televisual delight that is as self-indulgent and fun as it is lovingly put together.
