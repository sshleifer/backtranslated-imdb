I watched Love Jones more than thirty times. It's one of the rare films that portrays a love story about people who are African American. The dialogue was realistically written and delivered honestly. It was great to see a movie where the plot focused on young, professional African-Americans. This is practically an unexplored market. Love Jones was also visually captivating. The chemistry between Lorenz Tate and Nia Long will bring memories of past and present love. The movie's feeling is jazz and blues, and brings to my the sensuality of a hot creamy hot chocolate with a touch of Kahlua and Butterscotch. If you had not guessed, I loved it!
