There must have been a sale in this story in the 1940s. An epidemic threatens New York (it's always New York) and no one takes it seriously. Some might say that Richard Widmark and Jack Palance did it better in Panic in the Streets, but I disagree. <br /> <br /> There is always something about these Poverty Row productions that really touch a nerve. The production values ​​are never so polished and the acting is a bit rough around the edges, but that's the reason why I think this movie and those who are like it are effective. Rough, grainy, nervous. And the cast. All 2nd strings or A list the actors after the prime. There are no egos here. These people were happy to get the job. Whit Bissell, Carl Benton Reid, Jim Backus, Arthur Space, Charles Korvin and the melodious voice of Reed Hadley flowing to the bottom like crude. By the way, I've been to the hospital a few times; Why did not my nurses ever look like Dorothy Malone? In this type of film they do not bother much with makeup and hair, but they really managed to turn Evelyn Keyes into a witch. Or maybe they just skipped makeup and hair completely. Either way, it was quite effective. She plays a passionate jewelery smuggler who picks up a Small Pox case in Cuba while smuggling jewelry back to ultra-villainous Charles Korvin (who is helping her sister in the meantime). You have the Customs Agents looking for it because of the jewels, and the Health Department looking for it, because it's about to depopulate New York. There are 4 rights to change here. Everyone gets bothered. <br /> <br /> You have to have the right attitude to enjoy a movie like that. I have a brother who examines movies to the death. If they do not meet his Orson Wellian standards, he bombards them mercilessly. They must have the directing excellence of a David Lean film, the Wolfgang von Korngold soundtrack, the Sound and the Art of Douglas Shearer and Cedric Gibbons, respectively. Is not it. <br /> <br /> But I have the right attitude, and if you do that too, you'll love this movie.
