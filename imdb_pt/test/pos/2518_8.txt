Drive was a nice episode with a grim ending. Basically, a man and his wife are infected in their inner ear by a high frequency sound wave emitted by some military equipment. Some of my favorite parts of this episode are Mulder's dialogue in the car, and the scene where Scully enters with the Hazmat team and finds the deaf old lady completely unaffected by what they thought was a virus. The end of the course is tragic in its realism because it causes the viewer to believe that they will actually be able to perform this elaborate plan to save the victim, but when Mulder arrives the man is already dead. 8/10
