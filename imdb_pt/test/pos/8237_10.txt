It is well known that Irene Dunne could sing a little more than a little. And I think his talent as a comedian can only be understood when one has fought through a Haydn sonata or a Debussy song and made it successful. Your instrument is your voice and your manipulation is pure musicality. She could attack any part. The only thing she could not do was not succeed in it. This movie is a perfect example. In it, she channels Ruth Gordon (because the joke is the thing), is feminine, charming, stubborn and modest, generous, protective and combative, but never pretentious. She manages to be as believable as Alexander Knox is in another difficult role that he assumes with aplomb. The viewer begins to believe what he sees and cares about it. It's refreshing to watch a movie that is both fun and intellectually challenging while pressing the right patriotic buttons. I sincerely hope that all of Dunne's work comes to DVD someday, because it's very difficult to keep a secret like this from just a few insiders.
