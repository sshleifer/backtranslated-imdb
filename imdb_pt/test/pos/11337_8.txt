"In the mood for love" a provocative allegory of loneliness and longing. Here is a movie without sex, or even kissing - and it is undoubtedly one of the sexiest and most definitely the most psychological and thought-provoking novel I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Telling the story of two people who coincidentally live in the same apartment and are one door away from each other. The film, as and unlike "Random Hearts", is about how two people get together through the case of their two lovers. Only when they receive this news do they take the time to think about the consequences of a case, and their feelings about having just finished - and whether the two people are willing to fall in love or not. /> <br /> What is fantastic about the film is the way director Wong Kar-Wai presents the way each character deals with loneliness. With the character of Maggie Cheung, he will show her, in a repeated montage: leaving work, going home, watching his neighbors play, go to the diner, get out of the diner and find his attractive same age, played by Tony. Leung. This is an intelligent technique, if not subtle and knowledgeable, to present solitude. That's when you're alone when you find yourself in a loop. This movie worked for me because I can relate to that feeling.
