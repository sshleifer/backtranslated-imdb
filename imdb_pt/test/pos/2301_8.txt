In the Kingdom of Senses is a beautifully filmed film, well written and splendidly portrayed. It tells the astonishing story of a woman who kills her husband after falling in love with another man. Her husband's ghost continues to haunt her after her murder. This movie is really good, anyone interested should definitely take a look.
