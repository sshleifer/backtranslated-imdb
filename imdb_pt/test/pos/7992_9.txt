1992's "Batman Returns" was Tim Burton's second round as director and once again he made a success by making this film again somber and somber as 1989. Gotham City is again a place of darkness and sadness with crime and corruption swarming in every corner. It was also smart to see how Burton used politics as a subplot that fit well with the corporate corruption of businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the plan to make Gotham mayor "Penguin" (Danny DeVito)! Anyway Keaton returns again as "Batman" / Bruce Wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and ripped man who simply can not find love in a normal world but he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in Selina Kyle only Ms. Kyle has an obscure secret that is very sneaky and she is just a vampire as the sexy and mysterious but dangerous "Catwoman" (Michelle Pfeiffer). A plan forms between the two villains to destroy Gotham and, above all, both want to get rid of the bat. Actually this movie, although violent and a little disgusting with many scenes of penguins, is clearly exciting from the beginning to the end, since you never find a moment of boredom and Tim, because he explores the characters as dark and conflicting. movie even more interesting. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance was the best of them all, since no one could have played "The Catwoman" better and Devito was perfect as the "Penguin", her body fit perfectly into her character's performance, though macabre was fun to watch . "Batman Returns" is a fun thrill ride that you can not take your eyes off of as a spectator you're going to have fun, it's often thrilling and explosive.
