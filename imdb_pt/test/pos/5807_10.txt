Well, I have to say I had the chance to see this show here in Philadelphia, PA on June 06. And I really loved it. My favorite visual of Madonna was the 1990 Blond Ambition tour.this for me is "MADONNA". Now that she is the mother of three children, she has to change some things to suit motherhood. And I totally agree. This is a classic Madonna concert. I wish that "living to tell" was not edited. in 911 we can see a woman on a cross ... anyway, I'm looking forward to the launch of this DVD tour and I hope it's the whole unedited show and with a lot of bonus scenes. She is an artist of all time.the best out there ... and still on top and going strong.long live MADONNA!
