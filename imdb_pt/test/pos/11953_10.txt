I really love anything made by Savage Steve Holland, the writer / director of this great movie. See also "Better Off Dead" and "How I Got Into College". Wonderful! Anyway, this movie is very funny and offers some unexpected things. Where else but in this movie you can see Demi Moore as a talented singer and Bobcat Golthwait as a twin? I recommend this to anyone who is looking for some old-fashioned slapstick comedy (George with the tortoise raft), not to mention some really well-written sarcasm (the Christmas tree on the roof of the car). This movie constantly throws you unexpected things even after you see 100 times like me! Appreciate!
