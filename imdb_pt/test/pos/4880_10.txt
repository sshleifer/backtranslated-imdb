Supernanny Jo Frost, in each episode, gives a family the benefit of their sweaty experience. But when she leaves, she will be able to adhere to tough disciplinary rules or face a life dominated by undisciplined children. Following the line of British documentaries "Wife Swap" and "How Clean is Your House" Supernanny takes an in-depth look at the private family life of ordinary people, but with the added benefit of practical advice on ways to raise their children. Jo advocates a hard love style of caring for children and the now infamous 'disobedient step' has reached the popular vernacular in many British homes. <br /> <br /> In just three short weeks, the families presented were taken from a disorganized house; rivalry between siblings, screaming, kicking, biting children and fierce parents, for a quiet and peaceful oasis of family love. <br /> <br /> The series, when aired, has garnered great classifications and critical acclaim and is currently in negotiations to be reverted to America. .
