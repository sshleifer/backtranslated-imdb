Here is another Antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or DVD. I saw this a few months ago when it ran for the first time (even in the LA metropolitan capital!) For a few weeks and then disappeared (the art-house public seems to have opted for its own special territory where old favorites like Antonioni and Resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosities. At first I was disappointed, found the pace unbearably tedious, and the man had missed a chance (for years Antonioni found it difficult to find funding) in old age to add another masterpiece to his canon, but knowing Antonioni for what he was and how I had initially reacted to the Blow-Up and the Passenger, I refused to judge until I had seen the film again.I came back the next day and should not have been surprised with the fact that the film continues to pull me, making me aware of things I had thought of and lost sight of throughout my life, driving home in a contemporary setting, expost points them for the movie. for the first time some forty years ago in L'Aventurra, forming an environment of subtle humor so characteristically and fascinatingly alienated in tone (and rather comical, in fact) that I could not get enough. The scene with Malkovich sitting in the sophisticated swings on the wind-swept beach, with the time so beautifully silvery skiing, and the Eno / U2 track in the background flowing exactly at his pace, had been my favorite; still was, but now the whole movie was so good! What a strange phenomenon, the complex simplicity or the invisible complex that only Antonioni's eyes seem to capture and communicate. The curious thing is that, although it seems at first glance a pornographic film of some form and has a lot of sex and maddeningly beautiful Sophie Marceau and many other international stars to distract him, this film is unmistakably the essence of Antonioni. , but you will not realize how much you've seen it a few times and get used to its pace. For example, it's a rather funny movie with a deep sense of humor, something I did not notice at first, but which was criticized by another critic, and I realized that I delighted a lot with other exhibits (4 before they pulled it and did it ) ve came back for more). If this film had been promoted properly and people had been guided to some extent on how to approach it, I have no doubt that I would have succeeded in the circuit of art houses, like most Antonioni films of the 1960s. the 60s are no longer and the movie will have to find its audience on the small screen, where half of its beauty will be lost, even in a DVD version for letterbox (if and when it is released). I ask all the general or esoteric nuts movies to see 'Beyond the Clouds' and add a bit of magic to the tragic.
