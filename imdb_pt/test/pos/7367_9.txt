Tales of the Bonfire (1997) <br /> <br /> An excellent peace of work. Everything about this movie is just perfect. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great cast as you can see on IMDb. The reason I brought the film was because of Christine Taylor and the love of horror movies. let's go to the main parts <br /> <br /> 1. There are 4 teenagers in this movie, after hitting the car, they decide to tell some scary stories 2. There are 3 stories and the main plot (the 4 teens are the main plot ) 3. The best story is "people can also lick" In my opinion. the less frightening story is possibly "honeymoon" or the second story (I can not remember the name). 4. "People can also lick" is about a man pretending to be a 13-year-old girl (He starts talking to a girl named Amanda and enters her house, a very scary thing, this story will make you think twice about talking to someone online, basically a pervert enters your house and things become scary. 5. The main plot is sweet and simple, teens break, tell stories, try to scare, but there's a pretty cool twist in the end. <br /> <br /> The only bad part of this movie is, teenagers crash the car into another couple, but the kids do not bother to see if the couple is okay. <br /> <br /> Men only talk about the couple they shocked. who did this movie did this to scare people, not to make money, unlike "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer," this movie was created to scare you "scream" and "I know what you did last summ er" were made to make money in large quantity. <br /> <br /> Even though this movie has not been as publicly as the scream, it's still 10 times better than screaming and "I know what you did last summer." <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are great and have realistic features. The cast that plays these characters is great. Christine Taylor does a fabulous job with Lauren, does not exaggerate with acting. The guy who plays Eric (laurens younger brother) also does a good job of showing that men or teenagers can also get scared. Screaming is like a spoof movie, the killer is a joke and the kids are stupid <br /> <br /> Contrary to yelling and "I know what you did last summer," this movie has realistic people, not a play of a movie, should have been more noticeable.
