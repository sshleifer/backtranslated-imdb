I feel extremely sad for some of the people who reviewed this film. Clearly their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a movie just for pleasure. Or, perhaps, your pleasure is derived from the act of separating the movies; looking for some reason not to like them? <br /> <br /> Long Kiss Goodnight is an action movie, in every sense of the word. Of course, there are holes in the plot large enough to drive a semi-through, but none of them is enough to stop the flow of the movie itself. I was never a big fan of Geena Davis, but I was impressed by how she managed to create two very different characters, Samantha Cain and Charlie Baltimore. In my opinion, it was not even necessary to have changed his physical appearance to differentiate between the two ... his performance was more than enough to do the trick. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, however, this movie was by Craig Bierko. In the hands of another, Timothy's character could have been just another interchangeable villain. His decision to interpret it with a more casual approach was just the right counterpoint to all the action scenes. It is not often that you find an actor who can express himself so well only with his facial expressions ... in the case: the scene in the freezer with Charlie and his daughter. Where most of the films would have stuck the moment of "revelation" with an unnecessary dialogue, Bierko's eyes told the whole story. <br /> <br /> The basic plot? Fine, to be honest. A seemingly average housewife, who suffers from amnesia, slowly discovers that she was a killer. When her memory returns, so do the people who want the dead killer. Is she really Samantha, the cookie cookie, or Charlie, the cold-blooded killer? Or maybe a little bit of both? For me, The Long Kiss Goodnight was a nice trip to discover.
