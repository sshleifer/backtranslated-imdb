I saw this movie when it came out and I never forgot it. My uncle Antoine is much, much greater than the sum of its parts. The film, vaguely, is about a preteen who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in Canada. There are adventures that seem more or less typical, but underneath there is a current building. MUA has a slow pace but has patience, the reward is coming. I believe the film was under-titled and, like in all non-English films, I've seen that it's worth avoiding any dubbed version. Inevitably nicknamed movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors, with the added need for lip sync lines that do not fit well. The Amarcord, English-speaking, is a farce, for example, while the sub-titled version sings. My Uncle Antoine is worth finding and watching in French.
