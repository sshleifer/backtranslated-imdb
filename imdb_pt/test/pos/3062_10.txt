I can not believe there are people out there who did not like this movie! I thought it was the funniest movie I've ever seen. Mine was b / c I am the biggest fan of Mel Brooks ... I know almost every word and I get very discouraged when they censure them when it is played on a Family Channel. :) This is one of my favorite movies, so I do not know why anyone would disagree!
