I'm torn with this show. While most of the parts I found to be HILARIOUS, other parts of what I found to be stupid and simply shock because of shock. Some of the cartoon wall parody is brilliant as indeed are many of the scenes with the children. However, I do not think it's smart to make small children say rude things. It's not that I think "oh poor children, they're being exploited" - it's just that he's not really smart! It is something that anyone could do, therefore making it as simple and useless as making a paper airplane. To make this show better, they would have to stick to the children's natural responses, which I think may be funnier than the script at the moment. By far the funniest part of Wonder Showzen is Clarence, the blue puppet who marvels through the streets chatting and annoying strangers. It's very funny and it's practically impromptu. Seeing him in a long scene about the importance of patience testing the patience of an extremely patient man, was by far the funniest scene in my opinion. <br /> <br /> You must watch this show, because in spite of everything is very funny, even if it is stupid sometimes.
