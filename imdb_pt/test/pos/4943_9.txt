The story line for this game is very abrupt where it seems that the game's writers have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in Tales of the Soul. That being said, this is the only complaint I have about the game. <br /> <br /> The initial FMV is spectacular with breathtaking landscapes and interesting new devices such as the ability to create and design your own character and your own. Martial arts discipline. There is even a second story mode that makes up for the strange design of Stories of Tales of Souls. Parts of FMVs during the Tale of Souls are also interactive, where you can decide the fate of your character. a degree that is an interesting feature. With the many character combinations you can create, the various paths you can explore in Tales of the Souls and Chronicle of Swords story mode, this game will continue any fan of Beatem up / RPG Have fun for a while!
