Naked City: JWAB does a good job of balancing its two A - B stories, even though I do not like so many plot movies. And Scott Glen and Courtney B. Vance make a great duet on the screen. However, I'm not sure what kind of message a movie sends when two country girls can get away with murder, robbery and, moreover, win a flight back home (in the first class, not least - at least appearance of your costume anyway). Wow, I think the blue wall of silence is still enough to think! Rating: 8
