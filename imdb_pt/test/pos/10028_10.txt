After working on 7 films with director Mickael Curtiz (The Adventures of Robin Hood are his best achievement), Errol Flynn got tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great Raoul Walsh. This meeting is a happy thing for cinematography. The DIED WITH YOUR BOOTS ON is the first and best movie together. Raoul Walsh plays General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) from his debut at West Point, the Civil War and finally at the Battle of Little Big Horn. It's true that the film shows an overly heroic portrayal of Custer, but that's not important. The important thing is that we are transported with the passion and glory carried by the characters. Who can forget the Californian Joe, the great "Queen's Own Buttler" with his song "Garryowen", the touching Mrs. Custer (Olivia de Havilland), the evil Sharp well interpreted by Arthur Kennedy? <br /> <br /> An eternal blow remains in this epic and tragic mill.
