I stumbled on this movie by accident. I was traveling a few years ago and this movie was on some cable channel in the hotel late at night. Not much else and I figured watching for about 20 to 30 minutes until I decided to go to bed. Needless to say, I stayed up and watched the full movie. The plot was very interesting and makes you wonder if there was no SS who did this or at least thought to do so. I've been looking all over this movie. I even e-mailed the producer, but they were not sure it would hit the DVD, but they said there was always hope. If someone finds this movie, put a note here where you found it, how I would like to get a copy sometime.
