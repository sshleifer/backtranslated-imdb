I saw this movie on TV in the 60's and it still holds up well, even after brilliant performances as DI by R. Lee Ermey, Lou Gossett and even Frank Sutton (in a comedic vein) in Gomer Pyle USMC. I was not on duty, but my brother had a recording of a drill instructor in the Air Force and it was scary. Other family members who were Marines told me that Ermey and even Sutton were well positioned in their roles. The only thing missing in "D. I" is the language. In 1958, they still could not use profanity in movies, but Jack Webb proved quite tough without it. I think it's his best role. In Dragnet, he was quite rigid, I admit, though not as bad as George Raft, but he used it only for effect on "The D. I." You never forget the funeral of the dead flea! The romantic part was just to stretch the film, but it did not interfere with the basic plot. Don Dubbins was very good, but he never surpassed this film in his career. As for patriotism, Jack Webb was John Wayne from TV. It took him a little too far in some episodes of Dragnet, but not in "The D. I." After 40 years, I had hoped that the film could withstand the likes of "Full Metal Jacket" and others; and it was!
