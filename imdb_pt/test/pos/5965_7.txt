Many animation animators consider Wladyslaw Starewicz the great forgotten genius of a special branch of art, the animation of dolls, which he invented almost alone. . . and, as it happened, almost accidentally. As a young man, Starewicz was more interested in entomology than in cinema, but his unsuccessful attempt to film two beetles provoked an unexpected advance in filmmaking when he realized he could simulate movements by manipulating beetle carcasses and photographing them in a frame. a time. This discovery led to the production of Starewicz's incredibly elaborate classic, CAMERAMAN'S REVENGE, which he made in Russia in 1912, at a time when film animation of all kinds was in its infancy. <br /> <br /> The politician The tumult of the Russian Revolution caused Starewicz to move to Paris, where one of his first productions - coincidentally? - was a somber political satire, known as "Frogland" or "The Frogs Who Wanted to King." A variety of black comedies can be found in almost every Starewicz film, but here it is really very dark, geared more towards adults who can appreciate the satirical aspects than the children, who most likely find the climax disturbing. (I am middle-aged, and I find that very annoying.) And in fact, the impressions of the film intended for English-speaking viewers of the 1920s were given title cards filled with puns and jokes to help soften the sharp sting of final. <br /> <br /> Our tale is set in a swamp, the Frogland Commonwealth, where citizens are dissatisfied with their government and have convened a special session to see what they can do to make things better. They decide to beg Jupiter for a king. The crowds are staggeringly lively in this opening sequence - it could not have been easy to make so many frogs look alive simultaneously - while Jupiter, in turn, is portrayed as a bearded, white-bearded guy in the clouds who looks as if he'd rather take one nap. When Jupiter sends them a god resembling a tree that considers them impassive, the frogs decide that this is not an improvement and require a different king. Annoyed, Jupiter sends them a stork. Delighted with this formidable new king rising above them, the frogs welcome him with a delegation of formally dressed dignitaries. The mayor steps forward to give him the key to the Commonwealth, while the news cameras record the event. To the horror of all, the stork readily eats the mayor and then cheers, swallowing citizens randomly. A title card says dryly, "The news of the king's appetite spread throughout the kingdom." When the now terrified frogs once again ask Jupiter for help, he loses his temper and irritates the community with lightning. The moral of our story, delivered by an unfortunate frog shortly before it is eaten, is "Leave it well in peace." Considering the time when this little film was made, and considering the fact that it was made by a Russian immigrant at the height of the besieged country's Civil War, it would be easy to see this as a parable about these events . Starewicz may or may not have had the Russian turmoil in mind when he made "Frogland", but whatever motivated his choice of material, the film is a pre-emptive tale of universal application. "Frogland" could be the Soviet Union, Italy, Germany, or Japan in the 1930s, or any country of any era that would drop its guard and be subjugated by tyranny. It's a fascinating, even charming, movie in its macabre form, but its message is no joke.
