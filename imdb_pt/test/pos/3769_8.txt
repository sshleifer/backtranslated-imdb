A blunt comedy in which comedian Mark Blankfield portrays Jekyll as a doctor tense and deeply committed to his research. Once he snorted his experimental formula, he became the Hyde-devouring landscape, causing problems for everyone around him. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by this. It has a truly crazy and crazy approach; is in full swing with a joke outrageously undeniably still undeniably hilarious after another. Funny and visual lines are in abundance; Blankfield plays every role for all it's worth. A highlight has Hyde bursting into music; "Hyde has nothing to Hyde" is quite captivating and so far I can still hear it in my head. The climax goes so far as to spoil old p & b horror movies. The supporting cast is also quite witty, with Bess Armstrong as the promising bride Mary, Krista Errickson as the brave Ivy, and Tim Thomerson as fellow doctor Knute Lanyon. I wish more things could be done with the Thomson character, since I'm a fan of the man, but it's always good to see him in something. <br /> <br /> A wide variety of familiar faces parade before the camera: Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson, Peter Brocco, Liz Sheridan, George Wendt, Michael Ensign, John Dennis Johnston, Art La Fleur, Lin Shaye and George Chakiris in a special participation like himself. <br /> <br /> Without saying that if you prefer a smart and intelligent comedy, it is best to avoid it at all costs. But for those who enjoy a good time, politically incorrect, cheerfully cheeky, this may be enough. <br /> <br /> 8 One of the best parts is saved to the end. <br /> <br /> 8/10
