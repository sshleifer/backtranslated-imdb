One of the best films of all time ... Fire ... is not much about the sociological description of India today ... it is the use of light that never stops, never becomes ... normal ... even when. . in this sense the film is almost unique ... both leads are of very good quality ... Das's origin as a street performer is quite obvious ... his performance is an excellent "cammeo" ... but the use of light ... I looked at her and looked at her, again and again ... continues to blow after a long time ... nothing torrid in history ... a "pure" way of looking at the subject ... in a sense it is sad that in the bizarre world we live in today, an important work of art is known as a genre film ... The fire can stand face to face with Jeanne D 'Arc de Dryer or Biruma in the Tategoto of Ichikawa or some of the main Kurosawa films, just to name "a few." I want my contribution to help this movie a bit for the well-deserved way to fame.
