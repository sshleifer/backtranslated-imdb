I recently bought this movie for three dollars on a garage sale, and although I'm glad I did not have to pay the usual $ 19.99 for this DVD, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is set up as a horror anthology, divided into 5 short stories, including the 'Connector' story that involves four teenagers as the car breaks down a dark and lonely road in the middle of the night. Apparently, these little ones like horror stories, because that's what they decide to do until the morning - telling scary stories around a campfire. Each character, in turn, tells a story, after which his own story is involved with a little twist. The first story, "The Hook," is kind of a waste of time, a bit bland and dull. Luckily, this is not one of the top stories and only lasts 5 minutes. The goal is simply to present the film and it is easy to ignore the lack of originality of this piece. <br /> <br /> The second story, "The Honeymooners," is, alright. It's about - you guessed it - two people on their honeymoon! They are traveling in a trailer for Las Vegas. They decide to stop somewhere during the night, but are quickly warned by a mysterious stranger to leave the place, or risk being attacked by some dangerous and unknown creatures. This story has a good setup, but only an "ok" delivery. Basically, it's quite fun and mysterious until the monsters appear, so it's kinda dubious. <br /> <br /> The third story, "People Can Lick Too" is my favorite. It involves a young woman whose parents leave for the evening and the older sister is abandoning her to a party. So she's going to be left alone - a fact she makes known to a friend of her internet. The problem is that this friend of the internet? Not exactly a thirteen-year-old girl. The conclusion of this story is a little less climatic than I would have liked to have seen, but still very good. <br /> <br /> The final story, "The Locket" is definitely the most full of atmosphere. Set in a scary mansion on a dark and rainy night, it's the tale of a young man (played by Glenn Quinn!) Traveling on a motorcycle stumbles across the house at exactly the time he conveniently has a problem with his bike. He meets the mute girl who lives in the house and falls in love with her at first sight. Unfortunately, not everything is good and elegant - and it may have something to do with that medallion hanging from your pretty neck ... <br /> <br /> After the stories are wrapped up, we are presented with a twist involving the four teenagers in the car, a twist that in retrospect should have been obvious, but that did not happen, and is a pretty nice conclusion to film. <br /> <br /> So, all in all, a good movie. Rent it if you can, because, unfortunately, I do not think it has much re-observation value. But the next time you're in the mood for a slightly vaguely scary movie in the vein of "Tales of the Darkside" or something, get this movie and some popcorn, turn off all the lights, and watch out if it clicks.
