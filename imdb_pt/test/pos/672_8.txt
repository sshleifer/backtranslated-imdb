A great B-feature. A virtual two-handed and set over a day, (you can see the origins of the stage and even how it must have functioned as a radio piece) and although it is only 77 minutes long, played in sequences similar to something like real Time. Robert Ryan is the psychopath who keeps Ida Lupino stuck in his own house. Both are superb, especially the underestimated Lupino, whose initial independence and self-control soon crumble before Ryan's unbalanced intruder. Today, of course, everything would be guts and gore, but the restraint shown by director Harry Horner, (much better known as Art Director), only increases the suspense that is sometimes worthy of Hitchcock.
