Satya was excellent .... Company was so good but more polished, probably due to the money earned from previous films. Ab Tak Chappan, however, is even more fun. The dialogue is hard, coarse and sometimes hilarious. Nana Pataker shines once again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority, but the supporting cast is very talented. The direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfactory pace with a very dramatic climax. As a representation of reality, it may be super-dramatized, but at the end of the day it's a movie, so the balance is perfect. I ordered my DVD and can not wait to see it again at home. As a lover of this type of gangster movies, this is very rewarding and is highly recommended for the refreshing Bollywood gangster lovers who are not Yash Raj.
