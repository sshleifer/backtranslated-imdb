Finally!!! A good movie made about the most demented serial killer in history. For those less familiar with Ed Gein, he was basically the madman who was known for stealing and flaying his victims (which most horror fans plucked). Filmed in a period style that perfectly reflects the bleak plains of Wisconsin, this is easily the most atmospheric horror movie to date to represent Gein and his horrific murders. Kane Hodder (Jason from Friday the 13th) and Michael Berryman (Hills have Eyes I and II), feature chilling performances in this serial killer opus that easily leaves behind Gein's previous attempts. So far I would say this is one of the best horror movies released this year (Tourists = 0).
