Because this show was cut early, I never realized because until recently I read the story behind the series. I felt that this show never had its debts as one of the biggest shows, this show is iconic in nature and deserves the movie that it was always meant to have, if not with the original cast of the team, at least with the cast incorporated into the line history or a long appearance, perhaps in the end, celebrate the late Colonel Hanibal Smith (Preppard). This cast gave a lot to bring happiness to us growing up they deserve a last breath ho the fact that the series ended openly because they cut the series is reason enough. This team and cast made us realize how kids the essence of being one of the good guys, especially seeing how the world is spoiled is today, I think a softer version like the original should be put into motion I've read the previous ones and I know These are not the plans, but if something goes straight into the DVD movie, I would certainly buy it. I really do not understand how shit shows get end of the series but this great show that still works regularly today and is probably watched more than some of today's junk shows today we will not always remember the Incredible Hulk series, Knight Rider, Airwolf and Team A, because this kind of program takes you through, I'm pretty sure that the ones you know about detectives will not even be remembered in 10 years, so why not bring back something and show people the staying power? how old these programs really are.
