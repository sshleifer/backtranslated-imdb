Okay, I do not fancy that this is the typical gay love life, but since when are straight romances in real life how are they on the screen? This movie is well balanced with comedy and drama and I had a lot of fun. It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving portray a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' homes for his encounters with flaming Darren (Tom Hollander). And having seen him in Priscilla, the desert queen just a day before, he is probably one of the safest actors in his manhood. :) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male link scenes were a joke. Affirmative! 8/10
