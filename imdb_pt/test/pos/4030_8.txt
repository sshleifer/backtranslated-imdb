This is a whodunnit in the tradition of Hitchcock. You are kept in the dark when the suspects come and go. Dennis Quaid is supurb as Dexter, a man condemned to die and Meg Ryan excellent as his baby. There is not much to dislike about this little suspense and all the pieces fit perfectly the way they should. You will not regret having watched this if you like suspense.
