Sometimes the Academy does not recognize the potential of some movies, or it does not name them because they are controversial or strong. Sometimes they are nominated, but they do not earn anything (I hope this does not happen this year with "American Beauty"). This is exactly what happened to "Boogie Nights," which was the best film of 1997. The Academy preferred to give the Oscar for best film to "Titanic," a purely commercial and hollow film, and other awards for the overrated "Good Will Hunting. " "and the annoying" Full Monty. "The other photos that were nominated in the main category were" LA Confidential "and" As Good As It Gets ", great movies, but" Boogie Nights "is still better and should have been remembered in more categories. <br /> <br /> This incredible film tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, in a surprisingly great performance), a 17-year-old bartender who catches the eye of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds in a redemptive performance) director of pornographic films.Eddie has a special 'gift', which helps him enter the world of pornographic films.He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and starts to make a huge success.But fame ... does not last forever Other characters also have their parallel stories - Amber Waves (Julianne Moore, perfect), Buck (Don Cheadle) and others, including Rollergirl (Heather Graham), an actress who agrees to do anything but she has to be wearing her roll. <br /> <br /> What could have s gone a banal and trivial film, turns into a perfect and memorable film in the hands of Paul Thomas Anderson. What makes "Boogie Nights" a great movie is its execution, added to a clever and well written script, great soundtrack, etc. Each character is very well developed, and each of them has its importance in context. Every feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, resulting in a masterpiece of modern American cinema. <br /> <br /> "Boogie Nights" is a strong and powerful image that must be seen by everyone who really likes movies. Under a plot that seems banal at first impression, there is a wonderful story of ups and downs, things that we face in our lives. It's an incredible portrait of the late 70's and early 80's, exactly a season of ups and downs. That's what makes this movie so special and a true work of art. <br /> <br /> 10/10
