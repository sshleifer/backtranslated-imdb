I watched Sleeper Cell with a bit of fear of worrying if the terrorists would be glorified. This mesmerizing series not only dealt with the subject responsibly, it created depth and substance for almost every character. Oded Fehr only swallows the screen in every scene he is in and even though his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell, he still has a hypnotic appeal. Michael Ealy did well, although in some scenes I wondered why he was not shot at the scene because of the scowl he wore on his face. <br /> <br /> The professionals in the series are the two leaders, Fehr and Ealy, the well-written characters - all believable and tragic, and the perplexing issues addressed in the story. Having been married to a Muslim, the atmosphere created was quite realistic. The cons, for me personally, were that the female T & A was overkill, most seemed gratuitous, as well as some sex scenes. Despite this, it's an exciting series that will make you think. Someone give Fehr more juicy roles like this and let him run with it. He has an incredible onscreen presence and a strange kind of innate power emanating from him.
