Let me start by saying there is no bigger fan of the original "Lonesome Dove" than me. Both the Pulitzer Prize-winning book and the awesome mini-series adapted from it stand alone in my experience as exciting, dramatic, believable, and captivating work. There is no comparison between "Lonesome Dove" and any Western movie - at least not since the legendary collaborations of John Ford and John Wayne. It was with real reservations that I sat down to watch this new mini-series, with the non-participation of McMurtry and with the original cast members missing. After watching the first episode, it was clear that this is not "Lonesome Dove". In almost every measurable aspect, this sequel falls short of the original. But so what? I did not expect this to go well. Taken as an effort of its own, this film is engaging, fun and of very good quality. If this was done as a new story, not as a continuation of "Lonesome Dove," there is no doubt in my mind that it would not have received so many negative ratings. Jon Voight did a worthy job as Call, Barbara Hershey was a great Clara, and the new characters like Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well rendered and believable. Louis Gossett jr. deserves special mention as the organizer of horses Isom Pickett. The movie made me care about the characters, and I do not ask more than that about an actor. It is unfortunate that this worthy effort is in the shadow of its predecessor - it is worth being seen by itself.
