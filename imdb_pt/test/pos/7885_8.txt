New Yorkers contemporary to this film will remember how reflective their time is and how well the cast and crew captured America, the city of New York at the time. <br /> <br /> Norman Wexler's script outlines the different worlds of the various subgroups. live and direction of Avildsen brings phenomenal performances all around. The prodigious talent of Peter Boyle is on display like never before or after. Clearly, it's the best character portrait the ever-nice Dennis Patrick has ever performed. <br /> <br /> What I will always remember about JOE is the feeling of being in a virtual state of shock coming out of the theater. Knowing that what the canvas portrayed was boiling beneath the surface in neighborhoods throughout the five districts of New York City. <br /> <br /> This movie needs to be remembered.
