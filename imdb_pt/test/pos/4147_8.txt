This is a good movie, no doubt, but with some strange aspects. Without ruining anything, it happens only in three places: a Sicilian farm, the boat and Ellis Island in New York. All photos are closed, so we never see a wide sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? There are no street scenes anywhere, and we do not even see the boat except in close-ups. And the music ... what the hell was going on with Nina Simone's songs, decades before they left? I could have done without the milk business in the river too ...... But, hey, before you think of me as a pure misanthro, let me repeat, this is a very good film with painful moments, photography wonderful, great characters and more accurate than the usual (American) efforts in the immigration experience.
