I watched this movie the other night, and I have to admit, it was possibly the best movie of that generation. It turns out that I was not born until 1988, but I can relate to this movie as Cary Grant can relate to having an STD, or with Burt Reynolds as an exhaustion. Marky Mark did not decline so much beauty after a brief period in New Kids on the Block, which I would henceforth call "the best band in the world (aka BBW)." As it is totally a tale of morality about transvestites a 'poop , so watch out! I love you all and I continue to support Marky Msrk because he needs us now more than ever.He's the only boyee who survived De-sharted.
