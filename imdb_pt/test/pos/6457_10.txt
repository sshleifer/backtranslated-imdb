I first saw this movie in cable in the 80's and it shook me to the core. He appeared again on TV about six months ago. Filmed on location, black and white cinematography graphically portrays the 1950s in New York as the "urban jungle" at a time when there was much more industry and port activity in the city, particularly in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes has always brought a special intensity to his acting, and is magnificent in the role of the army crook. His short TV series "Johnny Staccato", 1959, is also a joy to see. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier and (later in the film) Ruby Dee bring freshness and vitality to their roles. But it is the superb performance of Jack Warden as the head of cruel and brutal turn that caught my attention. To get an idea of ​​Warden's versatility, watch this movie and check out a 1962 episode of the TV series "Naked City," entitled "The Specter of the Pink Street Gang." If you are a fan of movie noir, this is a must see. Appreciate!
