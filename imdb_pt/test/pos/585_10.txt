"Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side?" Kermit places this relatively simple double questioning near the beginning of "The Muppet Movie" as he sings his signature song, "The Rainbow Connection." Over time, the question and the film only gain depth. <br /> <br /> I will renounce the critique of this movie as a children's comedy, but instead consider it a classic for every generation love with serious ideals and a comforting message that gains more heat with each passing year. <br /> <br /> As the milestones in my own life arise in me, I hear more and more the evocative tensions of that elemental part. and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to someone's life because we all dream. And that's what this movie is about. It's not just a bunch of dolls - it's a bunch of puppets with the strength to pursue their dreams, which is a good lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> And while the humor and joy of the movie are always good, they are not a fair judge of the movie. Only "The Rainbow Connection" and the powerful emotions it will perform. And everything fits: "Rainbow Connection" * is * the movie Muppet, and vice versa. Existentialism finds infantile entertainment - there is no simpler way of describing it.
