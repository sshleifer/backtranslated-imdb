This is a short comedy of Laurel and Hardy, with some great and funny moments, but overall the film tells a little too much with just a comic premise. <br /> <br /> The comedic premise on which this film is based is very simple; Stan Laurel is not wearing pants. Laurel plays a na√Øve young woman from Scotland who arrives in the United States with everything. For some reason he gets the spotlight because of this and his uncle played by Oliver Hardy thinks that because of that, it's time to put some pants on Philip. <br /> <br /> Your mood is well executed, but the main premise also gets a little tiring after a while. Although the film definitely still has its great comedic moments, at the same time it is also far from the best of the many comedy short films of Laurel and Hardy that are still out there. The film is simply too simple to be considered one of the greatest, though it definitely is the most well executed, for the most part. Great fun, nothing memorable. /> <br /> 7/10
