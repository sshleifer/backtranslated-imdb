Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the cover girl - she's one of Danny McGuire's dancers, the most special according to Danny (Gene Kelly) and pretty much anyone who finds her. Take, for example, Vanity magazine mogul John Coudair (Otto Kruger): charmed by Rusty's resemblance to his grandmother Maribelle (also played by Hayworth in flashbacks), whom he courted devotedly when he fell in love with her, he tries to revive his youth fixing what he thinks went wrong between him and Maribelle. He does not believe Danny could give Rusty happiness, or anything she should be entitled to - he even gets Danny to believe that. When Rusty becomes famous as Vanity's "Cover Girl", Danny takes her into the ready and expected arms of Noel Wheaton (Lee Bowman). So what happens when Danny returns to town with his sidekick Genius (Phil Silvers), only to find out that Rusty is marrying Wheaton? <br /> <br /> As a musical, COVER GIRL benefits from the beautiful soundtrack and written songs. by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, including the Oscar nominee 'Long Ago and Far Away' (possibly one of the most beautiful ballads ever written and beautifully, sweetly sung by Hayworth and Kelly), the number of Maribelle 'Sure Thing' (the most mediocre "Poor John" is not a Kern / Gershwin collaboration and "Put Me To The Test." The dance, of course, is top notch, as Gene Kelly has had more than just a hand in choreography. dance with Hayworth for 'Put Me To The Test', or the cheerful and exuberant 'Make Way For Tomorrow' (performed by the trio of Danny, Rusty and Genius) ... which foreshadows the the character of Gene has police officer in the title number in SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN.Kelly especially scored a technological and artistic blow with the' Alter-Ego 'dance.As his successors in ANCHORS AWEIGH and AN AMERICAN IN PARIS (Jerry the Mouse and the 16-minute ballet respectively), this dance is a an example of the incredible innovation and creativity that Kelly brought to the modern music film: wanting to use the medium for current dances that could not be shown on stage, and years before CGI, Kelly insisted on dancing with the only person who could combine it in talent and style - himself. The number hardly lasts five minutes, but he (and Kelly's genius) still takes his breath, even after sixty years. This is the reason why I watched COVER GIRL, and if nothing else, this dance really worth it. <br /> <br /> You can tell that a lot of money was wasted on COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth - not that she does not deserve this. Witness the scene in which Rusty hits Broadway - the big screen showing all the different girls on the cover gives way to an incredibly large stage set up for Rusty's entrance. Hayworth is indeed one of the most beautiful and effortless girls in the film, and she dances with a style and grace almost worthy of Kelly. (Very few of Kelly's co-stars have that honor.) She's hilarious in some scenes, for example, her drunken scene when John and Wheaton come to get her from Joe. <br /> <br /> For some reason, however, her performance still lacks the spark of greatness that would help COVER GIRL overcome her general curse of mediocrity. This curse is only raised whenever Gene Kelly is on the screen (dancing or not), or when Eve Arden as John 'Stonewall' sidles' long suffering secretary for another cutting comment or clever remark. Because the film, in the end, belongs to Hayworth, neither Kelly nor Arden can save it as a whole. That's not to say the movie is bad - it's not. It's nice, with great songs, cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to see. But it's not quite a classic. The dance is classic - so check COVER GIRL for it, and you will not regret it.
