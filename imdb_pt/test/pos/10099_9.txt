Every word of praise fell well before the height of this film. This movie is the true example of how a psychological horror film should be. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be a little confusing at first glance, but it will definitely explain a bit about what is happening and you really want to see it for the second time. But after the second screening, you'll begin to piece together and then you'll know how amazing a movie can be. <br /> <br /> A word of warning for slasher fans stay away from this movie. This is not your dumb teen slasher movie, in which you simply turn off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big bds and lots of blood. <br /> <br /> If you want to increase the psychological horror factor of this movie and watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or 5.1ch DTS without any of your rude friends make jokes about a really tense situation. And do not forget to turn off the light. My points in different aspects: - Direction = 9/10 Performance = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total = 9/10
