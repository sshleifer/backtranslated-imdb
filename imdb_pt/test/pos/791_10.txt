This is one that you can watch over and over and laugh so much every time. We were at Keaton's party around here after buying some of his movies. In that case, Buster is mistaken for a murderer who escaped and there are many scenes of persecution and crazy scenes, but also the best in Buster - his creativity. The opening scene is very funny and keeps going from there.
