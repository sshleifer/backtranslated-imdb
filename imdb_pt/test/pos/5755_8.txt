This is a gem of a movie, the violence of the pie, the Simon Pegg and the Green Spew. <br /> <br /> A suspicious looking power plant and uncontrollable motorcycle contribute to this stonker. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, I recommend it, perhaps not as well as the background, but not too far. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen a man impaled by his nose on two hooks, then what are you waiting for to buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I did not even see the turnaround at the end when Ritchie and Eddie are both ghosts. <br /> <br /> Feeb - 1 boiled egg.
