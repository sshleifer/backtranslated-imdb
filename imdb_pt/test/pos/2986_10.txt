A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the music of Elton John. I remember seeing movies when I was a kid and for some reason (limited release?), I never met anyone else who saw this movie when it was released. <br /> <br /> The dreams that inspired me from decades ago never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought everything running back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their twenties) did not experience a similar emotional run. Generational thing? <br /> <br /> Why is not it on DVD?
