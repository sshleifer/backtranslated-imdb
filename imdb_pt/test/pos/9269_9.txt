I got into "The Closer She Gets" knowing it was the story of the filmmaker's mother battling cancer. I hoped it was a very distressing and depressing film. And while the subject is certainly emotionally violent, the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends. It shows the total dedication of a family to meet the challenge of cancer together. They refuse to lose faith in each other, even in the darkest moments. <br /> <br /> The most touching moments for me are when this faith is revealed. Small comments that mother and family make to each other that reveal (and their) will to survive, and their challenging emphasis on love and family unity. In this way, it is an uplifting and deeply hopeful film. We should all be lucky enough to be surrounded by such a family in times of serious illness.
