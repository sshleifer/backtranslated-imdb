I saw this at the BendFilm Festival Friday amid an unstable crowd of people, not helped by a bad decision from the event planners, who chose a totally inappropriate short film to precede the film. And this really played the public when Modern Love came up after a short, whimsical light (name I forget). <br /> <br /> People !!! It was very silly to mix this short with Modern Love - which is a serious drama. Film. <br /> <br /> So the audience gets the teaser which is a comedy and then ... Modern Love. Hmmmm Modern Love, despite my reservations (weird ending, a little too tangential) needed a short that was compatible with its strange strangeness, so my advice to programmers for next year is to take more care planning the show. <br /> <The people who watched Modern Love really did not know what had hit them - they were taken along the way and this is not their fault. <br /> <br /> Modern Love has great performances that play well. against the tangent meanders of the film - a film that its creator seems to have "thought out loud" instead of being executed in the normal way a film is scripted and filmed. <br /> <br /> Too bad the public was misinformed. Wrong placement in the session, wrong short film, wrong approach of well-meaning programmers, who, despite good efforts, need to see a lot more movies and travel to other festivals.
