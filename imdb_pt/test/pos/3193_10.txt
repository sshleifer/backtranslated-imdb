This was a television program I watched during the 1960s as a child, and I was captivated by it. In the many years that have passed, I often thought about this show and how good it would be to watch it again, but be aware that things of the past are not always as good as you remember them. This was a great show in the 1960s and did not lose anything even now in 2007. Of course there are some strange production mistakes you see when watching old shows, and it takes a few episodes to get accustomed to dubbed voices but having done that, I was as captivated now as in the 1960s. The Samurai is played by Koichi Ose, who plays the role in a very humble way. I remember that during the 60's due to the popularity of the show here in Australia, he did shows of swords etc, and was impressed by the interest in the show and in it. It was great that one of my all-time favorite shows still had the magic it did during my childhood. A must see series.
