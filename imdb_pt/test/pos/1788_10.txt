After the overall success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, CBS allowed Barbra to create an even more elaborate follow-up as her second special. Streisand knew wisely, in order to follow the innovative success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, that his second special indeed would need to raise even more the level of inventiveness and spectacle. Not surprisingly, she succeeded once more. Even more impressive, Streisand was able to mount this great production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME IS BARBRA. <br /> <br /> Once again, the special is divided into three distinct Acts. Filming in the Bergdorf Goodman department store was so successful in the first special that Streisand and company decided to film on location again for the first act of this second special. The site decided this time was the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which would allow Barbra infinite chances to "get" in different works of art that corresponded to the songs that were being performed. In addition to the myriad artistic possibilities that this location made possible, the museum would offer the perfect opportunity to enjoy the filming in color. <br /> <br /> After recording "Draw Me a Circle," which is against Opening Credits, Barbra then runs around the museum in a maid costume for the tensions of "Yesterday" Kern and Harbach. She stops to admire various paintings and statues, often becoming the character who is portrayed and singing a thematically appropriate song. Streisand plays "One Kiss" by Hammerstein and Romberg as Thomas Eakin's CONCERT SINGER, and features a hilarious performance of Chopin's "Minute Waltz" as Marie Antoinette, embraces abstract art with the frenetic pace of Peter Matz's Gotta Move. Performs a sweeping rendition of "Non C'est Rien" as a disturbed Modigliani girl. The highlight of Act I, however, is when Streisand compares the profiles to the bust sculpture of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti while singing a version of Rogers and Hart's "Where or When." The Act II circus medley allows Streisand to interact with various farm and circus animals while singing various farm / circus / animal themes. Some highlights include Barbra singing "It was that special face" for a baby elephant, playing "I grew accustomed to that face" as a serenade for a piglet, the exaggerated "Sam, you made the pants for Long" sung to a group of penguins baby, and Barbra comparing profiles with an anteater, singing "We have a lot in common." Streisand also swings on a trapeze and jumps from a springboard to the "Spring Again" chorus, and then slows down by running an astonishing rendition of "I stayed at the fair a lot" while sitting alone on stage. Barbra also has the chance to show off her pet poodle Sadie in this segment, and even speak a little French. <br /> <br /> The Act III show is once again the highlight of the hour. Dressed in a slender white wool dress, the concert segment is held on an exclusively designed stage with a partial staircase leading to nowhere. Streisand opens the act with a sultry version of Harold Arlen's "Anyplace I Hang My Hat Is Home," before launching candid versions of the familiar "It Had to Be You" and the rarely heard "C'est Si Bon." So good.) "Streisand then really amazes the audience with a breathtaking, powerful and octave performance of Sweet Charity's ballad" Where Am I Going, "which Streisand makes the definitive version of. Newly-written ballad by Richard Maltby, Jr.-David Shire "Starting Here, Starting Now," which contains a passionate vocal of Streisand who is among the best vocal performances of his long career. <br /> <More Than Any Other Color Me Barbra was a showcase of Streisand's growing mega-watt star power. Despite the presence of even more visual glare, Streisand herself is always the main attraction. Her voice sounds as beautiful as ever, and this special was the first to show how impressive she photographs in color.As with MY NAME IS BARBRA, COLOR ME BARBRA was another great success and spawned another album of Top Five and Gold soundtracks. ME BARBRA defies tradition and appears as a sequence that is almost close to a classic original.
