I must say that this film had a great cast, locations, music and camera work. Cameron Diaz was great, she had a very exciting, very noisy move, while Jordana Brewster played an important role still capturing one. to me Jordana is very nostalgic, she reminds me of a female classmate of mine! What really brought me in this film was the very well planned camera work and the choice of venues. the story is very talented writing. you must see one. those who are into mystery movies must watch this, I assure everyone that they will keep it in their seats until the end.
