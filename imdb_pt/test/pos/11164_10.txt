I just saw this movie in a preview and I can only recommend watching it. It was about 90 minutes long and when it turned out I felt I could continue for hours. The stories of the protagonists are so realistic and you really feel at home. The movie basically consists of dialogues, but I was not bored for a minute. 18 people from really different characters and each of them acted so well. I had to laugh, I felt uncomfortable, I was sad and I still felt happiness. In short, it is a film that shows the different types of people in our society, the way they communicate and how love has changed and is nowadays treated as an economic thing. Dating becomes something akin to hearing. The whole public loved it. So, please note if there is a possibility. You will love!
