Honestly, this is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. I was captivated by the story, petrified by Captain Howdy and on the edge of my seat the whole way. I really do not understand all the negative reviews. <br /> <br /> The montage has already been discussed in depth; Captain Howdy is an online predator who organizes encounters with teenagers, kidnaps them and introduces them to their favorite body modification and piercing pastime. Dee Snider is Captain Howdy and he is one of the scariest psychopaths ever created; perhaps the most scary because he is so human and you get the feeling (especially if you are into body modification) that there really are such people in the world. <br /> <br /> But the biggest reason I liked this movie and the reason it's so horrible is that Captain Howdy becomes the hero. At the beginning of the film, the roles are clear; the victims are innocent, the policeman is the good guy and Howdy is the pure evil. In the second act, however, things have changed a bit. You want it to be an evil, but it turns out he's just a victim of circumstances and maybe the good and the bad are not obvious. It's scary to find yourself cheering for the "bad" guy. <br /> <br /> Some people mentioned that Strangeland should have been split into two separate films. To be sure, there are definitely two separate "acts", but this film works so well because the two acts are back to back. The first act is the typical psychopath, but the second act is most disturbing because of the reaction of the viewers to the situation. I do not think it would have worked in the same way if the second act were expanded and made a continuation. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of horror movies, I highly recommend this movie. It's the first horror movie that always gives me nightmares.
