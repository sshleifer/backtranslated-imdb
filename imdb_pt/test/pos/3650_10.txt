Before I forget, let me tell you that the art here is excellent. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the designs are beautifully made. If this were not encouraged, the critics would be praising the "direction" here, because it is very good. <br /> <br /> For the story: Sylvester is scavenging the garbage in the yards, but the pickins are slim. . As he collides on the dock next to a large ship, on a lookout he sees Tweety in his cage. Tweety also sees it, and you know his first comment - the same thing he always does when he sees the cat. Anyway, Sylvester runs, opens the lookout and says, "Hello, breakfast!" Tweety hits the lookout window on his face and says, "You old crazy cat!" The cat falls into the water. <br /> <br /> The fearless Sylvester quickly returns aboard the ship, walks on tiptoe in Tweety's cabin, grabs it and is ready to leave when - wham! - there's "Granny" at the door with her umbrella. Sylvester takes a beating when the old woman protects her pet once more. But, "flippety gibbet," says Grandma, "I dropped my glasses. I can not see a thing without them. Gods to Betsey, where are those cheaters." <br /> <br /> Now Sylvester has the upper hand ... and the normal cat-trying-catch-bird-perip√©cias are back, like Grandma's glasses. Sylvester's smarter act was to get the glasses and paint a picture of Tweety on them, so when she woke up and put them on, she saw the bird and thought it was okay. <br /> <br /> Overall, a fun short animation that was a lot of fun to watch. As you can tell from the quotations, I love dialogue in some of these old drawings.
