This is probably the best movie filmed for at least the last five years. I've always believed that making people cry is a lot harder than making them laugh. If you want to see 400 screaming adults aloud in the same room, go see this movie. It is breathtaking. Javier Bardem plays the role of his life. You will cry, you will laugh, you will smile ... The most deserving fact is that in Spain everyone knows about Ramon Sampedro. Personally I knew the whole story and by the end of it. So the film's excellence lies in the way the story is told. And in this field, Amenabar is a master. <br /> <br /> This movie is mandatory.
