When I watch this movie I also get excited when I see missing bed world scenes. She has a beautiful and charming body. When cute lady do bed scenes and show her body totally naked ... I think man has difficulty resisting .... think it's time for beautiful girls like hrishita bhatt also do nude scenes. At least no one wants to keep the body of ugly women like Seema biswas in the bandit queen. I agree with what Mallicka said. The film is portrayed in a way that appears to be a kind of defamation in the original content. Emotions are not transmitted correctly. I think a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to their mediocrity. In my opinion, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role, rather than Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she seems a bit sexy, which is not what the film should have portrayed. I also noticed a little over-action in some of his scenes. I am a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) I can not help it; Sorry about that. 'Raincoat' was a good Rituparno Ghosh movie. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed
