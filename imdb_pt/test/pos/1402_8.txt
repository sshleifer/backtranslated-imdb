This is a very strange film for Harold Lloyd - at least in relation to the sweet character he played in the 1920s and 1930s. Instead of a cool guy, he and Snib Pollard are swindlers to rob everyone blind. In a particularly successful coup, Chester pretends to have lost a "very valuable ring" and a little later, Harold thinks as a puppet is also looking for the ring. The ring, of course, is cheap and then found by Harold, but the greed of the puppet is so great that he "convinces" Harold to say nothing and sell him the "valuable" ring and then run away for fun. your luck (?). Again and again they find patsies until they meet a woman who herself is a con man (working with a guy doing fake sessions). She catches a trap and takes all the money she stole - and has a police officer ready to make sure they give her the money. <br /> <br /> Luckily, the two crooks stumble across shady deals when no one is home. Soon, you return and tinker with your minds - releasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their bad manners. <br /> <br /> All around, this is a completely weird and invented film, but it's also extremely funny, as the jokes work very well and Lloyd and Pollard make a great team. Besides, though scary and strange, he liked to see Pollard dressed as a lady.
