This movie proves that you do not need a Hollywood budget to do something fun to watch. What struck me was how the team from different places managed to unite without promises of wealth to do something just because they believed in it. I think anyone who makes low budget films can relate to certain scenes, like actors who just can not get that line, being bothered by the police, and having most of the crew disappear after the first week. No one was paid for it, which tells a lot to the people who had to travel around the country and the long hours spent in the edition. After seeing Stuie sell his personal property, use his own money and ruin his house to make the movie, I'm a bit curious about how much his wife may have gotten close. Good work for everyone.
