This is not your typical Indian movie. There is a great sense of humanity, and the characters are very realistic. There is great dynamism in interpersonal relationships, and there is a sense of guilt, regret, passion, passivity among the many characters. Seeing this, we have the feeling of the heavy burden of the 5000 years of layers and layers of the history of the social existence of one of the oldest civilizations. The final scene of an elephant pulling away in the countryside was a great footnote to such an ancient civilization, yet human relationships are still preserved and nurtured. I saw on DVD, the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting. He was surprised to learn that the film did not go well (or was not shown) in India (... but perhaps not very surprised). The artistic heritage of rural societies is slowly being lost and its heritage is not absorbed by the younger generations as some of the film's earliest musicians are no longer living today. Great movie.
