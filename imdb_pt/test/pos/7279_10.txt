Wow, I loved this movie, this movie was full of twists, good acting, great story and an amazing ending. To be completely honest, this film was not overly bloody, but it contained some blood, but it was more of a psychological side. I read on the internet: The movie cost $ 3000 and was filmed in 8 days. Amazing!!! This is for someone who wants to think and loves making great movies. What begins as a terrifying thriller slowly turns into something a bit more distorted, even a little more sinister. There's not much I can say without giving plot points just that this movie went beyond my expectations
