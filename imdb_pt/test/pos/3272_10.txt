I remember getting this movie on a C4 screening a year ago and I was completely overwhelmed by the whole thing. I thought the film managed to represent a diversity of genres; the supernatural, a love story, the intrigue of crime, and many more. <br /> <br /> I got hooked on everything after a minute and was really worried about the characters. It made me feel terrified for a second by Jimmy, and then made me laugh at the bandits at the next ... and all the while I had my fingers crossed that things would work out for Jimbo! <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are superb, Bryan Brown is of utter quality and left me crumpled, along with David Field, who was funny as well as being an evil idiot. <br /> <br /> Since I've seen this movie I've been able to order it on DVD and as a result, every person I've shown has been hooked in the same way. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for a Sunday afternoon or a lazy night, and it's one that you can really enjoy with your mates around.
