With the recent release of Carlos Saura's 'Fados' in the United States (although only a limited art house has been released), it's time to relaunch this great documentary about Amalia Rodrigues. This film is a treasure trove of Amalia's old clips on American and American television as well as several other movie clips including one from her mother who could easily reduce the man's most macho man to tears. I first saw this excellent documentary a few years ago, when it received the unjustified release of the "art house" (which deserved much better). Fortunately, there are several recordings of Amalia's best recordings on various "budget line" recordings (which are usually available at venues like K-Mart or Best Buy), or if you do a little research, some of the releases may be improved originals, or E-Bay, or one of these distribution services specializing in imported and expensive European CDs. There are at least two versions of this documentary in circulation (the original English version, without English subtitles, and the English version with English subtitles, except that the European version can not be played on most USDVD players because of the color PAL line system). Not classified by MPAA, but contains nothing to offend.
