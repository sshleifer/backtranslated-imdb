I just watched this, a short film Harold Lloyd who presented his character "Glasses" on the Kino Video DVD of "The Harold Lloyd Collection". He is actually a con man with Snub Pollard as his partner, which is discovered by Bebe Daniels, who does fake sessions. What she discovers is that Lloyd and Pollard deceive many customers by abandoning "lost" fake rings. I stop there and just say it was very funny especially when Harold and Snub enter the place where Bebe works and find some creepy gadgets and put on clothes like Snub trying on one of Baby's clothes. Not much slapstick but what there was also was a lot of fun. So, on that note, do I recommend Are Crooks Dishonest?
