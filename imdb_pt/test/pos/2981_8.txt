My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy surrounding the original release (nudity among teenagers, physical intimacy and unmarried pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were about the same age as Paul and Michelle and experienced many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to be caught up in simplistic attitudes (sometimes) and quarrelsome emotional twists (sometimes). This movie told us in a way that a love story for adults could never have. I still remember sitting at the movies with my girlfriend and holding her hand while she cried during the tragic final scenes.
