The Beatles had just done "Magical Mystery Tour". There was the general feeling that performance, peace, and drugs went together naturally. In Los Angeles, there was a film subculture that knew something was happening. Nicholson was in several of these gangs. Before seriously deciding to become an actor, before 'Easy Rider' before 'Pink Flamingos', before 'Day for Night', there were several experiences with what to do about it. An important one is the "Manuscript of Saragossa". This is another. <br /> <br /> Jack writes. It touches with circular narrative, self-reference, cinematic reference, self-aversive performance, the pain of creation, all on the periphery of the safe kiddiepop. You should see this even if only to know something about Jack. <br /> <br /> Certain actors act by digging in on themselves. It is a common technique. Some dig deep, but after a while, they become annoying because they are incredibly shallow people. There are not just enough things to sustain a career. Think of DeNiro and Hackman. <br /> <br /> Others are very interesting people, who seem to become more interesting over time. When they enter the barrel, they put things back because of the pain of the dig. Think Sean Penn and Jack. At the bottom of Jack's barrel, at the end of the wire, it spins, as every character's base is this experimental and risky writer / filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Who cares if it's a bad movie? It's bad because you took risks. Notice when a tear is wiped from Annette's cheek by the director. It's a love affair in the whole Brando thing, something I've heard Marlon laughing. This is one of the richest moments in the history of Hollywood cinema. <br /> <br /> There's another reason to watch this. Music in the movies has a strong root in dance. Revolution in cinema often depends on music. Entire crops are thus drawn. <br /> <br /> A gigantic giant, inventing how billions now dance, is Toni Basil. She was as influential in pop choreography as the Beatles were in music. She was already well into her career when called to work on it. But this is one of his first onscreen appearances. You can see her work everywhere and herself in the really cool segment of 'Daddy's Girl', about one of Nilsson's best songs. (Followed by Frank Zappa's cameo.) McCartney would refer to this scene in his special years of TeeVee afterwards. <br /> <br /> A third reason to watch is early (about 6 and a half minutes) in the movie: a character named 'Lady Pleasure' kisses each Monkey in a long, continuous shot and then walks away. She is credited as I. J. Jefferson, but is actually Mimi Manchu, Nicholson's lover at the time and a partner of LSD. Red hair, psychedelic behavior. Lovely. This scene says it all to me, about how Jack feels about the boys. <br /> <br /> Ted's rating - 3 out of 3: Worth seeing.
