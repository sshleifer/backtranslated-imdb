Famous French detective Henri Cassin takes his first vacation in 11 years in St. Margot, where he meets Nanette, the daughter of vacationers. Although Nanette was promised to her childhood, Leon, Henri and Nanette fall in love and decide to marry, despite Nanette's father opposing Henri's age. On the day of the wedding, Leon returns and Nanette runs after him. Nothing is heard of them until both are found dead, and Henri swears that he will not rest until he finds the killer. The only clue Henri has to work with is a footprint found by Leon, but he is also receiving written warnings that others will soon die. Soon the mother of Nanette is found dead and Henri has no idea of ​​the identity of the assassin. Thinking to be a failure, he returns to Paris, then realizes (and fears) that the killer may be just one person, though none of his colleagues can believe his explanation. Out of the ordinary murder mystery that does not really follow the formula in another genre by Columbia or other B Studios. Credit for this certainly goes to the director Lewis who manages to turn this into a noirish movie despite the setting of the movie, also aided by use of good camera and lighting. Geray has a very good performance in probably his only leadership and the rest of the cast is able to take his performance. Evaluation, 8.
