If you are looking for a movie that is fast and will not bore you, then this is the place. It's fast and funny with some decent acting from the characters. It's always hard for me to see Mark Walhberg as anything except Marky Mark. This image is burned in my mind forever. As an actor, he is very good. This movie is a must see for action fans who like to see some twists and turns. I'm going to have to get this movie one day and buy it.
