When you think of brilliant Australian comedy you do not think Skit shows (although I'm quite partial to a little 80 and 90 Full Frontal) or even Sitcoms - you think of SATIRE! Something that we Australians really know how to do well. (For example: Front Line, The Micallef Program) We know how to get pi $$, and The Chaser War on Everything, is a classic example of how to do this and how to do it very well. <br /> <br /> I've been a big fan of Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel for a long time. I remember hearing them on Triple J's afternoon show. They were, and still are, two of the funniest comedians in the world. <br /> <br /> Although it made me sad when they left Triple J, I was excited to find out they were investing so much time that they needed to leave. (They were doing CNNNN and Triple J at the same time, so I realized this was something much bigger.) And what an incredibly HILARIOUS show is the Chaser. Political and social bite at best. <br /> <br /> I am also pleased to say that it recently received MUCH better hours than Friday nights and was moved to Wednesday evenings after Spicks and Specks. THANK YOU ABC !! Finally I do not have to record it! :)
