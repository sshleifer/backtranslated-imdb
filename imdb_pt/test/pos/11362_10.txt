Anyone who has enjoyed this series when they made the first broadcast (I ran home from school to see) is now a certain age, so I can only add my comments to those asking for a DVD release to allow us to relive the memories of the first broadcast . before it simply became a piece of the history of unrecorded TV files. If so many old TV shows from the sixties and seventies can be released, why not this? Certainly the releases of rights can not be so difficult. Most of Shakespeare's lines I can cite come from this iconic series and I remember exchanging them with my classmates as we tried to overcome each other's memories of each other's text. Peter Dews rightly deserved credit for having the acumen of bringing him to the screen. This certainly was public broadcasting at its best. Robert Hardy and Sean Connery battling to death - is fascinating and from the beginning of the golden age of BBC Television. Come on the BBC. Clean and license please. March 2009 So finally the DVD is here and congratulations to those who made it happen. The picture quality is incredibly good and the performances as good as the memory. Now all those who cry for it must buy it and relive those magical moments. <br /> <br /> British spectators. Since the series was made in the UK by the BBC using British actors, it is strange that the DVD is not available on the Region 2 (Europe) DVD and can only be imported from the US and played on modified players. It seems unlikely that there are major rights issues, perhaps the market is considered too small, so why was not the 'free region' liberated on Earth? so that everyone could have fun?
