This was my wife's favorite movie. I'm sorry she did not live long enough to have the video because I'm sure she would have used the video. What can we say? A great romantic story and the thrust of two great men, Raisuli and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are great at these roles. But while Connery is his usual sexy sex, it's the late Brian Keith that gives us a solid performance as the mercurial Teddy Roosevelt. Back up comes with Candy Bergen, gorgeous in her 30s as the abducted American widow. Great back-up also comes from the great John Huston as Teddy's besieged SecState, John Hay; Geoffrey Lewis, of Clint Eastwood's films, is great as the hesitant US ambassador, Gummere; the late Vladek Sheybal with his demonic and malevolent look is great as the Beshaw and much more is given by Steve Kanaly and Roy Jensen whose faces we have already seen in various origins. All in all, this is a movie full of wonderful romance, aware of an era that is gone. Mindless story? Not at all. The question of the great nations pushing the smaller nations to their own hegemonic interests is as true today as it was then. Excessively romantic? Not really - certainly not sentimental in any sense. Fun to watch? You bet. I own the video and watch it again and again. I suggest you do the same.
