As in a circle, the film takes back to its starting point, the image of the cranes crossing a Moscow sky. They represent the freedom to carry out your life as you wish, in order to aspire to the greatest possible accomplishment. <br /> <br /> At first Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness, and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in joy. It seems they can live up to their dreams. <br /> <br /> But man is not a bird. Life elaborates its own rules, from which no human can escape and which we can not change - not even making a supreme effort. The war breaks out, and without much hesitation, Boris enters the front to do his patriotic duty. He can not even say goodbye to Veronica, for she arrives late to the meeting point from which the soldiers are sent away. Surrounded by an exultant crowd, all her attempts to attract Boris's attention must inevitably fail. <br /> <br /> Boris ends up being killed in the war, without Veronica learning it at the moment. His brother Mark, a vigorous musician, who has been exempted from military service for corruption, is eager to take his place. Veronica initially resists, but on a terrible night of bombing she is finally a victim of her charms. A marriage happens, which is never accepted by the family. <br /> <br /> Soon feelings of guilt overtake Veronica and she realizes that Boris' return is the one thing she really wants. She therefore relieves her bad conscience and despair of the selfless work in a field hospital. <br /> <br /> When the war is finally over, once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gather to cheer the victorious soldiers. Again Veronica is among them, forcing her way through a wall of bodies. In her hand, she is carrying a bouquet of flowers until she finally has to hand him over to complete strangers, as one of the homecomers has just thwarted her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of Boris's death. <br /> <br /> Once again the cranes invade the sky, drawing their rebel lines. But now Veronica is watching them alone, and the look in her eyes is different. She had to accept the impossibility of living according to preconceived plans, to follow the orientations of her dreams. For all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the inscrutable strings of fate. <br /> <br />
