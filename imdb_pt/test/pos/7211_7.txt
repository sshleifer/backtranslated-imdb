Can this really be a Troma movie? Some scenes almost have an "A" movie appearance. The acting is generally competent (the two leaders and the nurse substitute were especially good, and I enjoyed some of the confrontations between the young Capulet and Ques); the scenes were gently edited; the plot is coherent. It is funny. It has an original and modern soundtrack. <br /> <br /> He has the usual brutishness of Troma and low mood, but I do not think Shakespeare would have cared so much. In fact, I think he may have gotten some good laughs out of it. <br /> <br /> It's a good DVD. There is an alternative soundtrack with a very informative commentary from the director, several deleted scenes, and Troma's usual self-deprecating nonsense collection. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you that it was Citizen Kane. , but it is a well-inspired and low-budget cinema.
