An incredibly harrowing account of two soldiers in World War II. Against the backdrop of the freeze not only of fighting the Nazis and traitors in Belarus, but also of the harsh natural elements, this film tells a story of two soldiers of polarized morality, one who survives but finds it rather impossible to deal with his circumstances, and those who die, having done all that can be done in the face of intimidation and all that is possible to break the spirit, in fact, the "ascendant" of the title. A film that must be seen by all, particularly by the phenomenal performances of the main characters, and by the creepy excerpts (incarceration and outstanding scenes, in particular, an absolute must see.
