This is a very good documentary. I'm not a skateboarder, I particularly do not like skateboarding or skating culture. But somehow, for about two hours, this movie interested me in the subject. <br /> <br /> I would not call it the most intriguing movie ever, but for some reason, when those guys were talking about how they started their skateboard clubs and were skating in those empty Southern California pools, I was interested. <br /> <br /> I should also add that the music in this movie was also very good. I do not sit eager to hear more 70's rock bands, but it seemed appropriate to what they were talking about.
