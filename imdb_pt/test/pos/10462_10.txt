this is one of the best movies I've ever seen ... the austere setting ... the isolation ... the intolerant and ignorant people who hide behind their religion ... a backdrop to some words and sophistication. .. the acting is completely natural ... but for me as a "foodie" the best is the real choice and preparation of the party .. I spent time in Paris and get to know the kitchen ... or not the English coffee really exists I dont know but I know of similar establishments and menu babette and choice of wines are authentic ... and of course the end where even though the perfect meal loving them back to friendship is the only end that could be .. this is a 10 out of 10 movies and should be seen by anyone with brains and good taste to understand
