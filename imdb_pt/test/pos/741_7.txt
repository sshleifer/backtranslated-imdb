The Doctor. Stephens (Michael Harvey), head of an institute for insane people with insufficient personnel, adopts a "progressive" approach to the treatment of his patients, allowing even his lunatics to complete the freedom of the building, day and night; however, he pays the price of his reasoning when he stupidly prescribes cutting wood with an ax as therapy for one of his patients, and consequently confuses the neck with a piece of wood (he does not suggest basketry). Soon after this tragic incident, nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the hospital to position herself as an assistant physician, and discovers that the facility is now being directed by the very stern Dr. Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick ). Although not aware of her deceased predecessor's decision to employ Beale, and not particularly anxious to hire new staff, Dr. Masters agrees to let the nurse begin work, but after several distressing hospital experiences, Charlotte begins to to ask if it could have been better if she had been refused. <br /> <br /> It does not take a genius to figure out what's really going on in the hospital, the 'lunatics have taken over the asylum' schtick being a premise that should be familiar to more experienced terror fans, but SF Brownrigg's Do not Look In The Basement even proved to be a fun drive-in piece, thanks to its well-defined collection of freaks: lobotomized, sucking cock sucker Sam (Bill McGhee); Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross), who continually murmurs sentences in court; old Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams), who recites William Allingham's creepy poem, The Fairies, and warns Charlotte about the imminent fate; laughing with Danny (Jessie Kirby), who delights in provoking the other patients; Harriet (Camilla Carr), who thinks her doll is a real baby; Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin); and best of all, Allyson King (Betty Chandler), whose rejection by a series of men left her with a desire for love (that is, she tries to jump over any man who approaches her). <br /> <br /> This compellingly crazy set of characters, plus a bit of blood and nudity, reasonable direction from Brownrigg (who also gave us the awesome white trash scum of the Earth), and a solid turn of the covergirl of Playboy Holotik, everyone will turn an otherwise somewhat predictable, low-budget, exploitative into a psycho very watchable shock.
