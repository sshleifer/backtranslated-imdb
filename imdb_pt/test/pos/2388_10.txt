I watched the movie for the second time on September 30, 2006 and thought it was even better than the first time I saw it. I really enjoyed the performance, especially "Uncle Benny". I thought Fred Carpenter did a great job writing and directing this movie. The plot definitely kept its interest and I hope this movie reaches the top. I felt that changed very smoothly between the scenes and the surprise at the end, well, let's just say I did not see this happen. I also thought that Craig, the actor who played "Eddie Monroe" did a great job and I hope this film helps him go further in his acting career. From start to finish, I really enjoyed it.
