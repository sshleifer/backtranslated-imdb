Hello, I was wondering if anyone has a copy of the movie Broken Promise? I loved this movie growing up and watching it every time it was on. It has been YEARS since I saw it and would like to receive a copy. I checked the entire internet and could not find it. If anyone has a copy to market or sell please email NoelGypsy@Yahoo.com ... Thank you and have a great night !! Christine --------- The "broken promise" was made to Melissa Michaelsen, an 11-year-old whose parents abandoned her and her siblings. Taken by the county, Michaelsen had to watch impotently as his brothers and sisters are divided and distributed to different families. One of the children is even institutionalized. Juvenile court officer Chris Sarandon joins Michaelsen in his fight to reunite his family under one roof. Broken Promise was originally offered as a "General Foods Golden Showcase" presentation. It was the first broadcast on May 5, 1981.
