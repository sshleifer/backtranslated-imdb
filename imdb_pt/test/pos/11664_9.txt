"Dead Man Walking" is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen. I find it hard to believe that anyone, having seen the movie, could feel indifferent about the movie or its message. Tim Robbins does not try to impose his ideas and beliefs on viewers, but he manages to make a film that is, for the most part, sympathetic to both views of the death penalty - whether murdering a murderer or not. I have always known where I am on this issue, even as a child, and this film - despite the fact that it does not really make any difference - has made me even more certain in my conviction that it can never be right to kill anyone. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant in his interpretation of Matthew Poncelet, his Oscar nomination was very well deserved. Even if Nicolas Cage did a great job on Leaving Las Vegas, I would be happier if Penn had won the award. Susan Sarandon is also brilliant and she deserved the Oscar that she won. And Tim Robbins certainly deserves the vote I gave to this film: 9/10!
