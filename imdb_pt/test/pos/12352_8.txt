Pistol-Packing Pam Grier takes names and kick ass as the heroine in "Asylum of Satan", entertainment director William Girdler, blaxploitation actor "Sheba Baby" co-starring D'Urville Martin and Austin Stoker. "Sheba Baby" is one of several difficult girl movies that Grier appeared in the 1970s, including "Coffy", "Foxy Brown" and "Friday Foster". The short-lived Girdler co-wrote this routine-eyed private potboiler with producer David Shelton in one night and features a stubborn female shamus who refuses to trust a man to help her take care of business. Unfortunately, "Sheba Baby" is not as good as the blaxploitation films that Grier did under the supervision of director Jack Hill. Hill commanded the African-American native of North Carolina in "Coffy," "Foxy Brown," "The Big Bird Cage," and "The Big Doll House." Anyone who analyzes images of African-American women in the movies should be familiar with these epics. The main problem with "Sheba Baby" is that our heroine makes many convenient breaks. Of course, the secondary villains are happy cats who have failed to reach the side of a barn with a howitzer. As the main antagonist, Dick Merrifield qualifies as both a selfish villain and a villain with lines of choice such as: "It's worth stealing anything worthwhile." In addition, composer Monk Huggins provides a strong and atmospheric orchestral soundtrack, and the best song, with Barbara Mason stumbling, is "Good Man Is Gone." "Sheba Baby" launches Grier as Chicago stylist Sheba Shayne. She leaves Windy City to return to her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, to help her father. When she arrives in Louisville, Sheba discovers that her father, Andy (Rudy Challenger of "Detroit 9000"), is having trouble with a local black gangster nicknamed Pilot (D'Urville Martin of "Hammer") who demands that Andy sell his loan company to Pilot or die. <br /> <br /> Initially, the pilot dispatches a daunting squad to destroy Andy's office, but the father of our heroine catches them in the act. They turn Sheba's father into a punching bag. Interestingly, during the fighting scene, Girdler rarely shows fists breaking flesh. Earlier, Andy's right arm, Brick Williams (Austin Stoker of "Horror High"), sent Sheba a telegram requesting her to return to Louisville, but she did not immediately receive him thanks to her lazy partner who did not know where to find her . Brick and Sheba connect, rekindle their romantic flames and share a night in the bag. Brick spends most of the time asking Sheba to remain calm in the face of adversity. As a former Louisville, Kentucky, Sheriff, Sheba prefers filming first and asking questions second. After she arrives home, Sheba borrows her father's car and narrowly escapes. As she walks out the door to get into her father's car, Andy gets another harassing call from the pilot. Previously, Andy refused to discuss the possibility of selling his loan company to Pilot, but Andy changed his mind and agreed to talk to the villain. A grateful Pilot warns Andy about the dynamite that was attached to his ignition with a delayed-action fuse. In other words, firing the car will not cause the explosion; the explosion comes ten seconds later. Andy and Brick rescue Sheba before the car explodes. Earlier, Sheba agreed to let her father handle his problems without their interference. "Dad, I know you think I'm doing a man's job, but I'm not going to sit backstage just because I'm a woman," says Sheba. After her near-death experience, Sheba promises to learn who sabotaged her father's car. She crumples an old contact from her days as a cop and threatens the guy with her gun to extract the information. Only after Sheba has ground the subject's face into a bucket of chlorine powder does he regret it and tell her about a payment at the city's railway museum. Brick follows with Sheba and the shooting follows with a disturbed pilot escaping through the skin of his chin. <br /> <br /> Later, the pilot sends a quintet of bandits out of town, armed to the teeth, to the trash. Andy's office. These guns ignore their requests without killing. Not only do they shoot the tape-lending company's office, but they also blow up Sheba's father with a shotgun. Sheba retaliates in no time. Wielding her nickel-plated revolver, she knocks down three of the four Dirty Harry style assailants. The last killer discards his weapon and begs for mercy. Sheba has her finger on the trigger when homicide detective Phil Jackson (Charles Kissinger of "Abby") and a uniformed police officer arrive at the scene. At the hospital, Andy Shayne dies holding his daughter's hand. Of course, Pilot is furious at this revelation and his fury is borderline apoplexy. After that, Sheba traces a loan sharksman, Walker (Christopher Joy of "Cleopatra Jones"), and extracts information from him on the pilot while holding him under the sight of a gun in a car wash. This is one of the best scenes staged with many sinister photos of whirling and buzzing car wash equipment. Walker warns Pilot about Sheba. Pilot and his henchmen confront Sheba in a parking lot and change lanes. Sheba flees on foot for a carnival nearby. While police corner one of the pilot's men, she handles the others. The pilot shoots one of his own accidentally and Sheba hits him. She catches Pilot on a roller coaster track and threatens to hold him until the roller coaster cuts off her head. Pilot manages to escape after spilling his insides to Sheba over the identity and telephone number of the great man, Shark (Dick Merrifield of "The Hellcats"), whose reputation is so immaculate that Detective Jackson describes him as "the guy with everything the right answers ". "Sheba Baby" is not the top-notch Pam Grier. However, the idea that our heroine can handle everything on her own without the help of guys makes it interesting, just like the fun girl movie.
