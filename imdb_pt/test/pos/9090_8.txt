Flatliners has all the ingredients of a good Joel Schumacher movie - clever and young characters, stunning cinematography, an exciting story and great acting. It's an escapist fun, but it's fine and resonates with a positive spiritual message, despite the unnerving precedents. <br /> <br /> Schumacher has a knack for identifying talented young actors, and all five major ones have moved on to bigger things (see the cast list). His credible performances help raise this film well above average. Kiefer Sutherland shines in his selfish role as a medical student. <br /> <br /> Cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain, which is what I love about Schumacher; its use of light and location creates images that remain glued. It creates a disturbing nightmarish atmosphere that makes you restless while watching the movie and haunts you when you go to bed - reminded me of The Lost Boys. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that has an incredible premise - curious students want to find out what is after death and successfully follows on a scary and exciting story of redemption. One of Schumacher's best; highly recommended.
