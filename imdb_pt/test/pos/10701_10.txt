"Ninja 3: The Domination" by Sam Firstenberg, mixes martial arts with "The Exorcist" as a horror. The elements of terror played on screen are simply laughable, but the movie works like an action / martial arts movie. The fight scenes are well choreographed. and exciting, and the movie is never boring. So forget stupid dialogue, lame acting and annoying soundtrack - grab some beer and check out this one! Highly recommended!
