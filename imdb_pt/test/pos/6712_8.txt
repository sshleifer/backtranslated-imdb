For the guy who shocked the idea of ​​Lifeforce, I have one thing to say: Thank you, sir! Lifeforce combines the science-fiction pomp of Star Trek: The Movie with Phantasm's terrifying horror adventures and beats it all with t-ts - and some real meat hooks ... And best of all, it's actually a good movie! It amazes me that someone actually justified a mainstream movie that is a vehicle for a hottie to appear naked on the screen for an hour and a half to the producers. God bless you, all of you who were involved. <br /> <br /> Steve Railsback (Helter Skelter) plays Colonel Carlson, the American commander of an international space mission sent to investigate Comet Halley. Carlson's team finds an alien ship inside the comet and inside it they find three naked people in suspended animation - two guys and a hottie (Mathilda May). Well, to shorten the story, they are "space vampires" ... "naked space vampires." They do away with the crew, with the exception of Cel. Blueballs, who decided that he had to let the hottie out of his lucite showcase because the part of his brain that controls his nutty fluids told him that it was the right thing to do. The colonel flies back to our big blue ball in an escape pod. Meanwhile, another space shuttle crew discovered its ship floating in space and brought the three space coffins of the undead Martians back to London. And that's where people start to turn into greasy and, in general, starts to get out of control very quickly. <br /> <br /> Carlson joins the ruthless Colonel Caine (Peter Firth). the British SAS to track down our cute nude - who's having a hell of a time sucking guys to the left and right. Carlson has discovered that he has a mental bond with Vampira that allows them to locate her with the ultimate goal of blowing up her butt and ruining her and her large space umbrella that sucks the energy of the people who attack you vampires. Will they succeed in time? SPOILER: Yes. Wow. What can I say, but "Wow"? This damn movie really works. I can not believe they have British actors like Aubrey Morris and Patrick Stewart (Sexiest Man Alive or some other title) to appear in this movie. All the actors are good. The direction is good and really shines during the last half, where we see the fantastic devastation of London. Special effects are also not sloppy. By 1985, this movie must have been as fast as possible. All the effects are quite impressive and there is a wide variety of talents on display here in animotronics, makeup effects, light shows and very nice space scenes with good old modeling and a matte painting - very well done. There are even some bloody and bloody scenes for all the horror fanboys out there. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a great movie for anyone who has nostalgia for when popular bigsceen movies were made with 100% love from start to finish. finish. The creators of the film really made sure that all the bases were covered and the end result is a phenomenally fun affair that does not allow you to move away because the procedures are very beautiful. Solid real entertainment here: 8 1/2 out of 10.
