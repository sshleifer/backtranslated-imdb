Operation Scorpion (AKAThe Scorpion King) does not slip to full speed until the last 25 minutes, but when the action reaches full speed, it offers some truly amazing martial arts scenes that demand the attention of the viewer. Does not that mean the first hour is useless ?? only that compared to the final of the fight party, it seems a little below expected. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Yuk-Su, a talented comic artist who dreams of being a hero, as well as those he portrays in his drawings. When Yuk-Su rescues a young maid, Siu-Yu, who is being sold into prostitution, he incurs the wrath of his evil boss, Wa. Led by Sonny, master of kung fu scorpion style, Wa's henchmen chase Yuk-Su and the maid. Yuk-Su's father intervenes, but he is wounded. After being rescued by some friendly bodybuilders, the three eventually hide in a noodle restaurant owned by his friend, Master Yat. Yuk-Su learns to cook noodles, but also flees regularly to secretly build his strength and learn kung fu under the tutelage of Jean, the teacher of the great soldiers who have rescued them. When Master Yat is to go on business, Yuk-Su is in charge of the kitchen; however, he leaves to practice his skills with Jean, leaving Siu-Yu to meet the customers. Sonny and his men visit the restaurant and, disgusted by the noodles that are served to them, wipe out the restaurant. <br /> <br /> When Master Yat discovers that Yuk-Su is sneaking, he says he should have learned. his kung fu; It turns out that Master Yat used to be one of the top killers of the Triad until he decided to try to change his ways. Under the guidance of Master Yat, Yuk-Su improves your skills, even learning the art of kicking without shadows! Yuk-Su eventually gets a chance to try to become a true hero when her friend, Fatty, announces that her maid has also been sold into prostitution. With Jean, they visit Wa posing as French brothel guards in search of new women. When Fatty's maid is introduced to them, she accidentally blows her ruse and finally the action begins in style. Despite his best efforts, Jean is beaten by Sonny and he and Yuk-Su are forced to flee. Upon returning to the restaurant, Yuk-Su is on fire; and worst of all, the bad guys found Siu-Yu! Yuk Su, accompanied by Master Yat, returns to Wa's place to try to rescue Siu-Yu ... <br /> <br /> Despite some rather entertaining training scenes, the slow build up to the final action in Wa's house is quite elaborate and devoid of serious fighting scenes. It's a shame that boredom has not been broken by a decent scrap in the middle of the road, instead of saving all juicy things to the end. <br /> <br /> The last fight, however, is worth waiting for; Won Jin gives a jaw-dropping performance like the fancy Sonny who runs, turns and turns with incredible skill and dexterity, and Chin Kar-Lok gives a solid performance as Yuk-Su, the artist turned fighter. Also very good is the old guard kung fu star Lau Kar-Leung (as Liu Chia Liang) as Master Yat, proving that this veteran still has what it takes to get the hell out! Although not a perfect movie, Operation Scorpio has enough prominent action in its ending to definitely guarantee a vision. <br /> <br /> NB. I may have some of the wrong names. My DVD names characters from names other than those listed on IMDb.
