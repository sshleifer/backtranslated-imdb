This was a very energetic and well played show. I saw it back in 98 and my friends and I still joked about it. Every time I see it, it's always as funny as the first one. I also love the way that everyone can relate to it in their particular ways. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of John's scripts and productions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I can not find it anywhere to sell, and I've already done a lot of searching. If anyone knows of a website or store to refer to, I would appreciate it as I'm looking for your other live shows as well. Please, send me a message if any of you have information on the subject. Thank you.
