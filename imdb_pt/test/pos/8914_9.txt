And a tough spot somewhere else. I have not seen this movie since I was very young, maybe 12 or 13 years, who knows. But what I do know is that this is the movie that taught me how to masturbate. I'm not kidding with you. I have no idea if this is good for any real standard today, but for me, back then, that was all. <br /> <br /> The only reason I feel comfortable writing this is because I'm sure no. No one will ever get to read it. I mean, really, who's going to look for this movie today? <br /> <br /> I just discovered that I have not yet used the minimum of ten lines for the amount of length that I most spend on a review. I had no idea that there was a minimum length, but there I go, as a student trying to fill a page in a diary, my ten lines. Thank you very much.
