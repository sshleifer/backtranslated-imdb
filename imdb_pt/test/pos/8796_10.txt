Hello everyone, all I have to say is that Human Traffic and all its characters are so real, it's funny. I live in Australia (Melbourne) and am finally out of the club and stay out of the whole weekend lifestyle. This movie explains everything that is happening in the world today. So exactly what I can not stop watching .... I used to be exactly like Moff, so my friends said and I had not even seen the movie .. I left the weekend partying behind about 3 months ago after 4 years of intense Partying to change my life .. I was in a DVD store when I saw Human Traffic and I remember my old friends going on about it so I bought to see what all the fuss was about .. I was so into watching it 4 times in a row because I could not believe that someone had made a movie that explains everything to a T. Anyway this movie is by far the best and funniest movie I have ever seen .. It's funny because it's so true in everything that happens in the movie. And Moff is a legend !!! That's all I have to say .. :) Enjoy 11/10 I messed up my socks on how real it was, it's exactly what's going on in the world .. hr rm I jabber a lot <br /> <br /> take care of everyone. ..
