"The China Syndrome" could not have been released at a better time: twelve days after its launch, the infamous bang took place on Three Mile Island. But even if this (and / or Chernobyl) never happened, this film remains an important look at what could happen to the mismanagement of nuclear facilities. Jack Lemmon performs a five-star performance as the supervisor trying to expose a cover-up at his nuclear plant, with Jane Fonda playing the reporter trying to investigate, and Michael Douglas plays her cameraman. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the current threat of a terrorist attack makes the "Syndrome of China" more disturbing, but anyway, it is still definitely a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> I hope these people who spent years pushing nuclear power saw this movie just so they could know that their views and ideals are completely extinguished.
