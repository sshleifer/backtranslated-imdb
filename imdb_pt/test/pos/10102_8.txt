I watch a lot of movies, but currently my number one genre is Asian terror. I just bought this DVD and initially found "Janghwa, Hongryeon" an intriguing but confusing movie, since I had not understood many parts of the story. But I saw in IMDb a message entitled "Explanation of a masterpiece (all your questions answered) load faster", written by opiemar, and I was really impressed by the high quality of the explanations that this user provided for viewers like me lost points in history. I would like to congratulate you on your excellent work and suggest that he write a correct summary of this film on IMDb to help and guide other viewers. <br /> <br /> In the end, I agree that "Janghwa, Hongryeon" is a great Korean movie, but I do not give ten in my vote because very few people can see the same movie more than once, as this movie requires , and without the great support of opiemar, I would not be able to understand the story as a whole. I plan to see this movie again in the near future. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear" ("Fear")
