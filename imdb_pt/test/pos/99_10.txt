This film, with all its complexity and subtlety, makes one of the most provocative short films I've ever seen. The topics he addresses are ugly, cynical and sometimes even macabre, but the film remains beautiful in its language, ingenious with its camera angles and beautiful in its style, cleverly recreating the tale of the same name written by a master. of short stories, Tobias Wolff. <br /> <br /> Not wanting to spoil anything about the movie, I will not go into detail, other than to say that this movie is magnificent in itself. You are proud of what you do and do well. It shows the most important memories of life, all of which can be overcome by the most evasive feeling: unexpected happiness. This film, of its own accord, created in me the same feelings that the main character (Tom Noonan) felt when the words transformed their own existence, and this is an impressive achievement.
