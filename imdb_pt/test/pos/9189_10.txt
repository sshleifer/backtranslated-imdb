I was not sure about making this movie on DVD because I actually have something against people doing black and white movies in the 21st century, but I ended up buying anyway. I still do not understand why it had to be black and white, but this is the only negativity I can see about the film, and it sure is a perfect example to see the definitive rise of Brazilian cinema. Not everyone can understand a movie like this, but it's very rewarding for those who do. Unlike The Man Who Copied, surrealism fits very well in this film, and the acting is at least as good as that, or other successful Brazilian films, like Bicho de siete cabezas, Cidade de Deus, Brava Gente Brasileira, etc. . <br /> <br /> My only hope is that this gem will not be insulted and raped by a Hollywood remake. It's amazing to see how these guys spend billions of dollars and still can not make a movie that is 1% as good as this low budget movie. <br /> <br /> Bravo to the whole team! 10/10
