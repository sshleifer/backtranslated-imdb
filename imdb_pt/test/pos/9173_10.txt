I just wanted to be eloquent enough to say how good this movie is. <br /> <br /> I ... it's hard to say. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just say what comes to mind I laughed. I really laughed. I could not believe it. I laughed and it was not bitter laughter. it was not cynical laughter. was the laughter generated by genuine joy. <br /> <br /> joy. This is a foreign word to me. I do not feel that word often, but I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> Will. Maybe it's Will's face. He is a great human being. "Smile on my face and there's a sparkle in my eyes." This line in one of Will's songs describes it perfectly. He has "joie de vivre". Trey is a lucky boy lucky to have a father like Will. Jada is a lucky woman and lucky to have a husband like Will. He is someone ... special. <br /> <br /> Happy. I really feel happy. It's a strange feeling. I do not feel that way many times. It's so cool to see, see other people really happy. I mean very happy. In that movie I did. As Will says in the movie, "Maybe I'm not happy with just 'good', maybe I want 'extraordinary.' You know, watching this movie made me think: me too. <br /> <br /> Fun. Being yourself. We all know that we must be ourselves, but it seems we are punished if we do. Maybe it has to be won. Maybe it's something we show after we have not been ourselves for a long time. That's why I just loved the ending. Will, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, Amber Valleta, Julie Ann Emery all dancing at the wedding. Dancing without inhibitions. NOT THEY ARE NOT DRUNK! except, in fact, be happy. I can understand that at least I think I can (at least I liked to see them happy, very happy). <br /> <br /> Women and men. I do not know anything about relationships, but I do. Watching this movie I feel like connecting with someone, struggling, pushing, wanting to be with someone. It seems to make life ... something completely different. I really do not know. I'm just guessing. but I felt something watching this movie. I felt that connection should be ... it should make life worth living. <br /> <br /> That's the kind of movie that it is. It is funny. IT IS INTELLIGENT TO TEND. It evokes feelings. It made me think that maybe, just maybe, life is, really is, a wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> Want to laugh? Wants to REALLY FEEL GOOD! Want to GET ANY ANSWERS ON GIRLS (and Girls, Answers on Faces)? Watch Hitch. YOU-GO-GET-IT-ALL !!! <br /> <br /> GO !!! You're a great human being.
