The ENGLISH PATIENT not only has it all (damned romance, tragic warfare, great characters), but it has a way no other movie does. It's a fascinating tale told through flashbacks with incredible performances from everyone involved, sullen visuals, characters we care about, and the most sweeping love story ever told. A cinematographic landmark, the best film of 1996 and one of the best of the 1990s.
