I like this film because it has a good approach to Buddhism, for example, the way Buddhists use to take care of all kinds of living beings, combining some extravagant and real situations; in some parts the photograph is very good and many messages about freedom, such as the episode of the hawk, remain always focused at all times, even in difficult situations. She also has funny situations like Swank's birthday and, speaking of this two-time Academy Awards, her performance shows us how people living in this type of culture are trying to behave when Miyagi takes her to a Buddhist temple, and how she is slowly changing his mind. And, of course, Pat Morita has always been great.
