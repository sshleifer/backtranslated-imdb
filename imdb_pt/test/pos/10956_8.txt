Hey; Belmondo! Look at Anna Karina! Great American improvised New Wave (or whatever you want to call it that), not as good as Godard or Truffaut, and not flawless, but hey like realism, style, warmth and humor. I love that NY accent; "you do not know nothing!"; "forget it". Like the French New Wave, it's about young people; partying, falling in love or just walking around. Lelia Goldoni is so cute; she's adorable; Wonderful. Ben Carruthers is good too, remind me of Belmondo. A movie you will not forget. <br /> <br /> 26.5 out of a total of 31 ;-)
