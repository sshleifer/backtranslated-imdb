In my work with the only national nonprofit organization, Security On Campus, Inc., dedicated exclusively to campus crime prevention and student awareness, I often see the type of campus violence and 'cover-up' 'through the secret campus. courts portrayed in the movie "Silencing Mary." In fact, we get numerous calls and requests for information every month from campus reporters like "Mary" who are facing similar situations. <br /> <br /> His portrayal of a rape on campus and the subsequent crusade of "Mary," the victim's roommate and a student journalist played very well with Melissa Joan Hart, because justice was very well done and searched accurately. <br /> <br /> This was the first television movie I've ever seen that felt truly reflected and encompassed all the various complex issues associated with how rape and other violent crimes are treated on our nation's college and university campuses. Although it is not possible to address all these issues in depth in 2 hours, this film comes closer than any I have ever seen.
