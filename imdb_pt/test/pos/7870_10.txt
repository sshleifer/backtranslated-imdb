This is the most energetic and fun 10 minute movie I've seen in a long time. As a film student at NYU, where this short film was shown several times, I salute Jim Cox for his astute sense of style and pace of our generation. I'm sure I'll see his name later on the big screen. I hope this small> find a market on TV or somewhere, so this inspirational work> can get the wide distribution
