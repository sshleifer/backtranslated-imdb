A movie like Crossfire puts another movie that spreads around its social consciousness - that is, the recent Crash movie - almost to shame. Not necessarily because anyone puts forth their message of intolerance - it is rotten more significantly (though I bet Crash will throw the hammer much thicker in comparison to that), but because of how narrative and maneuvers are never much way as with Crash. Perhaps it is not really necessary to compare the two, since the Crossfire is at its core, deeply in the vein of film-noir, as if it were going out of fashion. It was interesting to see what director Edward Dmytryk said in the DVD interview, where he mentioned that the budget for photography was significantly lower (on purpose) so that more could be spent on the actors, and the agenda went on at a very fast pace is fast. But then what happens when it's amazing about the photo is that you would think about looking at many of the lighting settings that took a lot to do. Just for a small scene, such as when Robert Mitchum's Keeely enters for the first time for interrogation under Captain Robert Young - the contrasts of perfectly shadows in the room are excellent. That there are many other lighting configurations that go even further, with so few marks, as something essential in the realm of the appearance of the noir period. Just take a look at a shot of characters on a ladder, the bars silhouetted against them, and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> But back to the substance part of the film, it's really a story that consists of a murder mystery, but that we as the public do not take long to figure out the answer. It is then more about something else then in the mind and soul of a killer that would not be found in a common crime scene, then as there are not really 'criminals' in most of the film. There is a very calculated risk with the fact that the characters can be too thin just to sustain the (valid) message against anti-Semitism. But Dmytryk's direction from his shelf cast, along with a really fantastic screenplay by John Paxton, highlights the characters, the least of which they should have so as not to look too skinny alongside the message. And what would a noir be then without some attitude in agreeing to it? Mitchum helps in this, even in scenes like him and Young, where he relies heavily on the momentum of the story (that is, a detail in the plot), by injecting some cunning humor into some dialogues. It may already be there in the lines, but it helps to make the character with a good advantage for your scenes. <br /> <br /> Then there is also Robert Ryan who stands out in Montgomery as a man you know in the beginning, just through your behavior bs but you are not totally sure about either. So once it starts to appear ironically through a subjective point of view of suspect Mitchell (George Cooper) in the apartment of Samuels who will soon be killed, his performance becomes a great balancing act to be full of crap and also quite scary in your blind path. It is a good performance when it also strikes back with Cooper, who has real personal problems that he faces and presents himself with regret and humility. It's really after the movie ends that you think about it a lot, however, and as you watch the movie, it's more about getting into the dialogue and flow of the scenes, and the camera sometimes stiff and overwhelming moves over the film. actors, then the message is somewhat secondary. Not that this is not important, especially for the period of time (coming straight from WWII), but years later he is seeing the actors, even those who do not receive the great status as Gloria Grahame as Ginny. femme fatale of the photo, if it could have had time for one that does not have) and William Phipps like Leroy (the "caipira"), working against each other that gets very strong in the compacted script. Dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit the musical score that is powerful as well, since for long periods we do not hear anything, and especially when it arises is incidental to the character's environment. He could have gone so easily with musical notes added in some dramatic scenes to emphasize, more specifically the opening of the audience to the film. Evidencing this and getting the right attitudes and nuances on camera and in the cast, it elevates the standards of genre material to a very good and memorable level. My favorite scene would probably go to Finley's story about an Irish immigrant he tells Leroy, where all these elements fit together. It may not be too loud on top of my favorite noirs - and I'd still play Murder My Sweet as the director's masterpiece in that kind of image - but it's certainly higher in quality than something in B's level as well.
