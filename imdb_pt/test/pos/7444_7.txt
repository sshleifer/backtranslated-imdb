SOME SPOILERS, YOU WERE ADVERTISED <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at the Venice Film Festival, and I must admit that being a fan was REALLY AWESOME. Excellent graphics, excellent music, excellent dubbing, excellent action sequences and so on ... BUT there is one more. ALL the movie was EXCLUSIVELY thought of for the players who loved it, and who can therefore enjoy all the references, characters, internal jokes (you should see a joke with winning music that is particularly comical) etc. A poor man who is not inside the world The FF obviously will see the magnificence of the technical side, but CAN NOT capture the inner satisfaction of seeing, for example, Barret appearing and firing in Bahamut TOTALLY OUTSIDE OF ANY PART. He asks himself, "Who is this guy?", And I can not blame him. He can not even understand what a player feels when in OPEN SEQUENCE there is the opening song of the game, Nanaki running in the canyon with his two cubs, howling at the ruins of Midgar, and then "498 years ago ...". Almost all the characters made an appearance or quote (including Reeve, Tseng and Elena), and Reno and Rude were really silly and comical to see, but the final impression that the movie left for me was "ultimate dream of the hardcore gamer, but a lot least for a FILM fan ... ".
