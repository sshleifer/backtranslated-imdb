Sadness and nostalgia permeate Late Chrysanthemums, a 1954 film by Japanese author Mikio Naruse, who now goes through a retrospective of his long films unavailable thanks to James Quandt of Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation. Based on three stories by Fumiko Hayashi, Late Chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired, now middle-aged geishas whose lives have become filled with disappointment and regret. The performance is uniformly remarkable, particularly that of Haruko Sugimura, who starred in Late Spring, Ozu, Floating Weeds, and Tokyo Story films, among others. Sugimura portrays Kin, a former geisha who has no children and lives only with her young maid who is unable to speak. <br /> <br /> She became skeptical of men and turned her attention to money, especially real estate speculation. and lending money to his friends, Nobu (Sadako Sawamura), Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki), all ex-geishas. Kin's friends live under scanty circumstances and complain about how Kin has become greedy and Tomi spends considerable time playing to try to make ends meet. Both Tomi and Tamae are losing their children. Tamae's son is leaving to work in the coal mines in Hokkaido, and Tomi's daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man. Both resist change in their circumstances, but come to accept it as inevitable. <br /> <br /> Two male friends visit Kin, Seki, a former lover with whom she once thought of double suicide, and Tabe (Ken Uehara), another lover. whom she looks forward to seeing again after many years. Her mood is optimistic but soon turns into resentment when she finds out that the two men are only interested in borrowing money. Naruse cuts between two strings stretched perfectly as Kin confronts Tabe and Tomi and Tamae mutually console each other for the loss of their children. The dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are strong women who, although their future does not look bright, refuse to see each other. merely as victims. Late chrysanthemums have the simplicity, humor, and stoic acceptance of prominent life in the Ozu movies and it is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passage of time and comfort that memory and companionship can bring along the way.
