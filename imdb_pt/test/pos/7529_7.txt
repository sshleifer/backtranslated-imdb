Pepe Le Pew can really scare you or leave you totally free. Anyway, you can not help but feel a bit of awe at seeing this classic WB character. This commentator personally believes that Pepe was the inspiration behind other animated casanovas today from the Cartoon Network "Johnny Bravo" for the Disney Lumiere of "Beauty and the Beast". <br /> <br /> Your unique brand of lovemaking is to be admired in today's world where your antics would normally be slapped with a sexual harassment warrant and at least 50m away from all your victims. <br /> <br /> In this particular cartoon, a tired cat decides to make a definite retirement and gain some respect for a change by pretending to be a skunk. All is well, until Pepe arrives and immediately pursues the unfortunate feline with his incredibly enthusiastic love. <br /> <br /> The basis for Pepe's many trademarks are placed in this cartoon. From his lovely "frenchified" love calls that aggravatingly calm hop-chase him. <br /> <br /> This cartoon only shows that as far as the fantasy world of cartoons, the most ardent wooer can go the distance ... and have your beloved "pig-eon" leaving traces of dust back them.
