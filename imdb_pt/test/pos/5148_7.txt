I saw this at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2008. There are some wonderful descriptions of this movie from other commentators here and they seemed to really like it so I do not go very far in giving a movie synopsis but you can see a little by Woody Allen and perhaps a little by Federico Fellini in this A collection of films of about 50 short sketches or vignettes strung together without any real singular plot. Some of the vignettes are related to each other in their character and plot lines, however, and a corner bar is often used as a central scene where they are always giving the last call. The opening and closing scenes also have a common theme that includes the film. It took three years to film this and most of the time it must have been spent on finding the simplest, most homely people in all of Sweden to cast. This is Sweden's official submission to Best Foreign Film for the 2007 Oscars. It's a good movie, but hardly deserves an official presentation for the best foreign film. Last year, Sweden's official submission was the very weak Farväl Falkenberg and last year ZoZo seemed expensive, but once again Sweden will have no chance to win the Oscars. This film has its moments and would have made a good short of 20 to 25 minutes, but it gets a bit old and cold for a feature film. Roy Andersson drives. Gustav Danielsson is the director of photography. The publisher Anna Märta Waern deserves much credit for the work she must have dedicated to it. Benny Andersson, from ABBA fame, provides a fun musical track. It's an interesting movie with a lot of dry humor and I liked it, but it's nothing really special and could only give a 7.0 out of 10.
