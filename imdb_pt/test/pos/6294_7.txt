Along with In the Army !, this is one of Pauly Shore's best movies, if there is such a thing. Although the whole West Coast confrontation with the Midwest culture is not new, this film proves that the story is a little more fun with the crazy, unpredictable mischief of a new coast. Although the change in values ​​probably went in the other direction, the whole concept was quite fun. Not only did Shore's interaction with the family was hilarious, but also Carla Gugino and Tiffani- Amber Theissen (she will always have Amber in my book) in two ravishing and old roles. One of those movies I have no problem watching when it's on TV.
