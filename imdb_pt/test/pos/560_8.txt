This is an extraordinary film. As a court drama, it is convincing, as an indictment of the American justice system, it is scary. For Brenton Butler, the consequences of this system can be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, which is not about discovering guilt or innocence, but about who is better at court. In fact, the implications of this case go beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty or a guilty man being free. Every citizen has the right to justice, whether perpetrator or victim. But do they understand? The film is very rhythmic, understated and one of the best court documentaries I have ever seen.
