A letter to the guys. I tried guys, I really tried! I tried so hard not to watch this movie. I left the room when I was on or jumped on the computer when the wife was watching. This is his second favorite movie, the godfather being the first (which I love). <br /> <br /> I ended up getting little pieces of this movie and finally after maybe a year I was actually sitting watching with her. I can not believe I'm saying this, but I loved this movie. Dalton plays a great Rhett and has his arrogance down. Whalley plays a delicious Scarlett. Full of fire and brimstone and NOTHING will stop it. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is when she is abroad (Ireland?) And the government is going to demolish a peasant's house because they are late. the rent. Scarlett gets all pissed off and pays all the debt, thus making a big name for herself around this little town. <br /> <br /> All I'm saying is that you may want to try this movie ... especially if you're a Gone with the Wind fan. It takes a while to get used to the new actors, but I think you'll find them refreshing.
