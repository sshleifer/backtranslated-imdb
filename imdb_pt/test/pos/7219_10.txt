What can I say about Tromeo and Juliet, plus if you like twisted Trotam machinations, then you MUST see this movie! This is my favorite movie from Troma, and I've seen almost all of them! Penis monsters, cecsarian births to live rats and popcorn, lesbianism, smoking sex scenes in plexiglass boxes, incest, nipple piercing, dismemberment, shameless Trotam plugs and computer masturbation ... How can one go wrong? Surprisingly follows the original story very closely. YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE !!!! Oh, and talking about shameless plugs ... Check out Jane Jensen's "Comic Book Whore" CD in Interscope Records. This is amazing!
