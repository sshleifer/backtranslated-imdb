This movie is not only good, it is incredible. In addition to providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and much more, it was until then a world completely invisible to the public. This is the first science fiction movie that takes us into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and reality that the audience is speechless. I'm only 16 years old and therefore I was raised in a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies. But even then I was really, and I mean, completely impressed by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects were only one of the merits of this film, the camera was in true Kubrick style, incredible and enchanting. It seems like you are being consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera, and the size of the film got me from my guards, even though I saw the rating before I bought it. But this movie has more than that. The meaning of this film can also be interpreted as you wish, even though I think there are some clear points about humanity (also true Kubrick style). As humanity on top of its evolution is only maintenance on board and therefore not required by the computer, one of the tools of humanities. As we in space look like babies, learning to walk once more, losing control of our tools at zero gravity, breathing through equipment like fish out of water. At the height of evolution, we set out for the endless adventure as mere primates. Many may think that the length and slow pace of this movie is annoying? ridiculous or just a waste of time. But before you can go to those conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with quiet music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, beauty is, in many cases, not given due respect to the viewers. Kubrick wants to show us the beauty, and if we do not succumb to it and relax, we will not be able to enjoy this movie as planned. This is not an ordinary movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies, it requires time, thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch. All this together makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving images. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.
