Valentine, a model in France is separated from her lover who is abroad, they plan to meet in England, but seem to be increasingly distant as the film progresses. One night after refusing a pass made by her co-worker, she hits a dog named Rita. The dog survives and returns it to the owner, a hostile retired judge who lives as a hermit and a snoop, listening to the conversations of all the neighbors. She is intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him frequently, often becoming part of his espionage games. A conversation they both hear is of utmost importance; however, the conversation between a young man about to be a judge and his wife, which we discover parallels the life of the man who is spying on them. As we discover more about the couple, the man reveals more of his story, then continues his story and we find out if the two men will continue toward the same fate. As soon as Valentine knows his life, this meeting and the young judge's fate will entangle. She hit the dog that day seemed destiny, a divine sacrifice for the dog to its owner, allowing Valentine to be the savior of the young judge, who is traveling the same way as his dear friend, to prevent him from having such a thing. dark future, full of loneliness and loneliness. It seems like the old man's dream will come true after all, and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his days. <br /> <br /> An incredible ending to possibly the best trilogy of all time! Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me. He is one of my favorite directors and one of the most talented directors in movie history. His use of the colors of the French flag in all three films was nothing short of incredible, every scene, every scene was like a work of art. Three of the most visually appealing movies I've ever seen. And his subtle connections between the three films are incredible. Usually means a subtle pause or late focus on a scene, see if you can identify some. I have to mention this and it's a great SPOILER, I loved the ending, as all the characters in the three films were the surviving remnants of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on TV, solidifying his happiness about the suffering he has dealt with for so many years. I could not think of a better way to end the movie, but a smile on my face, great way to end an amazing movie and trilogy! I recommend this to everyone who loves movies, movies, anything ... A work of art! 10 out of 10 for the movie and the trilogy.
