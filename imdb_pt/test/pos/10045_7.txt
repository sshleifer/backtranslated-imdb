If anyone sees him as a gallant horseman of the plains or an egomaniac of the hunt for glory, the debates on the life and military career of George Armstrong Custer continue to the present day. They died with their boots On presents certain facts of Custer's story and took liberty with others. <br /> <br /> He actually graduated at the end of his class at West Point and got that promotion overnight on the battlefield. Brigadier General. His record leading the Michigan Regiment under his command was one of brilliance. <br /> <br /> It was also true that his marriage to Libby Bacon was one of the great love affairs of the nineteenth century. Libby and George were married for 12 years until Little Big Horn. What is not known by today's audience is that Libby survived until 1933. During this time she was the custodian of Custer's legend. By her own iron will and personality strength, her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way. <br /> <br /> I think Raoul Walsh and Warner Brothers missed a good opportunity. have Custer's career counted in flashback. Olivia DeHavilland should have been made the way Jeanette MacDonald was in Maytime, and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance. Even so, the cracks in Custer's legend were appearing, but if they were made from Libby's point of view, they could be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> Sydney Greenstreet did a great job as General Winfield Scott. The only problem was that Scott had nothing to do with Custer, he was retired and replaced by George B. McClellan in late 1861 while Custer was still at West Point. I'm not sure if they've met. But Greenstreet makes a good characterization of the heavy and powerful Winfield Scott. A good story of the Mexican War should have been what they gave Greenstreet instead of their very accurate portrait of the old Fuss and Feathers. <br /> <br /> The film is carried by one of the great romantic film teams, Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. This was the last of the eight films they did together. The last scene they did for the cameras was Libby's farewell to George as he joined his regiment for what would become their last campaign. Both performances, especially of Olivia, were a highlight in their careers at Warner Brothers. We know through the story that Custer is going to his misfortune, this and the fact that this was the last performance of his team gave such a scene such a special pungency. If your eyes do not moisten, you are made of marble. <br /> <br /> As the story they died with their boots on leaves much to be desired. As a Western adventure that successfully blends romance with action, you can not beat this movie.
