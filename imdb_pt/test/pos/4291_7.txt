Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett completing the supporting roles for the quartet of lies and intrigue. However, at the heart of it all, each character maintains a line of decency - moral awareness maintained despite obvious contradictions. "Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life." How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the heart of this intrigue - it is the central consciousness the other three captured. She is indecisive decency. <br /> <br /> The circumstances of the lie are proper: one to defend the professional name; one to insure due to pressure from family / partner; No one simply does not want to face the consequence; Ironically, we can not believe the truth and lies to save the friendship. These are all precarious situations. There lies the intrigue - fascinating to watch as each one approaches truth and lies. Contradictions, in fact. Despite the apparent dishonor, decency and heart remain strong. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the subject involved and how each of the characters behaves is masterfully delivered simple with clarity. It is not sensational or complex like another movie "Where the Truth Lies" 2005. Credits due to the writing of Fellowes and the differentiated performances of both Watson and Wilkinson. There is somehow heat coming through the seemingly bold or frustratingly hidden lies. Underneath all, human frailty not excluded, meant well. And following the story, the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles at how the two Mannings seem to have grown and matured in their relationship. <br /> <br /> You may say that there are no obvious action scenes or thrilling scenes in "Separate the Lies," but the intrigue is present and will catch your attention.
