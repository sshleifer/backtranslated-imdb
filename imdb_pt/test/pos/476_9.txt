The 1980s, "My Dinner with Andre," with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory, is essentially a dialogue about the world and how it affects and can elevate the spirit. 2005 'You are alone' demonstrates how ordinary mundane events can destroy the soul. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around three main characters. There's Daphne, a very adolescent student who cares about virtually every decision in her life. Then there's the prostitute, or escort, Britney, as self-confident as Daphne is self-conscious. What makes them interesting is that they share the same body, if not the same personae. Part of the magic of this movie occurs in one of the first scenes in which Daphne approaches a door of an old hotel room. Does it stop and is obviously divided by the decision to knock or not on the door? but it's Britney who slides effortlessly into the room when the door is opened. <br /> <br /> Across the door is Buddy, a middle-aged man with few or no personal qualities that anyone would. to find attractive. He comes to the clash over Britney's chosen profession as soon as she enters the room. However, we soon discovered that Buddy is the neighbor on Daphne's side and that she has watched over the years as she grew from little girl to feminine. This complicates things for the public. Is Buddy just being a worried neighbor or does he want something else? <br /> <br /> If it's sex that Buddy wants, here it is. Britney loves sex. His definitions may be Clintonesque, but that does not explain his enthusiasm. She prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic wristbands that her clients are asked to choose. Does each color band denote a specific act that it will perform? but exactly what act is not revealed until the band is wrenched from his wrist and the choice is irrevocably made. <br /> <br /> Britney is, or believes she is, in control of every encounter. Even when bandaged and tied up, as she is by one of her regular clients, she imagines her arms and body being caressed by several men but her legs and pubic area being caressed by a woman in blood-red lingerie. The images from the movie keep coming. <br /> <br /> Buddy's pathetic life is one of acceptance. He lost his wife, his dog, even his fantasies of the handsome teenager next door. It's no coincidence that he's brought Daphne or Britney to that particular hotel room. There is a painting on the wall of a dinner plate with only a fish head on the left. This is a perfect metaphor for Buddy's life; all good parts are finished. So here's where he brought his wife when they were still college students, what does he stand for? to regain some control of his own life, to make his statement. <br /> <br /> The director of 'You're Alone', Gorman Bechard, knows his craft. The main action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the movie, assisted by a multitude of interlaced scenes that add dimension to the characters, their circumstances and conflicts. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, Britney asks Buddy if she should undress. He says yes, but she just takes the clothes off her. A real prostitute would probably remove all her clothes (one of five professions). But it's not Buddy being teased, we are. When the movie ends, we find that there are deeper human emotions and motivations at play. A teaser does not work unless it is actually delivered. Britney does as well as 'You're Alone'.
