The End of the Suburb collects in an orderly fashion many of the concerns about the next "Peak" of the world oil supply. As the world's population grows, so does the demand for oil and energy. As we extract oil and energy, we come to a "peak" in production. More oil is required, less oil is generated. The inevitable result is conflict and great change. <br /> <br /> This movie will be disturbing and alarming if you are new to the subject. You can react at first with anger and denial because the implications are so bleak. Visualization should be required. Beyond politics, beyond optimism, mathematics is undeniable. <br /> <br /> The suburban is the focus because our suburban residential areas will be the communities most impacted when the price of energy shoots up. Although intuitive logic tells you that big cities will be the places to avoid during a period of crisis, the scattered nature of the suburbs will make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles carrying us. <br /> <br /> Peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion by survivors and madmen of the hinterland. This question will be at our door sooner than we think. This film is a lucid and coherent look.
