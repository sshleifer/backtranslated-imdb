Veteran chief advisor Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray in his best walnut form in his first leading role) presides over the various eccentric hi-jinks in the North Star summercamp. Tripper befriends the unlucky and lonely boy Rudy (a nice performance and affected by Chris Makepeace). Director Ivan Reitman chronicles the fun comic strip vignettes at an unceasingly fast pace and retains an engaging, humorous tone throughout. This film astutely spikes the essence of summer breezy'n'breezy: make friends, first love, pull matches, compete in sports with a rival camp, singalongs bonfire and of course the inevitable scary urban legend about the psycho killer of escape with the hand hook. The joyfully shrill fun that this image generates is positively contagious. In addition, the humor is always silly and occasionally rude, but never too nasty or stingy. Best of all, there is a surfeit winning pure heart to accompany the said mood (the warm relationship between Tripper and Rudy, in particular, is genuinely touching). The cast has an obvious ball playing its friendly characters: Murray's glorious presence keeps things constantly vibrant (his crazy PA ads are absolutely complicated), plus contributions from Harvey Atkin as the unfortunate landlady Morty, Kate Lynch as cheeky of Tripper the old flame Roxanne, Russ Banham as the lovely Crockett, Kristine DeBell as sweet, foxy AL, Sarah Torgov as the quarrelsome Candace, Jack Blum as the pervert Spaz, Keith Knight as Larby Finkelstein, Cindy Girling as the attractive Wendy, and Matt Craven as the hip hardware. Donald Wilder's cinematography gives the film an attractive, sunny look and makes good use of wipes. The lively and melodic score of Elmer Bernstein also does the trick. A real turmoil.
