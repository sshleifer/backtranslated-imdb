The first video clip I've seen, Thriller, my mother told me she took me home from the hospital and when we arrived, my sister had MTV on TV and Thriller was playing, my mother said I smile. Silly, I know, but I've loved Michael Jackson since that day, the music video Thriller inspired me to dance, I still have the dance memorized to this day. I even did it for an audience 3 times! Words can not describe the power of this song that makes you want to sing and dance, but Michael, of course, had to raise the MTV level at the time by signing with John Landis, director of American Werewolf in London, and directing the single, Thriller. <br /> <br /> Michael and his boyfriend, Ola Ray, run out of gas in a dark, leafy area. They walk into the forest and Michael asks if she would like to stand. She accepts and he gives her a ring. He warns her, though, that he's not like the other guys, no, not like the other guys. A full moon appears, and Michael begins to convulse in agony? transforming into a horrifying werewolf! Their encounter screams and flees, but the werewolf reaches, knocking her down and begins to attack her with their claws. The scene cuts to a movie where Michael and his boyfriend are watching the scene unfold in a movie called Thriller. Michael smiles, but his girlfriend is scared and says he's leaving. Michael reaches for her, and says it's just a movie, but she does not like her jokes about her and she starts to walk away. Michael and his encounter then walk down a hazy street, and he plays with the opening verses of Thriller. They pass by a graveyard, where corpses suddenly begin to rise from their graves while Vincent Price does his rap. Michael and his encounter then find themselves surrounded by zombies and suddenly Michael becomes a zombie. Michael and the undead perform an elaborate number of songs and dances together, followed by Thriller's refrain. Thriller is undoubtedly the best music video of all time, the funny thing is who wants to argue that it is with other Michael Jackson, but what makes Thriller so special is dance, history, effects, this at the time was the most expensive clip of the day. Michael, of course, climbed into that bar again with his famous music video, Scream, and again with Ghosts. But say what you want, Michael was the star of the 80s, there were no celebrities like him, he loved life, lived, breathed and hugged. Thriller is proof that he was willing to work to make the best and that is what we have with the legend that is Thriller. <br /> <br /> 10/10
