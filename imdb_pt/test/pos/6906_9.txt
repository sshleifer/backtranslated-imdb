I only saw this on SIFF, and I just loved it. There were parts where I laughed so hard I could not catch my breath. The script and direction of Glenn McQuaid are fantastic. I can not wait to see more of this talented young man. The performances make the movie. Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are simply delicious as the graverobber Willy and his apprentice Arthur. Ron Perlman performs fantastically (as usual) as a less than sympathetic prison priest. Bonus: Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! As always, he balances the threat and mood perfectly. <br /> <br /> This is a horror comedy style that has not really been seen since Vincent Price did "Comedy of Terrors", "The Crow" and "Theater." of blood. "The movie is really scary in some places, so all of a sudden it will go back to the hilarious way, keeping you totally unbalanced.Some parts are scary and funny at the same time. <br /> <br /> I can only I see three films on SIFF this year, but even though the other two are horrible, "I'm Watching The Dead" was well worth all three price tag I'll be looking for more Glass Eye Pix movies from Larry Fessenden. giving the horror genre a much-needed kick in the ass.
