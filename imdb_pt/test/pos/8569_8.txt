HOT. is a fun movie for a trip back to when skin films had a more positive and fun agenda. They were made simply to excite and give a few laughs. Everything seems less cynical and tired. All the girls have natural figures and some are playboy games. The simple plot deals with a group of young women opening a house of uninvited brotherhood to return to the arrogant sisterhood girls who have rejected and insulted them. Instead of today's witty tricks, most of the jokes are simply innocent fun. Women are decent actresses for this genre and are most often very attractive. To keep our attention among the topless scenes, we have mob bosses, a stolen bear, a hot air balloon, a funky mother house and the cheapest robot ever seen. There is even Danny Bonnaducci of the Partridge Family. If you have a sense of humor, let yourself go and enjoy some light entertainment.
