This movie was very cute and totally appropriate girl. My nieces have been watching over and over since they succeeded, and as a result I've seen this almost four times all the time. I can not get enough of this. The CGI images are great to watch, the mood is good, and the ballet portraits are great. Although the story has some holes, no little girl will pick them up and, as an adult, the film is so enchanting that it hardly seems to notice. Just keep in mind that it's a Barbie movie, and though fancy, sometimes in my experience, it lives up to the high standards that other Princess Barbie movies have set for it. I would recommend this to anyone who has a girl who has always wanted to be a princess. Teach a good lesson too. Everyone is special and different in their own way, and everyone can make a difference.
