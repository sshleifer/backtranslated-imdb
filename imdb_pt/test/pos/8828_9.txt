I strongly recommend to anyone who likes good scenarios, good actors (even if they are not well known) (often, it's better this way), science and / or science fiction presented in a clever way on the (small) screen, good special effects even if they did not have billions of dollars to produce it ... much better than any war in the stars ... <br /> <br /> there was only one comment that was not it is necessary: ​​talking about the comet, the commentator says that life may have been brought to Earth through a comet ... this is fun, there must always be a chance for a magical path, huh ?! That's what's great about life, it can come from anywhere, with no need for external force
