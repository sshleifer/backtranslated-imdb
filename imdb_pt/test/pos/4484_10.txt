It's one of the best movies I've seen this year! I do not agree with the person who said it is annoying. Of course, some people may find this film not scary, but personally I had a good time. This movie nicely alternates sex scenes with scary scenes. There is also a nice touch of humor. For example, when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father, and then the husband says "how can someone abuse someone like you", and then he tries to get her in bed for sex games: D funny ! I recommend this movie to everyone and, by the way, sorry for my poor English (I'm from France).
