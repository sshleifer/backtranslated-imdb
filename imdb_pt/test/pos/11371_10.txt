All right - it was in black and white and probably on 2 "tape - which means the BBC cleaned up, right? But it remains in my mind all those years ago (1960 ??) as a perfect slice of animated history by the most innovative editing and wonderful actors filled with youth and boast. <br /> <br /> I want to see you again! Are you reading this, BBC? Find your 2 "original tapes or 35mm film, deal with the actors and directors for rights and re-emit! I know, I know, some of them are dead, some of them are missing in action. <br /> <br /> Where else can I see Mary Morris as the 'heart of the serpent wrapped in tiger skin'? Where else can I see Paul Daneman: 'Now is the winter of discontent ...'? Or has Robert Hardy made his speech about "that idol ceremony"?
