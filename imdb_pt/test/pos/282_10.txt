Secret comedians have made a comeback in recent years, with Mike Myers' Austin Powers and Rowan Atkinson's "Johnny English," and more recently Steve Carell in the 1960s film version of "Get Smart! ". <br /> <br /> In 1974, it was David Jason who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying a "Classified" carrying case. The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs was her first starring role on a sitcom, after years as a supporting actor in series such as' Six Dates With Barker ', the series' Doctor' and 'Hark At Barker '. Humphrey Barclay found him working at a theater on the wharf in Bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include him alongside Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle on the children's comedy show 'Do not Adjust Yourself Set! '. <br /> <br /> "TTSLOEB" cast Jason as "Edgar Briggs," a well-meaning but incompetent agent for the Secret Intelligence Service. While John Steed wore a bowler hat, Briggs had a felt hat. While Napoleon Solo was carrying a radio pen, Briggs had a pipe. Objects fell to pieces in his hands. He read Confidential documents in bed while his wife (Barbara Angell) was reading Woman's own (on one occasion it would be otherwise). When he located a couple of Russian agents at a heliport, he accidentally switched on the Tannoy system from the airport and conveyed his plans to capture them! When he hid in a train to photograph a meeting between an S.I. man and his enemy contact, he left with him on board and took him straight to Brighton! When he tried to organize the desertion of a Russian scientist, he made a "short cut" to escape his pursuers, but eventually lost himself hopelessly in a parking lot. However, as "Inspector Clouseau," he always seemed to be at the top in the end, to the dismay of his colleagues. <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, he was married. His wife, Jennifer, understood the kind of work he did. Although they had a fight once, which resulted in her shouting from her skyscraper's window: "Secret Service, Secret Service! You never stop thinking about the Secret Service!" He shouted back, "Think of the neighbors! They should not know I'm in the Secret Service!" Briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included "Coronation Street." the villain Mark Eden (he was psychotic Alan Bradley) as "Spencer," Michael Stainton as "Buxton" and "Elisabeth Counsell" by Doctor At Sea as the lovely "Cathy Strong." They responded to The Commander, played by the late Noel Coleman. The Commander was kidnapped in one episode, leaving Briggs temporarily in command of the S.I.-which naturally horrified all. <br /> <br /> This hilarious show was by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna, who wrote for the series 'Doctor'. Instead of fooling Bond, it was yet another presentation of serious espionage programs, such as "Callan" (although it had a Bond style theme song). Stealth meetings in underground parking lots, cracking code, stolen missile plans, that sort of thing. Jason brought a lot of energy into the role, doing many of his own exploits, like Briggs falling off a ladder while decorating his apartment, and falling on a hill in a dustbin, and were reminiscent of those who were in the Pantera Color Films of-Rose '. <br /> <br /> 'Briggs' had all the ingredients to be a great success. Unfortunately, it was not networked. In the London area, it was exposed on Sundays at 7:05 p.m. where he was slaughtered in the assessments of the soapy drama of B.B.C. "The Brothers". It was then transferred to Fridays at 7pm. because I.T.V. wanted to show off his latest American import - the TV version of 'Planet Of The Apes'. Briggs never found an audience. A similar fate happened with Jason's next big show: "Lucky Feller", 1976. It was not until 1977 and 'A Sharp Intake Of Breath' that he found his first successful solo vehicle. <br /> <br /> You can see the sequence of the title (along with two brief excerpts in German!) for this series on Youtube. Unfortunately, that's all you can see. Jason will not allow his first shows to be repeated or released in D.V.D. A great shame. At the moment, however, the life of Edgar Briggs will have to remain secret. <br /> <br /> CODA: I've seen a few episodes recently and I'm happy to say that this is unbelievably good.
