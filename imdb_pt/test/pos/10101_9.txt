This is not so much a review of A Tale Of Two Sisters as it is a discussion of some of the small details of the plot, so I advise you NOT to read this review if you have not seen the movie yet, because doing so will absolutely ruin some surprises for you. In a way, The Tale Of Two Sisters is far from original, at least of a purely superficial aspect - part of its iconography is taken directly from Ring or Dark Water, while the plot itself especially what Brendt Sponseller calls the "rubber aspect" of the narrative) is reminiscent of films like Fight Club (the main character interacts with someone created in his mind), Mulholland Drive (character creates alternative reality in a psychogenic escape) as well as other minor aspects of Lost Highway, Jacob's Ladder, and basically all the movies under the sun dealing with mental illnesses, plus the films of Amenabar (The Others, Opens the Eyes), Memento (particularly with regard to the tortuous nature of memory) et al. Fortunately, all of these similarities do not diminish the overall emotional impact of the film, and I personally find The Tale Of Two Sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience. <br /> <br /> Many people commented on the "confusing" nature of the film. narrative, but I personally found the plot quite self-explanatory, even though it is partly portrayed in a non-sequential way. The narrative only becomes confusing to some because in the middle of the final third, the story changes from a purely subjective scenario (ie the distorted perception of the Soo-Mi reality) to an objective, with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of Soo. My mother's nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness. The change of emphasis is doomed to throw some people off guard, but structurally I think it resembles that mentioned a bit Mulholland Drive (although we are not dealing with the perception of the reality of a character through a dream, but rather with their own schizophrenic tendencies - something that in turn reminded me of another Lynch movie, Lost Highway). To be honest, I do not consider the movie A Tale of Two Sisters as a horror movie, but rather a tragic story of a family collapse as well as an honest view of a character's mental illness (and I am quick to add that fans of psychoanalytic cinema will love this movie). <br /> <br /> What aside, the cinematography in A Tale of Two Sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen on this side of Wong's 2046 Kar Wai. The performances are also fantastic without exception, and I expect to see more of the four characters in the future; not to mention the music, but East Asian movies without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between today. <br /> <br /> It is very likely that some people look beyond the finer artistic points of A Tale Of Two Sisters and simply dismiss it as "another Asian horror film," oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and approach honest psychoanalysis. But then each one to his own. If you can ignore some trivial aspects of the movie and simply take it to what is at heart, that is. an extremely tragic and heartbreaking story, so I see no reason not to recommend it.
