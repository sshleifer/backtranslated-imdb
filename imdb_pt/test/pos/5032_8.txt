Michael is probably too cute for most action movie fans and too much Hollywood for the intellectual audience, but I found it extremely funny and very touching, although it was pretty cute and stereotyped. <br /> <br /> When three skeptics are sent to investigate a man claiming to be an angel they end up accompanying him on a large tour of the midwest country side only to find that it is each of their own hearts who need investigation. <br /> <br /> When taking this film apart, as with most movies today, there is not much new material, but when considered as a whole, it has an original and refreshing approach, as well as being quite innovative way to entertain you all the time. <br /> <br /> Although not a "Family" movie is suitable for all ages and a good movie to share with the whole family or that special person. <br /> <br /> "Michael" is not a great movie, but it certainly is a good movie, a moving film and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> KWC
