It's been a long time since the last time someone created a movie like this. A movie called B. It may not have been a great movie, but it's fun to watch, classic Bruce Cambell, has its good, funny, disgusting, even artistic parts. <br /> <br /> ****** Spoiler Ahead ******* <br /> <br /> ------------------- --------------------------------- ------------- -------------- ------------- The part where your wife as a robot-avenger-robot is about to die, I do not know about you, but it made me feel so strange, so sad and angry in a good way. I compare this scene with the Fly 2 scene where your dog as a monster dies. Makes you think oh my god. eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu ------------------- ------------------------ ------- --------------------------- <br /> <br /> ******** No more Spoilers **** ***** <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Bruce Cambell, you definitely want to have this movie in your collection. If you are generally interested in movies, you may want to. Just think that the aim of the movie is to make you smile, disgust you out (do not worry it's not too bad though) and make you have fun with your friends. Attention, I said friends, can not be future girlfriend.
