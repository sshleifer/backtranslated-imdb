When I first learned that the subject for Checking Out was a self-orchestrated suicide party, my first thought was as morbid, tasteless, and then a comedy on top of that. I was skeptical. But I was completely wrong. I totally adored it. The cast, the funny liners and especially the ultimate surprise. Suicide is a delicate issue, but it was handled very well. Comical yes, but tender where he needed to be. Check out also deals with other common problems that I believe many families can relate to and does with tact and humor. I highly recommend Check Out. ONE MUST SEE. I look forward to your release to the public.
