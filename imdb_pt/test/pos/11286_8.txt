The generated is certainly an experience and an experience out of the ordinary. The use of color is fascinating and sometimes frustrating. Much of what happens on the screen is incredibly difficult to understand. His vision is obscured by a sudden bizarre change of color and tone, characters on the way and random cuts in the sky. The sound is very scary and a welcome addition. This really helps the nihilistic and hopeless tone that suffocates this movie. <br /> <br /> As for what Begotten is, the theory of "rape of the environment and rebirth" seems quite accurate to me. But I would not spend much time focusing on meaning, it's practically unimportant. Clearly the director did not want to explain anything. It simply presents as it is, and if you want to look for a meaning that is up to you. <br /> <br /> Watching Begotten is definitely not a walk in the park, but I've been captivated since the opening. It's like watching a person's worst nightmare. What we see sometimes is distressing and very unpleasant, but there is a surreal and dreamlike beauty there. If you are an art / experimental fan and have not yet seen Begotten, make it a priority. I doubt you'll forget it. I know I will not.
