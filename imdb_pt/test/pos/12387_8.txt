I suppose this movie is not your typical Spanish thriller as it is based on a real story that happened overseas. The film is based on the actual story of Frenchman Jean-Claude Romand, and the actual case is much more bloody and scary than the film. In the real story of Mr. Romand, the family did not escape, after years of lies, he decided to end it all, killing his wife, two children, parents and dog, and although he tried to kill himself, it seems he did not. Do not try too hard while he survived. I watched the movie with the people next to me talking about how it could never happen in real life that all these lies were not detected, I was laughing when I read the book about Mr. Romand, and I knew it happened. I like Jos√© Coronado in this movie, he offered us a good performance, like the rest of the crew.
