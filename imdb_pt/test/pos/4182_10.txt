When I first saw this movie, I also hoped that "our boys" would be cute and more like an extended version of the TV show. I did not "catch" back then. But years later, at a party YEARS later, in a 70-year-old PARTY where certain substances had been smoked, inhaled, and with enough tequila, "HEAD" was late at night. We watched and finally realized what "HEAD" was everything. He spoofed his own show, as shown in a song that was called, "A Crafted Image". As Davy Jones wrote in his autobiography, "They made a monkey out of me," he openly admits that everyone in the movie had smoked marijuana all night. They mocked themselves, society, everything! Great movie! Tho, like a 52 year old grandmother, I no longer "induldge", I still watch this movie when I want a good LOL!
