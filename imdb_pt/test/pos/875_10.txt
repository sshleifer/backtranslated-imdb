This is one of the best movies I've seen in the last few years. Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles, he as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic playful. Words will not do justice to this masterpiece, suffice it is said that this is a film that explores the darker side of love and the pain, humiliation and self-illusion that accompanies it, although it is dressed as a movie noir. Forget that weak remake with Jolie and Banderas, see the genuine article and deal with some moments of great cinematic beauty.
