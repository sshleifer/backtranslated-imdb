The third entry in the "Stepford" franchise, but apparently the three obscure sequels made for television are incredibly obscure and difficult to track, while the original 1970s and remake hit with Nicole Kidman are commonly known and very popular. I have not even seen the early '80s, "Revenge of the Stepford Wives" or the mid-'90s "The Stepford Husbands," but this "The Stepford Children" is a very charming and highly entertaining film. It's basically the same film as the original; obviously less mysterious yet very cheesier and incredibly 80's to the nth degree. The main difference here, as the title indicates, is that not only the liberated wives, but also the rebellious teenage and punk descendants of the city go through the typical and highly effective "Stepford Treatment" licensed by the local Men's Association. For some reason, the scene tries to underpin the Stepford mystery until the end of the film, although no one can watch this sequence before having verified the original and presumably everyone also knows of the outcome. The Harding family is packed and ready to move from the sinister New York City to the small, peaceful community of Stepford. In particular, Father Steven is excited about his new life because he already lived in Stepford and has always wanted to return since his first wife, about which his new wife Laura and her teenage children Mary and David know little, died in mysterious circumstances. The city is almost too perfect with picturesque neighbors and model students, and especially modern teenagers face enormous difficulties to adjust. His efforts to modernize the venue and take the local Stanford youth into the clashes cause clashes with the city's eminent residents, particularly the members of the Men's Association, and put family relations under stress. David meets and falls in love with Lois's last "normal" girl, but when she turns into a domestic doll at night, David can convince his skeptical mother to investigate Stanford's ominous secret. The first hour of "The Stanford Children" is slow and rather meek, but the ending is bad and cheesy, as the promises of the cover of VHS and how a thriller of the late 80's should be, in fact. The modus operandi behind Stanford's secrets is illustrated in more detail, and I think horror fans and original movie lovers will like that. At least I did. The general plot still does not make much sense and the script is full of irrational aspects, but it is nonetheless an engaging formula and undoubtedly one that evokes an atmosphere of suspense and fear. Performance figures are well above average. Especially the arrogant and unpleasant members of the Men's Association portray plausible characters and even teenagers Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff give impressive performances. Recommended without hesitation!
