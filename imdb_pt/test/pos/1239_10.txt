Why would I say that? Because when the movie ended, I was in a good mood. So many people exclaim at the end, wow! Bruce Willis can be funny. For those of you who believe that he has learned to act after the sixth sense, you must be very young in your career. He won an emmy for best actor in a comedy series before making Die Hard. It's like saying, wow, heaven has learned to lay snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life. The movie was hilarious. What strikes me is how some other comments made about this movie claim there are no memorable lines or scenes. Spoiler ... <br /> <br /> The waaaambulance? Am I not a loser? Have you ever seen an adult scream that I'm not a loser before? <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was great. It was funny, it was never boring and, in a weird Disney way, it had a purpose to do. Something to do with life and of course any kid movie trying to do that is in your head, but for the first time, I did not care. <br /> <br /> If you did not watch. Do it. You will like.
