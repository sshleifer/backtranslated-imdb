If you've been to Ukraine, this movie is absolutely hilarious. From teenagers using gold chains, listening to hip hop and break dance alongside jokes about airbags in cars and waitresses in total shock to meet a vegetarian, this movie really captures bits of Ukraine that you would never know unless it was there. I spent most of the film nodding and thinking, "Yes, that's exactly right." It's a lot of fun if you understand Russian too because subtitles do not always do it justice. The actors are so credible and Elijah Wood does a great job of playing a socially inept Jewish boy. My favorite character is definitely Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., the "eye dog who sees" the grandfather who is actually a psychopath border collie. The characters are so eclectic and enjoyable that you believe they are real people.
