I cried like a little girl during the end of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it without sobbing. <br /> <br /> A major effort on the part of Ann Margaret, who has a mother with ten years of terminal who, knowing that her arthritic husband of steel will not be able to support the family when she is gone, organizes the adoption of her children before she departs. The role really deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> You really feel for this poor family when the dying mother gives her everything to ensure that her children do not end up in a poorly run state orphanage system. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, get it if you can.
