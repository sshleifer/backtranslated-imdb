A beautiful performance by Vittorio Mezzogiorno and a masterful by Jean-Hugues Anglade adorn this strange story of lust, desire and alienation in France. The work of the two protagonists is impressive - subtle, intense and passionate. Unfortunately, the script is deliberately turgid and sordid, and the overall effect leaves one with a depressed spirit. Still, those who can appreciate the good acting quality will be able to relish the brave work of the clues in this often difficult film journey of Galician low life. <br /> <br />
