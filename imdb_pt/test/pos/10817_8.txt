I found this DVD in the library and based on the notes on the jacket, it looked like it might be interesting: a black comedy set in 1940 in France just as the Germans are marching. ("Boy, should that make them roll in the corridors?") But it does! This is a clever, original, suspenseful and funny movie. I do not remember seeing anything like this before? foreign or U.S. That the writer / director can find humor when we know that part of the result (the Germans will occupy France for four years) is remarkable. That he does it with so much charm is part of the pleasure. What starts as black comedy and fluff until it ends up having a couple of serious moments ?? including a run to release a "heavy water" hiding place (which was part of the preliminary research for the atomic bomb) and a brief introduction of History 101 to the principles of the Vichy collaborationist government that would govern southern France for most of the time . German occupation. * But do not let any of it scare you: the movie itself is funny, charming and romantic, and it's still up front. <br /> <br /> One of the best things is the combination of actors we've seen so often (Adjani and Depardieu) and others we've never heard of before. Along the way, there are two twists: Virginie Leydoyen and Grégori Derangère. Both are impressive, but Mr. Derangère is especially so. According to IMDb, was he in ten movies before this? but he also defeated Caesar as "Most Promising Actor" for that role, so apparently he was not so well known even in France. Is he a combination of romantic lead and comic actor? and it makes everything seem so easy. Can you be reminded of Cary Grant in "Bringing Up Baby" and "Arsenic and Old Lace"? it is difficult to make comedy on film because the risks are huge that the actor may seem inept. But Grant did it charmingly, and this guy did too. I think we'll hear more about it in the future. <br /> <br /> To be sure, this movie will not please everyone ?? there is a bit of violence, although nothing you do not see on TV every day. But if you're ready for something original, you may feel after you've seen it that you've discovered a cinematic gem. <br /> <br /> * The so-called "spoiler" in this comment.
