I remember when this movie went out and watched a few times on VHS. I was so happy when it was finally released on DVD. I was hoping for widescreen, but at the moment it would take what was available. I love how they used colors in the film, the outdoor scenes are so vivid with colors. The trees are the greenest I have ever seen. Most of the film was filmed in Stillwater, Minnesota, a beautiful city located on the St. Croix River. They must have explored locations to shoot because they did a great job. The story is well written and directed. I would rate this as one of Peter Horton's best. I'm also surprised that Andrew Dintenfass (the director of photography) has not done more. He did an incredible job. The performance is also on the rise. It's amazing to see two actors of such young age take this kind of film. Annabella Sciorra did a great job as Dexter's mother. Who would not want her as a mother.
