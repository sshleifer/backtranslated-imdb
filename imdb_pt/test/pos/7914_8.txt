When Patricia Newell is attacked after witnessing the murder of her cousin, Detective Carrella turns the city in search of the murderer. In identifying the killer after an intense persecution, Patricia is sent to live with relatives in the country. For Carrella, the case is closed ... or is "Blood Relatives" a neglected masterpiece. Donald Sutherland plays a police officer and it's cool to see Donald Pleasance in a small role as a child molester. The conclusion is quite disturbing. Still "Blood Relatives" is more of a mystery than a horror movie, so gore fans will be disappointed. A must-see for fans of old-fashioned mystery movies. 9 out of 10.
