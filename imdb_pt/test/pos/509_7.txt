I hope the summary line does not annoy you so much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show / Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I did not like in another paragraph so it will be easier to read! <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good things! The quote "strong bloody violence" (which is used by rating tables, to describe the content of a movie, fits right here.) This is not a movie for children! character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy storyline to hold / justify the action scenes! <br /> The original idea is also very engaging and clever. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are great here too. <br /> <br /> OK for the things I did not like.General story is very thin.It's enough as I wrote above to keep the action scenes together, but there could be more.And a character like Blade deserves more (imo) is not the best. .. also the use of clich√©s does not help.Some characters are subscribed ... That's it!
