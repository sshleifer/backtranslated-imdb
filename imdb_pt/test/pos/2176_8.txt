I think this is the first time I see a Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle movie. I really liked him in his role as a butcher. The way he moves is very funny, in my opinion, for example, how he handles the knife and how he rolls a cigarette. I think he's a good actor; his facial expressions really fit the role he plays, for example, as he flashes to the audience in the end. But it could be added that this was probably not too difficult. Anyway, I think he would have deserved a longer career. As you probably know, it was ruined by greedy journalists who made money by printing fake accusations that they said they were involved in a scandal. <br /> <br /> The plot is not very important. In the first half, Fatty and Alum are shopkeepers and rivals for the affection of Almondine. After a heavy food fight, Almondine is sent to a girls' school by her father, the owner of the store. (This is the beginning of the second semester). Both Fatty and Alum enter the school in drag, and the fight for Almondine continues. (Some of the names of the characters are different in the version I saw. It seems that for some reason they replaced the original title cards with new ones.) There are many cheesy jokes like food fights and pratfalls, but they are well done in my opinion. And there are some jokes I really enjoyed, for example, how do they make the dog run the pepper mill (or is it a coffee mill?), Or the scene where Fatty wears a coat, though obviously not necessary, or when Miss Teachem, the head of the girls' school, hits Fatty, and he hits her back. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is also funny about it, his first movie; a good addition to the cast. In the first half he is a customer in the store, in the second half he supports Alum in his fight for Almondine. I like his acrobatics, for example, when Fatty pushes him from one room to another, he does not show a simple fall, but he lands on his hands and head and does a little pirouette. Beware of a scene in the food fight: Alum throws a bag of flour for him, but she misses and hits the owner of the store. This makes Buster laugh, which must be a rarity, since he usually always shows a neutral expression (which, as you probably already know too), gave him the nickname "The Great Stone Face." Alum St. John, who plays Alum, was the nephew of 'Fatty' Arbuckle, and later became famous for the role of 'Fuzzy' that he played in many westerns.) <br /> <br /> I like this as much as I like, for example, 'One Week' and 'The Balloonatic' (films that Buster did later, without 'Fatty'). And that did not make me laugh too loud - but it made me smile a lot, so I gave it eight points.
