Anyone who has spent some time working in a hospital or medical center has to enjoy this movie. The plot is absolutely wild, but fun from start to finish. The acting is superb. George C. Scott is the brilliant physician, but class A fails as husband, father. Diana Riggs, a sex symbol of the 1960s and 1970s (of The Avengers), saves him from himself. The surrounding cast is superb and the dialogue quite entertaining. I think I liked the movie more when I saw the 4th, 5th. or 6. time because I have taken up much more of the richness of dialogue and interaction of the characters. Worth seeing again. You just will not want to check in at a hospital in the near future.
