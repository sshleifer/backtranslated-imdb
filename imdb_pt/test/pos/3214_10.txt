this is really a great series. I love the show and I'm so glad it has not been canceled yet. has a good mood and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. the yes for the Gilmore girls! it is very cool. they are a good-humored and sarcastic group. They do everything together, as do my mother and me. ya for Gilmore girls. Um, I'm running out of lines. but I love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they needed to be together. and I just love Sookie St. James! she is so incredible. and the show would not be anywhere without Michel. the whole show is dry humor, sarcasm and life in a very small town where everyone knows each other ... especially the Gilmore Girls.
