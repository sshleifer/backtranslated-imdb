Most people will consider Yul Brynner's greatest performance to be like the ruler of Zion in THE KING AND I. He certainly gave him a great deal of humor to test his skills, from comic to tragic, from eager to learn by mastering hateful. . This also showed him as an "interview singer" and a dancer. Finally, as was his Broadway Tony Award-winning performance, the film allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway performance as well. <br /> <br /> But he made other films that showed his talents as well as KING AND I. His comic twist once again with feeling was very good. The same happened to General Bunin in ANASTASIA, or his Ramses in the TEN COMMANDMENTS. However, he came awfully close to being a successor of the 1950s to Eric Von Stroheim as "the man you love to hate". A certain vulnerability in his performances and roles drew him to the audience of the film, even after his best years as a star were after him - and he retreated more and more to repeat the King of Zion on television and on stage. For me, his best performance is in this 1959 drama with Deborah Kerr, Jason Roberts Jr., Robert Morley, EG Marshall, Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard. The film is set in very modern times - the powder keg that went to Hungary in 1956 when it briefly appeared that the Iron Curtain was about to collapse under the reforms of Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his supporters. But the Hungarian Revolution collapsed due to bad weather. The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent tanks to crush the revolt (and arrested and executed Nagy and other reformers). The West stood ready and let this happen: England and France had been caught up in the Suez crisis, and the US had rebuked them and Israel for attacking Egypt. Due to the actions of three close US allies, the West found it difficult to condemn the exaggeration of the Soviet Union. It was an unfortunate situation, and the Hungarians never forgot how they were abandoned. <br /> <br /> In the film, Brynner is Major Surov, a Russian intelligence officer who is watching some of the Hungarian leaders. revolt, one of whom is Paul Kedes (Jason Robards). Kedes may be receiving assistance from some Westerners on a bus tour of Hungary, led by Robert Morley (including Marshall, Jackson, Howard and Kerr). The latter are being held in a hotel while the bus is being repaired, and Brynner mingles with them, hoping to find Robards' whereabouts. But Brynner is human - he tries to be insinuating with these people (all of whom see him as a monster), and in sequence, when he drinks a little too much, he confronts them with issues that have bothered historians since 1945: How come (even if we notice that Russia had Stalin in charge) relations between Russia and the West collapsed so quickly? The Allies had generally worked well together from 1941 to 1945, but after Yalta and Potsdam all kinds of mutual suspicions had arisen. Did they have to do this? Surov is a good officer but is torn in half by loyalty to the communist regimes in the Soviet Union and Hungary that he supports, and his growing affection for Kerr, who is hiding Robards, but is also willing to notice the more human side of the major Russian. And as the film reaches the tragic climax, we see how Surov decides whether to follow his sense of duty, or he will pity Kerr, Robards and the other Westerners who want to leave. It becomes a real fight for him - and one that he may gain too late. It was a great film about a tragedy in postwar Europe and possibly the most thoughtful role Yul Brynner has ever described.
