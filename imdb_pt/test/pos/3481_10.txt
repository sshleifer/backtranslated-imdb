I just watched a movie that by all means should have been forced to a second MOW rate in lifetime ... but trust the Irish to avoid it being anything other than saccharin. The whole set-up, less screams "Here's a message about what's really important in life," but the execution was way to the "Let's see exactly what we can do, here." <br /> <br /> This helps have two fantastic actors on the tracks - James McAvoy (as Rory) and Stephen Robertson (as Michael). While Rory is offered as the next saint - no matter the language and attitude, he is the "life force" in this piece and could easily have been unbearable in his "careful" attitude - McAvoy keeps him sharp enough to keep him from being very sweet. But the revelation is Stephen Robertson as Michael. Not since Leonardo Di Caprio in "... Gilbert Grape" did one so perfectly capture a person with an affliction that I began to believe that he really was an actor with cerebral palsy. And your eyes ... my God, he can end them. <br /> <br /> This movie is, to paraphrase Rory, fuck and amazing. Go see that. Take a box of tissues and enjoy every well-deserved tear ... and laugh.
