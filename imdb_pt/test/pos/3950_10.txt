I can not get this movement out of my brain. It's definitely totally different from everything else out there. I've seen a ton of movies during the holidays and while some are fine, nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There's just something cool about the actors and how they put the movie together. It's like there are really scary things mixed with some hilarious black humor and fuck. Franco is great, but the older guy steals the show in some scenes, like when he punches the boy in the grave of the dirt. I think some politically correct will not like the vibe (do not bring your grandma), but it's totally amazing. The best is the kaliedescope style. There are some really serious things mixed with super interesting road images. The movie really leaves you sad and scared in some parts, but it also turns your head to what's happening and the way it's filmed. Is WTF with the world? Sooo many critics are raving about all these supposedly revolutionary breakthrough films and when you see they are boring and predictable and not-all-that. I do not understand why there are many other better choices. Blind Spot is really great because it gives you thrills and chills and the next great power of the star, but it does so in a completely new and definitely totally radical way.
