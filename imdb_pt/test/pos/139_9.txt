They say it's always better in horror movies to leave things to the viewer's imagination - to hide certain details from the audience in order to please their sense of imagination, plunge into their fears and let them give birth to their darker thoughts. <br /> <br /> This was not the case when I watched Bakjwi, under the American title of Headquarters. Now playing in select theaters near you. It seems that the filmmakers did not want to spare any details. There will be blood in this film and you will try to look away. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the review, please visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi .html Thanks and hope you have enjoyed reading above.
