MPAA Rating PG-13 <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 or more <br /> <br /> My rating * 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> William H. Macy delivers impressive performance as the role of Mr. Neuman. It makes you feel supportive and afraid for it simultaneously. The story begins as a comedy and slowly but steadily it becomes almost like a horror movie with twists and turns that Macy struggles to master. I could not take my eyes off this movie even after it was over, and I could not believe it ended when it happened. ONE MUST SEE. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH CAN BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER FOR SOME <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, look at the plot this way: The Neumans are the United States as a whole, and the character which Meat Loaf Aday interprets are the people in the United States who are anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> This was a very nice film and I would recommend it to anyone I saw on the street.
