"The Honkers" is probably the best Slim Pickens performance of all time. When we were filming, everyone involved in the production realized that Slim was Oscar material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a photo of James Bond released at the same time and did not pay much attention to "The Honkers". Personally, I feel that this movie was underestimated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's "Junior Bonner" was at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our movie. Also, Cliff Robertson did a rodeo movie a few months before our release and that may have hurt us as well. The picture is worth watching, if only for the rodeo - some of the best ever filmed - filmed by James Crabbe. The director and my co-writer, Steve Ianat, died a few weeks after the movie's release, interrupting a promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife Sally, her daughter Gaby and her newborn son Stefan. Please give this movie a chance. I'm betting you'll say it was worth it. I thank anyone who has had time to read this. Stephen Lodge
