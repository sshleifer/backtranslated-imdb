This film is a masterpiece to simplify. Especially the double exposure made by videographer Julius Jaenzon. It is cleverly done even with the standards we are accustomed to today, seventy-eight years later. Viktor Sjöström, the director, also plays the main character, David Holm. On New Year's Eve night he is killed in a fight, and legend says that the first to die in the new year, will have to work as a collector of souls in the form of a transparent ghost. There is a new collector of souls to be named every year. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the alcoholic David Holm rises from his dead body (as the soul is leaving his earthly body) on the churchyard. (where the fight took place) is a real prize for a filmloving eye. Also when the present collector of souls arrives with his horse and his chariot is a beautiful but also scary scene. David Holm recognizes this collector of souls as a drinking companion of the previous life. Now it's your turn to take over. Like Scrooge in Dickens' story "A Christmas Carol", David is shown what his life and deeds have brought to the people around him. <br /> <br /> The film is about the danger of abusing drugs, in this case alcohol. It is based on a book by the Nobel Prize winner, Selma Lagerlöf. Viktor Sjöström has filmed some more of his books, but this is the one that has the best result, perhaps because this book is the most cinematic of them. <br /> <br />
