I hoped it was good, having seen some other amazing ozone moments, and read a lot about it ... but this movie is brilliant - clever, very clear (emotionally and visually), perfect at all times. every movement exists for a reason, everything fits so intimately and primordially true and honest. this is the movie about beauty and innocence; about simplicity.
