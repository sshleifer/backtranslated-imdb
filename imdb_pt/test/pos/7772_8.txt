From the opening sequence, packed with black and white photos reminiscent of Gordan Parks photos, this film takes the viewer to a feeling of artistic rebirth. The backdrop of a poetry cafe aptly named "The Sanctuary" provides just that. The jazz that permeates the film and the cinematography will seduce you. <br /> <br /> This love story allows love to grow, evolve and mature, a rarity in hollywood. Everyone can identify with some stage of their journey toward the other. This tale of two artists who fail to reach agreement sparked a debate among viewers. Should she be gone? Should he have stopped her? Who knows ...? Starring Larissa Tate (Darius Lovehall) and Nia Long (Nina Moseley) with a performance of stealing the scene of Isiah Washington (Savon) and Lisa Nicole Carson (Josie Nichols) as the final best friend, this movie is a romantic gem. <br /> <br /> See this with someone you love (wink).
