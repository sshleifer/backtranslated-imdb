This film is certainly well constructed, beginning and ending in the dark, focusing on Lili Smith / Schmidt, Julie Andrews, initially the singer 'angel' after the notorious spy. <br /> <br /> It's beautiful! I watched the movie 15 years ago and watched it again recently. Although rejected by critics in the 1970s as exaggerated, "cinema vulgaris," and lacking structure (among others), time proved to be wrong. Blake Edwards certainly produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality. <br /> <br /> The film rises and turns (aerial photography; Julie Andrews in motion) and captivates. One has only to believe in the premise that Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong. Neglecting the lukewarm chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson, one must believe that these are lovers - who in every innocence fall in love with each other. And in the end, love is so much more important than winning wars. And so it is to maintain innocence. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of unobtrusive acting, and the film certainly reaches emotional depths, often not seen in comedies. <br /> <br /> There are wonderful comic elements (prefiguring the French henchmen in Victor / Victoria), interesting diplomatic posts (remembering The Tamarind Seed, seen about 18 years ago) and a general sense of goodwill. <br /> <br /> Suspend all disbelief and this movie will take you away. Julie Andrews' war songs and the astonishing Whistling Away the Dark are enough reason to turn on the TV, just for the soundtrack. And the number of striptease, like the number of 'Jenny' in Star! job. <br /> <br /> This movie, like a good champagne, has aged well. Paramount should bring it to the DVD as soon as possible. The same applies to the transfer of Star's disc! for DVD. These are interesting pieces of meticulous and understated work by Julie Andrews.
