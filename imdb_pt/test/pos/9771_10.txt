I saw this drama on cable TV. Although I've only seen two shows, I love this drama. I hope more series are transmitted by cable. <br /> <br /> Even describing horrible and absurd situations in a prison camp, it shows us an indomitable spirit, human warmth, friendship and humanity. They do not know whether they can survive or not, but they held on to their hope strongly without being discouraged by adversity. <br /> <br /> I know this movie is not realistic like other war documentaries, but I do not want to blame for it. It makes me believe in the strong will of people in the most difficult situation. <br /> <br /> 'Private Bill', especially, this episode touched my heart. <br /> <br /> I remember all the scenes. I always hate math. But after seeing this drama, I can understand something about math ... Mathematics is your connection between past and present, it also symbolizes eternity. <br /> <br /> 'Time, light and memory framed in a circle.' Like other victims of the war, he lost his lover for irresistible fate. I am immersed in your time and memory as if you have experienced the same thing. <br /> <br /> He experienced the great loss, but has pure passion for study. <br /> <br /> He began his study at the camp, his joy to realize, <br /> <br /> I believe his dedication to study sustained him. <br /> <br /> I've seen it several times, but the meaning of this movie has never disappeared. Every time I saw it, I felt the same deep emotion. <br /> <br /> Your songs are beautiful, harmonious, <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I can not hear OST.
