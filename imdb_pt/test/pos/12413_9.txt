I know Chill Wills used to play lovely old Western guys. But its role in this segment is something I remember a long time ago. Wills could be a first-rate villain. Yes, Burgess Meredith's fall was correct! That look in Hepplewhite's eyes! He expressed swine greed, ignorance and the threat of violence at one go. Great performance, I think. <br /> <br /> The segment itself was also good. Question: Could the little black bag not cure alcoholism? I think so, with Fall. But the doctor would have been wise to apply the cure, if he had, as soon as possible to Hepplewhite. <br /> <br /> There was a time that was annoying, but also necessary. And it seems to repeat itself in those segments of the Night Gallery. It is the constant need to be Sermonize. Well, that's what we have, again, with Dr. Fall. I do not know what was more frustrating, losing the black bag and all its miracles or did not stop the fall of preaching on the benefit of the bag to mankind, while rubbing the greedy face of Hepplewhite in the mud, and therefore almost begging for Hepplewhite to attack it. But as I say, it was necessary. At least that was for me. Otherwise, we could not see the performance of Wills discussed above. All done without moving a muscle or speaking a word.
