I came across this by chance. I was at my friends house and he had just started watching, so I sat thinking we were going to shoot the breeze while it was playing in the background. However, within a few seconds I was immersed in this documentary, and we both spent the rest of the time completely focused on it and not saying a word to each other. <br /> <br /> I never knew the history of the first solo around the world of yacht racing, much less the tragic events of a man's attempt against odds, which he set out to be his redemption for all his misfortunes life, but ends up becoming an example of them. Not knowing the story, I watched it with as much fervor as I imagine those who were reading about the race at the time it was really happening, involved in what was going on and eager for more information, hoping that the lonely amateur would go against the odds and winning the pros, which makes the shocking twists of history even more tragic, I felt like I was living the story. <br /> <br /> The story is told very carefully and the interviewees clearly had time to reflect on the tragedy, which gives a great insight, but is also contrasted with the archive of interviews at the time of the tragedy, the recordings and photographs of solitary sailors are also used with excellence, and the insights into sailors' minds and how solitude was affecting them was superb. <br /> <br /> I am shocked that this story is no longer widely known or has been turned into a film, but also grateful. Grateful to have this documentary-drama to tell the story of who knew the man, rather than some unsatisfied film adaptation, and grateful to have picked this gem by pure chance. <br /> <br /> You have to see if you like documentaries or not.
