This film kept my interest from the beginning to the end, with lots of laughter and real on the land, acting all over the cast. Glynn Turman, (Preach Jackson) is the star of the picture playing the role of an intelligent guy who enjoys poetry and had a very sexy girlfriend. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs, (Cochise Morris) was a superb athlete at Cooley H.S. and even won a scholarship to a famous college. There are scenes in this photo with the Chicago Police Department chasing all these guys in a Cadillac and a visit to the Lincoln Park Zoo with monkey manure being thrown around. The music is great and there is great photography around the city of Chicago. Great movie, enjoy.
