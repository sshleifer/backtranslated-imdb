I have just seen this broadcast on Channel 4. Having seen some of the previous comments here, I believe I would like to declare, first of all, that I am not in favor of the death penalty. With that out of the way, I was expecting great things from this movie, but it just did not deliver. Dead Man Walking is very well done, with good performances and a good script. In fact, it's hard to blame him artistically. However, I felt that although she tried to face the issues surrounding the death penalty, she seemed to deviate from the religious / moral stance (which is hardly surprising since the main character is a nun). Although I'm not a heartless individual, I did not really identify with any of the characters in the story. If you do not take religion seriously, you probably will not see much in this movie. I think Peter Medak's Let Him Have It was a much more powerful and moving film, and I strongly recommend that anyone think of watching it to see it.
