This is the kind of movie that can give you a nightmare, plus it's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Hardware Wars is the only good parody in Star Wars, other films like Spaceballs have failed. This is the only lie movie I've ever seen, does not steal Star Wars, make it fun, and that's what spoofs should be.
