This was a great anime. True the animation is old but still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that was kind of long. <br /> <br /> Japanese movie star Hiroyuki Sanada who played Ujio of Last Samurai played the main character Jiro and was directed by Rintaro who made the Galaxy Express 999 and Metropolis. <br /> <br /> The anime has a good animation for an old anime, interesting characters like the main villain Tenkai and Ando Shouzan and of course we will not forget the beautiful scores of the film. <br /> <br /> After all, it's worth watching fans of anime, general animation, action and Samurai / Ninja movies. Despite the lows in the movie that the film is not a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie.
