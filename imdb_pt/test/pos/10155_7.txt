This is not among my favorite Hitchcock movies, though I have to admit it's still pretty good. Among the things I really enjoyed were the presence of Jimmy Stewart (he always improves to the most mediocre stuff) and the incredibly scary killer (who looks like a skeleton with only a thin layer of skin stretched over it). Although it cost a lot of money to the studio, I did not particularly care for Doris Day in the movie - she seemed to cry a lot and shout "Que Sera" as a quarterback. Yeah, I know she should sing like that, but it always made me hate this song. Excuse. The other complaint, although minor, about the film was that it was a bit "very polished" and "Hollywood-style." The original version (also made by Hitchcock) just looked much bolder and sordid - and that contributed to the scary environment.
