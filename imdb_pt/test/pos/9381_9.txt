George Barry's "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is, at its root, a dark fairy tale told through a horror movie frame. It is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 1970s, and it is absolutely criminal that the photo was basically stolen and distributed without Barry's knowledge (those responsible for this theft should be fed in bed the fastest possible). If you are looking for obvious or angry action, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is not the movie for you. "Death Bed" is a smoother and stranger drive-in image; It plays like a totally weird, half-remembered dream. I would recommend reading Stephen Death's summary of "Death Bed" in the FAB Press book, "Nightmare USA" (he describes the vibe of the film perfectly). Intentionally or not, I noticed "Death Bed" tones in every aspect, from the films "Phantasm" to "Cemetery Man" by Michele Soavi, to the magical / slipstream realism fiction of authors such as Kelly Link. Barry is an original and fair world that I'm sure he would have followed "Death Bed" with a series of fantastically bizarre movies.
