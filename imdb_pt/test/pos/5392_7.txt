Gary Cooper and a marshal change their identities, as they both agree that Cooper would be more effective at facing the bad guys. What is remarkable in this film are the costumes of both marshal and Steve Cochran, who is the bad guy. Cochran uses his weapons behind, probably to crossdraw. The film starts off quite exciting with a confrontation with Wild Bill Hickok. Ruth Roman, very handsome is the marshal's fiancee. There is a lot of action, never a moment of boredom, but you have to concentrate because the story is a bit complicated. Good entertainment.
