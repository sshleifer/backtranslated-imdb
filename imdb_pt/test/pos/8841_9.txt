I saw this movie accidentally for the first time when they showed it on TV and I arrived too late ... I really was lucky out there. It is truly incredible; (as isolated as possible on this planet, made the "abyss" look ET in the council pool) through the interesting characters (Keith David is especially good as the reactionary Childs - "What if we're wrong about it?" - "So we're wrong.") And the effects (more disgusting than Alien). <br /> <br /> Moreover, however, the real tension and fear in the film has nothing to do with the effects. It's the people you start to be afraid of; knowing that one of them may - or may not be - "All that seems to be." It is certainly the feeling of "who goes there?". <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great; This really increases the isolation, the fear and the gravity of the situation. <br /> <br /> Finally, the epilogue really cuts out. Even more than the "But again, who does?" Bladerunner punchline. Enough said.
