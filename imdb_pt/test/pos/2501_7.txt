This movie is not kinda bad. It may be a bit long sometimes, but carried away by beautiful scenery, an IMMERSELY lovely love letter and great actors, you forget the time and enjoy. The grand prize, however, goes to Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan as .......... well that would be revealing, but they are just GREAT!
