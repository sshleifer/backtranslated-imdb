I liked Ramin Bahrani's Man Push Cart, and this movie is just as good. This slice of life is almost a documentary about how life at the edges is lived. <br /> <br /> Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do an excellent job as a 12-year-old brother and a 16-year-old sister. who live in a small room in a car shop. There are no parents; they are surviving. Ali complements his income by stealing auto parts, selling pirate DVDs and selling bullets on the subway. Izzie complements her income by working on a food truck selling herself. They are trying to make money only with their own truck. <br /> <br /> We are tempted to express outrage at the fact that these two children are left alone, and surely someone can get very upset by Izzie. It sells its body to willing truckers, but the fact is that it exists today in the richest country in the world, not in some underdeveloped lands. Save the indignation and do something.
