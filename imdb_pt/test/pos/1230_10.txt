This is a scary short film. Both James Franco and Rachel Miner feature performances that hurt, touch and remain with you. Since this is called a tragic story this is not much of a spoiler. But I wanted to change the outcome, even if it was true for the story, because I had already worried about these people. I can only think of some short films that had this effect on me. Beautifully filmed, acted, edited. High caliber work around, even for the use of sound and / or certain music to advance the story. The final credit song finished the job, further twisting the excitement of me. This is the first rate from start to finish. Congratulations to the writer / director and everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is my first review of a movie in the comments section. I promised to do it in exchange for a copy of the DVD. The review could be good or bad, just my honest opinion. That's it, and it's the least I can do. I'm so glad I saw it.
