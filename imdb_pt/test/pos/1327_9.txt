I have heard that after the first film of the Oceans, the sequences begin to descend. I believe this is not the case (at least not for this movie). This movie is even better than the first movie! The original crew returns three years after successfully stealing Terry Benedict's casinos. Now, Benedict XVI is visiting each of them personally telling them to recover the money within two weeks. To do this, they must do some robberies in Europe to get the money. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. The cast of stars exceeded expectations. Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some confusing moments in this movie. But it does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments. Anyway, this movie is made just for harmless fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great assault movie. I rate this movie 9/10.
