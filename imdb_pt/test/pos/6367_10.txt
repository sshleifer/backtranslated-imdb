I first saw The Couch Trip (1988) on late night television years ago and instantly fell in love with it. The funny thing is that I usually get all the comedies done, but I've never heard of it until I saw it. Dan Ackroyd is a simple and simple period. He made some great movies with Belushi and did not forget about Saturday Night Live. But I think Couch Trip is probably the best and funniest of him. With a good supporting cast of Charles Grodin, David Clennon and Walter Matthau, this piece of cinema shines with comic gold. Ackroyd's wife, Donna Dixxon, even does a great job here. My favorite movie moments involve Ackroyd and David Clennon's character, Lawrence Baird. Those two played well in each other. So if you have not seen a good comedy, take a trip back to 1988 and rent or buy The Couch Trip. I just did, Amazon 78 cents. What a bargain, too bad I was hit with a shipping fee of 2.50. Oh well it's still worth it. Any guy will love this movie take a look.
