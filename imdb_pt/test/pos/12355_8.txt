Sheba Baby, is another Pam Grier Blaxploitation film. It was one of the less visceral films of the genre Pam. Pam plays Sheba Shane, who is a Chicago detective. Sheba's father owns a small lending company in Missouri. When the local mafiosi try to run their father, Sheba goes after the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier had already made her mark in the Blaxploitation films when Sheba Baby appeared. Fans of Coffy and Foxy Brown, know that Pam is capable of an explosive intensity as an actress. In Sheba Baby, the fire performance that viewers expected from Pam was not so evident in this film. Not that Pam does not jump at Sheba Baby. She is not as vigilant as a runaway train, as she was in her previous Blaxploitation films. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast of this film is a distinct disappointment. So Sheba Baby is Pam's movie. And although Pam is a bit more restrained than in her other films, she still gives a convincing performance on Sheba Baby. This movie is definitely worth it if you are a burning fan of Pam Grier.
