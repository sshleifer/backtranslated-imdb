This is one of my favorite movies, ever. The story is so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the time, this movie never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but we lack what we have here. This is funny, creative and always on target. This movie has something extra that you can not learn from books. However, this is not the best animated film of all time. This title belongs to BRILLIANT Toy Story. But this is a respectable second, followed immediately by The Lady and the Tramp. Just watch and enjoy one of the greatest achievements of cinema. And by the way, I'm not a little boy, this is for the older audience wanting to recapture their childhood. An absolute must!
