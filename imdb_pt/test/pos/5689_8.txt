Gore hounds beware ... this is not your movie. This little bitter nail has very little blood and courage. It's basically a version of Open Water that is effective and worth it. But what sets it apart is that we actually like the three tracks (unlike Open Water) that are seen on top of a tree when a crocodile turns over the fishing boat and chews on the guide. We do not want any evil to come to any of them. So when they start getting into dangerous situations ... we really do care. <br /> <br /> Now I like murderous animal movies, but I was not too impressed with Lake Placid up to Primeval (though I'm still waiting to see Rogue and hoping he's somewhere as good as this!) but this little bug did the job and did the job well. It's frightening are they creative and only falls in the mill rush crying frantically and arguing for brief periods of realism, so I never got bored. <br /> <br /> I remember reading the true story that inspired this, where three guys went fishing and two ended up in a tree while their friend was killed by the crocodile. But the thing that always impressed me and that was left out of the movie was that the crocodile did not devour the friend. No. For hours and hours he swam around the tree and shook his body still in his mouth to the friends in the tree. Looking like staying, if you come here, that's what's going to happen to you.
