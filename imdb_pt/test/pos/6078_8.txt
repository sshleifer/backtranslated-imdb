In World War II, a severely burned amnesiac known only as "The English Patient" is found in the African desert and is transported to Italy, where he joins a convoy of medical troops and others in an abandoned monastery. Among them are Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse whose lovers often encounter unpleasant ends; Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Whately), two explosives experts searching for bombs at the monastery; and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a Canadian soldier who knows the identity of the English patient and has a score to solve. Through flashbacks we learn the story of the patient: he is Laszo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who, in the late 1930s, engages with a group of British cartographers including Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Katharine (Kristen Scott-Thomas), while mapping the deserts of North Africa. After Clifton leaves them in the government business, Katharine and Clifton fall in love with each other in the desert, resulting in a case that, of course, has a less than happy ending. If one is able to ignore the illogical parts of the story (for example, why would a patient found in Africa be sent to what is essentially the front line of the war in Italy?), then you can appreciate "The English Patient" as a throwback to David Lean's clever, layered and epic epics in the 1960s. Much more than "Titanic" or other epic novels of recent times, this film puts "Doctor Jivago" and "And the Wind Took" - an epic love story against a huge historical background. You should not expect a war movie, although there are some striking (if very brief) violence scenes that stand out more than the romantic sections, as is usually the case (Caravaggio's interrogation by a SS sadistic officer (Jurgen Prochnow ). ) in particular. <br /> <br /> The film is very ambiguous, with respect to just about everything. The central question of the film is: How far are you willing to go for love? As critics of the film are quick to point out, Almasy is, on the surface, a character far from sympathetic - he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving maps and information to the Germans, causing death. of his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and Caravaggio's torture, and actually killing a British soldier who arrested him at one point. The fact that Almasy is reprehensible in many ways is what matters - he is in love with Katharine and sees the world closely in terms of his love that loyalty to the country (or anything else) is secondary; as Almasy says, he hates "Property. To be possessed." The two are involved in a rather daring love affair (fucking hundreds of people at a Christmas party) and it is clear that Katharine is more attracted to the mysterious and exciting Almasy than the comparatively annoying Geoffrey. The sub-plot of 1944 is somewhat unstable and seems superfluous; the romance between Kip and Hannah is never completely believable, and I feel the film could have passed without it. But these sequences add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the movie, so I will not complain much. <br /> <br /> Like the epics mentioned above, the film is able to convey time and place through simple devices such as crowds, strategically placed posters, and military presence. We need not dwell on the fact that it is 1938 in Cairo, but it is helpful to know. The direction of Anthony Minghella and the cinematography of John Seale's desert are absolutely beautiful; the sand dunes, the sandstorms and the haunted caves of the desert are captured in beautiful detail. Gabriel Yared's trail is haunting and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> The acting is generally solid. Fiennes gives a very stratified performance as a mysterious, complex and haunted character. The difference between the Almasys of 1938 and 1944 is remarkable; an exciting and a little unconcerned, the other haunted and reflective. Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective as Katharine, the female explorer in pursuit of adventure, and Colin Firth gives one of his best performances as Geoffrey, who realizes from the outset that there is a competition for the exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe does a good job as Caravaggio, the awkward thief turned spy, driven by revenge. Jurgen Prochnow gives a performance that resembles Jose Ferrer in "Lawrence of Arabia" (and a similar character too): very brief but more memorable than some of the main characters. Some of the actors of 1944 are not worth noting: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good, but it is not worth noting. Kevin Whately, as Kip's ill-fated partner, does what he can with a rather small role. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient" is not a perfect movie, by any means, but vituperative attacks on it by much of the audience going to the movies deserves nothing. It may be a demonstration of how the film's sensitivity has changed since the Leans and Kubricks era, or perhaps people expected something simple to understand. Completely flawed, brilliantly directed and filmed, "The English Patient" is a wonderful modern epic. <br /> <br /> 8/10
