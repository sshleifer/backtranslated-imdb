Many scenes and dialogues are silly, but when you add it all up, that is, Machine's daily cycle, from depressing walkup to depressing bar, depressing burlesque, depressing smoke-filled poker games and back home, you have a strange sense that someone somewhere is trying to give a faithful description of the junkie's life around 1955. Be Sinatra, who obviously would have come across this type of character growing up in Hoboken and working in various bands, or Preminger, who uses the trail sound and Frankie-Zosch's subtext to let the addict's inner vision pass through the Hays Code cage. you get a good piece of accompaniment on On the Waterfront, which was filmed almost exactly the same time. A kind of realistic work that leaves you wondering, realistically, how deep is the drug culture in American life.
