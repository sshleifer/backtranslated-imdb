For a long time this was my favorite of the Batman movies. He had the best cinematography and a nervous feeling with two wild characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - along with the ever-interesting Christopher Walken. However, after the last screening, it finally slipped in my rating and frankly, I now prefer the latest Batman: Batman Begins, with Christian Bale. <br /> <br /> The GOOD - However, this is still the most intriguing of all. the last five Batman movies. Elegant cinematography here is the best of all Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is known for his films that feature stunning visuals, as this is a great example. The three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. Of the villains, I preferred Catwomen, finding it more fun to watch before and after she changed. The violence is not exaggerated here as in several other Batman stories, but you're never bored watching it. As he did in the first film, Michael Keaton does a great job playing Batman / Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br /> THE EVIL - For a movie based on a comic book that most kids reads, I still think these first two films. The films of Batman, both made by Burton, were very dark and the profanity was definitely not appropriate. Although, unlike the first movie, there was no use of the Lord's name in vain here, there were still swearing and both villains made many sexual observations. This would have been nice if they had not marketed this movie to children and adults. Danny DeVito's "Penguin" is downright rude on some points. "Grotesque" I can handle, but who wants "rough". Meanwhile, few guys complained about the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer playing Catwoman. Generall a lot of darkness and some cheap shots in Christian- bashing also made me reconsider my previously high rating of this movie. <br /> <br /> GENERAL - Fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this the most interesting in Batman. series, but very dark an advantage, very rude and very anti-religious all finally turned me off after a half dozen looks for this movie. Sorry, but I prefer a nicer Batman movie. After all, it's just a cartoon. Most will disagree, but I was glad to see the series brighten up after this one.
