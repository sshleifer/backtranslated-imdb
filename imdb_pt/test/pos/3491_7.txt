No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this movie is absolutely hilarious, almost on the same level as Borat. Of course, the ending drags on a bit, but if Borat's involvement does not hurt you, you must be the worst wacko in the history of crazy kids. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest ALIVE comedian, and here he has more laughter than Jude Law on a nude beach. I challenge you not to laugh. <br /> <br /> If you can pull the ten-foot bat on your back for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well-timed and extremely stupid jokes on a stupid story about a stupid character, watch this stupid movie. You'll be glad you did it. Keep Real!
