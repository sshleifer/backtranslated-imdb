"Dead Man Walking" is a film not about the death penalty, but about people involved in a death penalty case - the murderer, families whose children have been killed, the nun who becomes their spiritual advisor and what happens . It tells the story with little fanfare, but a lot of compassion and sensitivity. I have it on DVD, and every time I watch it (often it's never an easy movie to watch), I'm more impressed with what Tim Robbins and the whole cast made here. So revealing that it could be a documentary, so convincing that you can not look away, so subtle and so powerful ... "Dead Man Walking" is nothing less than a masterpiece. No matter if you are for or against the death penalty (or even have no opinion), this movie will make you think of problems for sure. It takes a screenwriter and courageous director to look at this material without hesitation even once, and everyone involved in the film pulls it out - there is not a single scene that sounds fake. A masterful film, but do not expect to see the light ... for some, the final scenes may be more graphic than anything imaginable, even if there is no blood or violence. You are drawn to this movie and become a participant, and there is a character for almost everyone to identify with. 10/10.
