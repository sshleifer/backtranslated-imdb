Sharky's Machine is a criminal drama set in the early 80's in Atlanta. It stars Burt Reynolds as a renegade police officer who is committed to stopping crime and corruption in his hometown. The story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a crime ring that has brought the city to his knees. Sharky's bond to overthrow this union is a high-priced prostitute he falls in love with during the course of the film. The action sequences are well done for the early 80's and the soundtrack / score is very good. The acting is B-level, but this is a pretty decent movie to have in your DVD collection. <br /> <br /> General 7/10 <br /> <br /> Peace /> Buggieblade
