There is a version of "Nevsky" which is shown with a live symphonic orchestra, choir, soloist and film. If it has already been done within a day trip you see "Nevsky" done that way. The Oklahoma Philharmonic Orchestra did this with the OKC Canterbury Choir (one of the best anywhere) a few years ago. I think I cried the whole thing, it was one of the most emotionally powerful movie experiences of my life. I'm listening to "Nevsky" on the radio now and it still rips me apart. There are films that I love, and pieces of classical music that I love, but there is no combination that I can think of that comes close to the impact of "Nevsky" performed in real time.
