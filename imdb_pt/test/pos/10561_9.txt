After watching Tipping the Velvet by the waters of Sarah, I decided to watch Fingersmith, the characters were so good at both performances, although missing Rachael Stirling in the adaptation of Fingersmith. <br /> <br /> The general story was a good choice, the twist and the unrolling of the characters were amazing! Excellent watch just missing Rachael Stirling! <br /> <br /> If you like the romance of two girls, this is not one of the best movies to watch. <br /> <br /> It takes a different twist than Tipping The Velvet, but as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to everyone!
