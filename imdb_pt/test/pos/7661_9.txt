Hercules, the Avenger, is by far the best single entry into the muscleman genre that I can remember. The accusation against the critics - a cut and paste of two previous Hercules films, with some new material added to look new - misses the fact that this cut-and-paste approach solves one of the main problems of criticism. sword and sandal movies. With most of these films, the average third sinks horribly - usually involving a love story or an arcane political intrigue or both (the queen falls in love with Hercules and his evil brother plot against them etc.). to watch the exciting finale. Hercules, the Avenger, eliminates all this crap from source films and adds a rather vivid narrative of an imitator of Hercules threatening to come to power. (It should be noted that this episode also functions as a distant but intentionally critical observation on the rise of fascism in Italy.) This also establishes a good final fight between the true Hercules and his imitator. In a narrower focus, I might also add that later editions have improved individual scenes borrowed from the other films. For my money, the riot scene here is much better than it first appeared in Hercules and the women in captivity as it was enhanced by the reduction of various characters and their complications in the plot. <br /> <br /> There are also diskette monsters, scary underworld atmospheres borrowed (literally) from Mario Bava, a whole ruined city, and the usual amount of lovely girls revealing dresses. Since no one expects any of these movies to compete with Seven Samurai - or even The Magnificent Seven - it seems a little picky about holding the movie borrowed from other movies against it.
