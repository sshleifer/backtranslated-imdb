Why is there so much anguish among the critics of IMDb that they hate this movie? It's not a masterpiece, but once you've seen it twice, it's a compelling drama in the world of networked TV. Robin Stone is the epitome of all Dan Rather, Phillip Stone and Brian What's-name on NBC. A mannequin of a man unable to love who achieves professionally, but fails miserably in his personal life. I worked for eight (8) years on Robin Stone's EXIST Network and EXIST news! <br /> <br /> The supporting cast works for me from Cannon (which may be annoying, but it's not in this movie) to Greene (who plays the pathos just right) to Wexler (who marks as the new model in love w / the image of the prince enchant and can not reconcile that image w / the true ugliness inside). Also noteworthy is the ending that some critics of IMDb claim to be an excuse. It is not! Listen to the song "He's moving on" for clues about the bow that Robin Stone's character travels that leads him to finally face his problems. He realizes that the answers do not meet the life he lived and the symbolic move away from those with whom he associates, in the end is perfect.
