Too bad this movie was never released. (Now it's playing on the cable.) I tuned in to my high regard for the stars and was rewarded for seeing a much better movie than the ones I've paid to see in theaters recently. I like to surprise myself. Often movies are marketed as "out of the ordinary," but are actually more of the same old recycled trash. This movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a comforting message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel. Even though he is asked by the plot to sing some of the most sentimental songs ever written, he does them so well that he does not care. Cathy Bates and Rupert Everett are well-meaning and superb, but a newcomer in the role of Cathy Bates's daughter-in-law steals every scene she's in. Give this movie a chance.
