Clint Eastwood plays a wounded Union soldier found by a girl from a confederate boarding school and he took and nursed back to health rather than handed over to Confederate soldiers. It seems that women-folk in this place have ulterior motives. Geraldine Paige, the director, justifies not transforming him into the Confederation and even passes him as his cousin. Of course when the man starts to feel better he becomes the lady man and is doing the rounds, but when he gets caught he is REALLY stuck, in fact he gets his leg cut off, but it's for the sake of him clear than for retribution. Things are taken a little further when certain women can not get what they want. I have not seen this for years and still have a certain strangeness that by today's standards is still quite strange. Not typical Eastwood at all. If you have not seen this one worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
