I just saw this movie for the second time. I first saw it in the mid-90s as a cutting-edge video selection. He retained his power. <br /> <br /> It is interesting from many aspects. One is that it is based on a true story. Two is a launch pad for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And three, there's Dennis Hopper in one of his best social roles of psychotic misadventures / characters. <br /> <br /> The film is also a study of how people act in different environments. You have characters in one-on-one, family, peer group, school, society settings in general, etc. History does well in demonstrating how a person will act in each environment. <br /> <br /> I wish I could Find the details of the actual murder to compare with the movie. I saw a little that indicated that it occurred in California and that several school friends were taken to see the corpse. <br /> <br /> This is a good choice for a video rental of a rainy night. Be prepared to feel insecure at the end.
