This is certainly a good movie, beautifully photographed and evocatively represented. Still, one must certainly criticize him, and Mizoguchi, for it is not without flaws and weaknesses. Mizoguchi really cared for women, and wanted to make statements about man's lack of sympathy and total cruelty, but sometimes he anticipates trying to make that statement by taking the wrong means. This is certainly a case in "The Crucified Lovers", "Princess Yang Kwei Fei" and "Zankiku monogatari". He sets the stage in feudal Japan, which leaves the viewer at the end with the partially correct exclamation: "Boy, feudalism sucks, I'm glad it's over ...". It is true, some of the scenarios such Mizoguchi's weakest films of this present would be impossible literary today. In addition, their female characters sometimes become archetypes of unrealistic self-sacrifice, which also simplifies the scenario in a less attractive way. Saying that "Crucified Lovers" is a good movie, with so few relative weaknesses, despite the cynical and sometimes cold and cynical prose of Ueda, the screenwriter helps this film to be placed. I still prefer and recommend Mizoguchi's "realist" and "contemporary" films of 1936: "Elegy of Osaka" and "Sisters of Gion" as well as his masterpieces, in which he showed more restraint and subtlety: "Ugetsu" , Sansho Dayu 'and' The Life of Oharu '.
