This is one of my favorite James titles in games because: The missions are fun to play, they have a lot of action on them, they can be difficult, which makes them fun to make the weapons you use are good. The way James Bond looks like in this James Bond game is beautiful, you can see Pierce Brosnan in it, which is cool and all the other characters in this game look like the actors who played them in the movie. There is no way you can not have a good time playing this game I loved. Also the game follows the movie practically maybe some added thing but practically follows the movie. In addition, the James Bond game has great graphics for the Nintendo 64 and for the bad there was no voice over the actors in this game, but who cared as long as the game was fun to play. <br /> <br /> Overall rating ** ****** out of **********
