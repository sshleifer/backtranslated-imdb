I am 13 years old and I am writing this comment on my mother's sign. She will write her own comment later. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite movie of all time. It was filmed in England in 1944. I watched it so many times when I was little I used the videotape. I love this movie and it has changed my life! The beautiful scenery. The mighty thoroughbred horse. The simple little Irish village with the young woman who wanted to do what no other girl had done, competed at The Grand National Steeplechase in London with her most beloved horse, The Pirate. All this made me want to ride a horse (which I did now for 7 years) and learn all I could about their races so that I could also draw and paint them. It's an innovative movie about winning against all odds, overcoming your fears, believing in yourself and reaching difficult goals by working hard. In addition, the horse racing scene was one of the best ever made and I have seen many movies with horse racing. I never get tired of watching this movie. Everything about it is perfect. Especially if you are a young girl and passionate about horses!
