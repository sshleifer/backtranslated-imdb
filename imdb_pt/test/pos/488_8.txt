The real-life case of an innocent First Nations chief (the Indian) by an officer in the city of Winnipeg (the Cowboy) is the basis of this TV movie. The real case has caused its fair share of racial tension in Canada, a Martin Luther King small-scale thing. The injustice of the First Nations people is becoming a landmark in the diet of Canadian cinema. What makes this movie worth seeing is the focus on family reactions. The father played by Gordon Tootoosis demands forgiveness and the brother played by Eric Schweig demands justice. Stars Gordon Tootoosis and Adam Beach (WINDTALKERS, SKINWALKERS) have minor, almost apparition-like appearances. The future protagonist Eric Schweig makes his mark on this film with a powerful performance. An honorable mention goes to veteran actor Gary Chalk, who has more than 100 films on his resume. His portrait of Inspector Dowson's troubled soul was worthy of a Gemini Award (the Canadian Emmy) along with Eric Schweig. The special effects (jumps, sequences of dreams) are occasional and not arrogant. Couple this with some beautiful northern Canadian landscapes and recent events involving police officers and First Nations people, such as the Neil Stonechild case, and you will have a very rewarding and relevant viewing experience.
