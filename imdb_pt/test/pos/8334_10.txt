A SUPERMAN Cartoon. <br /> <br /> When America reveals its new colossal bomber, the JAPOTEURS, an elite force of Japanese spies and saboteurs, attack. Stealing the giant, with the intrepid reporter Lois Lane aboard, and the fate of Tokyo or destruction, it's time for Superman to get involved ... <br /> <br /> This was another in the series of excellent cartoons initially created by Max Fleischer for the Paramount Studio. They feature great animations and fast, firm plots. Intended to appear in cinemas, they are miles ahead of their Saturday Morning counterparts. Bud Collyer is the voice of Superman; Joan Alexander does the honors for Lois Lane.
