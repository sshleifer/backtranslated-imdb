In the film of Luchino Visconti, Death in Venice, it is not only the beauty of the world that decomposes, but in the search of its own beauty, Gustav von Aschenbach becomes a mere shell of man. To understand decadence, we must recognize the beauty that enchants us, is best described and explained in a quote from Socrates found in Thomas Mann's death version in Venice, "beauty alone, is it lovely and visible at once?" the only aspect of the spiritual that we can perceive through our senses? What, if the divine, if reason, virtue, and truth speak to us through the senses? Should we not perish and be consumed by love? We see in the film that exactly this happens, the man is surrounded by a longing for beauty, that turns into saudade of the boy Tadzio. Even if the balanced part of your mind tells you that the worship of beauty can lead to sensuality and abandonment, it can not contain itself. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to describe it as a beautiful movie; Early on we see the extravagance of the living room, and we are treated to a perfect summary of the turn of the century upper class life, all captured perfectly by filmmaker Pasqualino De Santis. But Visconti does not surrender to the picturesque aspects of Venice. Instead, the glorious and sensual artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensual beauty, and these things are relegated to the past. The city we know as being of unparalleled beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a leisure resort with a nosy hotel staff. The streets become exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting dirt and rot, the city decays in tune with the protagonist. Only through flashbacks is it permissible to glimpse why this famous composer is a fragile and innocuous man. The death of his daughter, and presumably his wife, along with the failure of his music, allow us to understand why he is destroying himself. <br /> <br /> Alfred, with whom Aschenbach has deep conversations about the meaning of beauty and who can create it; but Alfred is more than a friend, he is Aschenbach's alter ego, and what Alfred says articulates the composer's own doubts and fears. The scene in which Aschenbach decides to leave Venice is immediately followed by a clip of Alfred saying that he is weak, alienated and has no feelings. In the end, we can conclude that these flashbacks are not reality at all. It is a decay of memory, rather than objective renderings of the past, these flashbacks become distorted memories. We can say that these are decomposed memories, because even Aschenbach alludes to this, he declares, "reality distracts us and degrades us"; and, following the scene in the travel agent's office, we see Aschenbach confront Tadzio and his family and warn them - leave Venice, but soon after the meeting we see him sitting with the clerk again and we realize that everything was in his imagination, he employs long scenes without dialogue that are framed by the poignant music of Gustav Mahler. It allows the mind of the beholder to wander as we observe Aschenbach's life and respectability to decay with the beauty around him. <br /> <br /> Slowly, the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by fatigue that is mixed with a growing awareness that the city is suffocating in filth. The ruined city paves the way for the attraction of the middle-aged man by Tadzio, it is a romantic desire for something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed, even in fantasy. The beauty of this Polish boy kindles a fire in him that at first makes him shine and then consumes him. The film ends with von Aschenbach sitting feebly in a beach chair watching Tadzio fight with his friend, we see the black ink of his hair dripping on his cheek and looks like rotten blood, is a sight of the moments of his life, although before his last Sigh. The final decay happened, around him the city is dirty, and with that he became what he hates. When Aschenbach dies, he has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film, a man who disturbed him. It was the search for beauty that began its decadence, in search of artistic beauty, he could not feel his own death and the city around him; his sensuality is favored, while constantly kept under control by the presence of death and decay. It is these three themes that unite convicts and death in Venice, beauty, death and decadence, these themes are the art of Visconti, the beauty of his work lies in the decay of beauty itself. <br /> <br /> In this film we are treated with the deliquescence of a great man. We see the honored composer Gustav von Aschenbach in search of true and pure beauty, and it is in search of that trait that he deteriorates around him and leads him to a miserable and solitary death, observing the aim of his affection. I believe that through these films, Visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful can not last. Decay is intrinsic in the world around us, and when we become distracted, it can destroy splendor. In Death in Venice, it is because of culture and the pursuit of beauty that everything is erased. Beauty and deliquescence are woven together as thorns in the works of Visconti, at the same time beautiful and destructive, it is these themes that define their art.
