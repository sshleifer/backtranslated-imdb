I just watched this and it was amazing. I was in serious doubt about renting the DVD or not. So if you are ... and you like watching action movies without brains ... do not hesitate any longer. Do not let the cover bland put you off. The script is one of the best of all time. Intelligent, funny, original, touching and keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout the movie. I had already watched another movie before this and was really sleepy, and I usually get bored watching a second movie on one night but this really made me wake up and had no annoying moments. It also made me rethink many things in life and it gave me a very good feeling. <br /> <br /> Also the acting is great (one of the best roles of Kevin Spacey). The visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well chosen. If I have to come up with something negative to say about it .... well .... I really can not find anything ...... Have fun! 10 out of 10
