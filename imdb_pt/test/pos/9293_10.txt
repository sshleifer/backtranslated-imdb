This show is up there with the best Comedys made in Australia as it makes fun of just about anything that is what many of our audiences want. Some of the best parts of the program are the ad road test, which tests how an ad would work in real life. What is really good about the show is how original it is and the fact that there are people (the hunters) who love to do what they do and who they do not love. This show has a lot of things that can wipe out someone like the road test of advertising I've already mentioned, ten questions where he asks 10 questions very fast in front of famous celebrities like Hugh Jackman and the beach boys, tempting like The Chasers Emmys and those who have been there since the beginning, like what we learned today from this week. Overall I rate 98% fine show.
