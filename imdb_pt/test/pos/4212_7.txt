It's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you did not expect it. The Dead End Kids / Bowery Boys have seen in a number of odd-numbered films, and have generally fared better in a supporting role, such as "Angels With Dirty Faces." Here, their presence as the backdrop to the story of a boxer framed by murder gives them a lot of screen time without distracting from the main action. John Garfield is light heavyweight champion Johnny Bradfield, a southpaw hitter who is very different from the picture he portrays for the sports world and for the press. When a newspaper reporter inadvertently discovers Johnny is a womanizer who likes parties, his plans to spread this information in a column are interrupted by a bottle of whiskey on the head of Johnny's manager, Doc Ward (Robert Gleckler). In turn, Doc talks to Johnny's girlfriend, Goldie (Ann Sheridan), to run away with him to avoid the legal hassle of dealing with the reporter's death. As the two flee, a police chase ends up in a car accident, and Doc's body is mistakenly identified as Johnny from the gold watch he was wearing. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains adopts a disdain of Edward G. Robinson who does not. I do not work as a detective who was transferred to the details of the morgue after a bad prison years ago. His character is Monty Phelan, and he has a good guess that the body of the car accident was not Johnny. He torments his boss to hand the case closed to him, and gets the task of getting him out of town and out of the way. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Johnny seeks advice from his lawyer and winds. being screwed even worse when he is fooled by most of his ten thousand dollar savings. Making his way across the country, Johnny ends up at the Rafferty Ranch Date Farm in Arizona, run by a crunchy Granny Rafferty (May Robson). The farm is the legacy of her grandmother's brother, a late Brooklyn priest, and now is the home of a bunch of street kids working on the farm. Billy Halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this, and his sister Peggy (Gloria Dickson) becomes the romantic interest of Johnny, now with the name of Jack Dorney. <br /> <br /> From the historical perspective offered in these films of the pre-war era. When Johnny and the boys take a ride of joy on the farm truck, they fill up at a gas station for $ 1.28! Tommy (Halop) has the idea that a gas station on the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money, and with that thought, Jack Dorney decides to hire a barnstorming boxer offering $ 500 per round for anyone who can stay do not touch it. The clich√©d premise is activated when Jack is eliminated in the fifth round, but by this time he has earned enough to give the fruit farm a chance to fight on his own. Maybe Grandma Rafferty should be in the ring, she almost took everyone sitting around her in the ring. When Johnny / Jack arrives in the locker room, Detective Phelan is on hand to take him into custody. Knowing that he can rescue his reputation with this collar, it's a question of whether Phelan follows his imprisonment - you'll have to watch the movie to find out. <br /> <br /> I like Dead End. Movies where Leo Gorcey is in charge, but he does not have much to do in this. However, he does a great flam film at the box office at the gate of the boxing match. Another thought-would not it have been great if the image that had always been on the priest's wall had been Pat O'Brien's? <br /> <br /> In short, this is a good entry in both the filmography of John Garfield and Dead End Kids, and a fun way to spend an hour and a half. If there is a downside, there is not enough screen time for the beautiful Ann Sheridan. The film could have been even more satisfying if the roles of Sheridan and Gloria Dickson were reversed, as the on-screen chemistry between Dickson and Peggy's Jack seemed more forceful than natural.
