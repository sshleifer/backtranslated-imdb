By the time this movie was made, most housewives knew exactly who Barbara Stanwick was. Today, only a few women over the age of 50 probably remember Gladys Taber, whose "Butternut Wisdom" column ran in the Pre Warfare Family Circle Magazine until the 1970s. She lived at Stillmeadow Farm in Connecticut, and her columns were collected in several books, Stillmeadow Seasons, Stillmeadow Daybook, etc. The lines that Barbara Stanwick recites as she types them into her column are quite typical of those that started with a typical Gladys. In addition to cooking and living in the countryside, she sometimes got a bit nostalgic and philosophical. She talked a lot about her favorite dogs, mostly cocker spaniels. You can tell that Martha Stewart is Gladys Tabor today. <br /> <br /> Christmas is Connecticut can not be any cinematic masterpiece, but it is enjoyable, joyful entertainment, soothing to the stressed mind, and this is good enough
