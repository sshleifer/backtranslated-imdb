This must be one of the most horribly titled movies of all time. The kind of title that spoils a movie because it does not conjure up the plot or the characters. A title like this makes a film failure, even the French title is not much better. Too bad - Truffaut & Deneuve must have been enough to sell it. <br /> <br /> This is a long movie, but largely worth it. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story about a personal-page bride, her wealthy husband, a robbery, a change of identity, and an obsessive love. The plot here is really quite good, and takes us on an unexpected trip. <br /> <br /> What works both for and against the film is the focus on the relationship. It's an interesting study on how these plot developments are performed in the "real-life relationship" with these two people. Unfortunately, that is what afflicts the film and makes it unsatisfying. We like movies to have a real sense of purpose, and that's missing here. <br /> <br /> It was the case in many of his films that Deneuve became a screen for Directors to throw their costumes away, and this time does not work as well. Messy here, is the fact that the director clearly just wanted Deneuve to take off her blouse a few times. Deneuve is an actress who always seems very deliberate and thoughtful, so these attempts to make her seem spontaneous fall off. <br /> <br /> Basically, the script needed to be worked out better before the start of filming, to make this film shorter and shorter. But Truffaut did not break, did he? So - it wanders a little, but still interesting.
