Let's face it, many bad movies are made all the time. For those people who work in the movies, you have probably devoted a lot of time and effort to many of these wonders. Sometimes, and this is my opinion, it is the act of simply making the movie that is important to us. To tell a story (no matter how simple and unrealistic). In addition, the collaborative process is a fundamental feature that is unique to cinema and theater. To produce a production of any caliber, it is necessary that the talents of a varying amount of people, depending on their scale, bring their story to life. The most intriguing part of the American movie, however, is not the movie being filmed. It is the filmmaker himself, as a character in his own life, who demands our attention. None of them serve as role models for the filmmakers we know and work with. But, I will argue, they are archetypes of small parts of us who try to be part of that cult independent film production activity. (Okay, a very small part of us.) These are the people who live under the rocks of their own lives and who are therefore captured by the movie novel. This brings me to my next point. The American film captures the raw spirit of independent cinema. Bad stories told in the (nowadays) digital film with sloppy effects and horrible performances - because that's the best they can do with a budget of a few thousand dollars, instead of a multi-million dollar studio budget a day. That's the difference between low and low end productions and studio productions. The independent filmmaker just wants to create a linear or even non-linear storyline to film as well as he can with the money that is investing in himself and the resources around him to see a finished product on his decaying TV. The rugged individualism materializes in all forms of art. I think this movie is a brilliant document for many filmmakers. And no, I'm not full of myself. Man, these people are hilarious. His problems seem hilarious, their characteristics are hilarious. There 's something to live for ... Jesus told me that! He said it a million times for a funny old man. The hat goes to Tom's beach. Chicago Rules.
