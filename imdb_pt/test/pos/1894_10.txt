I find this film meretricious, tentative, lethargic and cleverly a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid. But I admire the courage to throw out a screenplay, turn on the camera and act foolish. I think the performances, lighting, cinematography, sound and whatever the school film laws that D 'Urville Martin broke were funny. Speaking from a movie director perspective, there are times when I just want to drop everything and have fun on the set. This movie looks like fun. When other aspiring filmmakers ask me for advice, I just tell them to watch any Rudy Ray Moore movie. They always return a perplexed stare asking me why not watch the masters Woody Allen, Scorsese, Lucas, Capra? I laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in the storytelling storyline first.
