If you want to see the true and vile nature of communism, watch the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. (Tvamomodr√Ω Svet) tells how the courageous Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war, the Communists feared they had discovered dangerous Western ideas about freedom. So they had these heroic Czech pilots thrown into a nightmare prison where some of the guards were the same Nazis who risked their lives to defeat them. <br /> <br /> If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of his films fall flat, they should compare the portions of character drama of "Pearl Harbor" with this movie. In Dark Blue World, you actually make a connection to all the characters. In Pearl Harbor, everyone is like a caricature version of a real person. <br /> <br /> There are countless cases of brilliant writing in this film. A funny scene that is in my mind is when the character Karel is being taught English by a fairly formal Englishwoman. When he can not utter a word, he mocks the lesson. In the typical Stoic English form, the teacher confronts Karel calmly but firmly, and ashamed to behave. <br /> <br /> The sequences of aerial battles in this movie are incredible, and help keep the movie alive. I read that it cost $ 11,000 per hour to rent the planes, but it was worth every penny. <br /> <br /> Ladies, you are expected to cry with sad but personal movies ... watch out! This movie would make General Patton cry. And if you're a dog lover, you use half a box of Kleenex. Do not say I did not warn you.
