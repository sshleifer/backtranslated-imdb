Great Charlie Chaplin comedy. I've seen Chaplin's 4 major movies (Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times and The Great Dictator), and I think it's easily the funniest of the four. This movie made me laugh more than almost any other I've ever seen. From the opening notice ("Any resemblance between the Great Dictator and the owner of the barbershop is mere coincidence"), the film is a one-minute laughter with a mixture of humor, slapstick humor and verbal humor. And at the same time, Chaplin manages to portray the evils of totalitarian persecution. Maybe a bit short at the end and the duration of the subject, but easily a 9 out of 10 for me.
