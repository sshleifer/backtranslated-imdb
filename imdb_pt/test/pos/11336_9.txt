Having seen many of Wong Kar-Wai's other films (Happy Together, Fallen Angels, Ashes of Time), I knew what to expect to come to the theater; the cinematography would be exuberant, the use of space and perspective would be varied, the performance would be superb and at least one of the characters would be consumed by an ineffable solitude. These are, after all, precisely the techniques that make Wong Kar-Wai's art what it is. What I did not expect was the degree to which I was drawn to a movie that some critics dismissed as "unfinished" and compelled by characters who "seemed consumed by boredom." <br /> <br /> I find it interesting how people can be so completely indifferent to a movie that so vividly displays the emotions and environments that many of us take for granted or that we forget with effort: the overwhelming sense of regret arising from being betrayed; the guilt awakened by the thought of not becoming better than the traitor; the worldly but deeply intimate moments of relationships, in which the need to express themselves verbally is totally superfluous. This is what Wong Kar-Wai tries to portray in the film and what he achieves so well. <br /> <br /> Many Americans are consumed by the need to have every moment of a movie full of dialogues about actions; pranks, unsatisfied sarcasm and exaggerated confessions seem to be the culmination of the "best" American film he has to offer. Wong Kar-Wai sees things very differently. Instead of the character needing to keep the audience informed of all their feelings, perceptions or beliefs, Wong's characters make their feelings and understandings clearly known by facial gestures, body posture, and, yes, silence. viewers merely contemplate this film from the point of view of character development and action, so they may be disappointed by what it has to offer. If they are willing to let themselves try to intuit what the characters are feeling, then they may feel quite different about what Wong has to offer them.
