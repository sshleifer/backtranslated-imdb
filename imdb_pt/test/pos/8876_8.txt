Just thinking about the movie, I laugh at myself. Anne Ramsey plays an unforgettable part as "Momma", probably the most unpleasant, yet hilarious matriarch ever captured in the film. Danny Devito and Billy Crystal make a fabulous duo, bringing real warmth to the film. Although not extremely complex, the cute story holds your attention and keeps you laughing all the time. It's a fun comedy to brighten things up and even entertain kids. I give my full recommendation.
