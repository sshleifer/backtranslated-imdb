I saw this movie on TV as SCREAMERS and I loved it. I heard an interesting story about this movie. When Roger Corman launched for drive-ins in the summer of 1981, his trailer department sent an advance trailer that was not really filming the movie. It was supposedly filming of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory mounted by a monster. During the opening of the movie on the drive-in, angry customers complained that they had not seen the movie they paid to see. Theater owners called Corman and said their clients felt cheated. So Corman had to make copies of the footage and send the movie positive to the movie theaters to share in the movie. As filming was never part of the negative film, it did not appear on any video, DVD or television broadcast. Has anyone seen this footage? Who saw this movie on a drive-in in the summer of 1981 remembers that?
