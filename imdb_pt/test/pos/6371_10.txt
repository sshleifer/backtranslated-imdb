I loved the Complete Savages! Why did they cancel anyway? They should have done a second season and so on ... God! They always cancel the good shows ... and leave all things boring. Nothing interesting on TV since Complete Savages is gone. This show was a great idea. A single firefighter father with five crazy kids and a lazy dog ​​... Each and every one of them has his own madness in that house. TJ is always the boy ... always the smallest ... Kyle rocks! He breaks everything he touches! He is always in detention, he is always doing the wrong things ... But still, he is so funny with all the things he does. Sam's the smart one. He is always shy and stupid when it comes to girls ... Finally he ends up dating Angela. Chris is the sport guy who does not have much to do with school, study and things like that. He's always funny And finally ... Jack! The rock of the show. The oldest of all, the male, "the rock star" ... But still, as crazy as everyone. Nick is ... helpless with these guys. Oh! And I almost forgot! Uncle Jimmy ... He's the guy! He's like a 30-year-old boy. He's like doing the same stupid things the boys are doing. I always wondered how he turned out to be a firefighter ... And the dog is the image of the whole Savage family. The thing is ... this show had everything to become something really great. He had everything, man! But of course ... they canceled ...
