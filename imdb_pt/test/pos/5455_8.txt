*** SPOILERS *** This movie portrays the brutal bloodbath caused by Johnny Carson's retirement to determine who would succeed him. The imitations of David Letterman and Jay Leno are interpreted satisfactorily by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, although the performances were not optimal. Reni Santoni is the best performance of the "executives" (he plays NBC's John Agoglia), and Warren Littlefield (played by Bob Baliban) is the second closest. I was shocked by how Littlefield enthusiastically discussed the eviction of Johnny Carson. This was Johnny Carson! This scene highlights the world of television that is what you have been doing for me lately. Kathy Bates presented the best performance of the film as Jay's agent, Helen Kushnick. Another commentator said that Leno was portrayed as a simpleton in the film. I respectfully disagree. His relationship with Kushnick bordered on something similar to domestic violence. She orders him and, when he rebels against her in the end, she tries to play the sympathy card (mentioning her dead husband and son); however, when Jay terminates their relationship, she becomes violent again, shouting "Do not leave me, you two-faced bastard!" before breaking a photo on the floor. Overall, the movie is hilarious and I wish it was shown more often.
