I saw this movie as a kid and I loved it. I loved how brave and full of energy Nikki is, and how she mostly ruins Louden's perfect yuppie life and corrupts and transforms her into her crazy ways. As a child in the 1980s, I saw New York exactly as portrayed in this film, the dominance of Madonna's character, with wild animals running around and heinous bald men chasing people around and wreaking havoc. Now, as an adult, I think I love the film for the same reasons, and even more so for the love story woven into Miss Crazy 's antics. Nikki Finn. Although I would still love to go anywhere and find an interior atrium like in this movie. Pure beauty and genius.
