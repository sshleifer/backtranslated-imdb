I just saw this movie in Austin Texas at the Gay and Lesbian Festival in Austin and it was my favorite festival. The gymnast is a movie not to be missed. It's an honest story of "coming to terms" about relationships, self-discovery, getting old and having the courage to change and move on. This is not just a good story, but the glorious aerial performances of Dreya Weber and Addie Yungmee will take your breath away! Watch this movie! Will be coming soon to a festival near you. This movie deserved to be picked up immediately by a large network or studio. I will certainly buy this when it is available on DVD.
