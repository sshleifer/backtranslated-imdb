Then the unruly pair begins their adventure together. <br /> <br /> REVIEW Okay, so it's another Journey To The West movie, which is not a bad thing for me since I love the story and the characters associated with it. , so I was a little excited to get my hands on the DVD. So I guess I'll start my comment with the story, which is all over the place, in the beginning was his standard fantasy film, then it became a ridiculous comedy, it suddenly became full-fledged science fiction, if director Jeff Lau was experimenting mix genres, so he did a pretty eschatological job with this movie. I think it's a pretty unique approach to having the story centered on a character other than the infamous Monkey King, especially catching a character as pacifist as Tripitaka and then putting him in a love story. So overall, I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The acting is mostly solid, with Nicholas Tse and Charlene Choi doing very good performances, although Char Ah spend most of the time on the screen behind some. pretty ugly makeup. The supporting cast is very well set up, includes all the usual EEG major stays for Boy'Z and Isabella Leong making appearances, an actor I would like to mention is Wilson Chen, who plays Monkey King, he did a good job with limited material he seemed to have been given, he played a version of the Monkey King who was subjugated yet arrogant, I had the feeling that he would be retreading the territory of Twins Effect II, but fortunately is not the case here. I hope he can follow that up with himself in the central role as the film is left open for a sequel. <br /> <br /> Okay, so let's get right to the subject, which is again kind of everywhere, Lau gives a lot of time to Stephen Chow-esquire's nonsense comedy which includes a scene in which Tripitaka to stiffen, is dressed in Spider-Man, which I presume to take to many the head scratching the moment since the film must be set in Old China. He creates some really nice moments and suits between the two protagonists and plunges into a boring territory, but this reviewer does not like sap from time to time, so it does not bother me at all. <br /> <br /> Now for the CGI, which is mostly quite bearable, there are many times that probably belong to a PS2, as many other critics have claimed, but there are some cool moments particularly the scene in which Monkey struggles against a flying footman. Many of the CG gags are provided in the form of the gold team that turns into a variety of different things, ranging from a giant fly-swatter to a mechanical suit straight from The Matrix Revolutions. So yeah, it sounds crazy, but I think you'd have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Right, so in closing A Chinese Story is not a film without its flaws, but it holds together long enough to be able to entertain and generally be a nice movie in general. If all of the above do not give the impression that I put it this way, it's way better than Twins Effect II.
