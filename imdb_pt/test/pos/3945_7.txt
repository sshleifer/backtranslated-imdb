Another round with the monkey king going west ... kind of. <br /> <br /> Starting in the middle of some action, the film goes from the first frame forward. <br /> <br /> Monk and his three disciples go to a city to obtain the sagas suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world. But an evil force intervened and kidnapped all the children of the city. The force of evil wants the monk because if you eat it, you will live forever. The retainers fight against the forces of darkness before sending the monk by force for security (the monk thinks he can win by simply reasoning with the villains). The monk ends up with a bunch of lizards imbeciles who plan to sometime eat it ... however the thugs arrive and he is out of an odyssey with the ugliest of the lot. <br /> <br /> Can a movie that starts off the rails get off the rails? Do not get me wrong, I really enjoyed this movie, but it's so scattered and everywhere that plot and logic just disappear, because some scenes just start in the middle of the action without knowing how we got there (The final battle to rescue the disciples is completely off the left field). This is one of the most messy movies I've seen for some time, but it made me laugh and smile like I did not leave. The movie starts and you have no idea where things are, so what's on the screen is interesting or funny and you just go with it. How we can go from thing to thing is often beyond me. It is full of strange asides and strange references as we go from heaven to the ocean to the space to the rib cage of some mythical beast to God knows where. This movie floats all over the place, which helps keep it fun, since you do not know where it's going to end up (and that's the reason to keep the details to a minimum) and it's funny. Sometimes very funny. <br /> <br /> And the action is very good, even though a good part of it is a CGI animation though (which provides some cool pictures, the gold team, the formation of spider attack, the angel in flight. ..) And it is very Action and comedy aside this is really a wonderful story of love, it is the story of an ugly and a monk who ends up falling in love (and having other complications), is an interesting look at the nature of love and what is true You will be moved. As much as I liked it, I was still bored with its scattered build, the inability of the movies to keep their ideas together and tell a complete story really hurts the movie and takes away from the pleasure every time we get to a roadblock, the bumps take you out of the movie itself and make you realize how much is being extracted from other sources. <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth seeing, since you have many moments of choice, just be prepared for some bumps and you will have a good time.
