Keys to VIP is one of the most fun, informative and hilarious shows that are on television right now. The idea is original and well executed, because it manages to preserve the aspect of reality, but it continues to be fun. All judges have razor intelligence. They are not the prettiest at all times, but if you're looking for comfort, go watch a girl movie. Say what you want about the validity of the program, but this is absolutely real. I know people who competed on the show, and they confirmed that. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh, watch this show. It's one of the best comedy series ever made.
