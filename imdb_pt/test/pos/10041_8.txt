Errol Flynn at his best as Robin Hood of the West, battling the military bureaucracy, Confederates, Indians and business rug bandits individual for his great and final heroic finale. Do not forget the ever-reliable O. de Havilland as Lady Mary of the West. Never try to link this story to facts and real people, it does not work. Just enjoy it, because no one ever claimed to make documentaries when Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn collaborated.
