This is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again and I can not get enough of it. It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations of all time. I liked this even more than X-men. In fact, this movie is a kind of cross between X-men and the matrix and left before any of them. Wesley Snipes does a great job with the Blade character. He's not just an unemotional superhero. Also, this movie is not suggested to get a pg-13 rating. Of course, comics are for kids, but I like my movies more. Let's face it, if we were in such situations, we would scold a storm, so it's more realistic. This comic adaptation also has something that many do not. A good fight at the end between the bad guy and the good guy. Let's face it, none of the Batman movies had a good final fight.
