Mary Pickford plays Annie Rooney - the daughter of a policeman who lives in the difficult part of town. She is a young woman of undetermined age (something between 12 and 16 years old) who likes to get undone, but deep down she has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> This is a very typical movie style for Mary Pickford. . Like many of her films, she plays a girl - though she was almost 40 when she did LITTLE ANNIE ROONEY. And, like so many other stories, she was both brave and courageous at the same time. As a result, I had a strong déjà vu feeling. Now, if you have not seen your other movies, this is not a problem. However, she is essentially playing a character very much like SPARROWS or DADDY LONG LEGS - although these two other films are much better. Now that's not to say that this is a bad movie - it's certainly not among her best work - mostly due to a rather "weird" story that is very heavy on feeling but not particularly compelling. Fun but not essential visualization unless you are a big fan of the silences.
