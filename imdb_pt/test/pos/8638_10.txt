With an opening segment that imitates Todd Haynes' song and cinematography of Safe (1995), David Lynch uses notions of dreams, myths and deformations of reality to tell the fractured story of a Hollywood actress / waitress, Diane Selwyn, disappointed by fame and their own demons and obsessed by Camilla Rhodes, who is engaged to the director Adam Kesher. <br /> <br /> The film actually takes place in Diane's mind; we are witnesses of their crazy distortions, their desires, regrets, obsessions and fears. Using the dream narrative as a way of presenting two notions of conflicting reality, Lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy, but actively involves them. The last 45 minutes are as dreamy as what came before; and the problematic air of outstanding and supernatural ambiguity still permeates, fracturing the seemingly sure distinction between reality and dream that we expect to see in films about nightmares and dreams. <br /> <br /> Lynch's film uses many films, old and new. but ultimately it's a movie unlike any other, except for the Lost Highway itself and the director's Blue Velvet. It constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what is seen, not just intuitively, but intellectually. However, it is not as pretentious as you might imagine, because Lynch makes us sympathize with the protagonist, despite his murderous actions - an element that was lacking in all his other films except the Straight. He does this by presenting Diane's dream alter-ego, Betty, as a healthy Canadian farm girl destined for fame. Lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and denies in equal measure. Is Camilla and Diane really lovers or just friends? Who is the blue lady? What does it mean? Who is the tramp behind Winkies? What is the meaning of the decaying corpse in Sierra Bonita? Is Aunt Ruth really there? Is Silence an abstraction from hell or perhaps a self-reference about the status of the movie as fiction? Lynch is not prepared to answer any questions he may ask, choosing to present his "love story in the city of dreams" as a set of interconnected abstractions and motifs. <br /> <br /> The acting is of high quality, especially Naomi Watts as Diane Selwyn / Betty, who is yet to eclipse this performance. Laura Harring has the fascination Hayworthesque demanded as Camilla / Rita, while Adam Theroux as Adam brings an arrogance of free-wheeling and paranoid aggression sublimated to her role. It was an injustice and a grave injustice that none of them were even nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> This is a film that demands to be seen and analyzed closely. The mystery at the heart of the film remains in Lynch's hands, but half the fun is finding consistent ideas from the maze of apparent incongruities he presents. Upon closer inspection, there is a definite sense of puzzle, perhaps an incomplete puzzle that provokes us with closure, but denies the imaginary fullness of narrative coherence. Ultimately, this is Lynch's main movie.
