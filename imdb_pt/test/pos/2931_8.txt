The next top model in America is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately I got bored with it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 1: Yes, I'm glad that Adrienne won, I wanted her to win from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Cycle 2: It's too bad, I think Mercedes deserved it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 3: I did not like Eva, but I did not like most girls in this cycle. <br /> <br /> cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. I do not know what they saw in Naima, but I definitely know what they saw in Kahlen. <br /> <br /> cycle 5: as in cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either. but out of all the girls, NICOLE as a winner? eww! <br /> <br /> Cycle 6: I liked Sara and Joanie, but Danielle is fine too. <br /> <br /> Cycle 7: Caridee definitely deserved this. <br /> <br /> Cycle 8: No, I did not want Jaslene to win. I did not like her. I've seen other girls in this cycle with definitely more potential than her, though I have not seen much of that cycle. <br /> <br /> Good show, I just saw it many times to like it much more: D
