Is this a good movie? No, certainly not. But for Jolie lovers it is indispensable. His unpolished scene of acting and semi-nudity will please his fans for a long time. The current rating however (3.2) is very low. The movie may not have a good plot, and it's not a great SF movie, but the acting is good enough (and as mentioned before, Jolie's acting is good and raw), the film is filmed straight, very close - ups. The scenery is bizarre. And last but not least, leaving van Damme outside was a very good choice. Presumably, none of Jolie's lovers would want to see her having sex with him. This movie has all the potential to become a cult movie.
