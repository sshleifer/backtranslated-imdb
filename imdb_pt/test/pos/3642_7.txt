The quality of the animation here is decidedly below the IMO pair, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters do not. <br /> <br /> This may sound demanding, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by live machines, would YOU feel comfortable as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, lack of vision and greed so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers to this in the film, but only when the crew can be bothered to put them, "bioroids" (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters. You look sloppy to me. <br /> <br /> The main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement, although no light is shed on it. Little light is shed on the background story, a great shame. The short duration of the film, coupled with focus on the wick and the crime, means that we do not see depth of character. The base is all down, but we're running out of finished product. A trimmed version of this OAV would have made a great episode of TV, since some subplots of personages had been established. <br /> <br /> The highlights of this short film are wick designs and action / espionage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The glitches really begin to appear after you've had a chance to digest all the happenings so I could not recommend this for possessing it but it's certainly worth a watch or two ! While this review is mostly negative, I really think it's worth your while to watch this, but it's not something to rush out and buy. <br /> <br /> In short: a wasted opportunity.
