David Attenborough brings his fascination for wildlife, this time the creatures under the sea, on this extraordinary 8-episode trip for all animals on the seabed! <br /> <br /> The cinematography is impressive, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking images of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they got it! Whether making models of creatures, or those stunning photos of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it! <br /> <br /> 2001 had great TV shows on our screen. But in contrast to this gem of documentaries, they make them very bad! But to be proud of this series of documentaries, the best TV series of 2001 does not epitomize the brilliance the series offers in quality entertainment. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is the best TV series of 2001, with no competition and perhaps the best TV series of the 2000s!
