Random Hearts have infiltrated me. Criticized for the implausibility of a) the premise and b) the pairing of an AI cop and a congresswoman, as well as for its slowness, the film seemed to me very well, and even ended up being surprisingly absorbing. I found my interest involved as the film passed between the lives of Ford and Thomas as they discovered, and dealt in very different ways in very different environments with the deaths of their spouses and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people. It could happen; the flirtatious spouses of two people could be on the same plane, the plane could fall, the survivors could be reunited for the consequences. So what if it's unlikely? Unlikely it is not the same as exaggerated. So ... what if this happened? Why not speculate? <br /> <br /> The performances of Ford and Thomas are believable and nuanced. Instead of finding the coupling implausible (opposite sides of the rails - give me some time), I felt it moved by grief and betrayal that neither party could handle. The script does not link them too soon or too easily, and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship conventionally either. Where I find this unsatisfactory is when the dialogue brings interesting insights or insights into the ramifications of the situation, both personal and professional, but it seems that it never pursues any of them very far. And if you make the mistake of thinking too much about it, Harrison Ford seems to be 10 years older for the role. <br /> <br /> For five and a half dollars at Wal-Mart, with full comments from the director. and behind the scenes, the DVD is well worth it. I do not think I would pay $ 20 for it on a bet, but my wife can. Okay, ten ...
