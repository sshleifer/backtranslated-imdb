A heap of human flesh lies asleep on a red pillow. This is the bare piece of meat that is "Little Joe," a New York dealer who lives with his bisexual wife and baby. The film follows a day in his life, after he woke up from sleep with his wife demanding that he leave and do the traditional male thing - be a breadwinner. But the use she wants to put the bread is to pay for the abortion of her new girlfriend. We certainly are not in the traditional family unit here ... <br /> <br /> After playing with his son, Joe comes to the streets to walk by johns. Clients are rude and quick: the average gay man who wants to meet him again because he "works well together," the old English scholar who pays $ 100 to see Joe pose as a former Greek athlete; the female topless dancer who blows Joe then boasts of being raped; the old school rabbit who does not think what he and Joe do together is weird. After a hard day's work, Joe comes home exhausted, only to be slaughtered by his wife and girlfriend. He goes back to sleep while they harp and mine. <br /> <br /> The meat is fascinating, since it takes what is a conventional classic traditional structure - it has an inciting incident (money for abortion) and a set-up. , a confrontation and a resolution (albeit a very pessimistic one), even a protagonist with a strongly motivated goal, and then concentrates on the day-to-day details of these people who are perfectly common to themselves but extraordinary to most. people. Everything looks very authentic and natural - it's hard to see the acting, the actors are so full their roles - but still the whole thing is a cunning device - a beautifully drawn portrait or a sculptured statue. Director Morrissey carefully plants every incident, every encounter around his subject of human flesh turns into packaged commodity, but with such delicacy of hand you hardly even realize he is doing it. The woman "bundles" Joe's sexual organ, the old Englishmen lament an order of classic beauty that created art and poetry of human carnal beauty, transvestite stripper friends as women while reading a Hollywood magazine in which "real" women are packaged as products; the academy bunny buys Joe's friendship and affection, thinks that artificial pornography is real and can not say, as we can not, that Joe is making his friendship and intimacy for money. The film itself presents itself as the ne plus ultra of cinematic realism, but what we might also be dealing with here is art or one of the earliest examples of conceptual art. The genius - a word that is not lightly used - of Morrissey was to find a way to bring Warhol's artistic pretensions to the production of films, which were interesting but boring as hell, and "Heat" with a product label - "Andy Warhol" - which sells an idea about the "fleshed" products that are among the most intriguing cinematographic art works ever made - commercial cans labeled "Flesh" and "Trash" the product as well as the product itself. However, just as you see Morrissey's cynicism, you are delighted with your ability to maintain the highest standards and depth of meaning. The constant that looks like camera flashes continually draw attention to the filmic nature of what you are watching but you are drawn to the illusion in the same way - Flesh is certainly one of the most extraordinary pieces of magic in the cinema that charmed the audience.
