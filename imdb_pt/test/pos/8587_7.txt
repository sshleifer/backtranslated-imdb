In the film, Lumumba, we see the faces behind the monumental change in Congo's history after he is taken back from the Belgians, and we see the motives behind those men in whose hands the country raped and hungry fell. <br /> <br /> Lumumba is not a movie for the hyper masses; requires the attention of its viewers with a raw and true performance and a complex and intricate dialogue. Little of the main plot is shown through action, it relies almost exclusively on words, but there is a recurrent strand that is just action, and it is the coup d'etat that makes the film an enlightening and powerful panorama of the tension of the political struggle that independence of the Congo gave rise to. <br /> <br /> This movie is real. It is a crude representation of those in power and those in the streets. It is to open your eyes to its content. And it is moving in the passions and emotions of its superbly portrayed characters. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of history, cinephile or simply good stories, Lumumba is a must see.
