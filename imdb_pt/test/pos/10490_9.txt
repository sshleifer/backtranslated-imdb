This is an exciting story that lends elements of Kennedy's murder, and uses them successfully to create an excellent Western tale. <br /> <br /> The film has a good soundtrack, although it is based on repeating the theme of the title a bit. too much. Giuliano Gemma and the rest of the cast are excellent. This is a more cerebral spaghetti western than usual, which depends more on history than on action, and is successful because the story is excellent. This is not to say that there is no action in the film. There is much, and it is very well crafted. This movie pulls you right away, and keeps you absorbed to the end. You will always be imagining what is in those documents that everyone is after. He also has some scathing remarks about American politics. <br /> <br /> This movie shows why Valerii, in my opinion, is in a three way draw with Sollima and Corbucci for second place in the ranking of directors of spaghetti western.
