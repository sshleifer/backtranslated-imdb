This movie has something that most other movies of its genre do not have: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, it is the story of a boy named Bartleby (Justin Long), who is rejected by all the faculties that he is applying for. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. Then, Bartleby and a few other students facing similar problems start a fake college, to devote themselves to parents as children of college students. Not everything is planned, and the movie is about them flying. But behind this plot that seems ridiculous, there are good messages, moral and a new perspective on the American educational system. The college they create "South Harmon Institute of Technology" accepts those who have not been accepted anywhere else. The message is that you do not need "money, tradition or fantasy books - you just need a desire to improve yourself." they are a completely unorthodox school, but what the film teaches is that this is still OK - and different (whether it's a person or a school) is not necessarily bad, and that anyone should have the chance to improve - they are "strangers." is a message of nonconformity and has traits of anti-authority scattered too. But it's not just big messages, it's hilarious! Haha, I laughed a lot. the humor may be subtle, but it can also be glaring, and it's a great mix. Fraternities, be careful.
