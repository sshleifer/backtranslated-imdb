"Balance of Terror" is still one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made. It was inspired by the film "Enemy Below" (starring Robert Mitchum), a film that deals with a game of cat and mouse between two captains during World War II. In this episode, Captain Kirk and his crew play a similar game with a Romulan ship. This is the program that introduces the famous Romulans hungry for war, distant relatives of the Vulcans. It's an incredibly suspenseful episode, rigidly built for maximum effect. It's also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story. Mark Lenard makes his Star Trek debut as Captain Romulan (he will later play Spock's father, Ambassador Sarek). An unforgettable episode!
