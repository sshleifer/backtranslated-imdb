If people were really that stupid, I could be the SRW - Supreme Ruler of the World. In this, Knotts touches a battered bean counter to a small, rough-hewn seaside town, run by a bunch of twisted simpletons, just a little brighter than him. When things seem a bit unstable for the crooks, they go to a patsy picture Figg. A lot of laughter as Knotts does his usual stumbling and stumbling. I particularly enjoyed the extension cord scene; asininity at its highest level.
