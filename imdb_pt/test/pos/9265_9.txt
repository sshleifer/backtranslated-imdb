I became a fan of the 'Homicide: Life on the Street' TV series at the end of the show, but I became a fan very quickly. It was a police spectacle unlike any other: visually different in its use of handheld cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multiethnic and multi-racial cast and their varied and fascinating personalities, and covering everything from good and bad to one police department, including clashes of corruption and personality that bubble up to the surface. Homicide: The Movie, the reunion of the series, is as good as a movie made for television can be. After Lieutenant Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the cast members of the series are back to help find the killer. In addition, cast members who have left the force and those who died, also get their place in the film. The intensity and the fire that marked the series return, and the script shivers with the same fire that marked the series. All in all, a great TV movie. <br /> <br /> Vote: 9
