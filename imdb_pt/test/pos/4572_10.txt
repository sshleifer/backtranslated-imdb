I've seen this movie since I was a little girl, and being from New York and remembering how people lived back then, brought back many good memories. This movie is not just about wanting a fairy tale ending, but understanding the struggles of becoming a better person, woman and provider Claudine has attempted to be. It was about the welfare system putting women in a bonding situation. It was about the injustice of a system that invaded and put demands on a family to stay afloat. Diane Carroll was nominated for an Oscar for this role and was well-deserved. If you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but wonderful moments, enjoy Claudine. Your goal as a spectator is to keep an open mind and understand the general frustration.
