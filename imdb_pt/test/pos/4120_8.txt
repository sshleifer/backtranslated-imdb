Almost all commentators mentioned how some of the interview footage is superimposed on the scenes of the show in some places. This is true and is the biggest flaw of this movie. However, it is not so frequent or so bad that someone does not see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. In addition to having seen Black Sabbath in the seventies and early eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006, when they also headlined OZZfest as in this video. The show was amazing, and very much like that, which is why I rented this in the first place. It's just about the best geezer-rock out there. Check out.
