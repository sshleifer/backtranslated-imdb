"Campfire Tales" is basically composed of three scary stories that a group of friends tells about after getting into a car accident in the woods after a show. The movie begins with the classic story of "Hook" and then we are introduced to the group of friends coming home from the show. They hit the car, blow out flames, and light a fire in a small abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to come with help as they warm up by the fire. To pass the time, they decide to start telling classic horror stories about terrified honeymoon, a girl who is the victim of an Internet predator and a driver who takes refuge in a haunted house. While telling the dark tales, each story becomes increasingly terrifying, but the real shock that awaits them is yet to come ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the last story they tell is probably the more frightening and some genuine and scary effects. The first story was good, and the motorhome sequence near the end was a bit scary. The second story has built a lot of suspense, more than any of the others, but the non-original plot is the fall. I remember watching this movie a long time ago when I was eight years old on HBO and the third story scared me, although it's not scary for me now. You'll probably recognize part of the cast here, particularly Amy Smart's hook-opening interlude story, and Christine Taylor as one of the film's leading actresses. The end of the twist was very interesting too, I know I did not see this coming, I thought everything was well done. <br /> <br /> To sum things up, if you're looking for a worthy horror movie, rent it, you should be happy. It's a great anthology of some classic urban legends, and the whole movie was well organized. It is much better than what one would expect. 7/10
