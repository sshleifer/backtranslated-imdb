This distorted comedy is well represented and directed. Very funny and the production quality is excellent. It is easy to understand why this short film was accepted in so many festivals and won prizes. <br /> <br /> Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, a bad week, a bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this movie the right twist. The old man enhances the mood of the story. And who would not love the suicidal goldfish! <br /> <br /> This short one will bring a lot of laughter. And do not miss the credits as they are playing in the end!
