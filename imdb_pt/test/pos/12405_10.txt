This movie was so well paced that I did not think I actually blinked while watching. One intense situation after another kept me glued to the set. However, I wish I had seen Corey Feldman a lot more in this photo. He just steals every scene he's in. This could be my favorite performance of Corey. The ending was clever and unlike other movies that move away from parts of the body from friendly supporting characters, this movie goes for it! I liked that it was not blood and gore graphics, but left more to the viewer's imagination. Angry. I literally had to wipe the sweat from the forehead during this torture scene with a paper cutter. Ultimately, the film works because of its nice main character and the impressive presence of my all time favorite villain, James Remar (48 hours, remember?) I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to sweat the shirt. <br /> <br />
