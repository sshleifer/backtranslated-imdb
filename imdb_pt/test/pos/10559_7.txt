I watched the series after Tipping the Velvet, for which I gave 10/10 note. I had read user reviews about it and expected an equally good series, or, if possible, even better. At this point, I must emphasize that this series is good, and it definitely captured me everywhere and therefore worth watching. However, I did not like it as much as Tipping the Velvet for the following reasons: 1. Less passion, love and related sexual content. There was surprisingly little emphasis on these elements, which I considered to be an integral part of a love story. Fingersmith looked like a watery version of Tipping the Velvet. <br /> <br /> 2. Similarly, as in Tipping the Velvet, the story had three parts: the beginning, a second shocking part and the ending. The second part should have been the climax of the story (as in Tipping the Velvet), but instead was almost totally ignored, perhaps due to the inability to create shocking but compelling asylum content. The series should have been in three parts, featuring two cliffhangers, with much more focus on the second part. <br /> <br /> 3. Almost no weight was given to what Fingersmiths were and how it affected their personalities. I found it quite annoying that the series did not adequately address this central topic. <br /> <br /> 4. The ending was much more hasty than in Tipping the Velvet. Fingersmith left several interesting plots open. <br /> <br /> Despite these flaws, Fingersmith is a good series, and worth 7/10. However, it's not a classic like Tipping the Velvet.
