First of all, those who are weak at heart should definitely avoid this movie. Even those who, like me, are insensitive to most graphically violent and sexual acts in movies should beware. I'm not telling you to get away from the movie, but be aware that what you are about to see is disturbing material. It's definitely not a nice movie to watch, but nothing is put on the screen strictly for shock value. But I must admit, when I watched the movie for the second time, I had to jump to the next chapter when the "razor blade scene" came up. <br /> <br /> The main character is one of the most unfriendly friendly characters I can imagine, but we begin to better understand the humanity of his character later in the second act of the movie. In one scene, she stuffs a broken glass into the pocket of her student jacket after being dissatisfied with her seemingly unsatisfactory performance and getting nervous when in front of a live audience. The student goes to her pocket and screams in pain as she looks at the blood-stained hand. Beside the scene of the razor blade, it bothered me more. The student's mother is not much nicer than her. When she learns that her daughter will not be able to play, she talks about it as if she had also hurt her hand, being one of those spoiled mothers who try to torture her daughter to become a super enterprising. <br /> <br /> Although the film intrigued me and piqued my interest most of the time, I felt more need to be explained about the character of Isabelle Huppert. When a woman is fascinated by sadomasochistic porn movies and engages in this behavior, you want to understand the root of the problem. The film states that she desperately wants to be loved. So why the hateful attitude towards all? Why does she receive sexual pleasure from pain? <br /> <br /> The acting is great and I liked the sleek and bright lighting. Overall, it's not a movie I would recommend if you're in the mood to have fun, but like I said, it's very intriguing. And I'm sure that if I watched more than once, I could detect certain subtleties that would shed more light on aspects of the film that I did not initially understand. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (of 10)
