Based on the actual event, this epic is set in 221 BC and tells the true story of China's unification. Action packed and full of intrigue, passion, betrayals and sequences of unforgettable battles, kept my attention all the time, despite its duration of 160 minutes. <br /> <br /> King, Ying Zeng, played by Li Xuejian is obsessed with unification. the seven kingdoms of China and becoming its first emperor. His mistress, Lady Zhao, played by the beautiful actress Gong Li, plans a plot through which to travel to the neighboring kingdom of Yan to put into action a plot of murder that will give the king an excuse to invade Yan. However, she falls in love with the killer when the king becomes more and more ruthless. <br /> <br /> There are subplots, tragedies and constant high dramas. There are scenes of great beauty and abject cruelty. There is great cinematography and a brilliant use of physical space. <br /> <br /> Deep characterization made me think of Shakespeare. And tragic events that draw attention to the Greek drama. And yet, it is totally Chinese, because it deals with old questions about whether the ends justify the means. And it raises the questions that deal with life and death and good and evil and all edges blurred between them. <br /> <br /> It is the story of individuals against the background of history, a story that has shaped China into the past. two thousand years. I was swept away by history and moral issues. There are no easy answers and this was one of the strengths of the film. <br /> <br /> Recommended. But be prepared for violence and blood. <br /> <br />
