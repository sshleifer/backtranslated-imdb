The plot of "In the climate for love" is quite simple: a married man and a married woman (though not one for the other) slowly develop a romantic attachment to one another. The rhythm of the film is slow and not very precious, in fact, it happens between the two. However, the background of Hong Kong in the early 1960s and director Wong Kar-Wai's keen sense of capturing the beauty of the setting, as well as the main characters, make this film a joy to watch. Actors Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are excellent and Wong Kar-Wai did an extraordinary job of capturing the sensation and nostalgia of the past (something many filmmakers and directors try to do but often fail miserably). There are so many little details that add charm to the film (a trademark of the director) and the colors and cinematography are what send this otherwise simple story to the top as a wonderful cinematic achievement. 9/10
