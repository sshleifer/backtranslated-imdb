This movie is about so many things. The most obvious is the dominance the film can have over the audience and how capturing life in the film can be a kind of magic. There is also the tense relationship between China and the West, as many Chinese have seen (probably rightly) that the "barbarians" try to dominate and pollute their way of life. Liu even seeks to preserve his way of life in the movies because he sees that one day he will disappear. His is also Liu's internal conflict between China's loyalties and traditions versus the Western philosophy of self-determination. All these themes are skilfully woven into a coherent and pleasing whole by Hu. A very nice film.
