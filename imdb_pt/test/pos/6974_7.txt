Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this incredibly personal story of a married woman's flight from her husband - and the reality that perhaps the youthful joy and excitement of her younger years are behind her. We learn little about this woman's marriage except that she has felt her independence fading lately; she has also recently learned that she is pregnant, which has further complicated her heart (she does not want to be a complacent wife, despite the maternal way of talking to her husband on the phone). She meets two men on her journey: a former college football hero who - after an accident during a game - had permanent brain damage and a sexy, attractive cop who has many problems in her life. . The clear and clean landscapes (photographed by the very talented Wilmer Butler) are astutely accomplished, as are the characters. Shirley Knight, James Caan and Robert Duvall perform strongly and emotionally, mainly because they are not very nice people in conventional terms. Some scenes (such as Knight's first call from a payphone, or his first night alone with Caan, where they play "Simon Says") are almost as close to watching. Coppola plays with reality, turning the irregular memories of his characters into scrapbooks that have been revealed to us. It allows the scenes to unfold, but the editing is very agile and the film is never allowed to be too heavy (there are at least two or three very funny moments). It's an intoxicating effort - so much so that the image was still being shown at festivals almost five years later. Some may avoid twisting Coppola's events in order to underline the end with bitter irony; however, the strength and momentum behind the picture almost nullify its deficiencies. *** in ****
