Thank God for this movie. It is a talent document that, three decades later, seems even more unique and rare in retrospect. <br /> <br /> The music is simply extraordinary, full of so much talent in writing, performance, arrangement and production that it is absolutely infectious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are amazing. The performances of underrated talents like Nell Carter and Ren Woods lift my spirits every time I hear them. Although the film may be different from the stage version, I prefer the soundtrack to the cast album, which I find truly grating and underdeveloped. Here arrays are populated and expanded into dynamic parts that could not have been produced in a scenario. <br /> <br /> But music is not the only extraordinary thing about this movie. The juxtaposition of scenes of almost hyperrealistic dialogues (it reminds me of Altman's films) interspersed with exuberant musical and dance numbers, really works. All the talent in this film - direction, writing, photography, editing, music, choreography, casting, acting, costumes, art direction - fits perfectly into one of the best music films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing how much we know about the characters in "Hair," based on very little information or plot. They are not designed as caricatures, but as realistic and very human people. We see little glimpses of where they come from, but the portrait is completed by vignettes that draw the characters to the surface through full acting, direction and editing. There is an underlying theme of the misogyny of Berger and Hud, who color their characters by exposing their reckless machista-hippie ideology. Berger's home life scene reveals important details about his psychology, and the brief glimpse of Claude's house tells us about his past through the simple, realistic and genuine interaction between Claude and (presumably) his father. <br /> <br /> I love fashion in this movie. It is defiantly blending ideas from the sixties with very 70 years it seems (one has to ignore hair extensions from treating Williams ...). It is a document of how most of the seventies was fancy, contradicting conventional wisdom that the time was in bad taste. Claude's beige knit tie was a hot trend from 1979, and the hair and clothing of singers and dancers (particularly those in white during the Central Park scene) blend the decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of the themes of the musical. These elements merge with Twyla Tharpe's extraordinary cutting-edge choreography in a way that enhances the art of both. <br /> <br /> "Hair" is not a movie that rewards cynicism. If you come to this with expectations, you will probably be captive to artists who are not subject to your rules. For me, it opened my eyes, ears and spirit to a perspicacious and passionate musical dialogue about war, friendship and family that transcends its time and is still significant and relevant to me to this day.
