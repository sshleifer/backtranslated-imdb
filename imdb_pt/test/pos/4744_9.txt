The Seven Ups has been compared to Bullitt for the chase scene, but it does not even come close to Bullitt. Bullitt has a beginning building builds. When McQueen leaves the hotel decadent, he enters his Mustang, which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway (now destroyed) and notices the Charger sitting nearby, you know you are about to see something spectacular. From that moment on, when McQueen starts the car, begins the best chase sequence of cars ever filmed. Adding to that is a great Lalo Schriffin if I remember sound track. This continues for a long time before you actually hear the first tires singing. This photo of McQueen Mustang, suddenly appearing in the rearview mirror of Bill Hickman is unmatched for visual impact. Hickman's surprise and double look really enhances the effect. So, of course, San Francisco is unparalleled for the scenario of cars going up and down hills and curves. In addition, Bullitt being filmed in the 1960s, when the cars were still "hot" (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger), produced a better set of wheels than two boring and smoky Pontiacs in the Seventies, Seven Ups. Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad guys' car in both films. I saw him sitting in a preview of an insider movie once in Univeral's lot when I was doing movie reviews for an article. They gave a good try on Seven Ups, albeit with the chase scene. Seven climbs had some "jumps" over small hills, (Yawn) but of course they were not the hills of San Francisco. The pursuit of Seven Ups, where they are really going fast, is longer than the fastest sequence in Bullitt. But the scene of a single shotgun totally blasting the hood of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the pinnacle of the absurd. Strictly Hollywood, I would say, except it was filmed in New York.
