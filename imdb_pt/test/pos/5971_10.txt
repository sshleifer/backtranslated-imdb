If you have a chance, see this Russian (what should I call them: precious stones, masterpieces, hidden treasures?), War movies like this, or The dawns here are silent, or Proverka in dorogah ... And, soon after that, to watch again the American war movies, or the international productions, those with the allies and the Germans, etc. Or, even worse, watching the Italian war movies. Everything from the west will seem superficial, artificial, ridiculous, compared to Russian films. I am so shocked by the quality of the Russian war films mentioned above that I can not find words to praise their superiority over the Anglo-Saxon war films.
