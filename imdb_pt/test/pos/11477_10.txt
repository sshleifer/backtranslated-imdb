This is probably one of the best Portuguese films I've ever seen ... I really enjoyed the plot, because by the way the story was unfolding, you would get more involved in how their world was really upside down ... There are only just one part that does not really seem to fit the movie, which is the girls' strip ... It does not add anything important to the story, it looks like it's there just for a fun purpose for men. The ending is a bit unexpected, although at the same time, it is a bit expected. If you do not understand, then follow me: after so many strange occurrences, the viewer is so accustomed to oddities, that ending the film with totally unexpected relationships (like Mimoso and Susana) sounds totally natural after watching the rest of the movie. But above all, Luck is a movie that makes you think a lot trying to solve the mysterious places, laugh your head off with your unfortunate lives and mess with your perception of what can happen in just a few minutes when you turn your distance- if anything ... for all this, I rate it 8/10
