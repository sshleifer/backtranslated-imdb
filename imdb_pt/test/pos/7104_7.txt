The "House of Dracula" really has nothing new to offer in terms of shivers or emotions or new twists in an already tired storyline. This movie was made as a hasty sequel to the best made "House of Frankenstein" the year before. In "House of Dracula" you can see the factory as the production figures of 1945 charging its price on a potentially scary movie. Images from previous films of the series and then the ending of "Ghost of Frankenstein" used as the ending here just makes a movie "the cheep". That's the shame of the studio and the producer, considering they had top-notch talent and simply wasting everyone's time and effort on a quick cash back scheme. But that seems to have been the trend all over Hollywood at the end of World War II. That's what brought some of these unimportant photos from the 1950s SciFi, with all their close-ups of harmless lizards, in order to make them appear like dinosaurs. The days of James Whale and Val Lewton, to mention two, went as far as creating humor and real atmosphere in this genre. Keep in mind also that makeup genius, Jack Pierce, who actually did medical research to create all of our favorites, was summarily fired shortly after this particular movie was released. A less capable makeup man, named Bud Westmore, was then hired as head of this department at Universal, which would soon be Universal International. Not to denigrate Westmore's ability, but horror movies simply were not his forte. OK, watch or not watch. Watch this movie, but only as part of the chronological order of the Frankenstein series and you'll see how it all turned out to be a comedy for Abbott & Costello.
