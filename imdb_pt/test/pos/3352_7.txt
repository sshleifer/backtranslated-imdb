Alice enters a world of wonders ... but not the kind of wonder you remember as a child. The Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, the Queen and others (even Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alice a few things about her body - and about the body of other people - that can be wonderful. A tale of love and lust you've never seen. <br /> <br /> Kristine DeBell appears as Alice. I must say that, by the 1970s, this may be the most attractive adult actress of her day. I believe this is her only movie before moving on to mainstream work, but it was pretty much the best she could have chosen (my love for all things Alice is no secret). Even better than "Fairy Tales" (which is not really porn, so much). <br /> <br /> The songs are cheesy, but they fit the theme of the movie. A song, "What's a girl like you doing in a knight like this?" was very funny, and the others had similar themes. The trial to the end was well scripted and fit very well into Alice's world. Logic and humor were definitely explained. <br /> <br /> What else can you say about a movie like this? All I know is that for people who are accustomed to adult movies, where it's just a 30 second link to sex, this one will overwhelm you with plot and music. But personally, I think there's something very special about this movie and I hope it gets a good DVD release with retouched stuff and special features (if that's possible). I can see this being a cult movie.
