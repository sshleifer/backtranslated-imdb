In the 1960s, the Cleveland television audience could watch an episode of "Flash Gordon" as part of the Ghoulardi Show (11:30 pm Friday). This was the best mockfest material that any of us in high school had ever seen. We would have regular sleepovers (though we did not call them that) just to get into the fun of seeing those things with a group of friends. Then, the following week, we quoted our last maize lines from the last episode. <br /> <br /> Seeing this today provokes the same reaction. But if you can stop laughing at dialogue, stupid creatures, silly fantasies and horrible spacecrafts long enough, there are some good things I did not enjoy the first time. Production designers have built some excellent sets, both rooms and laboratory devices. Charles Middleton's character, "Ming the Merciless," was the greatest villain of all time, certainly up to that point and arguably better than anyone ever since. Jean Rogers is incredibly handsome. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
