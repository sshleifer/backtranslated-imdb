Highly recommended for all those who enjoy watching movies. Great acting, weird humor perfectly surreal, sh-t requirement of arrest, accurate representation of the masculine condition. The music is perfect too. I think the artist is "Dip", but I'm not sure. The short title credit song loop on the DVD's menu is well timed and sounds like Slint. (One thing to know is that IMDb maintains a ridiculous policy of MINIMUM duration based on comments, not CHARACTERS, not WORDS, but LINES. Measuring quality and quantity of posts based on LINES in the daring era of UNICODE and flexible, web-based typography, is like poles of smoking.)!
