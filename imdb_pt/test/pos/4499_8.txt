Based on Khaled Hosseini's best-selling novel, The Kite Runner is a story of friendship, betrayal and redemption. Set in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion of 1979 and later on the days of Taliban rule, all elements are present for great drama, but under the direction of Marc Forster (Finding Neverland), the film lacks the kind of emotional impact it makes for a memorable experience, although it is fun, well-represented and occasionally moving. <br /> <br /> Located in 1978 in Kabul, but filmed in Kashgar, China, because of the dangers in Afghanistan, the friendship that opens The film between two boys is very real, although they are separated by miles in social and economic circumstances. 12-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) lives in an elegant setting with his rich and educated father Baba, played by the great Homayoun Ershadi, although his wealth seems somewhat incongruous in one of the poorest countries in the world. Although Baba is a loving father, he confides to Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), his friend and business associate, that Amir is too soft and that there is "something missing from that boy." The family has a servant, Ali (Nabi Tanha), who loves all his needs and whose son Hassan (Ahmed Khan Mahmoodzada) is Amir's best friend. <br /> <br /> The two are separated not only by class, but also by ethnicity. Amir, a flourishing writer, is a member of the Pashtun majority, while Hassan is a Hazara, a minority sect (10% of the population). Although we learn little about their traditions or social situation, they are united by their love of kites, a popular sport in Kabul and by Amir reading Afghan folk stories to Hassan who is illiterate. The annual kite competition for boys is a big event in their lives and the CGI effects are breathtaking. The kite ropes are covered with glass particles and the winner is the one whose kite rope can cut the other kites in the sky. Hassan is the kite hunter who has an incredible ability to locate the fallen parrots and bring them to Amir as a trophy. After Amir wins the important contest, however, a sad event occurs that will shape the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> The bullies, led by the eldest assef (Elham Ehsas) who later appears as a ruthless Taliban leader, attack Hassan because he is a Hazara and brutally rape him (off the camera) while Amir is too afraid to try to avoid it. Unable to confront his perceived lack of courage (although one must ask what if he could have done to help Hassan), guilt becomes the driving force in his relationship with Hassan and his friendship becomes tense. In one incident, Amir throws pomegranates at Hassan as if begging him to retaliate and punish him for his passivity, but Hassan does not bite the bait, remaining loyal in spite of his friend's cowardice. When Amir asks his father to dismiss the employees and accuses Hassan of stealing his watch, Hassan admits the robbery, although he is innocent. Eventually, circumstances force Ali and Hassan out of shame. When the Russians invade Afghanistan, Baba and Amir also leave, fleeing to Pakistan and then to Fremont, California, where the story begins years later. <br /> <br /> Baba is forced to work at a gas station and sell trinkets. in an open-air market, while Amir (Abdul Salam Yusoufzai), apparently going through life moves, studies to become a writer at local community college. After he falls in love and marries Soraya (Atossa Leoni), the daughter of a Kabul general, Amir finally publishes his first novel, A Season of Ashes and things look very positive. When Amir receives a phone call from Rahim Khan asking him to visit him in Pakistan telling him "there is a way to be good again", the specter of guilt that haunted his whole life beckons for Amir to go home. He returns to Pakistan and, with great risk, returns to an Afghanistan now controlled by the Taliban to face the demons of his past and discover a surprising secret in the process. The Kite Hunter is a sensitive film that deals with the inner pain that comes from knowing that you were not true to your best instincts and allowing the possibility of going beyond shame to a new level of responsibility . Nor does it hide the pain caused to Afghanistan by wars and revolutions, a pain that is perhaps represented by Hassan's suffering. Unfortunately, it reduces complex situations to the level of good guys and villains and distorts what actually happened, exonerating the US, who engaged in covert operations against the government within the country, from any responsibility for the disastrous war that left more than a million dead and dead. millions more disabled. Although we are inspired by the prominent children's actors and moved by the freedom that the flying parrot represents, the Kite Slayer relinquishes his power when he tries to replace the melodrama with the story.
