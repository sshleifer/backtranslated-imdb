Every time I hear the voice of Karen Carpenter, there is that old familiar feel of the blues of the seventies. What an incredibly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb, in the title role, does a good job, but I think Karen Allen would have been the best choice. This is a rip-off movie that does a good job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard, but also the personal struggles Karen faced and her illness. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very well done. However Karen Carpenter finished, there was a time when she was very special and brought a lot of joy to her fans and music lovers. Even if you were not a Carpenter fan, this is a good story that shows how great talent can be a victim of societal pressures.
