This film is a sleeper because Rod Steiger is the only big name in the credits. However, all supporting actors fit well with your character. It was fitting that in his last film, Rod Steiger reminded us once again of his inventive power as an actor. He portrayed the impulsivity, obstinacy, and acceptance of the end of a grandfather's life in a characteristically individual and compelling performance. As his character was near death, history brings us closer to the most precious things we have been given: the privilege of life, the relationship with family members, and the empathy of those who care for us. His quest along with his granddaughter's daughter provided enough suspense to keep me waiting, expecting a heavily loaded climax, like the meeting of two long-separated elderly lovers who were also on the verge of death in Forever Young. "I wondered how the meeting would be staged and how firmly my emotions would be hurt when he and his granddaughter came to the end of their quest.I was delighted to find that the story brought more than I had expected.The deliciously satisfying climax brought me a a greater appreciation of the value of the precious gifts of life, love, and family that we enjoy today for myself and for all of us.
