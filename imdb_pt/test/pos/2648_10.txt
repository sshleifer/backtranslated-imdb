This movement is absolutely, certainly, one of the greatest films of the genre, or of any other genre. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but all his filmography must be put in a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike anything I've seen on screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors who can lure him in and keep him captivated from beginning to end, even with the absence of prolonged dialogue or plot development. Only with the visual, 2001 is able to present an image of the future sublime and horrifying. 10 out of 10, without a doubt. For my money, it does not get much better than 2001: The Space Oddysey ... now, the sequel of 2010 ... is a different story.
