The director and author Jean-Pierre Rappenau was 8 years old during the spring of 1940, when the Third Republic of France disintegrated in a matter of a few weeks. It was a time, he says, when "all adults were a little insane." He and the production team lovingly and meticulously recreated the world in a film in which all characters are essentially fictional. The structure, a classic farce, is ideal for the period when multiple plot lines intersect and intersect only to unite in a logical and satisfactory conclusion. The peg of this conspiracy is Frédéric, played by bright rookie Gregory Derangere, who is totally up playing alongside Adjani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. The real strength of the film lies in its supporting performances. M. Rappeneau has thrown the film in fine with actors who have offered ideas for action and dialogue and who know and prove that it is possible to perform a character with only two short sentences. While still not as influential as Renoir's "Rules of the Game", "Bon Voyage" deserves to be a companion piece to this classic. Although it requires a lot of the audience, this gives a lot of feedback. One of their demands is tolerance for a certain shyness and disorientation as to the exact genre we're watching: a crime melodrama, no, a spy thriller, ah, a romantic comedy. Recommend it to the friends of the cinemaphile. Just be sure to let them find out for themselves that it's a romantic comedy.
