It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if someone is confused about her past (like how she ended up in the same hospital where Hurley was), then you should know that naked Libby dying in Season Two, the character will be explored further in 3 Season and we will get answers to the questions that surround it. <br /> <br /> BTW, great episode. Had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions ... like what happened to Eko and Closed and what about the four toe statue? <br /> <br /> I can not wait until season 3, Just lost rules !!! I hope all unanswered questions are answered. I loved how they explained why the plane really crashed. Desmond did this when he could not type the numbers in time. 4 8 15 16 23 42
