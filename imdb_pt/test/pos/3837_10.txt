I really liked this movie and generally do not like animated images. But I thought the cats were cute and the storyline was charming. There's a good song called "Everyone wants to be a cat," that's a lot of fun. It has some comic moments and is an interesting adventure. I think it helps to be an avid cat lover to enjoy this movie.
