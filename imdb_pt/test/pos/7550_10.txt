Unfortunately, many great movies about IMDb, like this one, have their scores "adjusted" by IMDb. This is really an interesting and intriguing film from the director of Bonnie and Clyde, Little Big Man, Night Moves, Mickey One and The Chase. <br /> <br /> If you click on the user's rating area, you will see that the actual median of four friends is 7.6. However, IMDb "adjusted" (stunned?) Rating to 6.4. "The IMDb publishes weighted averages of votes rather than raw data averages. A number of filters are applied to raw data to eliminate and reduce 'vote-filling' attempts by more interested individuals To change the current rating of a movie than to give its true opinion about it .... The exact methods we use will not be disclosed.This should ensure that the policy remains effective. " In other words, we will not disclose our methods, so you can not question how we got the score! How embarrassing to see good, thought-provoking movies, like Four Friends, are no better than the fictional comedians in the IMDb "filters."
