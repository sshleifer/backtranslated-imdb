I loved the story of a guy who tries to get the girl back ... to be there, to do it, so I can relate ... anyway I love the camera work, as occasionally the camera gets "turned on" and they are just sitting there talking about the scene, or other things ... or how the camera follows you to find the cast and what not ... I watched this at IFC sometime last year and I loved it, so I said to a few of my friends about it, and some of them watched, and they also loved it ... check it out if you can, female type, but it's still a good movie ... I gave it a 10/10 because of two reasons. .. one: I can relate ... but anyone who has ever fallen in love and made a mistake can relate ... two: it's a really creative way of making a movie, it's like you're constantly there, right in the middle of filming ... like I said, great movie
