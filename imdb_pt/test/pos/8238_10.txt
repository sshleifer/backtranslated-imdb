A light, uplifting and engaging film. Watching Irene Dunne is a delight! As you watch her, she stops being Irene Dunne and becomes, in every way, Paula Wharton. <br /> <br /> I liked Irene Dunne in all the movies I saw and that would be almost all of them. Too bad that most of your movies need restoration so badly. I hope Irene Dunne's movie is restored before it's too late, they're treasures. Thank God, this is not the case for over 21. <br /> <br /> You need to see if you like superb acting and witty comedy in serious tones. I agree with an earlier comment about the speech "The World and Apple Pie" was one of the many highlights of the film. I read somewhere that Irene Dunne helped write this speech along with director Vidor (Irene Dunne was a very good and charitable person in private life) and certainly seems to show through her films!
