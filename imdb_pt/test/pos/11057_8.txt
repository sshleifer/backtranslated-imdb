This is the forty-minute movie that features the Butcher character, which will later be examined in more detail in the long Seoul Contre Tous. In this film, follows the initial period of his life from 1965 to 1979, but focused on the late seventies. The first images are from a slaughter of a horse, then the birth of a baby, the daughter of the Butcher, which we see rapidly growing each year. The Butcher (played by Philippe Nahon in both films) is a bitter man with the world. He hates many things. His anger comes to a head when a man assaults his autistic daughter. The butcher then changes the wrong man, and finds himself in prison. <br /> <br /> This film follows the life of the butcher to soon after his release from prison, so Seoul Contre Tous takes over from there. I watched the movies the wrong way, Seoul Contre Tous first. Try and see this little movie first if you can.
