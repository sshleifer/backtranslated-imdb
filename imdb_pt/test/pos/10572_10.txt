I watched this movie recently and fell in love with it. I loved the plot and the actors. It has a bit of everything. I was completely overwhelmed by the unfolding of the story. There are so many surprises along the way. I recommend. In fact, I loved it so much that I just bought the book. I felt I had to read to appreciate the art in the writing behind the movie. I also wanted to be sure that I would not lose anything from the book, but I was out of the picture. I recommend that people who love the movie read the book because there is enough difference in the book, especially in the second episode, to want to read it. It became my favorite movie. I am now a fan of Sarah Waters and Elaine Cassidy !!
