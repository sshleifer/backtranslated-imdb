One of director Alfred Hitchcock's best films is the story of an American and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day and his son) who are vacationing in North Africa. Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world-famous singer. They know a Frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them get out of an incident on a local bus. Later, the French whisper something in Stewart's ear after being attacked and killed. The rest of the film is an enigma while Stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. The film is steeped in mystery and strangeness from the exotic location to the strange occurrences. You never really know what's going on in this movie because people are popping it through to the end and even then you're not sure. The final scene takes place in Albert Hall and is one of the most famous cinema, which lasts 12 minutes without dialogue. Hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934.
