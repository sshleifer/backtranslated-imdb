I can not believe I've never added my two cents on this movie yet! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films of all time. Many film critics and goers talk about John Carpenter's "Halloween" to set trends and be "his best work." Those folks have not seen this version of "The Thing" because it's up there with "Halloween". <br /> <br /> The work of John Carpenter shines in this film. He got a movie that was already made and instead of "remaking" the movie, he made the book on which the first movie was based! Bright. <br /> <br /> The cast of each man was great, the tension between them was real, made me scream, scared me, made me guess, made me laugh, made me question, even today "who goes there?" in this movie. This movie did not have any Hollywood sweet pie or funny type end, and what a bold move to not have one in 1982. Another brilliant move. <br /> <br /> I was at the screening of this movie when I was on vacation. in southern California. The viewing audience was crazy! I carry those memories for years, it was so much fun! We all thought there was no way in the green earth of God that this movie would not be a success. But for box office receipts, it was a failure because of "ET, The Extra Terrestrial" and "Poltergeist" two very good family-oriented movies took the box office in 1982 when this movie came out. <br /> <br /> Film was what I, as a fan of horror movies, sought, a horror / suspense with a script for adults and real adult actors. No kids playing adults. No little miss queen of the day screaming running around screaming for titillation, but real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you've ever heard. Damn, being a feminist, I did not even miss women in this movie! It's good for Mr. Carpenter not to put one there, it really would not have made sense! (Unless "The Thing" was really feminine! Something to think about!) I saw special effects from that time I had never seen before, I saw makeup that made me sit for a few nights. This is what today's horror / suspense is missing. Today, the directors are frustrated. Today, the studios hang up. Too much CGI and insufficient belief, too much CGI and insufficient history, insufficient imagination. You leave the theater and in a week - or less - you forget the movie and move on to the next big movie opening. This one stays with you. This is one of the marks of an excellent film. <br /> <br /> In many reviews, I wrote that paying $ 10 for a movie is horrible. For movies like this, you would pay and you would not feel scorned. This movie is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> I think it's horrible that they put this movie as a "cult." I think the audience is broader than many would have believed, and although it was not a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how releasing a good movie on the wrong date can make a good movie look bad. After the John Carpenter movie, many people copied many techniques, makeup, special effects and story lines from this version of "The Thing." <br /> <br /> Now I'm excited to record this and claim that this movie is one of the best films of all time, far below expectations.
