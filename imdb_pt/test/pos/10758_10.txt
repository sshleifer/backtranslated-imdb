I went to the premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York and I just loved the movie !!! I am Diane's biggest fan and, of course, as always, she gave a magnificent performance! I've seen every one of your movies and I must say this is one of my new favorites. Diane was funny and touching and just took my breath away. Donald Sutherland was surprisingly humorous, but also very serious. Anton Yelchin is just a wonderful young actor and gave an incredible performance. All in all, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can enjoy an excellent movie. 10 thumbs up !!! I would definitely see it again and again and again. This is the best movie of the year so far !!!
