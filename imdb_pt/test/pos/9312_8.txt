The first time I saw this movie was on a flight between Guangzhou, China and Los Angeles. It was a real joke and made the trip go by with much less discomfort than the normal 10-hour flight. I tried to locate a copy of it without success until I discovered a copy for sale on eBay. Having watched now twice, I recommend it as good entertainment. My only real criticisms are that the choice of English translation words for subtitles is insignificant, even by normal standards. In addition, subtitling is small or small, it fits in with the film very often and often travels too fast to read well.
