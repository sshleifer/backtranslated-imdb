"Crossfire" is ostensibly a murder mystery, but what distinguishes it from other similar films of the period is the killer's motive, which is anti-Semitism. The story highlights examples of the kind of ignorance that fuels intolerance and contains references to a "hick" and an Irish immigrant who has also been ill-treated because of his ethnicity. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is based on Richard Brooks. novel called "The Brick Foxhole," which is about a hate crime where the victim was gay. It is ironic that this story about a form of intolerance is met with intolerance by censors who stipulate that for the film version the kind of fanaticism involved must be changed to anti-Semitism. Another irony is the behavior of a soldier who seems fiercely proud to have served in a war against the Nazis and yet embraces his hatred of the Jews. The director and producer of this film also suffered another kind of intolerance when they were blacklisted after being called in to appear before the "House Anti-American Activities Committee." All of these points seem to underline the deeply ingrained and intractable nature of the whole problem of fanaticism as described in this film. When Police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) investigates the murder of Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), he discovers that the night he was killed, Samuels was socializing with a group of soldiers and a of them, the cable Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell (George Cooper) is quickly identified as the main suspect. More information is also collected from Montgomery (Robert Ryan), who is another of the soldiers present that night and Sgt. Keeley (Robert Mitchum), who is a friend of Mitchell's. Keeley, with the help of a few other soldiers, then searches for Mitchell and when he finds him, he hears his account of what he did the night of the murder including his meeting with a dancer named Ginny Tremaine (Gloria Grahame). Keeley helps Michell avoid being arrested and tries to identify the killer. Ginny Tremaine is questioned, but her information is insufficient to prove Mitchell's innocence, but Finlay's investigations lead him to acknowledge the motive of the crime and later he creates an elaborate trap that leads the real culprit to expose his own guilt. "Crossfire" is a film with a message and the identity of the killer is revealed at a very early stage of the story. The "message" is transmitted in a way that was undoubtedly appropriate for the period in which it was made, but by today's standards it seems quite heavy. J Roy Hunt's cinematography is simply marvelous with discreet lighting and creative use of numerous strategically placed matching table lamps to conjure up an appearance that is perfectly compatible with the drama being played on the screen. Despite this being a low-budget production, "Crossfire" was a blockbuster and benefited from having an absorbing and very relevant story with a wonderful cast, two of which were nominated for an Oscar nomination. Additional nominations for Edward Dmytryk (Best Director), producer Adrian Scott (Best Picture) and John Paxton (Best Screenplay, Adapted Screenplay) are just another proof of the positive acknowledgment that this film received justifiably.
