The only complaint I heard about this movie was that it was slow. Although, maybe this is the point. The two characters clash relentlessly and the slow buildup of tension between them is a producer of anxiety. Intricate and subtle gestures and minimal dialogue push the tension to a point where a normally normal argument shocks the audience. Istanbul and the surroundings are dreamy, captivating scenery, and the plot is thrilling - not in that kind of "look, the hero has blown up yet another car and he is now flying with his motorcycle," however. I had shivers down my spine as the characters stepped in and out of each other's spheres and watched the fog engulf Istanbul.
