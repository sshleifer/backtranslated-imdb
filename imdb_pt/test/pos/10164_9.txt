I put this second version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" for my Top 10 Hitchcock movies. Along with "Frenzy", it is probably the most discussed movie among Hitchcock fans. I consider this much better than, say, "Rebecca," who has gained overly reasonable ratings. <br /> <br /> The film contains many ingenious scenes (most of which have been mentioned in other reviews), but this is something to be expected of Hitchcock. It takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen, but this time is used to prepare the following events, which are full of intriguing suspense. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the awkward rear projections, the only weakness of this film is the main villain, played by Bernard Miles, who is a rather flat and underdeveloped character. Luckily, there's a scary killer in the form of Reggie Nalder. And Hank, the little boy, is not as annoying as most children in old movies.
