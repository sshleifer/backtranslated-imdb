This short comedy by Stan Laurel is a small parody of Valentino's film Blood and Sands. If you've seen BLOOD AND SAND, then you'll probably like this movie and laugh at some of the mocking scenes from Valentino's movie. However, if you have not seen the movie and just watched this movie, you probably will not be too impressed - although I enjoyed the titles a lot, the word "bull" has been used repeatedly in very funny ways. <BR> Stanly plays "Vaselino", a bullfighter who looks pretty stupid and wins only because the bulls seem lazy and not aggressive. Even the bull at the end of the movie that supposedly killed ten men is obviously just a domesticated bull. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie of any stretch of the imagination, but still a cute and harmless movie.
