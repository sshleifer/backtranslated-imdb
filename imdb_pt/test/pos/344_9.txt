I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2002. This is the first Indian film I've seen in the Tamil language, and although it shares some similarities with other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography, rapturous plot), the director tries harder than just entertaining. The film tells the story of Amudha, a nine-year-old girl whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted, starting an odyssey that drives everyone from India to war-ravaged Sri Lanka. Beautiful visuals mingle with gruesome scenes of violence expressly to make a point, although it is simplistic. Amudha is played by P.S. Keerthana, and she is one of the few children I have ever seen who may be precocious yet non-irritating. His charm and beauty kept the film together.
