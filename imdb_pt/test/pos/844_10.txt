I loved this show. I think the first time I tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show. Was not the shop located like on the beach or something? I actually wrote back and forth with Marci for several years. I have lost contact and would like to be able to reconnect now as adults. Does anyone know where she is now? I wish they were released on DVD. I seriously doubt that, since I think there may be five or six people who even remember the show in the first place. They just do not do shows like that, do they? I wonder if this would still last in this day and age. Do you guys know anyone who can record DVDs from the show they recorded on VHS? I would be willing to pay (within reason).
