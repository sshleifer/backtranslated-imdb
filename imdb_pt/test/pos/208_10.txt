If you're looking for a typical war movie, this is not it, so a note to all fans of the war of desire for carnage bombarded by testosterone, do not bother. Although the film is about Russian characters in World War II, do not expect to see Nazis, cannons, blood, blood, etc. It's not a movie about people who wage a war or fight a war. It's a movie about ordinary people with whom war happens and the choices they make in dealing with it. <br /> <br /> Acting, cinematography, writing: all perfect 10s here. You'll certainly appreciate it if you're Russian like me, but even if you do not, you'll probably love it. If you do not speak Russian, look for the DVD version of RUSCICO (Russian Cinema Council). It has subtitles in about 14 different languages, but the English dubbing on that one I'd say is as good as. Of course it's not as good as the original Russian track (some things are missing in the translation), but as good as the English subtitles. So take a look, especially if you are studying movies in any aspect.
