I was lucky enough to watch this movie at the recently completed international film festival here. I actually got to watch another South Korean movie (The Power of Kangwon Province), but Christmas in August caught my eye more. The story is quite simple, the usual girl-girl (or, say, girl-meets-boy?). What made it special to me was how it was processed. We can say that the film was quiet and captivating. We do not have flashy romance and invented here, just two ordinary beings made wonderful by their friendship and love not expressed by each other. I also loved how the film used images as expressions of past and present relationships. I wanted this to be shown here as a normal movie. I'm sure this would call a larger audience.
