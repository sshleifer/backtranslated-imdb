This is an extraordinary film musically. It made me feel horrible that Rodrigues died in 1999, before I had the chance to see her live. Knowing she performed a wonderful Lincoln Ctr. Show in 1991 and that I could have been there but it was not painful beyond words. <br /> <br /> I just bought my first recording on Amalia. While the music recording is fantastic, power in this film see your face and your enormous expressiveness and passion while singing these songs of terrible sadness is wonderful. More or less like seeing Mary's face as she cradles Jesus in her arms in the Pieta. Watching her in the film reminded me of witnessing a similar extraordinary concert performance by Mercedes Sosa in the mid-1990s at the Lincoln Ctr. As I sat listening to Mercedes sing, I felt I was in the presence of a tremendous spiritual and musical force that contained an incredible primal power. Some of the musical segments of "The Art of Amalia" are playing, like Caetano Veloso doing a tribute to Amalia and singing one of his solo songs in front of a crowded concert hall. The musical segments also convey the incredible international repertoire of her musical repertoire and the bonds she has created w. fans around the world. There is a segment in which she states that she played in all the cities of Italy that has a stage! <br /> <br /> In another section, Amalia talks about her fight. mouth cancer and how she came to NYC to commit suicide in a hotel. However, when watching videos of Fred Astaire, she gradually convinced herself that life was worth it and walked away from killing herself. Amazing! Later in the film, she admires very boldly and directly to the interviewer that although she may have conquered the world musically, her personal life was out of sheer sadness. She admits she has never been happy. This is unbearably sad to hear, but perfectly in keeping w. a singer immersed in fado (which she translates as "bad fate" or "bad luck"). Also, someone wants to hear more about your personal life: what made you so sad? What were your disappointments? <br /> <br /> "The Art of Amalia" is a little disappointing in other important areas. My puns: show 20 to 30 full songs in the film, but only provide an English translation, as the last one seems a waste (unless the film was intended for a Portuguese-speaking audience only, which I can not imagine ). To see the deep pain in her face as she sings and not understand the lyrics is a delusion. As for the others less: there is almost no biographical material about Am√°lia's family background. There is a 20 sec. stretch w. she singing w. her mother (it's absolutely grand). There is a brief reference to his moving parents fr. the field to Lisbon. I'd love to see the movie from the village she came from. The interviews, as they are, are almost exclusively w. Amalia (and some close friends). She's a good one, but not a great subject. There are no interviewees who are experts in fado or Portuguese culture and society, so we do not deeply understand their musical roots. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a wonderful movie that everyone interested in Amalia should see. But it is not a perfect or definitive work on the subject.
