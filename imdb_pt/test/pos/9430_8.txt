The Doctor. Franz Tobel, a Swiss scientist, is smuggled out of his country by Sherlock Holmes so that the Nazi agents who spy on him do not have the invention of a new bombing vision. Arriving in London, he marries Holmes and Watson, but leaves for a visit with his girlfriend, Charlotte Eberli, where he leaves a clue to Holmes about the location of his bomb, which he divided into four parts, but The Eternal Enemy of Holmes, Professor Moriarity, is also looking for the bomb to sell to the Nazis, and kidnaps Dr. Tobel and the left lane in Charlotte, a code series of dancing men, which both Holmes and Moriarity are unable to decipher completely. Holmes finally discovers the clue of the code and gets the location of the fourth piece of the bomb, but Moriarity has the other three and a clash is inevitable. Very good entry into the Holmes series with a lot of mystery and divination to go through. Moriarity's portrayal of Atwill is more sadistic than the nifty type depicted in Doyle's stories (or George Zucco's performance in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), but Atwill's abilities as an actor make his Moriarity a benevolent subject. Both the script and the direction make this entrance a game of cat and mouse between the two characters and that is one of the reasons why this entry is successful. Great work in cinematography too. Evaluation, 8.
