OK, so it should Pulp Fiction, but in my opinion it has its own voice and identity mainly because of the style of direction of the video clip, narrative in sketch style and great performances. Thomas Jane is great (the show-down of dealers is extraordinary), Aaron Eckhart too. James LeGros has a short, effervescent appearance - great humor - "they got Wong's house." The scene of interrogation and rape of Porzikova is memorable, just like Mickey Rourke's appearance - "take a spike." Great Hollywood popcorn production with strong performance by aspiring and renegade A-level (Rourke). <br /> <br /> Well, take a peak, it's worth it.
