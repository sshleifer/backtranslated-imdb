Being Cornish and brought the history of tin mining, this film is very special to me. Filmed in several locations in Cornwall, he portrays the story of two of his sons, who are trapped in a mine with a group of miners. <br /> <br /> The "Haunters" of the title refer to the "Spriggins". - ghosts of gold miners who live in the mine and say they bring evil to all who are there. The events happen to an American who wants to invest in local tin mining, but when young local boy Josh is plagued by apparitions of a boy's ghost, he and his American "girlfriend" decide to unravel the mystery behind his death. The climax in the rescue of themselves and several miners of death almost certain when a new well is opened and the Spiggins save them. <br /> <br /> Top movie though low budget and short but it is worth taking a look if you are from Cornwall and / or tin mining!
