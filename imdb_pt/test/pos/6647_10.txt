I can not remember a movie that cleverly shows the emotional destruction of the war, as if mirrored in a single marital relationship. The focus of the film is the union between Ullman and Von Sydow - the two are in every scene. Throughout the film, they experience a reversal of roles - one has the strength of survival and the other is reduced to emotional escapism through dreams. Both will lose a measure of humanity, but one to a degree greater than the other. The characters and the viewer go through periods of fluctuation in relation to closeness - the camera pulls away and disappears, the sound disappears, the words are lost, only for the camera to return to pictorial images of its facially expressive stars. The confusion and fluctuation can make this movie difficult for some viewers, but this is all intentional under Bergman's master. I think the use of a fake war makes the movie timeless, as relevant today as ever before, and by focusing on human relationships through war, makes the movie relevant to everyone. The pair could be anyone. The film is not based on place or time, but on emotion. A unique and effective war film unlike any other. Bergman's films are virtuous in presenting human relationships - that he would bring this to a war film is masterful.
