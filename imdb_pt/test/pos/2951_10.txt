This is a great movie! That makes you think of your parents. As we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And as important as this, we must remember to open ourselves up and show ourselves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely watch this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before posting my comment, how strange. Usually, online reviews need to be short, and here I am asked to write more! Well, I went to see the movie with my parents, I thought later they would like to talk about their parents, but my father kept wanting to talk about himself and the things in his life he feels he missed, which was unusual, my father is not a reticent man, but I was surprised that he wanted to talk about mistakes he thinks he made. Mike and Kitty went to the movies for a Q & A session and there was a hilarious moment when my dad was talking to Mike while my mother was talking to Kitty! I really just disregard my last few sentences to fill this review, and remember '51 Birch Street, 'go see!
