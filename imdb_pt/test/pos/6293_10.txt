One of our all-time family favorites. When we need a laugh ... we just put that on and laugh out loud, like it's the first time we've seen her. This movie has good clean family humor. Pauly Shore is brilliant! With no plans for the Thanksgiving holiday, Crawl (Shore) is invited to spend the holidays with a conservative coed, Becca. Crawl, being a big city boy, must adjust to life on the farm if he falls in love with Becca. But Crawl is not the only one learning new things. Crawl teaches Becca and her parents how to be more open about their feelings and accept others. This is fun for viewers of all ages.
