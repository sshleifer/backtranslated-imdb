Some people say that the pace of this movie is a little slow, but how is this different from any other Hitchcock movie? They all move very deliberately and, as a point, there are suspense injections and brilliant montages through it. This film gives us the right amount of comic relief that makes suspense scenes seem more suspenseful. The Albert Hall scene is one of the best examples of Pure Cinema in the Hitchcock collection (probably the best is almost all of the "Rear Window"). Pure Cinema for Hitchcock meant that a series of small pieces of film fit together without dialogue in order to tell the story visually. This is, of course, the basic definition of the Albert Hall sequence, as well as the shorter staircase sequence at the end of the image. <br /> <br /> There are not many slips by Hitchcock here, and the acting is superb especially by Doris Day in a serious and amazing role.
