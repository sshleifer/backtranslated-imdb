A wonderful little production. <br /> <br /> The shooting technique is very modest - the fashion of the BBC very old and gives a feeling of realism comforting and sometimes uncomfortable to the whole play. <br /> <br /> The actors are extremely well chosen - Michael Sheen not only "has all the polari" but also has all the low voices! You can actually see the perfect edition guided by references to the notes of Williams' diary, not only worth watching but an incredibly written and executed play. A masterful production on one of the great masters of comedy and his life. <br /> <br /> Realism really comes home with the little things: the guardian fantasy that, instead of using traditional 'dream' techniques, remains solid and then disappears. He plays with our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes relating to Orton and Halliwell and the scenarios (particularly of his plans with Halliwell's murals decorating each surface) are very well done.
