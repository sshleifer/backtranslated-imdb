I'm giving this film 9 out of 10 just because there are not enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy needed to produce food to satisfy the enemies of science. It seems that mdixon believes that admittedly biased commentators are inventing these things, but even an elementary understanding of the features and laws of thermodynamics will indicate that, at the very least, they are on solid scientific grounds when they claim that we can not continue depending on oil, we must do the transition to different types of energy and we do not have a plan that replaces the amount of energy we get from oil. Other civilizations refused to face the facts of life and perished. Read the "Collapse" of Jared Diamond, which is a popular book, or any Ecology or Elementary Earth Science textbook, and you can check out the basic premise of this movie. Go ahead, stir while Rome burns!
