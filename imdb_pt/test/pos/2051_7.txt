Let me start by saying that overall I enjoyed The Long Kiss Goodnight. I would give it a 7/10. The Good: 1. Performance: Samuel L Jackson is fun in almost any role. In this film he does not play his usual character, the type that is in control, instead, Geena Davis is in control and Sam is together for the ride. His time on his lines is great and he is the highlight of the movie. Geena Davis also gives a great performance as Samantha Caine / Charlie Baltimore. She is a credible acting heroine and I do not think many other actresses could get the performance Geena does. 2. The action: This is a very action packed movie. Things are almost always breaking or exploding or someone is chasing someone else. The special effects are very good, especially for being almost 8 years old. I can see some green screen stuff, but that does not detract greatly from the acting. <br /> <br /> The Bad: 1. Why did it take half the movie to set the storyline? This film needed to be edited at the script stage so it would not run for so long. Maybe a drama or something like that could last so long, but people really need to be in the movie all the time to support it. I think if you manage to stand out in the first half, you'll be surprised in the second half. 2. Geena Davis is cool and a top, but she never seems cold. 3. Some things are not realistic. Sam Jackson flies through a giant plate after he is kicked out of a room and then he falls into a tree and simply gets up. When you see this part, you'll think it's a joke. general fun movie 7/10
