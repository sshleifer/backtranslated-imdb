This is an excellent, suspenseful, murder mystery movie. Not only was the plot full of suspense and intrigue, but you can see the beautiful Ryan Gosling for a few hours, which is not to love! Also, Sandra Bullock is good in this movie - I was always a fan of her, (I just wish she had not decided to be in "The Lake House", which was awful, but that's another story). Obviously, since there are thousands of other horror / murder movies out there, there are similarities between them, there is no need to spoil this movie by having some similarities with at least some that have already been made. Anyway, this is a great movie for those who really like "scary" movies, it's a little gloomy and distorted, but overall a great movie !!!
