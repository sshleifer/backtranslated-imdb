"Pitch Black" was a complete shock to me when I first saw it in 2000. In previous years I was repeatedly disappointed by all the science fiction films (Ex: STARSHIP TROOPERS) and I thought this movie would not be any different. But to put it bluntly: this movie scared me ... in a good way. I did not know that I was still afraid of the dark until I watched this movie; I must have buried my fear in the back of my subconscious when I was a child and deservedly deserves to stay there. <br /> <br /> The alien creatures sent shivers down my spine; the individual (s) who designed them have a distorted but brilliant and creative imagination to invent something so impressive and grotesque. <br /> <br /> I loved how the writers gave each main character a story and showed their flaws and strengths without much confusion. <br /> <br /> Riddick's gift (Vin Diesel) to escape from any impossible situation. and put on a hellish fight was jaw-dropping. At first you think he is a coldly intelligent villain, but in a few brief moments, you can see something human behind your animal side. But as soon as you find out, he does something maliciously dishonest. It certainly keeps you guessing until the end. I did not know if I despised or admired him ... he is definitely a kind of love / hate. Johns (Cole Hauser) was a perfect example of a character who puts a good front but through a need for greed, shows his real intentions and what he is willing to do to survive. John's talent for knowing which buttons to push and the right words to say makes him as dishonest as Riddick. <br /> <br /> Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character who, as Johns so well expressed, looked at her first before considering the consequences. But what is captivating about her is that she quickly realizes the mistakes of her ways and desperately tries to pay for penance even as she puts her life at risk when others discard all human values ​​and depart for the dark rolling hills. <br /> Jack (Rhiana Griffith) simply wanted to have a hero and was the first of the group to look for that hero in Riddick; Through the eye of a child, good can be seen through the thick clouds of evil. I thought it was absolutely invaluable when Jack shakes his head at Ode to Riddick; you know what they say: imitation is the best form of flattery. Imam (Keith David), like Jack, has the ability to see well at any evil. He uses philosophy to take him through the difficulties he knows and when time allows, he rationally lamented his losses and then soldiers. In a way, it served as a moral booster for the survivors, though most of the characters acted as if they were not listening. <br /> <br /> The cast for this movie was positively perfect. Each actor shone brightly in his role and his talents mingled wonderfully on the screen. <br /> <br /> This movie may have a small budget, but the director's lead and actor's acting made the film work and allowed the audience to use their imagination instead of letting some outrageously expensive special effects do everything work for them. This film is a definitive classic of Sci-Fi. Watch and judge (with an open mind) for yourself. It will be worth it.
