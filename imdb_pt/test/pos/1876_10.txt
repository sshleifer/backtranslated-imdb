Okay, well, no one in their right mind would choose a movie titled "The Man with the Screaming Brain" and expect him to be serious. This is a scandalous b-movie, and that means a really mushy storyline, weird characters, clich√©s, over-the-top action and a one-oh-so-cheesy liners. For that weird segment of the population (including myself) that gets kicked out of that sort of thing, that's a gem. <br /> <br /> The performance is better than expected. Stacy Keach is embedded in her character. Bruce Campbell brings a witty and compelling performance. His physical comedy skills are truly impressive in this film and refer to the films "Evil Dead".
