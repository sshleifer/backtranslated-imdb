HOT. It's proof that once the film industry said "F-OFF" to the censors and made movies with whatever they wanted! In today's world, this film would be too "exaggerated" and "extreme" to be anywhere than behind a velvet curtain. Although, BestBuy has multiple copies in its rack for $ 5.99 (if anyone wants to get a copy)! The film was brilliant in its own way as it blended humor into a T & A movie loaded with Playmates Playboy! Unlike most skin movements, he had a plot. This, however, is not exactly the reason why you would watch H.O.T.S. <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. is a college film that reminds me of the Revenge of the Nerds movies, where it takes a bunch of "ordinary people" and puts them against the elite rich preposses that most people can not stand! The only difference is that the "Nerds" in this movie have a much better chance of sex! I realize there are some people who would rate this movie as low, and to me that is ignorant! Obviously, this is not intended to win Oscar or break barriers in the cinema. If you are looking for this, then go see what the critics choose for you! You have to appreciate the fact that this movie really had a funny plot, decent acting (for the most part given the genre), and lots of girls getting naked! HOT. is one of those movies that you watch to get your mind off the problems of the modern day and everyday stress and instead laugh and have fun! If you are looking for a college-based movie that has enough skin to turn a pink Miata straight, then you should take a look at H.O.T.S.!
