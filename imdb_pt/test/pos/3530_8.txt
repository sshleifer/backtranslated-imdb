September 29, 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my appreciation of horror films. That was the date on which BBC1 broadcast (for the only time I'm aware) Jeff Lieberman's super-scary 1981 shocker, Just Before Dawn, and that made a big impression on me. Almost 20 years later, I'm pleased to report that I've finally gotten my hands on the special two-disc edition of Shriek Show / Media Blasters, and it's as strange and disturbing as I remember, if not more. The plot, as is usual for genre films (and this was Lieberman's first film as a 'rental director', though he at least removed all the religious cult that dealt with the script's mumbo-jumbo snakes). ), is a bit skinny-five friendly twenty-somethings (including Chris Lemmon, son of Jack, in a couple of uncomfortably tight white footsteps) venture into the dense forests of Oregon to make camp and check out a piece of land was left for one of them. But Just Before Dawn stands out from a crowd of imitators because Lieberman wastes no time in showing us how upset things are in this particular stretch of the mountain with a complete innocent and a drunken preacher pushed down a hill and enveloped by the flames minutes the beginning of the movie. The youngsters are rolling to the scene in a speedy Winnebago, Blondie's "Heart of Glass" hitting the soundtrack, and before you can say "Texas Chainsaw Massacre!" they beat an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first taste of aggression from the heavy maniac responsible for the opening catastrophes. Ranger Roy (George Kennedy) warns that things can go wrong if they go further, but they go ahead with the trip anyway, refusing to give the preacher a ride, although he is understandably frightened and finally flipping miles of camp. from anywhere. Needless to say, things fall apart from here. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not short on bloody horror and well-conducted action scenes, the highlights for me are those in which Lieberman lets his camera move away, long and slow, from seemingly harmless children who love fun, playing in the desert, or just let her rest for a while in the dense, imposing forests dotted with ink. It makes Oregon's exterior as ominous and ominous as Kubrick made the spacious interiors of the Overlook Hotel at Shining, and Brad Fiedel's scorecard (discounting the terribly distorted racket that runs through the titles) remains the right side of intrusive, underscoring the threat of slow climb with subtlety and talent. There are many surprises along the way, beckons to Deliverance with the discovery of a backwoods baby and his strange and disturbing family, and a truly bizarre killing technique deployed shortly before the end of the film. I will not ruin everything for you. I've said enough. <br /> <br /> Why did this gem of undeserved horror fall into the cracks and became a cult item instead of a success is hard to figure out but hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years to come - deserves to be.
