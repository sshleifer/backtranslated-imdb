Although this film does not have the darkness of the books, it is in my opinion a great movie. It's great fun with the beautiful Stuart Townsend as Lestat. He may not have blonde hair and blue eyes that are described so vividly in the book, but to be fair, he would not look good with blonde hair, and Lestat is definitely a good-looking one. It moves like the predator I always imagined Lestat would have. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are very good, and the soundtrack is absolutely incredible. It's not Interview with the Vampire, so do not try to compare the two. Interview is the story of Louis. This is a trimmed version of Lestat's. Anyway, I highly recommend it.
