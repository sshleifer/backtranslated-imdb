I would give this film high marks for film photography and performances. I just read a user commentary on the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who broadcasts Sinuoeh, the main character. I remember a mini biography of this actress after the movie the last time I saw him. Apparently she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the film industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and in tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also notable in this movie. Like other neo-biblical films of the 1940s and 1950s, "The Egyptian" reflects the morals and values ​​of the times, but it is still a great entertainment because the performances are wonderful and the story so well told.
