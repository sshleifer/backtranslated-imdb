Even if it's not labeled as a Slasher movie, it has all the elements. The fact that slashers are well known for their low budget, lame plot, fancy effects and everything you can add does not mean there can not be good horror movies. "Opera" fills in the description. Even being part of the Italian giallo; which is far from a sub-genre slasher. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento proves that he deserves the label of one of the best directors of Horror. "Opera" is one of the most elegant horror films of the last 30 years. Although the film takes place in a beautiful and bright place; the situations and gore make it one of the scariest places ever used in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I think of "Opera" as a stylish Slasher, although there is an in-depth plot and character development. The cheese factor often used in most Slasher films is not present here, but in return we have a thrilling, visually stunning tale. The plot of the movie is simple (as in all Slasher). There is an opera psychopath who is a bit obsessed with the lead actress / singer and forces her to watch horrible deaths. The death scenes are extremely awful and are the best thing about the movie. The infamous death scene "peep-hole" is the highlight of the movie in my opinion. It's a fantastic death scene that none other than Argento could pitch. The knife in the neck (and the mouth) is another horrible scene, but less violent than that of the scissors. The gore in "Opera" will please the bad guys and lovers of violence. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about the film is the lack of coherence or logic. That is, after watching the first death, the protagonist, calmed down as if nothing had happened to get home and does not do much about what she saw. In addition, she is left alone at home and does not take security measures. Still, the suspense in the movie makes you forget the lack of logic. Argento knows how to create tension and how to scare the subconscious. For example, when Betty's friend tells her that someone was watching her from the outside, she goes insane and puts suspense in case something happens. <br /> <br /> The direction of the movie is great. For an Italian giallo it is excellent. Argento's creative POV photos are impressive. The crows also added a scary feeling to the movie. Argento adds its unique spice. <br /> <br /> "Opera" is one of the most underrated, but popular through the Horror community for these reasons, in my opinion: -the death scene of the pio-hole (bright) -the crows attack at the end- the opera scene - the knife in the neck and the mouth - the heavy metal score combined with Opera music (this song never scared me before) - the murderer's ferocity <br /> <br /> The only thing that I I do not like "Opera" is the heavy metal songs used in the death scenes. It's okay to disturb the audience, but I think Opera's music could have added a more frightening feeling. Still, the "shocking" use of heavy metal is a disturbing aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Watch "Opera" even if you do not like blood. There is a lot of suspense and tension that can scare the most skeptical person. This is not "Suspiria", but deserves to be among the best of Argento.
