After 10 views in 20 years I also think that this was the best effort of the film Crazy Gang, with more cohesion in the plot than the next, "Alf's Button Afloat". They were in fact a crazy trio of double acts together mostly on stage, sometimes in front of royalty, until Chesney Allen retired in the 1940s through "health problems." He survived them all for years. Apparently, they were so crazy out of "work," regularly making jokes with each other. <br /> <br /> The group of Six Wonder Boys goes to the show "I'll tell you-me" (Alaskan) to dig for the gold that was being found there. It seemed a better idea than going to Mansfield ... because they were there. When they get to the Red Gulch, they discover that their information was only 40 years out of date - they thought the tokens that were in the guilty journal they had read were funny. But at this point, it does not matter, since everyone fell in love with Snow White and wants to help his grandfather find his lost gold stock. Baddie Bill "M" McGrew wants himself, though. <br /> <br /> The number of verbal and visual puns is staggering, but most of them will probably only make sense. (?) For British and ex-pats interested in seeing b & w's 30's British Comedies. Almost all the jokes and routines work, including the Gold If pattern between Bud & Chesney and the pastiche "Whistle While You Work" - even the insertions of "Always Getting Our Man" from Mountie. A wonderful little film, looking rather tired, but totally recommended.
