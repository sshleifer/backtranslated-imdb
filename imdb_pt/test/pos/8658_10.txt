Synopsis: Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) finds himself alone in a bus, being left in a deserted land, in what appears to be the last stop of his journey. He does not know how he got there, but a welcome signal was lifted for him. After briefly pondering his whereabouts, he is greeted by a man who takes him to his new life. He then enters a world different from where he came from. <br /> <br /> As Andreas is quickly introduced to his new job as an accountant, he feels that his surroundings are a little too uniform for his taste. While he makes his first lunch break, he instantly notices that everyone in town walks in a gray suit. On the same day, he sees a fellow business man dead at some fencing points, from what appears to be an act of suicide. The strange thing is that the town people do not pay attention to this horrible act and walk as if it never happened. It is quick to see that these people are genetically desensitized, and their ability to distinguish between something human or inhuman is absent. <br /> <br /> To help Andreas settle down, he is invited to hang out with his co-workers for a local nightclub. The club seems to be a step away from becoming as exciting as a bingo night ... And while Andreas drinks his sorrows, he realizes that no matter how much he drinks, alcohol has no effect on him. As he counts these observances to a stranger in the men's room, a man in a bathroom cubicle begins to utter words that have been in Andreas's mind all the time. Realizing that this man is thinking what he is, he follows him to his house and observes where he lives for future reference. The plot predictably evolves with Andreas wanting an escape. He looks for the man he once followed ... hoping he could get him to become human again ... but is it too late? <br /> <br /> My Thoughts: This Norwegian film is something that everyone should see, as it holds the answer to the big question! What is the meaning of life? (well, close enough). The film outlines the dark realities of what happened to today's working man (or woman). Its sole purpose is to make people realize that life is too short to be materialistic. He tries to show that little cliches, like the sound of children playing, should not be taken for granted, because the moment you stop hearing that sound, it's the moment when you're one step away from becoming a robot. The ending of the movie reiterates what happens when it's too late to escape the mundane routine you've gotten used to. You start adopting the saying "if it's not broken, do not fix it," and it's too comfortable to risk changing. <br /> <br /> Although this film should not be taken as a piece of realism ... its message is more than real. The lack of empathy conveyed in the film, and what Andreas sees, is a bold statement of what life can be. The director, Jens Lien, put together a film that, in the hands of any other director, would have failed. This is an excellent cinematographic genius work, and I look forward to seeing what he does next. <br /> <br /> The lead role, played by Trond Fausa Aurvaag, is perfectly thrown. Representing the average Joe, Trond provides a good catalyst in making this image darkly humorous. The supporting actors also do a good job, and for some reason, I feel that Keanu Reeves would have been perfect in this movie, since most of the supporting cast demanded that their acting be without emotion. <br /> <br /> The score for this movie was beautifully composed. The recurring theme was always a delight to listen to, and provided a very somber but welcome feel to the film. <br /> <br /> Prepared for a UK release date of May 25, 2007, I will definitely be reliving this on-screen experience. This movie has won its way into my top 10 ... now quickly becoming my top 20! It has some shocking scenes, and it is darkly humorous throughout ... A DEVE -SEE !!
