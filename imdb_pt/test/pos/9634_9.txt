Many people are making fun of Steven Seagals' acting skills. And I really do see why I remember Fire Down Below. Well ... okay your other films are acceptable (in relation to your acting!). <br /> <br /> After reading the comments about The Patriot, I did not expect anything from this movie. I barely passed Fire Down Below and read a lot that The Patriot was even worse. So I was very surprised by that. In my opinion, it's one of your best films. If it had more action sequences and a few more fighting scenes, it would be best. I liked the story of the directors and the actors. Cammilla Belle was simply amazing. She will have a great career in film in the future. The few action scenes were very well done. And Steven Seagal was very believable in his unusual role.
