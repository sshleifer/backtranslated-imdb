I already gave my comment about this movie with the name BruceV3. Now under BruceV13 I want to add something! Now, after a long time, I have seen many so-called heroic bloodshed titles! But many do not come close to the action shown in John Woo's movies! That's why after all these years I find it strange that "China White" does not have the credit it deserves! It does not matter which version you have seen! The action is top notch! The scenery, China Town in Amsterdam is very unique. You have the impression that it is a large district. But having lived in Amsterdam I know it's just a small part of the red light district which happens to have a lot of Chinese shops and restaurants! But because of the way they filmed the movie, it actually looks like a big and important territory where people do not know how to mess with the triads (the Chinese mafia)! In addition to the action "China White" is a convincing gangster drama with some good acting! That's why I have to give credit to Russel Wong! Too bad we do not see much of him lately, since he has so much potential! Must see the movie!
