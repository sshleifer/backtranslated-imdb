This is a movie that in no way reflects the real world. Nothing in this movie makes any sense of the real world or has any real-world logic. He operates entirely in his own world and his ability to accept it or not will determine his love or hatred for this film. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the beginning At first I bought the completely unreal premise of the successful woman regaining her memory while the past comes back to haunt her. There was a moment in the beginning when I remember accepting that this would be one of those movies where the heroine would not know anything until it was needed, despite all the logic that it would not happen this way. "Oh, it's one of those movies," I told myself, and got hooked when the movie started a crazy two-hour chase. <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with brains and strength, as things go on there. logic and you really have to pay attention to following some of the twists and turns. I like it a lot and am pleasantly surprised when I meet people who also feel the same way. People either love or hate, if they have ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> If you like action movies, it's a movie to try. You may not like it, but it's certainly worth the effort to find out <br /> <br /> And as always, leave reality at the door.
