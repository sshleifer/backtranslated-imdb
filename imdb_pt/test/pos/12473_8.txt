SPOILERS The famous character of Edgar Rice Burroughs has been adapted thousands of times to the screen until his thirst goes out, especially during the thirties and forties in Hollywood. Its producers made Tarzan one of the most successful characters in the cinema. Several years later, Hugh Hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the ape-man and is a more natural, wilder and more grounded Tarzan than he gives here. Hudson cleverly avoids the clich√©s you give Tarzan, such as his famous scream or his pet friendly, Cheetah. Not only are we far from the character designed and invented by Hollwood, but we are also far from the set of footage used to make their stories. The film was partially produced in Africa (more precisely in Cameroon). The film presents two obvious parts: the first occurring in the jungle where Tarzan lives among his adoptive friends, the monkeys and considers himself their master. But he ignores their real origins. The second in England, where Tarzan discovers the English society. Ian Holm synthesizes the connection between the two parties and Hudson avoids anything that could make the film fall into ridicule thanks to an intelligent script. In fact, Holm teaches Lambert's basic rules of behavior in order to behave correctly in English society and the result works. Also, in the second part, no one laughs at Tarzan and he's really much appreciated. As far as the end is concerned, it's a bitter and happy ending. Happy because Tarzan goes back to the jungle and meets his next adoptive relatives. But bitter also, because this return home means that the Greystoke line will not be secured and is doomed to disappear ... Christophe Lambert finds here, his first (and last?) Great role. Unfortunately, he will never match the achievement of his performance in this film and he will play unsatisfactory and unsatisfactory action films. However, as I said earlier, an intelligent script, a rare quality performance, some stunning natural scenes (both the jungle and the English country and we got a wonderful film.) It is also an excellent retelling of a popular novel. just badly rated (6/10)?
