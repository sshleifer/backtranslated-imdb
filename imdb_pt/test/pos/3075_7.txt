May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> This is just a good movie. Lots of good to laugh at. However, I do not watch the TV version, they cut a lot out. Dom Deluise is quite impressive as the Mafia Don, who is hired to kill Robin. All I can say about your ten minutes: It's a long trip from Jersey. Also, you must love them by checking the script to make sure Robin has another chance. Also: 12th Century Fox. <br /> <br /> Anything bad? The rappers at the beginning and at the end seem a bit outdated. The songs were pretty weak. Once while watching this movie, I could think a few more times when they could have played on another joke or 2. Overall, however, a nice movie experience. One should pay attention to comedy fans.
