This movie was really a breath of fresh air from the crap of Hollywood I've seen recently. The acting is superb and the characters are engaging and strangely captivating. There really is not much history, it's simple and works well. An easy movie to sit and enjoy. The mood was fantastic and the sets really helped propel the movie and offered some nice visual effects. The film obviously has aspects of horror, but it's turned a little more to the humorous side of things. You will not laugh out loud hysterically with this, but you will be smiling all the time. The humor works very well with the characters and the excellent acting does not hurt. I actually watched this movie based on the fact that Ron Perlman was in it. His role is a little smaller than I expected, but it does not matter; the rest of the cast does more than enough to keep him involved. If you like terror, check this out. If you like comedies, watch that. Just go ahead and watch it anyway, it's really great.
