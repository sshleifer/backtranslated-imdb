Fantastic movie! One of the best film noir movies of all time. Bad bad guys, bad girls, a steal of jewelry, a distorted morality, a kidnapping, everything is here. Jean Servais has a face that would make Bogart proud and the rest of the cast is full of character actors who seem to know they are on to something good. Get some popcorn and enjoy yourself.
