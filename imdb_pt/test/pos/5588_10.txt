This may not be considered as a criticism in any film, but only a commentary on a film I saw when I was a young man. I remember returning home from a night full of admiration for what I had seen. I tried to recount my parents part of the story, but they listened without understanding very well what was so strange about two children trapped on an island who fall in love and grow together and have a child. As you may have guessed, I am referring to The Blue Lagoon (1949) that kept me bewitched and bewildered over the years (almost 50) and now I wonder full of anxiety and disgust of who or what prevented the film from being available. on cassette or DVD or whatever. I have spent my whole life seeking the opportunity to get a day and nobody knows anything about it. What a waste indeed! Sorry if my English is not technical or scientific, but my mother tongue is Spanish. I'm doing my best to make myself understood. Thank you, my name is Juan and I'm writing from Uruguay in S.America.
