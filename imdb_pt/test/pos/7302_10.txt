This movie is great at portraying the reality of sexual abuse. Daughters perfectly express their conflicting emotions of affection and betrayal. The on-site setting is absorbingly authentic, and the soundtrack is discreet but moving. This film is a postgraduate course in a reality that is very little recognized in American society. Personally, I'm terrified of the characters' names - Lange's character is Ginny Cook Smith - my name is Connie Cook Smith, and my mother is Genny Cook. The youngest daughter is Caroline Cook, who is my sister's name, and the father is Larry Cook, my cousin's name. But sexual abuse was not of our immediate family.
