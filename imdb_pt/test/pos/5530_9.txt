That was one of the lines of a trailer about this movie and for once the advertisers did not overdo it. All six featured players here are on screen 99% of the time, so they have to be good. <br /> <br /> It is always fascinating how certain assumptions can be worked out for serious highballing comedies. Mary Boland of the ditzy and Charlie Ruggles of the henpeck play their usual characters who plan to travel by car to California. To share expenses, they advertise for someone to share the ride. They get Burns and Allen and a dog monster. That same premise was deadly serious several generations later in Kalifornia. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you're traveling with Gracie Allen, you know you're going to be absolutely crazy trying to figure out Monty Pythonesco's reasoning. about the whole world. And if that is not enough, you may come across W.C. Campos, a part-time sheriff and full-time crook who is living in sin with Alison Skipworth. But we did not go into such things at that time. <br /> <br /> A real classic comedy from the thirties, not to be missed.
