Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, this story has all the suspense of a good book or film about the Cold War while a multinational group of foreigners tries to smuggle Jason Robards from Hungary to Austria. However, three things complement the story, making this an extremely good movie. <br /> <br /> First, the actors use the real languages ​​of their roles. Russian soldiers speak only Russian; the Hungarians only Hungarians; the Germans only German, except to the minimum extent to tell the story. As Debra Kerr is English, she speaks only English and, of course, Yul Brynner and a few others who are essential to the story also speak English with a strong accent. As a result, the public's empathy with travelers becomes paramount. The viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when he / she can not understand any of the languages ​​spoken around him. Very powerful feelings are awakened in the audience and, despite the heavy use of foreign languages, the audience never gets lost to accompany the film. No caption is required. <br /> <br /> Second. I was in Hungary in 1995, and I'm telling you, this movie is right. From gypsy music dominating the dinner meal to the underground caves in the buildings where much of the action takes place in the village scenes, the realism is incredible. If I did not eat at the actual movie restaurant, I would have eaten at its double. I thought I actually walked down Main Street in that village. (In fact, the film was filmed in Austria). <br /> <br /> Third, and more importantly, this film brings together Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner (after The King and I) and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is no less than Oscar-qualified. Of course, Yul already received an Oscar for playing this relationship, so Acadamy was not going to give him another one, but that's the quality of the movie. Do not miss this one.
