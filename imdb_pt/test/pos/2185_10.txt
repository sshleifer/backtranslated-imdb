George Hearn really was everything and above the top, which in this case was great. I heard Len Cariou's version, but it was very meek. George was great at this character - very expressive. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury was perfect for the role. She did a great job. She gave Mrs. Lovett a great fun and comical personality that balanced the dark story. <br /> <br /> I love black humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs, as well as her physical expressions and George's angry emotions. Hearn in his songs of anger, revenge and anguish. <br /> <br /> I've watched it 20 times since 1985 when I saw it on PBS. I bought it on video (after copying it in 1985) when it came out in 1990 and I definitely bought a copy of the DVD when it came out in 2004.
