Stephanie Meyer will be so annoyed! Now, his book "Breaking Dawn" will not be the first with that title. Sorry, Twilight fans. <br /> <br /> Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is the medical student Eve, who is assigned to interview the psychotic Don (James Haven - Angelina Jolie's brother). I suspected the turnaround, and when she discovered they both grew up in the same town, I was sure of that. <br /> <br /> She continued to delve deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that I felt there was a shared illusion going on. Sometimes she even acted as if she had PTSD. I really thought she was missing out on this. <br /> <br /> Well, she was not missing out, and when the end came, I was shocked. All my suspicion turned out to be wrong. The turnaround was even more surprising than I believed. <br /> <br /> Overton was fantastic and the story is much better than something that Stephanie Meyer would present. A must see.
