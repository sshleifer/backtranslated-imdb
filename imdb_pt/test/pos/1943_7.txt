I was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when I came across this movie. It was so clear about teenagers in the early '80s, and I called my mother "hahahaha, turn to the such and such channel, the boy totally looks like father was a child." <br /> <br /> A. Yes. It turns out this movie is about my dad and his friends. <br /> <br /> Even without being based on my father's childhood, I would say watch this movie! <br /> <br /> It's just ..... bizarre to say the least, apathy instilled in adolescence even at that time. This is a good "human interest" and shows some strange sides of the psyche.
