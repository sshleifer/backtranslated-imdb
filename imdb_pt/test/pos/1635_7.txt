Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbologist, Robert Langdon, in his first Angels & Demons adventure, which Hollywood decided to do after The Da Vinci Code, given the more controversial subject of the latter, reaching a critical point in the faith itself. The Catholic Church was on a war footing with the first film, but apparently indifferent to it. And it is not hard to understand why, considering that Ron Howard chose to do an action that serves as a great video about tourism in Rome and the Vatican City, and would likely increase the number of visitors given the many beautiful scenes on the site except for the St. Peter's Square and Basilica, which was a scale model used. <br /> <br /> So, I guess with most of the budget going toward sets, the cast had to be reduced proportionately. Ayelet Zurer attempted to enter the void left by female Audrey Tautou, but given the character of Tautou, then having much more participation in the film, the scientist Zurer Vittoria had much less to do than just wait on the wings to change some batteries in a bowl full of anti-matter. In the book, she is the forager, of course, for Langdon to discuss her vast knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati, and the great quarrel between the two, but here she has no love interest, nor her intellectual equal. Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, chews on every scene in which Camerlengo is Patrick McKenna, who is temporarily tending to the papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope. And he plays Patrick with that sparkle in his eyes, with nuances enough to let you know there's more to it than it seems. There are no surprises here for readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the film, as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks. The book itself is rich with indisputably accurate content, as always, and had far more views on science versus religion, and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and interwoven into a fictional piece of work. As I read the book a few years ago, I thought that if a movie were made of it, it would be easy to waste time and take more time on the action pieces. Unfortunately, that's what this Ron Howard movie did, with a tempo that does not allow for a temporary break. Unlike the first movie in which you had the characters sitting for a "discussion time" over a cup of tea, this changed things so quickly, it's like reading the book again, page after page being jumped just to get to the Os. Catholic critics have called Angels & Demons harmless because I think he has not bent over his many controversies, unlike the Da Vinci Code that hit a raw nerve in the center of the faith. And if anything, this movie served as a great promotional video of tourism with a good showcase of the many important tourist landmarks that would draw many around the world to go visit it. Of course, certain areas, such as the catacombs under St. Peter's Basilica, and the archives of the Vatican remain off limits, but the walk down the Path of Enlightenment, now almost free. <br /> Nothing new to those who have read the book other than seeing it live, but for those who have not, this movie may just compel you to pick up Dan Brown's novel just to read a little more about the importance of landmarks, and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini, who are inextricably linked to the plot, but much left unsaid. Popcorn entertainment satisfaction leaving you with nothing spectacular.
