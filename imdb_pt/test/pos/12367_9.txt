On a dark and gloomy New Year's Eve night, a sick nurse, her life slowly fading, demands that David Holm be introduced to her immediately. We still do not know who David Holm is, or why this nurse wants to see him, but his only wish is to talk to him just one more time. On the other side of town, nestled comfortably among the tombstones of the local cemetery, Holm (Victor Sjöström, who also directed) and two of his drunken associates happily await the arrival of the New Year. "Here we can only say when to drink the New Year," exclaims Holm, flipping a finger at the great clock tower that appears in the darkness. Little does he know, however, that he will not be alive to greet him. <br /> <br /> To pass the time, Holm cheerfully recites a ghost story. He had already had a friend named George, "a happy guy" who was "smarter than the rest of us." On a New Year's Eve several years ago, George broke a potentially disastrous fight, fearing that the last man to breathe his last breath before midnight was ordered to drive the ghost carriage for next year, fulfilling the orders of Death and collecting the souls. of the deceased. "And, gentlemen, George died on New Year's Eve!" Holm concludes happily, not bothering to contain his mocking skepticism of man's beliefs. <br /> <br /> As fate has, of course, an unexpected violent encounter results in Holm's death, only in the heat of midnight. As the transparent spirit of man rises carefully from his earthly body, he witnesses, to his horror, the distant approach of a ghostly chariot. The driver, a fragile hooded figure - a sickle clutched in his hand - descends from the carriage and approaches. We are surprised to discover that the driver is none other than a decrepit George, preparing to pass on his terrible duty to this year's successor. <br /> <br /> Considering the time when Körkarlen is made, the special effects in this film are absolutely superb. Director of photography Julius Jaenzon used double exposure photography to create the eerie, ghostly silhouette of the carriage and its damn driver. Even today, the end result is highly effective. One particularly striking scene involves the ghost carriage traveling to the bottom of the ocean to retrieve the soul of a drowned man. Another scene, strangely reminiscent of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) in Stanley Kubrick's The Illuminated, involves Holm knocking the kitchen door with an ax in order to reach his wife and children on the run. Originally sinister and unsettling in its execution, Victor Sjöström's "Körkarlen" is a beautiful work of cinema, successfully depicting Holm's constant alcoholic decline, his inevitable day of judgment, and a final hope of redemption.
