Many people give this movie a lot of crap, and all of this is really undeserved. People give this film a difficult time, either because it is such a sickly affair, or when they come across some technical aspect of the film that no one else watches when they watch it. If, just looking at the cover, you think this movie will make you uncomfortable ... DO NOT ASSIST! However, you'd be missing one of the best cinematic experiences of the late 90's, despite what anyone else might say. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider is wonderful here as Captain Howdy, the depths of insanity he dreams of playing this character has to be beyond words, and is much further than any of us would have to be willing to go The acting here is wonderful. The film itself beautifully filmed. The subject may be a little too much for many to swallow, but it's still well worth your time. If you have not seen this movie yet, check it out.
