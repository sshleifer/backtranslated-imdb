Probably grossly underestimated by all who have never experienced the hell of living under communist rule. Although, it seems hard to believe, everything happened, in fact, the reality was even worse than the movie. It resembles Orwellian fiction, but this is not fiction. John Hurt is excellent as always. Yes, the script is not full of action, but life is not. The plot is breathtaking. Yes, people were shot, yes, thousands of them. Their "crime" was that they wanted to leave communist "paradise" without government authorization. Sometimes the movie brings tears to your eyes. We need more movies like this to really appreciate what America provides us. Great movie, highly recommend! God bless our country, USA!
