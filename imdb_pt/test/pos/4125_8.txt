I saw this (video 2000) years ago and would love to see it on DVD. A good movie, but I would have loved it even more if it had included the legacy of The Beatles and The Hollies, etc. <br /> <br /> I also do not know exactly how true the story is - were some changes made to dramatize the story? <br /> <br /> I was only 3 when Buddy fell, and I did not wake up with his song until the late 70's. Much later, I discovered that our family moved into our new home - yes, 3 February 1959. <br /> <br /> Well, ehelhell little things you say and do ... Your songs will always be remembered - always ...
