It's probably a year since I've seen Uzak, but it has left strong memories of the two main characters, the photographer Mahmut and his naive cousin of the village of Yusuf. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie with very little dialogue and a pretty limited lot. This of course irritated a few viewers. But the film builds a picture so painfully believable of Mahmut and Yusuf that there is as much emotional tension as in the more peaceful thriller. Just to be clear, there is no upholstery in this movie - in the long pause where no one talks there, as much going on in the characters' emotions (and yours, observing them) as you could bear. See him awake and alert, and you will be seized and not anesthetized. <br /> <br /> Uzak sounds true in many ways, and that sincerity is probably its greatest accomplishment. People do not deal with events and problems as much as with each other. In fact, throughout the film, there is probably no point where the main characters (Mahmut, Yusuf and Mahmut's ex-wife Nazan) are not opposed. Much of this is true all over the world: country the expectation of cousin Yusuf, perhaps naive, that a job on a ship falls on his lap; The urbanized cynicism of Mahmut and the reluctance to sympathize with Yusuf. Other truths are more specific to Turkey: Yusuf's misunderstanding that Mahmut might be tolerating his staying with clenched teeth; Yusuf wandering between macho ambition and wide-eyed strangeness when he tries to meet a woman. <br /> <br /> Uzak is undoubtedly a very somber movie, and the strengths of a Ceylan is not to hit us in the head with the themes he explores. At least for me, I fully believed in the behavior of his characters. All the small failed attempts to connect and little cruelties sound so true. And yet, I did not come out with the message that "the world is like this," but instead I received "That's how sometimes we treat each other."
