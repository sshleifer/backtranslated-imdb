I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV ads, and to be honest, I did not know how much I'd like. I turned on the TV last night and was totally surprised. Driving Lessons is a modest and simple movie that attracts you from the beginning. Rupert Grint plays the role of the socially clumsy teenager Ben brilliantly. He is definitely one to look into the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple storyline and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. The highlight of the film, to me, was Evie's rather colorful poem. It shows how friendships can form among the most unlikely couples. In my opinion, watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours. The scenery was also impressive, especially the course. Anyone who can call this shimmering comedy something forgettable, I disagree
