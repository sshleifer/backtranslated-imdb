Courageous journalist Holly Hunter produces investigative reporting for a large news network. She is a maverick dissenter, dazzlingly good at her job and with little time for romantic relationships. Enter William Hurt and Albert Brooks, two men who vie for her love. <br /> <br /> Brooks is an old school journalist who adores Holly because she represents everything good about journalism. Both believe that the media exists to test the gods, educate the public and fight for the truth. Children of the sixties, they incorporate hippie values. They are advocates of the public good. Knights fighting valiantly with pen and camera. <br /> <br /> William Hurt, in contrast, is a much more complex character. Initially clumsy, clumsy and self-deprecating, he gradually reveals himself to be a great sexy and manipulative entrepreneur, skilled at climbing the corporate ladder. Unlike Holly and Brooks, he is a symbol of the values ​​of modern media: news as a show, journalism as entertainment, news anchor as celebrity, truth as a matter for the editorial board. We want to despise him and his junk food journalism, but we can not manage it. He is playing the game by his own rules. Do we condemn you for lack of a moral backbone? Did we condemn the game? Can the game exist if its rules are disobeyed? How did these rules evolve? <br /> <br /> This is not the "Network" of Lumet and Chayefsky, and so the film never bother to answer or raise these questions. Content to keep things at the level of light comedy, ends with Hurt being promoted to the London Division and Brooks being charged to a small community network. Holly, having rejected the two men, remains stuck between them. The last bastion of media integrity, this brave reporter remembers its roots, laments the loss of Brooks and is alert to be in the guard of the future William Hurts. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful ending, but compared to "Network" the film seems positively banal. Chayefsky's vision is one in which the global media, despite its omnipresence, offer less meaningful information. It provides a world in which globalization has homogenized cultures, information has become subject to corporatization and a handful of media monopolies control all international news. This is a world in which truth is subject to shareholder meetings and economic interests. A world in which ratings of viewers determine content and opinion polls dictate the main news. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's why "Broadcast News", which yearns for the glory days of journalism, ends with such a bittersweet note. You know what the future holds. Created in 1987, he has lived for at least a decade. <br /> <br /> But today, in the digital age, things are even worse. Mergers and acquisitions left a very small number of gigantic firms dominating the communications landscape. As a result, content hypermarketing, the barrier between the creative / editorial side and the commercial side, all collapsed. Today everyone can start their own blog or website, but these are basic subjects. As the individual's range of communication increases (due to technological progress - e-mail, internet, electricity, airmail, etc.), the size of the individual's world increases in the same way. He must project his voice further and higher, struggling futilely with that deafening white noise, the incessant verbal static that is the global community. <br /> <br /> So, in the final analysis, you need two things according to democratic theory. First of all, you need a rigorous coming of people in power and people who want to be in power, both in the private and public sectors. Secondly, you need a wide range of informed opinions on all the important issues of the day. In a democratic society, the media system as a whole must produce this kind of culture. Unfortunately, the structure we currently have in the global system works directly against the needs of democratic journalism and democratic society. <br /> <br /> 8/10 ?? This is a lightweight material, but a witty script, some funny moments and a little special participation by Jack Nicholson, elevate him above most other films about journalism. Curiously, unlike most movies about the media, she never plunges into satire and instead replicates things as a direct love triangle. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look.
