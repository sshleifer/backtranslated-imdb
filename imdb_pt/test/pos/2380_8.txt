Monster of Mexico I agree is the weakest of the modern films of Scooby Doo, mainly because of the weak plot and how everything was predictable. Loch Ness's monster however is a considerable improvement, with lovely animation, honestly Scotland looked beautiful. The music is good and the plot is well thought out. In addition, there are some great dialogues, and the dubbing was fabulous, with Casey Kasem a consistent delight as Shaggy, and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheena Easten a pleasant surprise in a guest role. In fact, my only complaints were some strange accents on one or two members of the voice cast, except for Easten whose accent sounded genuine, and somehow the Loch Ness Monster was not as well designed as it had the potential to be. Overall, a Scooby Doo movie solid and enjoyable. 8/10 Bethany Cox
