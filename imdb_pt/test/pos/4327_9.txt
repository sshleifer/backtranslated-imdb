What's the point of these messages, if not discussing and sharing thoughts about the next season ... Here's my prediction: 1. The hatch was actually blown up, but somehow all inside survived. Buts lets see that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on the boat Desmonds by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island has been lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they will send a rescue mission. 3. After the hatch is destroyed, the island is no longer isolated, and other ships / planes will arrive. 4. The others will finally share your secret with us. Poor observers <br /> <br /> has actually confirmed that there will be 4 seasons of LOST? <br /> <br /> Cheers Mike
