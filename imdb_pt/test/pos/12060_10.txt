I realized that a lot of people commented on the nature of this show being racist and homophobic, but I do not feel like that's what the show is about. <br /> <br /> The show is about parents who were not kid-ready and now are not ready for teenagers. This program helps to bring humor to a very difficult subject that is sometimes neglected: parenthood. <br /> <br /> Yes, we all had programs that had families, for example: Family Matters, Step by Step, Family Ties, Full House .... but it would always have the same old recipe for your episodes. "Steph" leaves school and gets caught by her father. They have a heart-to-heart conversation and music is played and ended on a two-week basis that after a "aww, dad ..." gets a smile and the show is over. Where is the comedy in such a situation? Where is realism? With war at home, you get real situations from a real father-type figure. Most parents who watch this show hear some of the phrases parents put in and they either laugh (because they know they said it!) Or nod their heads (because they know they thought about it and never had the courage to tell it!) The War at Home has situations that bring a great comedy as a father thinking that his son is gay. It does not seem funny, most people think it makes the father homophobic, but the comedy comes from the clumsy father trying to talk to his son to open up. What parent knows the right thing to say, especially in a situation like this? I highly recommend this show to anyone I know who has a sense of humor, and especially for those who are a young parent or who were young when they had kids. You relate to a program like that when you are too.
