Set in 1962 Hong Kong (in turbulent times, as we are told), this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between two married people linked to their traditions can remember the essence of old Hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors, evocative yet restrained sensuality (as opposed to necessary sexuality and occasional nudity scenes that became part of the norm of a movie novel), and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication. It is not difficult to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here as she is known for minimalism in narrative as well as describes powerful drama using the art of verbal and nonverbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of - scenes that could eventually take place in the characters' lives. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE, his pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the tight quarters of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) to the last scenes that explain the intensity of lament that he feels as he remembers the opportunity that was missed in reaffirming this relationship. The plot still resembles something Duras could have written: Mr. Chow and Mrs. Su Li-zhen, neighbors in a While both are successful professionals, they begin to discover in the most banal manner that their spouses are betraying them, and find out naturally, it is with each other. The point is, should they act according to what they feel for each other or not be like their partners? Each scene plays with the notion that at any point they will yield to each other, and at one point, it is suggested that eventually they make it as intrusive as the camera in detailing their encounters (which seem to occur in a daily, as seen by the frequent changes of Cheung's dresses), we never see him. And just as not seeing any of their spouses increasing their own love story, not seeing them continue with their attraction makes the eventual separation even more bitter, because every moment we want something to happen - a catalyst - and the only one that comes is when Leung reveals to her that he loves her, followed by his brutally silent revelation that she will never leave her husband, which implies that he will not either. It also gives us a glimpse of what culture and time can do: from the western point of view, a consummation of his novel in a more solid and enduring case would have been possible especially in the 1960s, but as Hong Kong is, cultural values are markedly different. Presentations here are of a high order: it is very easy to play a torrid love affair but to continue playing a repressed and platonic relationship that is full of just barely suggested desire is difficult and makes all sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual. Cheung and Leung burned and their ruined chemistry lasted long after the credits were released.
