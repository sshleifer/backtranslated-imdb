(Some Spoilers) It took about 19 years for Bruce Campbell to finally put his masterpiece "Man with the Screaming Brain" on screen. But Campbell had to change his story by having her, due to financial problems, take place in Sofia, Bulgaria, not where he initially wanted it to be filmed in Los Angeles, California. <br /> <br /> In the film, Burce Campbell plays USA. tycoon Willian Cole, who travels along with his spoiled wife Jackie, Antoinette Byron, to the former Communist Republic of Bulgaria. It is there that William wants to help finance the almost non-existent mass transport system of Bulgaria. <br /> <br /> It is a misfortune for William to get involved with the gypsy woman Tatoya, Tamara Gorski and his ex-boyfriend Yegor, Valdimir Kolev. , a former KGB taxi driver. The two, William and Yegor, will end up unwittingly breaking their brains, inside William's skull, because of Tatoya's jealousy and revenge. <br /> <br /> After Tatoya murder both William and Yegor their bodies are delivered to mad scientist Dr. Ivan Ivanowitch Ivanov, Stacy Keach, by his loyal assistant Pavel, Ted Raimi, to have their brains tried. Dr. Ivanov has this theory in which two heads are better than one. And now, with the material, William & Yegor, available to him, Dr. Ivanov will finally prove it. What Dr. Ivanov will discover with sadness is that by merging the two heads or brains, their brain waves overlap and cause them not only to break down, but to turn against each other! <br /> <br /> William with Yegor's right wolf cast into his damaged brain is out to find Tatoya and make her pay for the damage she has done to him and Yegor. Yegor, in turn, is trapped in the head of William, who likes and dislikes, both in food and drink, are totally opposed to yours. This causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains in them fighting for control of William's body! Things get even more complicated when Jackie discovers that Tatoya murdered her husband William confronting her in the dangerous and the high crime section of Bravoda call Gypsy Town and ends up being assassinated. Brought back to Dr. Ivanov by his assistant Pavel, he is determined, with no available body, to plant Jackie's brain inside an experimental robot in which Pavel is working. The operation is an exciting success, but the only downside is that Jackie, with his brain inside the robot, needs to have his brain recharged every few hours! Or, like a real brain without oxygen, it will die along with the robot's batteries. <br /> <br /> Combination of the ball comedy and horror film of 1930 with both William & Yegor transforming the Bulgarian city of Bravoda upside down in an attempt to find Tatoya and make her pay with her life for the sad state of existence in which she placed the two. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** It's Dr. Ivanov who actually saves the day by figuring out how to prevent both brains from fighting and thus cooperate with each other! This is done by him instead of fusing the brains. Dr. Ivanov keeps them independent by implanting a neutralizing cell wall between the two noncooperative globes of gray matter.
