Well, let me put it this way - I've always been one of the "hardcore brothers"; I've always loved rock, and especially heavy metal !! That's why this movie is like a gift from God! I believe this movie is one of the best movies of all time (well, except for Neverending Story and Star Wars, of course ...). It's great to hear all the classics such as "Live Rock and Roll" (DIO), "Stranglehold" (Ted Nugent), songs by Jon Bon Jovie, Deep Purple, AC / DC, Zakk Wylde and several other legendary rock bands. Absolutely beautiful! WONDERFUL! I hope they make more movies like this (otherwise it's just bad movies like "AC in the USA" or whatever they call it, and "8 miles." Bulls ***!) Well, I strongly recommend this anyway! All I miss is a couple of Stratovarius songs! But except for that, it's one of the best movies ever! Ten in ten!
