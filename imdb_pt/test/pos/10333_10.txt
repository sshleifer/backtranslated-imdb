This movie was one of the best I've ever seen. The other day I remembered this movie for something on TV. It came back to me like a flooding dam. I've never been touched by a movie more than by this one. After the movie ended I really could not stop crying for about two hours. No movie has ever moved me this way before. I was 15 at the time of the movie and have not seen him since, but I'm hoping I can find a copy to buy so I can watch whenever I want. If anyone suggests you watch this movie with them, GO .... you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Peggy Fries
