In a really interesting twist on Hitchcock, Larry (Billy Crystal) and Owen (Danny DeVito) lead unpleasant lives: Larry's ex-wife has grown up publishing a book he wrote, and Owen has the most arrogant mother imaginable. When Larry tells Owen to calm down by watching "Strangers on a Train," Owen has the idea that they should do cross-killing as in the movie. And just like in the movie, Larry thinks it's a joke, but Owen is serious. <br /> <br /> How the idea of ​​"Throw Momma from the Train" came about I'll never know, but it's a hilarious movie. There is not a moment of boredom in it. And that ending was a joke. Crystal and DeVito are at their best, and Anne Ramsey is as witch here as in "The Goonies." A modern classic.
