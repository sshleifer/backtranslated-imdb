Ben (an excellent Charles Bateman), his young daughter K.T. (a cute Geri Reischl), and his new girlfriend Nicky (the extremely attractive Ahna Capri) are on their way to a birthday party for K.T. They are unexpectedly attacked in a remote southern city where no one is able to leave, and with the exception of Ben, K.T. and Nicky, no one can come in. To top it all, the kids are disappearing and the adults are being murdered at an alarming rate. Ben helps some of the locals - Sheriff Pete (LQ Jones), Tobey (Alvy Moore) and Jack (Charles Robinson), the local priest, try to solve the mystery. <br /> <br /> Themed horror film actually predates "The Exorcist," and combines a "Bad Day in Black Rock" plot of a rural town with a large skeleton in its closet with horror elements to interesting results. In fact, he sent some shivers down the spine of this sight as she inexorably moves along his sinister path. The melancholy and solemn atmosphere is established quickly and lasts for the duration; the growing sense of panic gives a real kick. Some unforgettable parts include the bizarre opening of a toy tank turning into a real car and smashing a car, not to mention Nicky's contorted nightmare, vividly and elegantly realized by director Bernard McEveety and the team. The music of Jaime Mendoza-Navas is subtly sinister and gives her an extra sense of eeriness. <br /> <br /> The firm and professional cast does a good job, especially the ever-involving Strother Martin as the affable Doc Duncan, and producers / actors LQ Jones and Alvy Moore. <br /> <br /> Just the fact that the whole plot is right under the noses of our heroes makes it much more scary. Jack, the priest, begins to guide them in the right direction, but will they be in time to put an end to things? It's a nice little refrigerator that's worth visiting again; just speaking for me, I could appreciate it a lot more after giving a second chance. I can say now that yes, it is really underestimated, telling a good story in an interesting, unconventional and effective way. <br /> <br /> 8/10
