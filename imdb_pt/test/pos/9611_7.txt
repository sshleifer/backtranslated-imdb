Crimson begins with a cool and jazzy song, so I liked it right away, but as the movie went on I started to wonder if music was not the best part. We have some thieves pulling out a jewel theft and when someone does something wrong the alarm goes off and the cops chase after them and when the car turns in a road block one of the thieves (Paul Nash, Jacinto Molina, whoever is here ) shot. Now, it looks like he might die, but with the help of a drunken doctor and his crazy scientist friend (and wife) he is saved, with a part of the brain of a nightclub owner called "The Sadist." The sadist is unhappy as the lords who have kidnapped him have lost their knives to remove the head, so to add insult to injury (or, in this case, death), they take the head off using a train, leaving the body to the authorities find, opa. Once the brain transplant is complete, Naschy wants to devastate any woman who approaches him, because he now has the mentality of his giver. Well, of course all this is quite unlikely and has medical equipment that seems to have been bought on Radio Shack, and overall it's quite tacky and scumbag. But, it has a good start from the 70's and the music is cool. This is not so much a horror movie but more a thriller with lots of thugs fighting over lawns and babies and other thug-type things, but it's strangely fun in ways I can not begin to describe. 7 out of 10.
