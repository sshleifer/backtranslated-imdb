Hitchcock has made at least 11 films about the common man, unjustly accused, on the run (sometimes actually running, sometimes not) to prove his innocence in a situation outside his control, being the first "The 39 Steps", which really made him popular in Britain. It's really your signature theme. <br /> <br /> Others include "Young and Innocent", "Saboteur", "Enchanted", "Frontier stupor", "Strangers on a Train", "I Confess", "For Catch a Thief" The Wrong Man, "" North by Northwest, "and finally" Frenzy. " "Saboteur" begins Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, a worker at an aircraft factory during the war, accused of murdering his co-worker and his best friend during an act of sabotage at the factory. He meets model Patricia Martin, played by actress Priscilla Lane during her law enforcement, and then, of course, the various Nazi / Fascist sympathizers along the way. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is mainly like "The 39 Steps", including including similar plot devices such as handcuffs, the blonde who does not trust the main character at the beginning, a race through the country (in one case, London to Scotland, and the other California to New York), and meet the "colorful" locals along the way. And so, just like "The Man Who Knew Too Much," I believe this is an American remake of one of Hitchcock's earlier works. <br /> <br /> I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he seems very ordinary American, a sort of "common man" with whom the public can identify. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is more involved in the action than Madeline Carroll in "The 39 Steps" and Ruth Roman in "Strangers on a Train." As mentioned elsewhere, Otto Kruger steals the show as the villain. I also enjoyed Vaughan Glaser's performance as a blind guy; Your lines are great. There are some hilarious touches along the way for some comic relief, such as traffic signs featuring the character of Priscilla Lane in them, and circus performers, and truck driver Murray Alper. Unlike other reviews here, there are not many characters who believe in Barry Kane's innocence right away. <br /> <br /> There are some slow parts, especially when the move shifts to New York, but it happens quickly when the last planned act of the fifth columnists is in progress. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite Hitchcock movies (I put it in my top 5), especially in these days of the new war on terror. I think it comes home. <br /> <br /> It makes you think, "Could my co-worker be involved in something bad?" In fact, one of the posters in the movie "Saboteur" proclaimed "Watch out for the man behind your back!" Imagine how this happened in the minds of adults during World War II.
