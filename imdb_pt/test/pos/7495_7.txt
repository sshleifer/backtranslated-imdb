'Thursday' is a good movie, but we recognize a lot of other films in its genre and so lack originality. If you've seen 'Goodfellas', 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and a lot of other films that were inspired by the latter, you've seen almost every part of 'Thursday'. There is a scene involving torture that has the same dialogue as Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. <br /> <br /> Still, it's a good movie. Because not every part is drawn from the same movie, the whole thing has some new ideas and some nice touches. The opening sequence, to begin with, is quite impressive. We meet Nick (Aaron Eckhart), Dallas (Paulina Porizkova) and Billy Hill (James Le Gros). They enter into a fight with an employee at a gas station in a cup of coffee and end with the death of that clerk and the arrival of a police officer. We already glimpsed a suitcase with lots of money. <br /> <br /> So we found Casey (Thomas Jane) in Houston. He is married to Christine (Paula Marshall), but used to work with Nick. She does not know anything. So Nick calls him and says he's coming. We learn that he has screwed up his friends and the problems are about to begin. <br /> <br /> What happens exactly is not for me to reveal, but we find some other characters, all interested in money or drugs Nick also had with him. Many funny moments, lots of blood, a very funny sub-plot involving actor Michael Jeter and a few surprises (although if you really think about it, you'll see them coming). This is a good movie with some very good performances, well directed by Skip Woods.
