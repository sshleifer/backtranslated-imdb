Remember - before there was Sidney, there was Dudley. Dudley Digges is little remembered today - because its pinnacle as an accessory in sound films was the late 1920s and the 1930s. Except for one major performance: the ship's good humor, if is a drunken doctor in 1935, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, most of his films are barely revived. More is worth it because he was a wonderful actor. In 1931, he played Casper Gutman (the original actor to play the villain) alongside Ricardo Cortez's Sam Spade in the first THE MALTESE FALCON. Likewise, about the same time, he played the recording angel in Leslie Howard's version of OUTLOW BOUND - the same role that Sidney Greenstreet covered in Between Two Worlds a decade later. <br /> <br /> Digges could be nice and amiable (that ship's doctor again), or detestable (in CHINA SEAS, as the First-Mate judge mocking poor Lewis Stone, but then proving that he is a great coward in a moment of crisis). He held onto Paul Robeson in THE EMPEROR JONES. He is the Chinese freedom fighter who works with Gary Cooper on The General Dieed Dawn. Digges could do anything. <br /> <br /> Here he is Mr. Thompson, the hypocritical director and thief of a reform school that Frankie Darro and his friends are sent to commit an assault and injure a Greco-American store owner (it is the last incident for most of them). Digges is as bad here as in China Beas, but it's a thing close to not fully enjoying it. He is able to somehow transcend his roles ... later on. <br /> <br /> Darro has a gang of urban delinquents (including a Jewish boy and "Farina" from "OUR GANG"). As pointed out in another review, it is a prototype of the Bowery Boys. We see them shaking car owners to pay them to "watch and protect" their cars. When a guy does not do that, they quietly calm his car. Theft and robbery in the Greek-American store is also shown graphically - his skull fractured when pushed. <br /> <br /> The boys are reunited and judged by the stern and decent judge Arthur Byron, who realizes that he can not leave the children with his parents: the parents can not see them or they are incompetent. Unfortunately, there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence: a Jewish father who is more concerned about his business than his son, the stereotype "Yassum", Farina's father, and the Italian father whose willingness to cooperate makes his son come out of retirement. school. <br /> <br /> Once there the boys find the regime oppressive. Occasionally, one of the guards or the nurse (Madge Evans) tries to speak for them. But Digges does not have time to pamper. He is a regime determined to break the boys so that they behave. Unfortunately, Digges and his accounting partner are greedy. They have served inferior food to the boys and pocketing the profit. <br /> <br /> One day, a new officer comes from the state to examine the reform school. It's Jimmy Cagney, who is an infirm hackeiro whose gang got the vote for Edward Maxwell. As a reward (he did not get the position of Park Commissioner), Cagney was appointed inspector of the school. He is supported by his friend Hook and factotum Allan Jenkins (in his first Warner Brother film). The irony is that if Digges were a little more careful, Cagney would probably have let him keep running things. But Cagney arrives to see Darro taken to Digges to fight. The director and Darrow have had problems with respect earlier, and Digges now purports to punish Darro, who runs away - but is seriously injured by Digges' barbed-wire fences and his use free of a whip. Cagney stops Digges and lets Evans handle Darro's wounds. And she explains the reality of the situation to Cagney, and her own idea of ​​real reform of the boys, building trust in them with responsibility. <br /> <br /> The film follows this to the end, showing that Cagney and Evans are on the right path, turning the reformatory into a "republic" for the boys to run properly. This leads to a conflict with Digges, whose profit is reduced because he is no longer receiving supplies. But the scheme is derailed when Cagney himself thinks he may be in serious trouble with the law. Digges sees his opportunity and accepts it fully. But then he goes too far ... much more than he ever negotiated. <br /> <br /> The 1930s had many movies showing children taking steps to correct mistakes and change things. Darro appeared in WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD. Cecil B. De Mille did this day and age, where children teach a lesson to a gangster played by Charles Bickford who scares the hell out of it. Then it was in the 1930s. The HELL MAYOR arrives at a similar intensity of revenge and quest for juvenile justice. But that's the only problem with the movie. Digges's character is a scoundrel and hypocrite, so we never bent on him, but if he was not a thief we could agree to his vision (even if it is counterproductive). The scenes at the beginning of Darro and his gang preying on people actually make the roughness that Digges would still seem quite understandable (even if their thieves are not). In addition, he has a time when he is justifiably angry with Cagney - at that point, hiding from his own confrontation with the law - giving orders from a long distance phone to a messy Digges. When Digges discovers what really happened, he is justifiably furious with Cagney, telling him about proper behavior. It's the closest thing to making Mr. Thompson sympathetic to this great movie.
