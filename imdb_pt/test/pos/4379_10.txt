This movie was soooo good! It was hilarious! There are so many jokes that you can watch the movie without stopping and not get bored of it. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were awesome like Pete Hogwallop and Delmar! I love these guys! I also love the adventures they did. I definitely recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the music in this movie is great! I love to sing along with all the songs!
