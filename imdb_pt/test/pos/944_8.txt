My mother Frank starts out as a warm and loving comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, nicknamed Francis, played by Sinead Cusack) who shakes off the lull by enrolling as a student at her son's university. Most of his friends and family are horrified, not least, his son (Matthew Newton), who is busy falling in love with his best friend's girlfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile, Frank raised the ire of his disapproving English teacher (Sam Neill). <br /> <br /> Matthew Newton is totally disarmed like David; relaxed and natural on paper, even when the character is tense. It generates valuable goodwill, guiding the audience through some of the movie's most complicated and broad comedy moments. Not long after halfway, first-time director and screenwriter Mark Lamprell cleverly drives his film into darker emotional territory and gives Cusack a real chance to shine. The supporting cast is full of welcoming faces (Lynette Curran, Sacha Horler, Nicholas Bishop) and all directors (including a more lively than usual Sam Neill) are excellent. While snaking a little to the end, My Mother Frank offers more than she promises and is a genuine favorite for the Australian public.
