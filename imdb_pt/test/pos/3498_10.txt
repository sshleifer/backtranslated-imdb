I do not see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor. You need to get your head off your tight ass if you do not find this movie hilarious! If this is not your "cup of tea," so to speak, then look at what it really is - a very funny movie. Maybe they got ready to make another drug / T & A film, but in this case, they really hit the spot. It's especially funny to Ali G fans because he delivers everything we love and we expect from him. Then I say GREAT UPS to Ali G, and if it's not your thing, do not regret it-BATTY BOY!
