When I watched this movie for the first time, I thought it was a very strange movie. But I know the director almost always has a purpose when making a movie. So I decided to watch it one more time. The second time I watched, I realized that Albert Puyn is a very talented and very original filmmaker. At first, the viewer was informed that the film occurred a decade after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. But they had clothes and cars with a typical 50's design. They had plutonium I think is a symbol for futuristic trade. I guess this means that the actual movie time is not specified. The song in the film is creating a long video clip that tells some parts of the real story in the lyrics, especially for the introduction and the end. Albert Puyn is wearing the color red and blue when he is showing the symbols of communism (red) and capitalism and the western world (blue). It may be noted that Ice-T, has the name Mao (communism) and that when it is in focus the background color is red. The American cop, starring Burt Reynolds, is always filmed with the blue color of his back. The club where Mao and his gang meet are also red. Crazy Six is ​​hanging between red and blue. <br /> <br /> The white puppy Mao had at first symbolizes, I think, the controlling force. Mao had the dog in the beginning, but the police caught him at the end. This symbolizes, I think, the fall of communism and the replacement of the capitalist way of thinking of the Western world in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I think Crazy Six is ​​a very well done film. Albert Puyn creates a science fiction / action film with political depth. It's a different but very special film about communism in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing another spectacular film by Albert Puyn.
