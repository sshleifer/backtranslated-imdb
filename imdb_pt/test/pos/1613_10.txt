The longest period of cinema began in post-war Europe with the neo-realist movement of Italy. Over the next 2 or 3 decades that followed, the New Wavers of France caught everyone's attention, and there was always Bergman up there on his desolate Scandinavian island somewhere, making bitter masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti geographically approached the art form with his miraculous work * Death in Venice *, which could also be called * The Death of European Cinema *. After the extinction of the 60s, the great European filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, generally became exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This film seems a grand summary, not only of Visconti's particular obsessions, but of the general attempt by European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal of films. And rest assured, you will not find a more severe taskmaster than the Visconti revealed here. He's not ringing for the crowd, folks: either you stand behind him and follow, or stay behind. Rhythm is a challenge: slow but never without emotional weight. "Incidents" are few and far between, but each of them seems charged with symbolic meaning in a lush cosmos. <br /> <br /> We'll probably never be in such a refined company in terms of films: one of the great writers of the century who inspired the tale (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers who directed it (Visconti), a (Dirk Bogarde), and swelling almost incessantly into the background, Gustav Mahler's 5th Symphony. Taking advantage of Mahler's ability to inspire romanticism even in the more cynical bosom, Visconti transforms the main character, Aschenbach, into a decrepit composer of his original persona as a writer, even making Bogarde look like Mahler (nerd mustache, glasses, hair disheveled, duck walking). Bogarde, by the way, offers what is probably the best performance an actor has in film history: it's a largely silent performance, and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a look - a trick difficult without assault like Chaplin or simply acting like an animated corpse. <br /> <br /> Cinema simply does not get any better than this. I will ignore the claims of the Ritalin junkies who say it is very slow but even the most legitimate complaint about some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is wrong. Flashbacks fit perfectly into the thematic concerns of the film (ie, what is the best path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), And the sudden and strident interruptions serve to avoid drowsiness among viewers. (Of course, some moviegoers will sleep in that movie, anyway.) An uninterrupted flow of Mahler and Venice, beautiful and agonizing, would be nothing more than a beautiful image; but this movie is about something. And what matters most is suffering: romantic suffering (capital R), in particular. Like romantic suffering, Visconti knew what he was talking about. <br /> [SPOILER. . . I think] If for nothing else, see * Death in Venice * for his portentous opening credits. . . and for his unforgettable finale, with Bogarde's black hair dripping from his sweaty, dying head to his chalk-white face. Meanwhile, in the distance, the young Tadzio, object of the agonizing desire of Bogarde, stays in the ocean and points to the horizon like a sculpture of Michelangelo. The climatic sequence boils down to the agonizing economy, everything the film deals with: love, lust, beauty, loss, the end of one's life against the beginning of another life, and cold death amid the warm, sunny beauty. Death in Venice is a miracle work of art. <br /> <br /> [DVD Hint: As with Visconti's masterpiece simultaneously released The Damned, I recommend that you turn on English subtitles while watching this movie. It's ostensibly in English, but the sound of the DVD seems noisy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the movie, anyway.] <br /> <br />
