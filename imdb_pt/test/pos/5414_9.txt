This movie is full of little surprises, many of them funny. The fact that it was written and directed by a 24-year-old girl surprises me. Some of the scenes in which high school kids are using ecstasy have made me very uncomfortable because I have a child of that age and I could imagine using it. As the father of a teenager, I found that the representations of parent-child interactions were accurate. <br /> I liked the many jokes in the movie and I liked the fact that not everything made sense and not all issues were solved until the end. To paraphrase Mark Twain, truth is stranger than fiction, because fiction is forced to stick to what is possible, while truth is not. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that touches the viewer, allowing us to believe that people are what other people think they are, only to later realize that the people we assumed were right completely ignored the situation real. One of the strongest scenes in the film, a scene about which we feel very relieved and supportive of what the character is doing, turns out to be based on a completely wrong guess, and the character, though admirable, is totally wrong. It's very subtly done, I guess. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> I really liked the score - I thought it really helped the movie, I really helped set the mood - the movie has some bad times, and the background music helps set it up. The speaker's speech is a joke and a half - she gave a great laugh! The movie's really in my head right now - I saw it this morning. I will try to see it again, time permitting. Dozens are hard to find, but a solid nine in my book.
