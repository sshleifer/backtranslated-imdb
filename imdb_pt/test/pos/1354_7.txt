If Sicily is a Baroque territory, with its doubling of perspective, this is part of the film's challenge to realism. And it's an exuberant pleasure here, beating Fellini with not one, but three film directors, of course, the actual Bellocchio, who made some really good films and should not be sensitive about his honor. There are a variety of takes and improvisations in Manzoni's "I promessi sposi" with, somewhere, the royal wedding. Sicily is also considered a territory of cheats (You already know this version of the island, so there is no spoiler involved), a comic version that makes the image worthwhile for the work of Sergio Castellito with guard dogs on the floor of the great hall of a palazzo.
