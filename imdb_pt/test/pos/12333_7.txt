As part of an initiation play, Julie (Meg Tilly of Psycho 2) has to spend the night in a mausoleum, but Karl Rhamarevich, a master of telekinesis, died recently and was put there. When the brotherhoods of Julie's brotherhood profane where he harbored the real terror begins. <br /> <br /> This little movie had a good dose of atmosphere and I liked the buildup, and the last twenty minutes are just great. Anyone who is looking for a lost jewelry from an 80's horror movie need look no further. Highly understated. Also, Elizabeth Daily is adorable. <br /> <br /> My Note: B <br /> <br /> Extras of Media Blaster DVD: Disc 1) Comments to director Tom McLoughlin and co-writer Michael Hawes; and trailers for "Being", "Bloody Frankestien Terror", "Before Dawn" and "Devil's Disc" 2) Cut of the alternative director (which is almost impossible to see due to a bad impression) & backstage feature
