I will not talk about it, but I will summarize it. basically for those who do not know how the prue really died ........... the first time the demonic killer comes beating piper and prue with a ball of energy they fly through the wall of blood all over. Phoebe, the third sister, goes down the stairs, says the spell that sends him away, but not defeated. (NEEDS THE POWER OF THREE) Leo heals them both and so on. they get exposed along the line and the only way to save the data is for a demon named tempus to go back in time. the only way he can do is that Phoebe stays in the underworld. she agrees, tempus back in time. Now, around 7:00 in the morning again. Demon comes pipers and prue with ball of energy. They fly through the wall again. but this time Phoebe is not there to speak the spell to ward off the demon. demon kills doctor. doctor flies out the window. he is dead. demon goes on a thing of kind of spinning wing and glass on the doors break which is a great effect goodbye the way and there is airy sound. is where it ends. NOW .......... what the whole world does not know if they did not pay attention to the next episode. Although what I am about to say was not shown what happens trust me ................ because this time there was no phoebe to call Leo this time he arrives later. Piper survives because her injuries are not as fatal as those of Prue and Leo cure her before Prue, so by then, the prue is already dead. There is mystery solved. ps asking for prue with a spell should have worked !!! and she should have made a surprise appearance in the last episode of all.
