I saw the 1973 Lost Horizons movie and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree that the move has had many opportunities for improvement, but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best performances, I was looking for something a little different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic, but as a person looking for a little hope, a little joy, a little relief from my everyday life, and that's what I got. You may be critical in interpreting singing and dialogue, but it is not what I look for when I go to the movies. I seek a little relief from my daily life, a little time in which I can sit down and imagine a better life where people love each other and help each other. It's a shame we can not enjoy a movie by what he tells us and we stop by as an English teacher reading a fifth grade essay. This may be too simplistic, but in fact, it would not be legal.
