I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in September 2000 at the international film festival 'seaside movies' in vlissingen, Holland. This impressed me so much that I kept smiling all day after I first watched and almost all night again when I took the film as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would be a girl in love with a novel star. But what I saw was so much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock and renée zellweger. A strange blend of romance, violence and roadmovie. And for everyone, a story that takes other directions every time you think you're on the track. Many novel lovers will love 'nurse betty' - the movie as well as the character! - but they can bring all friends who are not soap, because they will enjoy the story even more for the harsh and humorous lines - freeman and rock - for the cruel scenes, the suspense aspects and for the beautiful photos. And I'm sure in the end everyone will love 'nurse betty' for their captivating and innocent charm !!!
