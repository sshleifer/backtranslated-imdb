This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Top 20 of my life. I've laughed more than I've since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and I've cried more than I've since seen The Notebook. If you are looking for a moving movie without the sappy edge ... this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you will not regret it. I was reluctant at first and only watched because I had to do a school project about speech impairments. But this movie is much more than that. It's about life, free and independent of the way the world wants you to keep. It is about the shortcomings that each of us has that prevent us from seeing ourselves and what we miss, but letting everything else get in the way.
