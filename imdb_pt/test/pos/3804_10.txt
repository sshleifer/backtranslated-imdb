The first time I saw this movie, I thought "what the heck?" a 10 year old boy driving through bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! That's right! I really liked this movie! <br /> <br /> Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a pity he stopped acting. He plays his character Gus very well in the film. <br /> <br /> Gus loses an eye, has tattoos and goes to the strangest cities acting with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! I want more? <br /> <br /> OK, do not even try to understand the story, but why does this movie need one? Just open your mind and let Gus take you on this journey. <br /> <br /> "Motorama Gus, you have won Motorama"
