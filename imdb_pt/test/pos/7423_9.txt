One of the most unfairly defamed shows of all time, 'Terry & June' was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the '70s and' 80s. It began life as 'Happy Ever After', but when Eric Merriman decided that she did not want to write anymore, changed to that, hence the fall of "Aunt Lucy" and Fletcher's becoming Medford's. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was cozy, homely, middle class; the plots contained the range of clich√©s of the chief arriving for dinner, the vicar organizing a liquidation, and unwanted relatives coming in for the weekend. It certainly was not "terrible lazy comedy". As for being "not smart," it was not meant to be. It was funny and well executed, and that was enough! <br /> <br /> I also loved the 'alternative' boom of the '80s (' Spitting Image ',' Black Adder ',' The Young Ones' etc.), but I also liked conventional things like that. If nothing else, provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative. I found it sad when the likes of Ben Elton took against it and Benny Hill. Well, the family-oriented comedy has disappeared from our screens, but where did it leave us? Take a look at the last hours of the TV. All the soaps and slags of reality. The few remaining comedies are meant for teens, which means they are full of profanity, jokes about bodily functions, and explicit sexual references. And they're not funny either. <br /> <br /> The boom of 'alternative comedy' was good in many ways, but it had a dark side. This made conventional sitcoms look old-fashioned, turned away talented writers and artists like Spike Milligan, and eventually led to an unspeakable speech like "Little Britain" and "Tittybangbang" (heaven help us). If it is not broke, do not fix it!
