The Syndrome of China is a perfectly rhythmic thriller and not slow or boring, as some people say. The transitions from one scene to another are great and the tension built into the film will keep you on the tip of your seat for the entire two hours. Jack Lemmon is great, as always, when the nervous operator of the plant and Jane Fonda manage to bring back some real emotions to the story. You can see this movie as a political statement of the time, or just as an intelligent thriller. Either way it's worth watching.
