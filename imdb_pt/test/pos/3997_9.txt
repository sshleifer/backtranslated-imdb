I'm not sure why the other review about this movie was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am an Asian art student with a special love for Korean art, culture and history. I found this film a very controversial and interesting character for life. Jang Seung-up is one of (perhaps the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the tumult of the time when he painted and his own conflicting nature, it is incredible that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill. This film honors his talent while directly observing his erratic and somewhat self-destructive personality. The cinematography in MY opinion was beautiful, many of the panoramic photos looked like paintings of Korean landscapes (which I found a beautiful concept rather than "overly artistic") and I think Choi Min-sik portrayed Jang Seun-up with a necessary intensity and unpredictability. I highly recommend this movie for art lovers and movie lovers.
