This is really a brilliant movie. The story is grotesque, but the actors are brilliant. Especially the performance of Mads Mikkelsen as Svend, is magnificent. It's a simple story about two guys willing to do it on their own, but it unfolds into a strange and absurd story, with many people accidentally being killed and served as steaks of chicken. If only more people understood the Danish ... This could be a good candidate for an English version. Also worth mentioning is Ole Thestrup, who always delivers that extra touch to the plot with his slightly crazy Holger character. I can only recommend this film to the Danish public. Also take a look at Adams Ã†bler (2005), a film by Anders Thomas Jensen, also with Mads Mikkelsen accompanied by a well playing Ulrich Thomsen.
