Tipping the Velvet (2002) (TV) was directed by Geoffrey Sax for BBC television. The basic plot is a maturing story of the protagonist, Nan Astley, well played by Rachael Stirling. As a teenager, Nan works in her family-run oyster house. Everyone expects her to stay at home, marry an appropriate husband, and settle down in family life. Nan also expects this. <br /> <br /> Everything changes when Nan meets Kitty Butler (Keeley Hawes), a beautiful and talented artist who dresses in men's clothing and captures the hearts of her audience. The audience includes Nan, who is sexually attracted to Kitty in a way that is not attracted to her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film follows Nan to London and through its (horrible) ups and downs as a lesbian and sometimes male impersonator. <br /> <br /> As is typical of the BBC, every role, no matter how small, is run by an excellent actor. The BBC has a depth and breadth of artists that is truly wonderful. None of the supporting actors stands out in my mind - they were uniformly good. Both Stirling and Hawes are wonderful, and their acting takes the film forward. <br /> <br /> It is always sad to remember how life can be difficult for someone who does not fit into the mold of society for what is normal. I know it's not easy for lesbians, even in the USA, to this day. Imagine the obstacles to lesbian love and happiness in Victorian England. We've come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.
