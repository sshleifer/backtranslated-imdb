This movie caught me by surprise. I have a habit of discovering as little as possible about movies before watching because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler. All I knew when I entered the theater was that it was a documentary about a married couple and that readers of the IMDb gave it a 7.8, Rotten Tomatoes users ranked it at 7.9 and critics got an average of awesome 8.2! If anything, they understood this little gem. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parents "for posterity" and at the beginning of the film we are treated with the necessary interviews with his parents, the outspoken mother Mina. and less than the father, Mike. I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker (son of Mike and Mina, Doug) would take us. In fact, I doubt Doug himself would know where he was going with that! <br /> <br /> Life takes unexpected twists and turns and this wonderfully expressive film follows the journey. It's hard to verbalize how much I've moved with this story and the unique way it was told. Absolutely fascinating from start to finish and it really is a must, even if you are not a fan of the documentary genre. This movie will make you think of your own life and can even evoke memories that you think were forgotten long ago. "51 Birch Street" is one of those rare shooting experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. The best news of all is that HBO has participated in the production, so instead of playing for a limited art audience, eventually millions of people will get the chance to see this incredible work. ANGRY!!!!!!!!
