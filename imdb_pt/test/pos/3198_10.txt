I realized this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was another forgettable forgettable to the simple bad grouping of films. <br /> <br /> A perfect use of deep black and pure white with excellent but simple animation, this is simply a story of cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming and touching. A little piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics and anyone else who enjoys how simplicity can be beautiful. If you're in your city, see. This one short is worth the price of admission.
