Great movie. There are no free tricks like in most Hollywood movies. It all bore the suspense of the plot. B & W gave it a basic, no frills feel too. In short, it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and cast. <br /> <br /> Segue serves as an interesting contrast to Memento. Characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively. In that sense, both reminded me a little of "In the Company of Men", also highly recommended. One difference between Nolan's two films is that Memento was a bit easier for me as the black-and-white scenes progress in a constant chronological direction, as well as those in color. I did not think that was true in Following, where the scenes seemed to be randomly shown. If you have the choice between VCR and DVD, I recommend DVD, since it gives you the option to watch the movie a second time in chronological order, not just in the scrambled (though naive) order presented by Nolan. It also makes it easier, in a second preview, to join the request to you if you want. <br /> <br /> As another viewer noted, one of the best things about this movie and Memento is that none of the casts were famous. They were characters, not big names that brought people developed in other films. <br /> <br /> Given certain similarities in the plot, I wonder if Memento is a kind of remake of Following, but intending to achieve a larger audience, such as Edward Burns, did She's the One in the mold - and with the same cast of The Brothers McMullan.
