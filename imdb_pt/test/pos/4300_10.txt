This is an awesome movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It looked like a very exciting and clever play (but without the overly theatrical feel that one really gets from seeing people on a stage), playing with everyone's terror of a white lie that turns into monstrous consequences. All major players are mesmerizing. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart in the end ... and everyone is judging by the awkward amount of handkerchiefs and hands going up to faces between males and females. Julian Fellowes triumphed again. It is a national treasure. Gosford Park, Vanity Fair, Mary Poppins ... and now this. Can not he do anything wrong? GO AND SEE! This is a real adult movie.
