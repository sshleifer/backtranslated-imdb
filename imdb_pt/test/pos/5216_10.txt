I thought it was a great movie. Gary Cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife who fabulously fakes his death! Overall, I thought the movie was great, definitely not a boring plot! Sad to say, but I think a lot of men can feel that way. I think he should have just divorced and asked to be transferred instead of the extreme he was, but he felt that there was no other way out so he pretended his death. I thought it was cool for Cole's real life wife to play the wife that he was unhappy with the movie. I think what the guy did was a bit extreme, but the movie was great anyway! Definitely recommend!
