It's been a long time since such an original and funny black comedy came about. If "Eating Raoul" is on your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and find "Undertaking Betty" right away. The subject of death being funny was tried before (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov in "Mortuary Academy"). While this film has some bright black comedy moments, "Undertaking Betty" is much more stable with a better cast. Who could have imagined that the venture could be a breeding ground for an original, uplifting and sincere comedy? I was surprised and so are you. I recommend seeing "Undertaking Betty" - MERK
