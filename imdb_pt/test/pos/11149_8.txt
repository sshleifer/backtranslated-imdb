Having recently purchased Universal's Marlene Dietrich DVD collection, I was a bit reluctant to watch "Golden Earrings". The idea of ​​a Marlene Dietrich in her early 40s as a gypsy in a war novel seemed unusual and implausible. I should not have worried. With all the professional talent that went into these old movies, it's hard to lose, really. The film was a joy to watch; it's a classic. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie was Dietrich, who plays the Gypsy role to perfection. Make-up, lighting, photography and her performance all contribute to creating a truly amazing and memorable character. I had never seen Dietrich play a "good" woman convincingly before - but she does here! She played many heartless vampires in these great Sternberg movies, so it's refreshing to see her in a more relaxed, relaxed role playing an exotic but very human character. <br /> <br /> Good romance. The love story is believable, optimistic, and the happy ending is extremely satisfying.
