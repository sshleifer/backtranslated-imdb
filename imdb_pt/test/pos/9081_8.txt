I just watched this move recently on the Encore channel. What a great movie, a great cast too. Flatliners are very suspenseful and unpredictable. The film has a great opening scene across the ocean, then to a series of scenes that set the issues about the afterlife, which provide a very strong involvement in the initial story. Therefore, Nelson played by Kiefer Sutherland was the first to pass the test to die and come back to life. So it gets very dramatic bringing back your past mistake to life. So all the above mentioned characters went through the same experience except for Randy Steckle played by Olliver Platt. Then the story unfolds into a resolution and basic understanding about the life and presence and meaning of God. David Labraccio, played by Kevin Bacon, an atheist, ends up questioning his own belief about God. It's amazing to see Julia Roberts, Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt, William Baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland in such a special moment of their careers. One might ask why we no longer have such a good movie produced. This is one of the best productions of Joel Schumacher. I really like this movie.
