I absolutely loved this movie! Since I do not want to give too much, it's basically about a mother and daughter and the life they have together. It's a very exciting story, between the struggles they have. I also think Natalie and Susan have perfect chemistry throughout the movie! This is definitely worth seeing! Two thumbs up, up!
