I like the pastor! Of course the performance was not good, but the fight scenes were good. Van Damme throws some good kicks and so does Adkins. The history was average. A Texan policeman fights smugglers. This movie did everything a Van Damme movie should do, which is martial arts and action. Van Damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than van Dammmes on the 2nd. If you're looking for an Oscar-winning performance, you will not be able to, but if you're looking for action and martial arts, this movie is for you. Scott Adkins is an incredible martial artist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial arts superstars, but his films in this movie are great. Van Damme offers strong kicks and it's good to see him performing martial arts again as he does not have in his last 4 or 5 movies. This movie is definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of Van Damme.
