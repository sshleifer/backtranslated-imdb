I really love this movie. It always makes me cry. If you enjoy Drew Barrymore half of me, you'll love this movie. It has all the essentials I look for in a movie. It has good actors, good characters, good humor ... many exciting moments as well. The moments of flashback when we see Josie in high school makes me cry. Each time. I'm sure you will like this, do not judge based on the fact that it looks like a teen movie, even if it is, in a way, a teen movie. Of course, if you're a guy, and all you watch are hardcore special effects movies only in the best 250 movies of all time, then this is not for you. But if you like romantic comedies you will not forget once you see it, grab it at a video store and have fun: Drew Barrymore is great in one!
