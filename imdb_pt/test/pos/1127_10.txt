I love this show. I hate it when it goes to the end of the season because it seems like forever until the season starts again !! I followed this show from his pilot then all the way played from where rusty college starts and see Casey his sister for now where he is dating Dana .. love this show cant wait until Monday night !! I'm also so happy that cappie and Casey finally came back together that was driving me crazy !!! As for Evan and Rebecca, I hope they come back together, which seems to be the end. I just looked over the main part of the cast and I'm so shocked that Casey Cartwright (Spencer Grammar) is the daughter of Kelsey Grammar !!! This only surprises me so much and the other thing that is a huge SHOCK is that it was born the same year as me and that it was born in my little brother with my year and I was watching it all the time and had no clue !!
