President Harry S. Truman once said that the only new thing in the world is the story you do not know. Seven years before Richard Rhodes' Pulitzer Prize-winning "Atomic Bomb Production", the BBC produced a seven-part miniseries, "Oppenheimer," which was a study of the character of people who designed and built the weapon that ushered in the Atomic Age, permanently linking science and technology to the state (and, in particular, the military), not just making history but changing the world forever. production is flawless, the casting nothing short of miraculous, not just the main characters, but even minor characters have unusual similarities with the people portrayed.In particular are Sam Waterston in the title role of American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, director scientist of the Manhattan Project, which was based at the Los Alamos laboratory in NM (the place for which he personally chose), Manning Redwood as General Leslie R. Groves, who oversaw the entire Engineering District of Manh attan (the formal name of the project); David Suchet as a physicist and extreme enemy of Oppenheimer, Edward Teller (who, almost forty years later, whispered in Ronald Reagan's ear and brought us the Star Wars Strategic Initiative) and Jana Sheldon as Kitty Oppenheimer. The attention to detail is uniformly excellent. <br /> <br /> Part thriller, part love story - and finally a tragedy, this series faithfully recreates a chapter in the history of the world - and science - that we dare not forget. The highest recommendation. <br /> <br /> (NOTE: Viewers who enjoy this series will also enjoy Jacob Bronowski's 13-part series "The Ascent of Man" and the BBC film "Copenhagen" by Michael Frayn. )
