I've always loved this guy with harsh voices in all the westerns. He was the helper (Jingles) on the Wild Bill Hickock show in the fifties. In this he has the perfect vehicle for his wonderful character to boast about. He is harmless and nobody believes in him, but he is not disturbed and continues anyway. When you have a guy like that, there is no challenge because the details are not there to be discussed. Of course, in this episode, he is taken aboard a spaceship by a group of aliens who have no sense of humor and believe in everything they hear. They do not have the word lie in their vocabulary. It turns out that he is so unbearable that he can not deal with it; and then, of course, there is the secret weapon. Check this out just to watch Andy.
