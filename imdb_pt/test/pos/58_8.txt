Superb editing, excellent performance, especially by Epatha Merkerson, and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack. This film dates back to the 1940s to comment on differences in racial lifestyle and some desegregation effect while weaving the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays the young character of Terrence Howard does a wonderful job that reflects the life and times of his creation in the small northern town of New York. The audience laughed, cried, and applauded the film and its director. <br /> <br /> Soon to be shown on HBO (February 7, I believe) - turn on TIVO and enjoy a great story!
