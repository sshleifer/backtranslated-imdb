Simply an amazing bittersweet movie that portrays a side of life often jumped on to feel good movies. I saw it as a child and came back to it very recently and fell in love again. <br /> <br /> As a child, it piqued my interest purely for building an airplane, as an adult who captured me in A dark world and a young man escape from this world. The portrait of the King was great, the chosen camera style with low shots and shots focusing on actions and hand movements was well thought out, I personally can not remember anything done in that style and adds to the character and portrays it as an almost non-human force (which may not be far from reality), it becomes an interesting event <br /> <br /> A clock any day
