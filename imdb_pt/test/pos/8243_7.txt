We went to the movies expecting a budget release and we made an art film. The film was digitally designed for about two-thirds of the screen with classic edges of digital projection, and had a limited stereo soundtrack that was wasted on the movie experience. <br /> <br /> The content of the film was the same old historical content that we have seen before, but highly sanitized to prevent the public from getting sick. Live action scenes, little that there were, were constantly reused in classic documentary style, which became annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> I was a bit surprised that only 4 people came to watch, guess the others knew something we did not know. <br /> <br /> I suspect the producers made the film to recognize the ninetieth birthday of Gallipoli. I have to wonder if they should have bothered. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten for trying, and out of respect for ANZAC.
