This is not the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella or Bambi, but it is a very sweet, pleasant, romantic, and well-done Disney animation resource. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, lessons included here for children, and some very appropriate jokes, but there is much here for adults as well. <br /> <br /> Although this is a bit like a regurgitation of the classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still has some elements, which belong exclusively to AristoCats. O'Malley is the "slut" and Dutchess is the "lady", but Dutchess has several kittens and everyone is trying to get back home. <br /> <br /> Phil Harris is our cat O'Malley. You can recognize his voice, as he also provided the voice of Baloo, the Bear in the Jungle Book, and Little John in the Disney Robin Hood. Eva Gabor lends her sweet and sweet voice to Dutchess. <br /> <br /> Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, who directed, or worked, all the Disney animated films that deserve to be mentioned until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> This is one of my movies Disney favorites, and belongs to any Disney collection. The special edition 2 discs will be released this summer (2007). <br /> <br /> This ranks a 8.4 / 10 of ... <br /> the Demon :.
