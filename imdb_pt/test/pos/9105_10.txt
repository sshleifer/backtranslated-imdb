I was lucky to get free passes for POD preview. Let me just tell you, from the previews I was excited to see it! The movie absolutely rocked! What I really liked was the fact that JB was in his element. With other films like "School of Rock", he makes a grumpy song for children and families, but this music is obviously all his. <br /> <br /> I took my brother and sister to see her, and we basically laughed all the time. There are a few places where I wonder what the hell they were thinking because some items are a little disjointed, but for the most part it was great. Most of the time, it did not look like a low-budget movie, so that's a plus. <br /> <br /> What surprised me the most was Dave Grohl as Satan. This is hilarious fuck! You honestly would not know to see the movie that is it. <br /> <br /> I say that if you are a rock fan and you are in JB, KG, and / or Tenacious D, go see the movie. Be prepared for a lot of drug references, a bunch of four letter words and a little rock crunching skull!
