This movie is definitely a case of style on the substance, but the style is good and certainly more than unique in itself to make "The Cell" a memorable and above average movie. <br /> <br /> "The Cell" is beautifully looking with stunning outfits, costumes and makeup. Yes, it's a real eye-opener to watch everyone. The film has some perfectly "dreamy" sequences that are certainly strange but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at. This film is a perfect blend of a kind of art film and a typical Hollywood thriller that is accessible to both fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> The story itself is very unlikely and does not always make sense. Because of this, the film is not always pleasant and enjoyable to watch, but as I mentioned before, the style pays off. The style keeps you watching until the end and offers the best moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as the serial-killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D'Onofrio is really underused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once again. I'm not particularly happy with the Jennifer Lopez cast. I know she can act in some of her movies, but she really was not fit to play the main character in this movie. Her character was not strong enough and she was overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Yet I felt that Vince Vaughn was also misunderstood in this film. He did not fit the role well and no, I'm not saying that because I'm used to seeing him only in comedies now. The rest of the support cast is good and still gives the film a certain degree of credibility. <br /> <br /> The Howard Shore soundtrack was also a good surprise and it was kind of like "Se7en" like sometimes. He served the film well and gave some extra humor and atmosphere to the scene. <br /> <br /> It's a movie far from perfect and the concept is unlikely and not always treated the right way. Still "The Cell" is a perfectly watchable film and perhaps even a little must-see because of its style, originality and creativity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
