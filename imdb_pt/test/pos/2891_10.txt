I bought this DVD recently and was totally impressed that Rush's songs sounded the same way when I first heard it in 1980. The lineup of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart is so talented that I want to list for them to play. > Songs I remember like Tom Sawyer, XYZ, The Big Money, The Trees, Freewill, Closer to the Heart, 2112, Limelight and The Spirit of Radio were played and the 40,000 plus fans there singing along and having a lot of fun and I swear more than half the audience was under 25! The writers who put Rush in the shoes of Rush fans like me are worried about a bunch of jealous idiots who like to taste rancid sour cream mixed with lemonade on a taco. <br /> <br /> Rush does not makeup, uses tips, lip sync, wears lipstick, has issues with the law, and has a band member brag about how long they were single. All they do is entertain! <br /> <br /> I give this DVD 100 out of 100.
