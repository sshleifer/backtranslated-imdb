If the cape genus owes much to Walter Huston, he also owes a debt of gratitude to Jules Dassin, a man who was ahead of his time and who suffered greatly because of his blacklist when Edward Dmytryk accused him of being a communist. The end of his American career would mean the end of Dassin, but the move to Europe proved that he was bigger than the same people who contributed to his death in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> "Rififi" is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to Mr. Dassin's vision. He decided to adapt Auguste Le Breton's novel because he saw the possibilities of turning it into a movie that became an instant classic. Jules Dassin was out of money in Paris when he discovered the city that would serve as background for his film. Bad weather worked for Dassin because the streets were always wet and there was not much to be done to show them that way. <br /> <br /> When we meet Tony for the first time, he's playing cards. Tony seems to be in poor health; He coughs all the time and sweat profusely. After losing all his money, he will see Jo, the Swede, who tells him about the possibility of an assault on Maupin & Webb, the extravagant jewelry of Paris. They pass the idea through Mario, who suggests that Cesar, the Milanese, a security expert. <br /> Tony, who has recently been released from prison, discovers that Mado, his ex-girlfriend, is now with Grutter, a creep who owns a nightclub. In confronting Mado, instead of loving, all he feels is contempt, and the meeting ends badly and he throws it out of its place. Grutter has no love for Tony, who is his natural enemy because of his connection to Mado. <br /> <br /> When the day arrives, the gang is able to reach the building where on the second floor, just above the jewelry store, the owner lives, but he is away. All goes well and the gang runs away with the jewels. Caesar, the Milanese, a typical ladies' man, picks up a ring as a memento, which in turn gives the singer in the Grutter nightclub. This tactical error is the spark that unwinds the well-thought-out plan. <br /> <br /> Jean Servais made an excellent Tony. He showed a tired man who was possibly making his last robbery. Carl Mohner, Robert Manuel and director, Jules Dassin, are seen as Jo, Mario and Cesar, the jewelry thieves of the quartet. Marie Sabouret plays Mado. Marcel Lupovici plays Grutter with moderate intensity. Robert Hussein, who was to direct the films later, impresses with his Remi, one of Grutter's men. The film is the great work of filming of Philip Agostini, who captured the atmosphere of the film. Paris and the places where all these criminals operate. The music of Georges Auric plays well with the action in the film. Jules Dassin was peculiar in his choice of films that he directed, and unfortunately, this is our loss, because this man was a genius, as proved mainly with "The Naked City", "Night and the City" and "Rififi".
