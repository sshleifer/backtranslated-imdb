Dolemite may not have been the first black film, but it certainly is one of the best. It is a crucial film in the Black Exploitation genre, where it caused a dramatic change between the films that came before, in contrast to the films that came after it. It was not necessarily a moving or moving film about black culture and it's a struggle to overcome issues like racism or something as important as that, but it was the story of a grumpy guy fighting "whitey" with his hot kung-kung army . go mama It was a guilty pleasure, a lot of fun and best to watch it with friends.
