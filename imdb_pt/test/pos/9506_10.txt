As other reviews have stated, there are some videos missing from this collection, but what's on this album is impressive. There are two separate soundtracks, an original recording and a new version of performance completely redone. Any new resident music is welcome, and I suppose for the first time the listener may be more ear-friendly, but I prefer the original recordings (probably simply because they are "the originals.") Production of this DVD is incredible videos, new and old are all interesting, with videos of live performances probably the least interesting of what is offered (although the snippets of live recordings hidden like Easter eggs are extremely welcome).
