I was a 20-year college student living with people when I first saw this, and I never forgot that. I'm a big fan of Joan Hackett, and this movie was perfect for his remarkable talent. I am so happy to see so many other people have such a good memory of seeing this. Of course, it is not available in any media! It would be perfect to show off on Lifetime, but because of their age, they will not. You never see anything there before the mid-eighties. I still remember what made me watch it when it was first performed: Rex Reed analyzed it in The New York Daily News, and he said it was like a throwback to the great Hollywood movies of the 1940s, and if it was done then the parts of Hackett and Grimes would have been played by Stanwyck and Crawford. Think about it! P.S. So sad that Joan Hackett has left us so tragically young.
