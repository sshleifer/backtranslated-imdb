The Tous Risques Class is repeatedly recommended every time I look at a Jean-Pierre Melville movie that I had to give a watch as fast as possible. Since I have discovered Melville and apparently worked backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to confuse this with one of his films, but it was made in 1960 by Claude Sautet before Melville came and bet his claim on French neo-noir. <br /> <br /> Class Tous Risques has two of the best men of the season, Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura plays Abel, a gangster exiled in Italy with his wife and two children, who wants to return to Paris because the police are approaching him. After a noisy and accelerated opening with a big surprise, Abel ends up being linked to Eric Stark (Belmondo), who wants to enter the underworld of the crime. Stark becomes the driver of Abel and eventually the only friend in an underworld who returns to Abel after everything he has done and passed. The film shows the duality of the two men, the older Abel at the end of his time after the tragedy, and the young Eric starting in the same way that Abel did, falling in love with a beautiful woman who stays with her man after all. the world of which they are part. It never ends handsome for them, or their loved ones. It's one thing to see an individual criminal coming to an end, it's different when he has his loved ones that he risks accepting. <br /> <br /> Just like in Melville's movie, the seemingly simple story gets more subtly complicated going along. As usual, like what I feel about the Melville movies, he left my head spinning (in a good way) and dying to watch again to get what I missed the first time. Class Tous Risques is a definite holder.
