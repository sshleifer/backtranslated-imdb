This documentary traces the origins and life of Zephyr's skateboarding team, using original films made in the 1970s (mostly by Craig Stecyk) combined with interviews with team members and other influential people today. The first part The film documents how the "Dogtown" section of Venice, CA, began at the turn of the century when the city was created to be a European city of Venice. By the 1970s, the only remaining local attraction, Pacific Ocean Park, had been abandoned, leaving a beach with many exposed pillars and other dangers. Poor children living in the area had nothing better to do than surf, and they excelled despite (or perhaps because of) their surroundings. As the waves dissipated in the afternoon, they practiced skateboarding to fill the time, and the empty pools caused by the drought during those years, in addition to their surfing origins, led them to create the vertical skate style that is prevalent today. <br /> <br /> I thought the film covered a lot more about surfing than I expected, which seemed to be a bonus, as I really did not know much about surfing or skateboarding before watching the movie. The soundtrack, not surprisingly, was also good. I also liked how these kids were just following their passion and generally ended up getting better with the experience. The parts that did not work out so well for me were the drama they tried to create, which seemed a bit forced, and the team's sense of self-importance somewhat exaggerated (although this is probably just a street attitude from where they grew up above). This is not to say that they had no significant influence, but only that it seems extremely likely that there were other factors as well. <br /> <br /> One note: My wife is more affected than most when it comes to movies that use what we call "SpastiCam" (camera shaking). This movie is often guilty, so if you're so distressed, be warned. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone, but especially to anyone who has skateboarding and / or surfing in their history. <br /> <br /> Seen 5/11/2002.
