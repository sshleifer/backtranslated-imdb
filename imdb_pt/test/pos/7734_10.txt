I just can not believe the low scores for this movie. The likely reason has to do with the low number of votes, which few people have seen. This is simply a fantastic movie! There are so many stories intertwined inside, but it's not complicated. Each character grows with the movie and we experience with them going through life changes. The setting is simply amazing and the final credits are the best of all the movies I've ever seen (like a Shakespeare play). Yes, it's a bit dated (filmed in 1982), but the issues the characters face are very current. It could have been filmed in 2002 without changes in the story. Raul Julia is amazing, best role of all time in a movie - this is his signature piece. A young Molly Ringwald is excellent as she matures from girl to girl. Susan Sarandon is perfect as a carefree young woman and John Cassavetes is the force that puts it all together. Do yourself a favor, find this movie, preview it and enjoy it. Go back to IMDb and mark this movie among the 250 greatest of all time that it really belongs.
