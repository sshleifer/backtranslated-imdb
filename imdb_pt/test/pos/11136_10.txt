I've seen and enjoyed all of the Chameleon movies and I must say they keep getting better and better with each one of them. Bobbie Phillips is fantastic and my granddaughter wants to be like her. I'm glad they brought a "Brother" character to Bobbie (Kam) so we can expect to see more exciting shows. Bobbie is beautiful, sexy and sweet, and independent at the same time, and everything any woman could wish to be!
