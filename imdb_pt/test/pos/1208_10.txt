The largest crowd that ever attended a wrestling event in the United States happened at Wrestlemania 6. More than 93,000 people came to break the Rolling Stones record, and this event did not disappoint at all. Perhaps the greatest game of all time occurred when the Immortal Hulk defended its world title against the Ultimate Warrior. There are over 12 games at all, so you get tons of action
