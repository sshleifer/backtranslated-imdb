I absolutely adore this film about a columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a great domestic magazine that offers a welcome article every month that includes details about her incredible home life as wife and mother in a beautiful home in Connecticut. The problem happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a WW2 hero as guests during the Christmas holidays. Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small apartment in New York, is not married and does not have a baby - and can not cook anything! Hilarity (and romance) follows when she tries to do a credible act in an effort to save the face / keep from being fired by the magazine owner (played by Sydney Greenstreet). This is a delightful comedy; one I recommend for lovers of classic cinema !!!!
