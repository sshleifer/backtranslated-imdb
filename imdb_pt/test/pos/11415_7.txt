While I read all the complaints about this movie before I saw it, I was still interested in the preview. I do not know if it was because I was expecting a bomb or what, but I really enjoyed the movie. I was not too scared until the second half of the movie, but even then it was not too bad. I think most of the false scenes and alarms were realistic, albeit a bit overlapping, but it was necessary to take the story further. I think the house and the surrounding area is the perfect setting for this kind of movie, it's beautiful and huge but then the same qualities that are appealing become scary. I also think the light arrangement worked very well because they did not just call the entrance, but there was no way to keep them, so the house went dark outside the small section where Jill was. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Jill, I thought that part of her was well interpreted, at first it was not so believable, but after a few phone calls, that's fine. In fact, the scenes in which she is scared are perfectly executed. And finally, somebody hit the poker of fire. I can not tell you how many times when I hear a noise in my house I pick up the poker fire, and it was a nice touch for her to do the same, even if she forgot that when she needs it most. With regard to the plot holes, the film is not perfect but almost all holes can be explained, and part of the mystery is how it came in ... exactly how long was it looking at it ? How did he leave to kill his friend? And when exactly did the gardener die? Overall, I enjoyed it and was surprised at how quickly it was. This kept my attention, and I wanted to see how it ended, although the ending was very brief and left a bad taste in my mouth. My only complaint, apart from the end, was the lack of character development. They could have added ten minutes with her and her friends or something to make us feel bad about her situation, to give us a taste of her personality and to foretell how she will deal with the situation (for example, the scene in which she should go back to the kids, it seems that some scene is missing at first that talked about her only caring about herself or something).
