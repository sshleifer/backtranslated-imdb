The theme of religion in the films of Buñuel is a point that one, as a movie eater, as an art eater or as a person needs to analyze difficult. One can see a Buñuel satirical in "La Voie Lactée", "Un Chien Andalou" or in "L'Age d'Or". It is very hard and effective in your criticism, but when you saw this and then you see a movie like "Nazarin", after seeing this work you get questioned about its author. And much questioned about what seems to be a contradiction for Buñuel thinks, but it is better not to call it that, I think there is no contradiction in his work, only that the religious point of view of Buñuel is very diverse as unique in the films. <br /> <br /> This beautiful film is based on the novel by Benito Perez Galdós, who told us the story of Father Nazario, who lived a humble and simple life dedicated to God and to help everyone. He lived in a simple, poor country. There also lived Beatriz, who is an abused and abandoned wife. She finds no sense of her life without her violent macho. She has a kind of revulsion for him. On the other side is Andara, one of the city's prostitutes. Father Nazario was robbed again, he blames Andara's cousin. Andara listen to this and try to struggle unsuccessfully with the priest, who does not believe in violence. That night, Andara discovers that her cousin is really a thief, she stole his clubs. Andara fights with her cousin with terrible consequences. With this, Andara seeks the mercy of the priest. Nazario decides to help her, knowing full well that this could be against her church, obviously this thing will have some consequences. From here, Nazario will be a pilgrim. Without anything, even without shoes, but with spirit and faith. But Andara and Beatrice want to be with him, and be like him, to serve God. <br /> <br /> If it's the sweetest movie Buñuel I've seen so far, it's also the most spiritual. It is clear here that the thing that most confounds people with the contradiction is that here we do not see a Buñuel against the power of the church, we see a Buñuel whose movie is about church, but not in the typical - and great - satirical way. However that may be, I do not think that the right word is a contradiction, in fact I think it is nice and well made, and despite containing such religious questions (like her "Voie Lactée") I found it to be a spiritual movie, but do not try to touch the Catholic religion in diversity as he might touch it, and laugh at it in other films. "Nazarin" is from the father Nazario and his perspective confronts God and the same religion, but all this is in the end, analyzed in the spiritual life of this man. <br /> <br /> The other two women are, not a contrast, but as well as two other perspectives of faith. First we have Beatriz, the mistreated woman, who loses all faith in life, first with her husband and then with a girl who was her family. This girl was very sick. Next to her was also Andara, the prostitute who runs justice. In the family of the child, only religious women, there is a great pain, but faith becomes priest Nazario when arrives with nothing to this city. He blesses the child, then says that she is well. The priest wants to continue walking, but Beatriz and Andara have recovered their faith in life and want to dedicate their lives to God with their father Nazario. After a few complaints, Father Nazario decides to be with them, discovering with some things to the end how he feels about faith, God, religion and the person in need, the people who should ask the charity to survive. This last issue should be noted as a possible explanation for the end of the pineapple. This end we hear the drums (similar to the one in "L'Age d'Or" and a Nazario father, walking asking about these things, when he refuses the fruit the first time and in the end decides to receive it as a symbol of necessity or perhaps in response to his spiritual path that he begins to be a priest. In addition, the two women must take from the father, Andara for his crime (beautiful scene where she thanks a man who helps father Nazario in prison and then she condemns the man who beat the priest in jail) and Beatrice because she prefers to be with her macho, although he treats her badly, just because she does not accept that she falls in love with Father Nazario - and here is perhaps the only place in the cinema for the church's critical walk to contradict the church, the religion it serves. <br /> <br /> Father Nazario is then a (Soft for much, but not for me) critical to anything in religion (Father Nazario helping a woman who is guilty of a crime, of a pec ado), but above all is one of Buñuel's analysis of faith and life, and he really succeeded, with a beautiful, soft, sweet and unforgettable film, this is undoubtedly one of his best. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there are any.
