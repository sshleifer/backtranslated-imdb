I happened to read all the manga released in English by Junji Ito. I watched Tomie's movie and it was a big pile of steaming shit. THANKFULLY Uzumaki really does justice to the manga. I think those who have read the manga will really appreciate this movie more, since many screenshots and camera angles are just like the manga and it's interesting to see how the characters in the book are played in the movie. This movie reminds me of a weird Indian. The ending is different from the manga I was expecting. Kirie looks like his manga counterpart, and his male friend fits in well with the whole. Very scary I have to admit, this movie looks like a feverish nightmare, the kind you have when you were a kid. Is not it really scary, but weird, if you understand me? Another great horror of Japan, get a copy.
