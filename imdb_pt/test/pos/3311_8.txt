Is this a bad novel, bold, predictable, tacky and lascivious? "The Best of Everything" is such a guilty pleasure for me, something like "Valley of the Dolls." I mean, "Best" has it all. Someone gets pregnant outside of marriage (when is the last time you heard that phrase?), There are cases everywhere, drinking, betrayal, jealousy and even a tragic death, but not completely unexpected. <br /> Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delightful Stephen Boyd) are the centerpiece of the events. Its chemistry is immediate and it is the glue that prevents this film from becoming too fragmented. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker, a former ex-fashionable exuberant model, appears as Gregg Adams, an aspiring theater actress, a role that, according to any biography I've read about her, was apparently not much exaggerated. But Parker does a surprisingly credible job here, rather than holding onto a pair of scenes opposite Louis Jourdan, who plays David Savage. Jourdan probably took on that role for money and special screen credit because he was clearly addressing the aging star / road. <br /> <br /> Diane Baker is naive as naïve, naïve April Morrison, Martha Hyer as Barbara Lemont has a particularly juicy plot, and film legend Joan Crawford chews on her customary portion of scenery as Amanda Farrow, another role, like the Savage de Jourdan, which Crawford probably accepted for payment. <br /> <br /> There are some obviously dated dialogue and plotting devices (IS 1959) and predictability of the novel genre. But if you like good soap like I do, "The Best of Everything" goes more than satisfying you.
