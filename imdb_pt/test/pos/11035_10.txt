If it were possible to reward 10+ ... that would be the only movie I would choose. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this movie on TV many years ago - and fortunately be prepared enough to video it. Now my video copy is getting old, the video technology is outdated and I'm starting to worry that I might not be able to enjoy the wonders of this movie for much longer. Like a wildlife movie, superb. As a film about the relationship between man and nature, it overcomes anything before or after. How can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten? If there is a lobby / pressure group to push for the relaunch of this movie, please tell me and send me the details immediately. <br /> <br /> My guess is that there is a spearmint to be made by One able to relaunch this in today's market.
