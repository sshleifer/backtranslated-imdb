Isabel just got out of jail. She is determined not to return again, but life is difficult for ex-offenders, especially if they are homeless, like Isabel. When she finds out what her boyfriend Rufus was, she may see a light of hope, but Rufus is not only an addict but also an AIDS sufferer. This will not make Isabel surrender because, if there is a will, there is a way and she will fight for her future, have a normal life, a home and a family. A very hard and touching film that went unnoticed by most Spanish cinemas, the actors are great and the story is very moving, maybe a better treatment of the secondary characters has made the movie better, but it is really good. I strongly recommend to watch, but be aware that this is not a happy Disney movie, it's difficult and dramatic.
