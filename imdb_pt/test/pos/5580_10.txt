This is perhaps the television series with the greatest potential of any series around. The production values ​​are in a class of their own. The characters are round and interesting. This is entertainment at its best. Some of the aliens are quite grotesque, but there is an underlying mood that makes it unmissable. I hope this series continues for many years and has many spin-offs. Science fiction had its bad press, some justified, but this is really a flagship science fiction series and thank Henson for that. Best brands.
