I missed the beginning of the movie. I walked in when the partisan was at the farmhouse. I can honestly say it was awful. The moral ramifications are amazing. <br /> <br /> My fear of pain and torture leaves me unable to see myself beyond cowardice. I see the capacity of Christ that was portrayed by the brave patriot, and I can only pray that I could or had the moral turpitude to follow his example. <br /> <br /> I see that the main theme of the film is to show the weakness / strength of the tortured, but what a somber decision to face. All because the soul of man can be distorted in such a way that the pain and suffering that are exerted on another human being are somehow satisfactory. Be it mental or physical. <br /> <br /> I found the film very thought-provoking.
