Have you ever wondered where this episode came from, "Tuttle", in the middle of the first season of M * A * S * H? Well, now the cat is out of the bag: they got this Soviet movie, a satire about how dumb the czar is, due to the slip of a pen (making the phrase "the lieutenants though ..." in "Lieutenant Kizhe" " which makes no sense) and no one being honest or brave enough to contradict him and just tell him the truth - Kizhe does not exist and never did. years later, David Ketchum and Bruce Shelly lent this crazy plot and gave us essentially the same story, just on the other side of what became the Cold War, proving that people in high positions can be equally dumb, no matter their loyalties.
