I've seen this movie through one of the actors' agents, and it certainly agrees with a great deal coming from Sth. Australia in terms of the general tone *, which is just somber and melancholic. <br /> <br /> I thought the little boy in the movie was great. Most of the time, the child actors are troubled and embarrassing, but not in this case. He was really good. In terms of * surrealism * mentioned by jingo, well, I just think this movie is just 'weird'. It's a very weird movie, with weird locations, plot, weird stuff happening all the time. But 'good' strange instead of 'bad'. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of other films like this, but it's nothing like CARS ATE Paris, maybe more like a BANS but in fact I think more like a Hammer movie from the 60s. interesting mind working behind it. <br /> <br /> JINGO, My question is also about the title. Why modern love? Anyone? Besides, jingo, what did you mean by "god forsaken" when you were talking about Australia, hmmm? Just curious
