There are two ways to consider "Head". Or it's a dazzling and mind-bending collage of music, old movie clips, psychedelic comedy and Tv-style comedies, or a less pretentious and messy storyline. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. It is also one of the best films of all time. The Monkees - Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Mike Nesmith - just finished the hit series and wanted to make a movie. In collaboration with writer Jack Nicholson and director Bob Rafelson, they did 'Head'. <br /> <br /> It begins at the opening ceremony of a bridge in San Francisco, where the Monkees gate breaks the proceedings. Mickey leaps over the safety rail, dipping hundreds of feet into the water. The mermaids rescue him for the accompaniment of a beautiful composition by Jerry Goffin & Carole King called 'The Porpoise Song' and visuals that make the end of the '2001' Stargate sound monotonous in comparison. At this point, you will have either turned off or left completely captivated. <br /> <br /> More bizarre events unfold; Mickey uses a tank to destroy a Coke machine in the middle of the desert; the whole Italian army surrenders to it; the group is hired to play dandruff on Victor Mature's hair for a television commercial; a fat waitress insults the group, describing them as "God's gift to the eight-year-old boy"; a surprise birthday party for Mike goes awry; the group is sucked into a vacuum cleaner and, to cover it all, is thrown away inside a giant glass tank. <br /> <br /> You will either hate it or love it. I found a refreshing change from stupid pop musicals of the 'let's do the show here' variety. The songs are good too; 'Daddy's Song' is superbly choreographed by Toni Basil (who later appears on Rafelson's Easy Rider) and has a wonderful set, with Davy's clothes changing color at the speed of light. 'As We Go Along' is a lovely number of Goffin & King, whose images accompany a strong environmental message. <br /> <br /> Frank Zappa, Annette Funicello are just two of the invited stars to appear. Did Victor Mature read the script before agreeing to do this, does anyone ask? He's hilarious at it. So crazy that you just have to be a true genius behind it, 'Head' is a 1960s gem and worth revisiting again and again. Shame did not find an audience at the time. If only 'Spiceworld' had been so!
