... and I'm so disappointed because I can not buy the DVD or VHS from him anywhere. <br /> <br /> It's kind of a mix of Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald. fabulous as the spoiled teenager. This was done when Molly was still dark, shortly before she came across Pretty In Pink. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy with an edge! <br /> <br /> If someone has a copy of this, or knows where I can get one ... please leave a message for me - it will be greatly appreciated.
