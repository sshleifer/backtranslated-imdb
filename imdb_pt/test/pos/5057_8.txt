This film was an incredible tribute to those who went through this kind of pain and suffering. The acting was not the best, I admit, but was passionate about her message, sending people to prisons without a lawyer or some kind of judgment is cruel and unusual. They even had a damn judgment by Saddam, so why does not every suspicious terrorist have some kind of justified and justified judgment or hear why they were marked in the first place? I'm leaving the film, but I think it's worth noting about this sickly and distorted idea that the government has. The film's way of telling the story and the past was a great mystery. The whole movie, I was trying to connect the daughter with the plot and it was very obvious in the end. There was no doubt that the direction was incredible, but the only thing I did not care for was that there was so much emphasis on Reese Witherspoon's character's interest and fought the ideal that she had, very jump. Other than that, it was really fun, and above all, I kept my attention and interest for the two hours I played.
