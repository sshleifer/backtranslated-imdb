The premise of SF is not unique (though it was at the time), but the focus is completely different than in other artificial reality films. Especially during the first part, it is an elaborate crime picture that uses the premise of SF to tell a story of unusual crime in which the forcible detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of missing characters and useless witnesses who do not need lie to be useless. Instead of an unreliable narrator, we have an unreliable world. In part two, we follow the main character's fight for sanity and this becomes more of a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation. He knows that his own existence is nothing more than electrical impulses, how does he deal with this knowledge? He knows that there is a world that is more real than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, a world where no one can understand him. The problem of thinking about knowing something essential about the world that no one else knows or wants to believe is something very real that many of us can identify with. For me the film transports this despair very well, with its dark and artificial atmosphere that also supports the factual artificiality of the film world. <br /> <br /> In addition to 'The Matrix' or 'The Thirteenth Floor' is little worried evoking a sense of dread for its plot of artificial reality, instead, it focuses heavily on the psychological aspects. Philosophy is only so interesting that certain philosophical concepts are essential in how they shape and alter the perception of the character of the world. <br /> <br /> It's probably longer than it has to be (which is not a problem if you're as captivated by it as I was) and part 2 runs very low in the steam.
