Where the hell is Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Sky? Hell? A parallel universe? When the uncomfortable man leaves the subway platform and finds a train at high speed, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; walking alone, the newest arrival, into a dead underworld where all suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man who processes and transports the uneasy arid land man to a city if eyeballs work, a kind of urban landscapes he once inhabited, if memory serves you correctly. Andreas retains the appearance of a sleepwalking trance, a man alienated from people and objects, struggling to orient himself; at home, or rather, your designated apartment; or at work, where the troublesome man is randomly assigned to account as an independent contractor. Havard (Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him, "You'll get used to it," which covers more than just crushed numbers, we suspect, in this world, the same as the old world. <br /> <br /> If life has no meaning, as the French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said for death as well. The subculture of office life may be a man's paradise, but to us it sounds like hell, under the context in which "Den Brysomme Mannen" operates. Working in the afterlife, in essence, is working for the rest of your life. Andreas's social intercourse may be normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates strangeness in the viewer because he now recognizes the tedious work of white-collar work by white-collar workers, with their inconsequential idle talk and assigned jobs that they perform during the day, as automobiles every day seem irrational in their obvious absurdity. To see everyday life replicated in a speculative light, "Den Brysomme mannen" causes normal human interaction to appear as expressionless comedy, as everyday life becomes a performance that transforms the meaning of the word "alienation" of Karl Marx , because here men and women in the office "identify" with their work, as actors in a play conspiring to make their fictitious selves look real. But the uncomfortable man never fully participates in the facade. He is always aware of the cracks. From a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the consequences of a jumper impaling on an iron fence while people in their lunch breaks walk, indifferent to their fugitive bowels. which create red spatters on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassivity of his own co-workers after he purposely cuts his own finger, hoping that he will feel the pain, in a paper slicer. He does not. It's just another sensation, plus being able to taste and smell that is lost to the uncomfortable man. This inability to obtain solace in simple pleasures amplifies the man's need for love, where simple pleasures compensate for his solitude in the physical world. At a dinner party hosted by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt (Petonella Barker). They got along well. He takes her home. She invites you inside. They become a couple. He moves. When they have sex, however, it's no good either for Andreas, or for Anne, who seems to take more pleasure in interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation unattainable in this world, but love is important to the troublesome man, so he tries again with Ingeborg (Birgette Lagen), a girl at work. "Den Brysomme mannen" deconstructs love by presenting its basis as a series of gestures that require performances of man and woman. When Ingeborg does not arouse the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic yet strange city with an openness that is solvable and offering a variety of interpretations . Injured by Ingeborg's apathy for his declaration of love for her, the troublesome man enters the same subway station, stands on the same platform, observes the same couple aggressively, and leaps. . This time, he can not die. How can you die when you're already dead? He repeatedly hit the train after a train, Andreas's face turns into ground beef; his body writhes at angles previously seen only in art. When the troublesome man realizes that love and death are out of his reach, he looks for the club man, who was willing to say what is not said in this city of the undead. What it is: death, not life, has no meaning. <br /> <br /> Reaching the bottom of the mystery behind Andreas's whereabouts directs the narrative, and to the credit of the filmmaker, this puzzle is satisfactorily addressed in one scene. this recalls "Being John Malkovich" by Spike Jonze when Andreas crawls through a tunnel to cross another world, like a newborn baby, reminiscent of Malkovich's brain portal, to which Craig Schwartz asks people to crawl. Andreas's attempt to cross the great divide presents a seductive paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that "heaven is a place on earth." But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of hell; the place where Andreas is sent after being banished from the city of his fate.
