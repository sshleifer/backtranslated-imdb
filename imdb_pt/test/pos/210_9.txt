The story told by The Cranes are Flying is not, admittedly, so original. Young lovers are separated by war; Bad things happen to both of you. We have seen this many times before. <br /> <br /> However, we have not seen it filmed well, with daring photos that take liberties to emphasize separation, destruction or lack of hope. Even more remarkable coming from the Soviet Union, and reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in the Soviet cinema of the modern age. <br /> <br /> I was reading the "Three Sisters" of Chekhov the other day, and by chance on what might be the meaning of the title of this film. In Act 2, Masha opposes the notion that we should live our lives without meaning or understanding: "MASHA: Certainly mankind must believe in something, or at least seek truth, otherwise life It's just empty, empty, live and not know why the cranes are flying, why children are born, why there are stars in the sky, or you must know why you live, or everything is trivial - mere useless nonsense. " Similarly, Veronika finds it difficult to believe that the war, and the sufferings of herself and others, have been futile. Better to assign meaning, live as if life were meaningful and not give in to despair. It is perhaps this thought that leads to its final act in the film. <br /> <br /> BTW as a minor fix for another comment here - there may be a V pattern in the movie, although I had not noticed them myself. But the first letter of Veronika's name is no longer an example of this; in the Cyrillic alphabet, its name begins with a letter that looks like an English "B".
