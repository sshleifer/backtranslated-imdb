Words alone can not describe the beauty and power of this film. <br /> <br /> Think of "Toy Story". Now, think of "Toy Story," circa 1934. Now, imagine that the animation looks as realistic as it is fluid. Think of the movie not as something that adults and children might like but imagine it as a movie-noire. <br /> <br /> Imagine trying to do something like that in 1934. Somehow, "The Mascot" offers. In a story where toys come to life, and one of them is trying to deliver an orange to their sick owner, Starewicz offers a completely unexpected level of animation. It's so fluid, you'll know for a long time whether what you see is actually stop-motion animation. <br /> <br /> Comparing "Toy Story" and "The Mascot" is an exercise in futility in terms of plot: while "Toy Story" is a children's story that adults may like, "The Mascot" is bleak , chilling story intended for adults. Meaning, NO, your kids will not like it. A little. <br /> <br /> Still, get it if you can. You may be able to find it over "Vampyr" on DVD and LaserDisc. And get ready to be shocked by what Starewicz did in 1934 with some dolls.
