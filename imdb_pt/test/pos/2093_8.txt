Finally! Third time lucky. This movie has always been on my mind, but on my first screening I forgot about it and only picked up the second half of the movie. Then, only a few months later, I had the second chance to watch it, so I decided to record it. Only to find out that my timer went off late and again I missed the first half of the movie. I was not going to let that happen again. So when it came on TV again, I thought I would wait until it happened, so I would record it. And it was a good choice. I would have just watched the movie, but they always spent the week around midnight. After discovering a hole in his crowded cell, nine prisoners escape from their confinement to locate the key to the universe, which a fellow prisoner known as the Fake King claims to have hidden. They think this key can be an opening for a hidden pull of fake notes. On this journey, they naturally see it as an opportunity to regain their lives before being arrested. Although things did not go as they intended, most of the criminal plans went astray. <br /> <br /> "9 Souls" is a spiritual journey by Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada, who has thrown his viewers into a film of two totally different halves. The first half of the story looks more like a psychic comedy with the criminal ties and the situations in which they find themselves being the point of sale, but all this gives place to a second semester moralistic and full of drama, where the real problem begins with some rather nasty and bloody moments replacing the silly tone that began. While, the first half is quite fun with its on the road, doodling screwball and offbeat banter. But it's really the last haunting half with its quirky twist of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you sympathize with these very human characters. Even if they are not truly innocent of your crimes, you end up becoming entrenched by these fleshy characters in the first time when you see them spiraling into their fall, you know it's an effective drama when you get in shock in dramatic change. The nine characters have enough screen time to truly understand their personal history and what weakness would bring them down. The way the plot works is that Michiru and Torakichi are the main characters and we see her mainly from her perspectives. The tale of escapism is an indisputably attractive character study that is clear in your goal and poses for you many questions about society and the path you choose to take to escape life and free yourself from those restrictions. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the symbolic story is full of clarity and is told with clarity. The visual element does not go unnoticed, because there is only a dreamy and trance vibe that is channeled into the unique atmosphere. What contributed HIGH to this factor and gave the film a boost was the sweeping and melancholic instrumental rock soundtrack. The soft atmospheric gel I was able to create in many scenes left me breathless with the everlasting emotions he was able to bring about. Simply beautiful and absolutely powerful control on that front. The pace of such a long film (2 hours) seems to be easy and editing is done quickly because we are so involved in it all. Hypnotic photography is sharp in detail. Meanwhile, the performances of the cast as a bunch of criminals are of high quality, each providing personality and enough resources to separate. <br /> <br /> I've found "9 Souls" to be a pleasant and surprising surreal movie that stimulates the emotions and then gives you a powerful blow when you change direction. Highly recommended.
