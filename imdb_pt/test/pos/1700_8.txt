I've never seen American Werewolf in London, but this movie was a lot of fun. When renting it, I thought it was a horror movie, but it turned out to be another comedy with some aspects of horror. I thought the transformation sequences were well done, but the effects were wise, the best scenes were those where the effects and the lighting developed. The transformations have reminded me of many transformations of werewolves in other films, but the werewolves themselves are very bestial and do not like dogs very much. Gore: I believe there's been a lot in this movie, what really takes away the horror, when every picture has blood, taking violence seriously is difficult. <br /> <br /> J.Hurst (8th grade)
