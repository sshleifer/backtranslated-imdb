I'm not a Disney fan, but I happen to be in Orlando for a friend's wedding. Then my travel partner and I went to Disney for a few days. I did not see a good 3-D effect, well ... always. So I usually try to stay away from these presentations. The 3-D effect on it was so good. I am a grown man of 38 years, and even I wanted to try to reach and touch. That's nice! Word of advice. At the end, look at the back of the theater on the wall. Put it like this ... the first time I saw it, the effect was not working. So I told my friend ... "It would have been nice if ...." My friend said, "That's exactly what happens. It's not working for some reason." It's an incredible show. You will not be disappointed !!!
