I was truly and wonderfully surprised with "O 'Brother, Where Art Thou?" The video store was out of all the movies I planned to rent, so I came across it. I got home and, as I watched, I was absorbed and found myself laughing loudly. The Coen made a magnificent movie again. But I think the first time you watch this movie, you know the characters. The second time, now that you know them, you laugh so hard it could hurt you. I strongly recommend that someone see this, because if you are not, you are really missing out on a movie gem for ages. 10/10
