I read the reviews about Las Vegas and agree with some of them, it's not brain surgery on TV, but again I got the impression that TV was mostly for escapism, especially with what is happening in today's world. Let's face it, a show about Vegas (which is not a reality-based show) is not going to one based on reality, because for me Vegas is pure fantasy! It's the kind of place where we can go and pretty much do what we want when we want (subject to funds, obviously!). <br /> <br /> So the fact that Las Vegas is beautiful, sexy and clich√© with characters that reflect all this seems to be in the money in my eyes. If you do not like, do not watch, we have a million channels! <br /> <br /> We're coming to the third episode here in the UK and I know I'll be making a shorter way to watch it again. I just hope it will not be canceled, something that seems to be going on a lot with most shows coming to the UK that are kind of decent! (Firefly and Jake 2.0 anyone? !!). <br /> <br /> It's harmless, very fun and every time I watch, I want to get back to the real thing :)
