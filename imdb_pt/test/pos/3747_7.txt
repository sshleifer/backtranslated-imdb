I recently saw this movie at a 3D movie festival in Hollywood. It was in 3-D polarized (non-red and blue gray glasses) It was so much fun watching this movie with an audience, the printing was great and the 3-D perfect. The introductions were exaggerated and, added to the fun, the surprising ending (which we should not share with the other players in the movie, at least according to the movie trailer and poster) made people howl at laughing. By today's standards, this is probably more comedy than horror, but with the added dimension of 3-D (complete with cobwebs and sticks coming off the screen), this movie was a fun joke in the horror of the 1950s.
