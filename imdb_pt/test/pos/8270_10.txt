hi i'm john and i would like to tell you all that my dog ​​was in this movie on the bait screen he was the pit as one who was going to bite the chained man. my dog ​​name was Colin and he stayed away filming for a week for this movie. he was also in other things like the crime watch uk and some other small parts. he won a few dog shows but he passed away now I miss him, he was a big dog, true and loyal and we had great times together but he had cancer that could not be treated so I had to put him worse day of my life, I hope this gives you something to look for in the movie, if you watch again. <br /> <br /> Thank you all
