I wanted to see this, take a look at the show. He told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, I thought it was great. We have to see, Robin always being 'on' no matter what. Diamontopolous's performance was incredible. <br /> <br /> The introductions of the main players seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming at it, which helped me get over all of Williams' energy. The small backstage part of their other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley) was enlightening. I also thought Richmond-Peck's Harvey was also a beautiful rock in the pond. (This is a good thing). <br /> <br /> This movie told the old story of the Hollywood staff, going through the ups and downs of stardom. That kept me stuck on my TV, and I learned to love Robin, well, everyone seems to be the super people that sometimes I think Hollywood is. Go figure. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder why people on the net are always played to be idiots. We've never seen the head of ABC. Just listen to it, like Charlie Angels Charlie (I wonder if this planned?). It seems so sad, that a show at number 1 could be so destroyed by its own network. <br /> <br /> I think this story could be told about someone's life, as they climb the ladder of any job. Movie stars and TV are always loved or hated by so many people, with whom you grew up, you just want to go back to the past, remember your own past. I remember watching the show, and always wondering what happens in their personal lives. <br /> <br /> Mork and Mindy will always be part of me, and I could see part of them. It may not be all true, nor is it a lie, but in the end, it told me a wonderful story, sad and happy.
