I should have been about ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to see this martial arts movie on "DRIVE IN" on the circle drive in Long Beach. The title was "HAMMER OF GOD," which I can never forget for some reason, but what I remember are the different scenes that have left a mark on my mind forever. <br /> <br /> My brother always reminds me of the movie, although it has been forever seems since we've seen the movie. From time to time throw away the years I would look in the rental shops and every now and then I would check the web and for some reason it seems that it is never available or no one knows what movie I am talking about. <br /> <br /> If I knew if and if I were available I would love to buy this movie. If anyone is aware of your availability, please inform me.
