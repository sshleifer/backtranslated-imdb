I've been a big fan of Hitchcock since I saw "Rear Window" on television. "Saboteur" is not the best of Hitchcock for me, it's very good, but it's not a masterpiece. It has its flaws, some parts are rather slow, and as a consequence of being discarded in a hurry, the script seems quite incomplete. But Hitchcock's direction is superb, and the performances were not that bad. While Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane do a good job, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd come very close to stealing the show. The story is good, about a ruthlessly run-down man, very similar themes used in "39 Steps" and "North By Northwest", and cleverly provide some much-needed escapism. The score was absolutely exceptional; the song following the opening title was phenomenal, almost like a distorted march, and I enjoyed the excavations of Tchaikovsky's 1st Piano Concerto and Beethoven's 5th Symphony. The cinematography is also crisp and smooth, the scenery and the landscapes almost dazzling and there are also a lot of very effective scenes. That is, the climax of the Statue of Liberty, but the circus troupe meeting and the shooting at Radio City Music Hall are also on the money. Overall, not the best of Hitchcock, but definitely worth a look. 8/10 Bethany Cox
