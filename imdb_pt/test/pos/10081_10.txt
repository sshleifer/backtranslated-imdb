Is it a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Of course, what were you waiting for from a movie called "BEACH BABES FROM BEYOND"? <br /> <br /> It's a "BABES in BIKINI" movie and has no pretensions to be different. Given, this is not "a room with a view" or "SCHINDLER list". If you wanted a movie like "A Room with a View," then you would not be looking at Beach Babes from Beyond. But if you're looking for a good Babes in Bikini movie with almost no plot, this is the one for you. This movie fulfills what it promises, and then some. It's pure 100% teen fun. <br /> <br /> There were many BABES in and out of bikinis. The movie was very funny and great to watch. These were some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in home video. <br /> <br /> Every high school kid should watch at least one bad movie like this. This is actually one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen. So, no shame, I say again ... If you're going to watch only one movie "Babes in Bikini", that's it.
