I must have been a bit skeptical when I went to the movies to watch the OSS117: French comedies tend to be so self-satisfied these days that only the stupid ones get to the top at the national box office. But I was surprised that although humor does not always reach the level of Monthy Pythons, the many references to the French view of the world in the 1950s, represented by OSS117, are hilarious and the director has been able to recreate the style of film production. this time with amazing fidelity. To summarize, a good surprise, not to mention the excellent performances of several minor actors. And at least once, Jean Dujardin's style (which can get on the nerves of many people) perfectly matches the character he plays.
