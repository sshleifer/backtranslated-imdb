An unusual but very enjoyable performance by John Travolta sets off this very entertaining comedy. His interpretation of the archangel is like a man of disheveled, womanish, obese ladies. And it certainly has a mesmerizing effect on the women you encounter on your trip to Chicago. John Hurt is very low in his role as chief reporter for Chicago Tabloid owner Bob Hoskins. Angie MacDowell plays a lot as she did her part in "Four Weddings and a Funeral". Maureen Stapleton is cool on one end. His comment, "Michael does not suffer fools," is just one of many memorable moments. Bob Hoskins is the only one of the top artists who can not connect, a little off the wall. Mostly you are there to see Michael take on a bull, hypnotize the waitresses and dancers in a Western-style restaurant, and demonstrate that he is a complete and free soul. It's a memorable comedy that is worth more than a preview.
