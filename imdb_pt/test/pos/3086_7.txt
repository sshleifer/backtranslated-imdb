This is a funny movie and I really like it. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood in a match. This is, of course, the common good against evil with Robin against the evil sheriff of Nottingham. The humor is for the most part, but still works well. A comedy for a night when you do not want to think too much, it's worth renting!
