I saw that in Sundance, one of the first years I attended the festival - it surprised me ... <br /> <br /> It went too fast, and I could never find it again. I figured it would pop up in a compilation somewhere but still no joy. My memory is blurred in detail - I just remember being surprised several times, and on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Does anyone reading this have any clues? Online, DVD, Shabby VHS copy - I'd try to make it worth it ... Over the years, I've probably seen more than 200 short films (I lived near Aspen where they have an incredible Shorts Fest in April). This is definitely among my favorites, and I hope to see you again! <br /> <br /> Many thanks to anyone who knows how to see it :)
