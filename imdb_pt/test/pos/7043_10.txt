"Rattlesnake! Watch out!" "Is that a bra you're wearing or are you expecting an assassination attempt?" "Spaz, what are you a homo or what?" "Okay, come on, guys! Feed Fink, he's our hottie." "You know they use the most sophisticated training methods from the Soviet Union, East and West Germany and the newest Olympic power, Trinidad and Tobago? " "Oh Spaz your old master of lies!" "What, no mustard ?!" "Oh my God, your nose is bleeding." "It will get even bigger now" "Our roundtable policy ... Henry Kissinger will appear. Yassir Arafat will leave, spend a weekend with the kids just hitting them." <br /> <br /> These and many other great lines make Meatballs a comedy of fame. Only in Caddyshack is Bill Murray funnier. He probably improvised half the lines. The high school actors seemed to have an explosion in the same film with him. <br /> <br /> Hilarious movie to watch at any time of the year, not just in the summer.
