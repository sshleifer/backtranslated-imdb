Wow, this is in my opinion the best sitcom since Friends. If you've had a day of crap, sit down with a beer (if you're old enough for that. If you do not have a beer) and watch a few episodes, it's the perfect recipe for happiness. /> <br /> The thing that I like the most is that everyone on the show is very funny and they all have a fantastic comedy. After a while you cling to the characters and really care about them. I think the secret of the success of the shows is that they have an enviable life. Doug is fat but still happy about it, he loves his wife, his job and his friends. The father-in-law is the fly in the soup, but nothing is perfect.
