Michael Radford did a great job taking this difficult piece to the screen. He made a play with a reputation for anti-Semitism and showed us that Shakespeare knew very well the humanity of the Jews. Radford said after the show, and I agree, that Shylock is his first tragic hero, the first of his characters to be undone by a compulsive and compulsive need for revenge. He also rightly points out that a man who was anti-Semitic could not have written Shylock's speech of "If you sting me, did not I bleed?" Radford is of Jewish descent and has chosen the good and bad of all the characters with gentleness and honesty. no character is free from flaws; No character is evil. Radford put the play in the 16th century, which gives a lush backdrop to the politics and decadence of Venice to project the words of Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to hear Radford talk about the movie, I recommend that you take as he gives details about life in 16th century Venice that illuminate many of the choices he made and give considerable extra depth for viewing. I hope the DVD comes out with lengthy comments. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons makes a beautiful portrait of Antonio, a man who resigns himself to bear the burden of his past mistakes. Lynn Collins, an unknown relative, gives us an absolutely flawless, impressive and detailed work as Portia. Collins is not only beautiful - she also gives Portia layers of intelligence and humor before the scene of the trial that I have rarely seen in any production of that piece. the rest of the cast also does a great job, with a remarkable performance by Kris Marshall as Gratiano, and a fine and subtle work by Allan Corduner as Tubal, playing the role for Shylock. Finally, while Al Pacino makes his strong (and noisy) performance, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he says there are no words but you can see all the emotions and madness flowing in and out of him as he realizes their fortunes change. <br /> <br /> If you like vintage movies, I can not recommend this movie enough.
