The commenter before me stated that this movie is the worst that ever was forced on him / her as a child. I have to say I loved this movie when I was little and I still love it today. The film has the best running theme of the whole family together. Considering the length of time the film was released, I thought the film was staged well. I just wish I could find a copy of it somewhere !! Of all the 80's movies I watched as a kid, that was one of my favorites. I know I probably attended at least once a week with my brother and my mother. I would definitely recommend it to someone I know or do not know. So if you find a copy of it, I suggest watching! It is wonderful and comforting.
