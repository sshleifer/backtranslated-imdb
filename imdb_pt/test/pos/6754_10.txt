I still can not believe Starevich did this movie in 1934. The animation is just perfect, and what's incredible about it, with all the advanced technology we have today, there are few animation studios capable of producing such a little gem . 1. has it all: a great story, gorgeous characters (although this is a kind of morbid beauty in some cases), special effects ... well, definitely not a children's movie, but it's a must see for anyone who is seriously interested in animation .
