A strange relationship between a middle-aged woman and a transsexual who is going to be a woman soon. Charlotte and Venorica, both stuck for their inanimate lives and do not know how to get out of them. Charlotte owns a beauty clinic, broke up with her aggressive ex-husband, and moved into an apartment alone, with all the furniture tidied up except her big bed. Veronica lives downstairs with her poor dog. She is sensitive and desperately bothered by her mother's visit and her bad relationship with her father. Her only hope is that the next transsexual operation will turn her into a real woman and then everything will be all right. All she can do now is wait for a certificate of approval. <br /> <br /> So these two individuals meet by chance and gradually they are all involved in the lives of others, there are some sparkles between them, but no one is brave enough to face the truth because they are not willing to accept the change as most people do. Eventually the ending is quite satisfactory and leaves some imagination for us to think about it. <br /> <br /> The great work of the director gives me a great impression, it deals very well with the development of the characters, the emotional atmosphere is quite complete. and intense. I'm also so obsessed with the gloomy lights throughout the apartment, Delphic, but full of desire. <br /> <br /> Two main characters are played by Trine Dyrholm and David Dencik, they are incredible in their roles, a very impressive one. the performance and chemical reaction between them is genuine and convincing. <br /> <br /> This Swedish indie film tries to find and change, no matter if you are homosexual or heterosexual, male or female, the strangeness of life exists everywhere, whenever you fall, you will be hesitant and perplexed, but at least do not be afraid, follow your heart and choose the right path.
