Once again, we are fortunate to see a beautiful opening scene where the work of the artists has been fully restored and we see this old grocery store on a corner with the snow falling gently. Inside are the rich colors of all goods, from production to canned and packaged products, medicines, sweets, etc. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is a story of such goods "coming to life" as animals on item labels, or a pie, or even a packet of cigarettes. <br /> <br /> The whole "show" is narrated by "Jack Bunny," an imitator of Jack Benny, with music by Master Leopold. Stokowski, who was in so many animated short Looney Tunes, lost count. Much of the humor is topical, so it pays to know who the "Little Egypt" and other characters are. The "aqua" Busby Berkeley type with bath sardines coming out of the can, and the tomato can dance were both smart! <br /> <br /> All of the above, and more, were in the first half of this cartoon of a size slightly longer than normal. The second half was about a King Kong type that escapes from the crate "Animal Crackers" and terrifies them all. That part was not much, and ended on a rather stupid note. Then ..... an "A" for the first time, a "D" for the second, becoming a C-plus or B-minus.
