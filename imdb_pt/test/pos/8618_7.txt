Catherine Brreillat is a French director who loves to provoke her audience. She takes us along to witness how a movie is made on the spot. The film in production seems to be based on itself, since the person at the center of the story is Jeanne, a director, very much like Mrs. Breillat. Jeanne acts as the real director's alter ego. <br /> <br /> Jeanne comes to a standstill at the start of filming. Not only did you choose the wrong time to shoot this movie during a cold period, but it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras. Jeanne has problems with the two main actors, especially the male leader who has trouble accepting the way the director decided to show it in the film; the leading actress is not an angel either. <br /> <br /> Film production, says Breillat, is a process like no other in a creative work of art. First, there is the writing period, in which, in this case, Jeanne wrote a play, which when it goes into production reveals problems that the writer / director did not think. There is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the girl in the story has her first sexual contact. What looked smart on the written page does not necessarily translate into an easy moment in front of the camera. The actor is made to wear a fake penis and has a lot of trouble accepting the fact that a makeup has to touch it in a way that he never thought would be touched by another man. <br /> <br /> The bright Anne Parillaud is as wonderful as Jeanne, the director. She makes observations about the production, the actors, and the team that fit well into the story being told. Gregoire Colin and Roxane Mesquide play the main actors, with all the insecurity that some actors bring to a film set. Jeanne has to massage her egos to get what she wants in the end. Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, Jeanne's assistant. <br /> <br /> "Sex Is Comedy" allows Ms. Breillet to give us her own opinion about movies in general. This is a great way to see how movies are done in a typical Breillat style.
