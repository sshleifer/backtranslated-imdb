I loved the movie "Eddie Monroe". The film had all the components that kept me interested while watching. I particularly loved the twists and turns on the way and the amazing end. Craig Morris has Brad Pitt's potential in looks and talent. His blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newman. Fred Carpenter took this movie to a new level. I loved the cast. The score, cinematography, talent, locations and script were incredible. I loved watching some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and talented director. He gives his job at 200%. The film has great texture. I hope there's an Eddie Monroe 2. I'd love to see how Nicolette pulls out after getting her money. Fred Carpenter's Eddie Monroe is the Hollywood level.
