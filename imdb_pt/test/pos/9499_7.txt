Gloria Swanson (as Leila Porter) is an understandably bored wife. Workaholic husband Elliott Dexter (as James Denby Porter) "lost his romance" along with his waist; he also smokes cigars in bed, eats onions and snores. He can barely remember his own birthday - which is frequented by caddish Lew Cody (as Schuyler Van Sutphen); the young man looks at Swanson's voluptuous figure and blatantly flirts. Soon, Swanson is attracted to Mr. Cody. So Mr. Dexter decides to try to get her back. Who will win? <br /> <br /> The three directors are fine, with Swanson being the most impressive in the crucial role of the ripped woman. Julia Faye grabs the supporting honors as Cody's other interest, "Toodles"; Off-screen, she tried director Cecil B. DeMille. DeMille's touch is evident; especially in an imaginary sequence in which Cody promises Swanson ... "Pleasure ?? Wealth ?? Love ??" <br /> <br /> ******* Do not change your husband (26/1/19) Cecil B. DeMille ~ Gloria Swanson, Elliott Dexter, Lew Cody
