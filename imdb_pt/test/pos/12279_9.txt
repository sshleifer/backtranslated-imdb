In the late 1960s, director Sergio Corbucci made four western barbs - the classics THE MERCENARY, THE GREAT SILENCE, THE SPECIALISTS AND THE COMPANIONS. Three of these, all but the SPECIALISTS, are constantly appearing on the top ten lists when the spaghetti westerns are sorted. Until recently, all I had seen was a poor quality compilation with a little English, a little Italian, a fuzzy image and it was almost incomprehensible. Now, having seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles (still in two languages, though), I can safely include the SPECIALISTS in this group of four classics. Johnny Halliday is very good as the charismatic Hud, a notorious hand with the gun returning to Blackstone to investigate the death of his brother, who was lynched by the people of the city for losing their savings. It involves a voluptuous beauty that owns the bank, a Mexican bandit leader, El Diablo, who was once friends with Hud, an honest sheriff who dreams of better days, and a small band of hippies - well, it was the late 1960s, and hippies were everywhere, even apparently in our westerns. It's not a western desert, filmed in the Alps somewhere, and it's lovely to look at. There's a bit more nudity than I expected in a western, but that's not a bad thing. Sylvie Fennec is adorable as Sheba, who may be Hud's niece, or girlfriend of the dead brother ... this was never clear. This film deserves to be seen, and once again we order a good DVD with all the embellishments - I think the experts would be as known as any other Corbucci western, and that's a big compliment.
