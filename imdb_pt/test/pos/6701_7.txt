Okay, let's get this out of the way first: like a movie piece, Lifeforce is crap. As a bit of cheesy entertainment for SF fans, it has a lot of merit. If you like to watch those old black and white SF B movies - giant mutant spiders / alien monsters roaming the desert - you're really going to have fun with Lifeforce. <br /> <br /> Bad things: The story makes little sense and the acting is very poor. Good things: Special effects are kind of decent; has a history centered in the United Kingdom (that is acclimated in London) that gives a different sensation to the majority of the films of the SF; and has the well-endowed Mathilda May (playfully named "Space Girl") wandering naked. <br /> <br /> In short, it's fun. <br /> <br /> I've seen it a half dozen times now, and every time it shows up on TV I make time to watch it - admittedly this has to do with Ms. May nude - but it's also to do with to enjoy some unpretentious and foolish SF.
