I think it's great how the Chiller picked up this series and showed it to this generation. Film production has come a long way, especially with special effects, and in order to watch the archived shows they never knew existed, they will certainly be able to see progress against the now. MONSTERS is neither lame nor spectacular, but it's fun. It takes creativity for the kinds of stories that have emerged and each generation seems to have its own horror series. This particular series was not as horrifying as Friday the 13th, The Series, not as adult as Freddy's Nightmares ... it was something that a whole family could watch and still laugh at and frighten at the same time. I'm happy that the Chiller Channel shows this in its line-up, I'm about to get the episodes I lost when I was growing up.
