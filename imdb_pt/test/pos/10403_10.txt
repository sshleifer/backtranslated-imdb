I, for example, loved this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a "typically Asian horror," where you see a ghastly ghost (usually a woman) who is out there scaring people. You almost do not see ghosts for most of the movie, but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and the characters is great. This is not the movie for you, if you're into gore (eg, Saw, Hostel) or "surprise frightens" where the material appears in you (Hollywood horror, horror movies), but this film has an underlying factor "scary" throughout the entire movie that I loved. Noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to the horror between the ridiculous remakes and the non-original crap being cast by Hollywood in today's society. <br /> <br /> Please do not let the documentary filming style turn you off (why should this ?!). It's far superior to the Blair Witch Project because, on the one hand, acting on Noroi is brilliant and really makes you feel like you're watching something you should not be seeing. <br /> <br /> Noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. Only a few movies managed to reach my Top 5 horror; and this movie has a solid # 1 spot on my list.
