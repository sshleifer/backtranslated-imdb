This movie makes for the Infantry what Das Boot did for Submariners. If you liked Das Boot then this is all you really need to know. <br /> <br /> This is a well made piece of cinema. On a par with Das Boot. Basically, it follows an elite German infantry company, "Stormtrooper," which leaves garrison duty in an idyllic Italian coastal town and is immediately driven into the chaos of the disintegrating Russian front. <br /> <br /> A good war film illuminates both the folly and the brutality of war, and at the same time it gives us insight into the experiences and the essential humanity of those who struggle. This movie does that. The movie is full of drama and action and so it's fun on that level as well.
