These cartoon writers are relentless with their playful (and entertaining) puns. The first shot we see here is a prison on the island, with the following written above its great gates: "Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose". Inside the prison, the first sign we see is "Welcome: sit down." They then show an electric chair. <br /> <br /> Corny gives way to smart, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With the pen in hand, he literally draws a door beside him and then escapes through it! In a short time, he crossed the United States, crossed Canada and is in the northern part of the country. It is there that we see the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and of course our hero Droopy, known here as "Sergeant McPoodle". He has a mission to capture the criminal from Alka-Fizz. Then, with his faithful blue horse, he goes out in the snow to track down the wanted wolf. <br /> <br /> From that point, we have the normal story: Droopy always being one step ahead of the wolf. , no matter what the latter does .... and both characters are engaged in some wild and very funny jokes. Droopy even comes out of an eagle's egg on top of a mountain. There is no place where the wolf can go - or do (plastic surgery!) To escape the intrepid "Sergeant McPoodle". No one by the way in the history of cartoons may have more exaggerated reactions than this wolf every time he sees his enemy! His screams, facial and body extended in horror each time is a big part of the jokes of the vision. <br /> <br /> You think this drawing of a joke would be monotonous, but no. It's more of a good thing for Tex Avery and the gang, just one of the 24 completed "Complete Theatrical Collection" cartoons with beautifully restored looks.
