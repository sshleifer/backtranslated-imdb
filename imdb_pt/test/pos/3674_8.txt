Wish it would be released, as I would love to see the finished product! We saw the unfinished version before it left. I loved all the characters and actors. Anyone know if it's on video yet? Would love to see it again. Definitely worth rent if it is not going to be shown at the theater. I had trouble finding it because they renamed it.
