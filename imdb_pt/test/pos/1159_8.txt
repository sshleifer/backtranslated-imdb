Writer / director John Milius plays a little-known incident in American history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways. The result is a great adventure tale that shows two of their stars in memorable and grandiose roles: Sean Connery as the astute Arab sheikh with an unexplained Scottish accent, and Brian Keith as President Theodore Roosevelt, eager for the chance to put this "big stick" for good use. <br /> <br /> Helped immensely by Billy Williams' glorious widescreen cinematography and a magnificent trail of the ever-reliable Jerry Goldsmith, this initial effort seemed to herald a talent for qualification among contemporaries. Lucas, Coppola and Spielberg. Although Milius glimpsed his screenwriting skills for JEREMIAH JOHNSON and APOCALYPSE NOW, his career seemed to have a downward turn not long after he started driving, sinking in disgrace as CONAN THE BARBARIAN and RED DAWN. <br /> <br /> Here he is waiting for him to find the way back.
