I still can not believe that computer graphics are capable of creating 3D images. The moment I hear from my friends in a forum, I swear to myself that I will make myself watch it. <br /> <br /> I managed to watch parts of it in a mall where they had many Advent Children DVDs and showed on some laptops for sale. Obviously I was very happy, but still it was not enough. So I went to YouTube.com to look for the movie. All I created were dedications of music videos. Until that fateful day ... I found it. I watched despite all the distractions because I knew I had to watch, otherwise I would be called a loser. <br /> <br /> Enough of me more about the movie. As if Final Fantasy VII was not enough, they made a movie about it! My favorite part was the end of Sephiroth's life. Cloud's OmniSlash could not be better. But I would not ruin the show for you. You have to watch for yourself! Get the DVD now!
