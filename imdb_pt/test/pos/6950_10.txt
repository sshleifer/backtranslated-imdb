This is an incredibly convincing story, told with great simplicity and grace. The story itself is the object of the film, although the setting is beautiful. Performance is underestimated, albeit superbly, because the characters themselves appear in all their eccentric simplicity. <br /> <br /> This work of art will probably not be appreciated by those who watch "casually" movies without attention. It takes work to be brought to the story, but once you get involved, the capture is complete!
