I consider this story lovingly and sensibly written as one of the true masterpieces of the screen. After seeing this movie, originally on the silver screen with my mother in Los Angeles, California, when it first came out, many years passed before I had the opportunity to try it again. The beauty, the calm and simplistic elegance and the tranquility of the film for me, away from many others of its kind. Yes, tears still come to my eyes when I see it, and I hear the chorus of that one song in life. maybe still, today my number one movie of all time is the most beloved. I hope this classic love story is appreciated and appreciated by our future generations.
