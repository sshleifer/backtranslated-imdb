The story takes place in rural Germany on the eve of World War II, a unique setting with two British agents held by the Germans on a farm. As they are not yet technically at war, it seems that both sides must have realized what was to come. Both agents (Bruce Lester and Ray Milland) escape into the field and separate. Milland happens to the gypsy woman Marlene Dietrich one night while she is alone in her camp preparing dinner. Their meeting is a surprising and captivating scene, not so much for Milland, but for Dietrich, who takes sensuality to a new plane. Milland disguises himself as a gypsy to hide from the Germans, but remains committed to his mission of locating the scientist who knows the formula for a new poisonous gas, but who is also not a committed Nazi. Hollywood's view of life and gypsy customs is predictably portrayed, but the underlying knowledge that they would be one of the targets of extermination by the Nazis adds some tension. The film crosses the line between being a serious story about poison gas and the urgent pursuit of formula, and a colorful but not very convincing love story between Milland and Dietrich. However, both are very good; it's the film's fault that did not give them or their relationship a dramatic enough realism, relying on and exploiting obvious cultural differences for questionable comedy purposes. However, there are some tense and interesting points here and there, the surprise meetings with German soldiers and Gestapo agents, where Dietrich reads a big palm and Milland almost as good at pretending, and a dinner of Germans of various stripes in which the ad comes by the radio that Germany was attacked by Poland and everyone stands and gives a hard salute. Mitchell Leison may have missed some opportunities here and there, but he totally took advantage of the others.
