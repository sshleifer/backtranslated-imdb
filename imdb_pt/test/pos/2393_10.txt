I was invited to the September 30 Eddie Monroe performance and was pleasantly surprised by the story, the great acting and the talented direction. I found it hard to believe that all this talent could be found in an independent film. Powerful performances by Vario, (Uncle Benny), Sara (Jessica Tsunis) and Morris (Eddie Monroe). The support cast was filled with colorful and fun characters. This movie reminds me of one of those movies that you will look at in 20 years and discover that it has cast many actors in stardom. Much like "The Outsiders," where Tom Cruise, Emilio Estavez, Patrick Swazey, Ralph Macchio and others can be found. Look at Hollywood, there are new stars on the horizon and they can be discovered in a movie called Long Island, "Eddie Monroe." Good job!
