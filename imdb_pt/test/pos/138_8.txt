Although sometimes I was the only one in the cinema who was laughing, this is the main pleasure I took from the beautiful "Thirst" - laughter. Although it sometimes seemed that the film had an identity crisis and did not know if it was a tragedy or a comedy, the blackest of black humor shone at regular intervals. <br /> <br /> It helped, of course, that the standard of action of all involved was marvelous, and that I was somewhat obsessed by the evil, sometimes evil, lady who was magnificently elegant, no matter how bloody and she was malevolent. has became. <br /> <br /> I read reviews that suggested that this movie was overlong. I do not think like that. In fact, the last scenes, exciting and hilarious (I mean, brown shoes ...), by turns, were among the best in the film.
