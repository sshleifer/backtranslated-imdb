I've seen this movie many times and I never get tired of it. It's about a man coming out of the closet, that he does not know he's inside. Kevin Kline's character is a teacher and when one of his former students announces that Kline's character is gay, people in his town begin to speculate whether he's straight or gay. Kline's character begins to wonder if he's straight or gay too. The acting is absolutely fabulous and hilarious all over the cast. I found the film very funny and moving. I love this movie, it makes you laugh and it makes you feel good while watching. I recommend this movie to everyone, you will have a great time watching.
