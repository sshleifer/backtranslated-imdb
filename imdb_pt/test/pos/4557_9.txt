This movie has it all! It has a good plot, good acting, great landscapes, adventure and some brilliant jokes! Chris Farley plays Tommy Callaghanhe The successful company 'Callaghan Auto Parts' has to go down the road to prevent the company from dying after Big Tom dies. The problem is that Tommy does not know anything about the puzzle blocks and needs the help of the Callaghan Auto Parts worker, Richard (David Spade). From the moment the two idiots hit the road, the movie is a lot of fun. If you like clowning with a great plot, you'll love it because the jokes keep coming thick and fast and the movie will make you laugh out loud! It was so sad about Farley's premature death in 1997, but one credit to his genius is 'Tommy Boy'. Get it, chill out and enjoy this brilliant antics!
