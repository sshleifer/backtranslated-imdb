Walking With Dinosaurs is an incredible, educational documentary for both the Dinosaur Ignorant and Dinosaur Lovers (like me). I admit, I was too young when I saw this on Discovery, but I was obsessed with it right away. (Spoliers !!!!!) The series contains 6 episodes, ranging from the late Triassic when the dinosaurs were only evolving into the Upper Cretaceous at the end of the dinosaur reign. When I first saw this movie, it was as if I had actually traveled back in time. The majesty of the Diplodocus, the adventures of Opthalmosaurus, and the version of the tender mother of the T-Rex surprised me and my family. It's an incredible film, and I believe the BBC was able to do exactly what they intended to do. Incredible work!
