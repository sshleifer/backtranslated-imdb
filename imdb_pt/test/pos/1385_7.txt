"The Planet" is an impressive piece of film production. For only Â£ 8,000, Stirton Production has produced one of the most original science fiction films for a long time. Starring the physically intimidating Mike Mitchell, the film is a mix of great special effects, strong storytelling and well-planned action. From the battle of opening space, to the end of the beat, everything about this movie appears well above budget. <br /> <br /> To start with the special effects, although certainly not the standard "Revenge Of The Sith", they are level, if not above, the likes of Babylon 5 and Farscape. And for a price cut too. The detail and the movement are superb and capture the imagination from the beginning. The design of everything, ships, weapons, entities is unparalleled. The imagination and the creativity involved are a real surprise for a movie of that budget. <br /> <br /> Another surprise was the strength of the story and the bow it takes. There are some twists and turns, most of which are well written in the script, surprising and well presented. I was surprised by the fact that, two years ago, and imagined for the first time 15 years ago, how relevant some aspects of history are to today's society. With events around the world, there may be a certain resonance with the lengths that mercenaries are forced to go to survive. <br /> <br /> Even the sound effects are visible, as are atmospheric music. The use of light and costume further enhances the professional appearance. Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen looks like a desolate and lonely place. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, this film looks like 10 if not 100, the budget spent, and this is testimony to a creative and hardworking team of people, from the director, to the cast, to the effects via producer and sound team. Wonderful effort, I recommend you get your hand on a copy as soon as possible
