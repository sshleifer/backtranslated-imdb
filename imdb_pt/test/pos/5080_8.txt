Imagine that you have just flown for 18 hours. You've been on a business trip to South Africa. You're a well paid professional. You lived in the US for 20 years. You're in your thirties, you have a wife, a little boy, and another baby on the way. One thing, even if you have a green card, you're still Egyptian. In transit, you are asked to come with two security guards, and then you will know that you are overloaded, hooded and chained and after a brief (but still reasonably civil) interrogation you will be prosecuted! This is what happens with Anwar el Ibrahimi at the beginning of the film. His is a story of pain and (literally) torture. It is one of several lines of history. One follows his wife's attempts to get more information. One follows the (cold) bureaucrats behind the delivery. Another story deals with the family of the man leading the interrogation of Anwar the Ibrahimi. There are a few other stories too and in the end they all come together perfectly. Although most famous actors such as Reese Witherspoon (as the troubled pregnant wife) Jake Gyllenhaal (as the CIA rookie forced to attend interrogation in North Africa) and Meryl Streep (as Corine Whitman), are the most unknown actors who carry the story and give is the heart. For me, the actor who plays the unfortunate Mr. El Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) was the heart and soul of this film. His portrait of a man in distress was surprisingly well done. It's almost like he's being tortured for real! Also the Israeli actor Yigal Naor was very impressive as the part concerned the man of family and leaves the extremely cruel head of torture. Hard to watch and not exactly fun, but still worth it.
