Prue and Piper bring Dr. Griffiths to his house to save him from the Shax killer. While Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadows as she beats the demon, Prue and Piper fight and chase down Shax in the streets to destroy him. However, they are filmed and exposed live on television news as wizards. They become national feel with a crowd in front of their house. Phoebe trusts Cole and goes into the underworld with Leo asking him to summon Tempus and reverse time while a fanatic woman shoots Piper, who dies. The source proposes Phoebe to stay with him and in return he would save his sister. Phoebe accepts the agreement, and the time is reversed by the time Shax is attacking Prue, Piper and Dr. Griffits. <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a good but incoherent episode. With Piper dead and The Power of the Three destroyed, why should the Source reverse time to save it? But this dramatic show is certainly one of the best in Season Three and leaves viewers eager for the next episode. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Back in Time"
