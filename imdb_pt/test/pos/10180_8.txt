When you watch Superman's animated shorts of the 1940s, the likeness of the plot can become a bit boring - the opponent is most often a mad scientist in a hidden place, threatening Metropolis with some evil invention - death rays, mechanical monsters, electric earthquake, magnetic telescope, what you have. <br /> <br /> This is refreshingly different. The bad guys drive around a car, shooting and bombing, but the center of action is the gold train (in which Lois Lane travels, as the only reporter, it seems). Train movies have their own typical ingredients, from the Assault to the Great Train of 1903, and some are featured here: decoupling moving cars, running on the rooftops, picking up the steam locomotive from the back, struggling with the engineer, switch turned to divert the train on a side lane, the fall (of people or the whole train) from a high bridge ... it's all in the few minutes of this beautiful piece. <br /> <br /> But it would be a superman movie if he did not do some incredible feats (involving balance and high-precision positioning) to finally win the day. If you are a fan of train movies, do not miss it. It is in the public domain and can be downloaded legally from archive.org.
