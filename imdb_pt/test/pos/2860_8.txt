Nurse Betty is really an interesting movie. I think we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in a soap opera are real, that you can not explain them with any means that these are just actors and not real people. <br /> <br /> 'Nurse Betty is not a nurse. In real life, she is an ordinary housewife working in a restaurant. To escape her amazing husband and the problems in her miserable life, she became a very dedicated fan of a novel. After she witnessed the murder of her husband, she enters into some kind of shock and loses all adherence to reality. She thinks she's in love with one of the characters in the soap opera, a doctor, and decides she's going to visit him and start a family with him. The killers, however, think she knows too much and go after her to kill her. <br /> <br /> As I already said, the subject is well recognizable (if you leave the professional assassins and the murder of that) and the movie was funny. The story was well directed and the actors did a good job. He had everything he ever wanted to see when he was watching a comedy. I give it a 7.5 / 10.
