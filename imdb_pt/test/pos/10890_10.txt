We all played Halo and Socom and GTA and Resi etc. but none of them can withstand GE007. The game itself is great. I literally burned my N64 playing this great game along with Zelda OOT. This game alone has built the mold that is essential for all modern shooters. Also, the multi-player is great. The Story mode is worth being played a hundred times over and over. It's a great game for when your board and you just want to shoot some people on top and there are endless unlocking openings. (cheats, Aztec, Egyptian, god knows how many multiplayer characters, and the three difficulties, as well as the famous difficulty '007. Our modern games are great, but when you sit down and play this game you have the feeling that few others games And with the online features of the latest shooting games, we rarely see these two old guys in two death game styles, and when we do that it's not as good as these games, and when you get bored with the storyline, endless mysteries, flaws and Easter eggs to be found and taken advantage of. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best shooting games of all time.
