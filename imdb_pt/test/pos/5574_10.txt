After 2 years using this site for movie reviews, I finally registered on IMDB to give Farscape a "10". The writers, cast and crew of the series proved to be the unambiguous masters of the science fiction genre. Even those who do not usually appreciate science fiction should be encouraged to give this exceptional series a try! <br /> <br /> The virtues of Farscape are simply too numerous to list, but one of them stands out above all else; the quality of the writing is incredible. I have not heard of this dialogue since "Blake's 7." In fact, Farscape looks a lot like a "Blake's 7" with good special effects and a bit more romance. <br /> <br /> Everyone, have fun!
