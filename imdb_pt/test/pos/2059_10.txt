This movie is a great bustle of action and comedy, it looks good from the start, there is no boring construction. The chemistry of the leading roles increases the excitement and anticipation of the end, although my suspicions have not been fulfilled. The special effects worked brilliantly and were believable! I would have liked a different ending, but it still gave me the emotions. The plot unfolds well, however, it is a movie that you have to watch from start to finish carefully to pick up on every detail, to fully understand and get the most pleasure. <br /> <br />
