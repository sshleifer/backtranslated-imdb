It is sometimes difficult to watch these self-proclaimed "message films" from an earlier era, apparently simpler, without a certain degree of cynicism. The issue of racism and religious tolerance is an issue that has been introduced to us from an early age, and as we grow older, teachers and figures of authority have sought less obvious but equally effective means of conveying the message. 'The House I Live In (1945)' is as subtle as the 'message movies', and does Frank Sinatra seem to be treating his audience as a child? in fact, perhaps that was the point, since the short film was, undoubtedly, mainly aimed at influencing the young movie goers. Nonetheless, I found myself strangely affected when Sinatra threw himself into that heartfelt patriotic speech about what it really means to be an American? and I'm not even American! Released just two months after the end of World War II, director Mervyn LeRoy greeted the war-weary public with a message of tolerance, unity and, above all, hope. The music is not bad either. Frank Sinatra's new face ?? already a star, but still not the superstar he has become? opens the film in a recording studio, playing "If you're a dream" with a full orchestral accompaniment. When, between the songs, Frank goes out for a smoko, he watches a large group of children bullying a young Jewish man, his teasing provoked purely by his different religion. Ol 'Blue Eyes quickly puts an end to this childish behavior, delicately marking the bullies "Nazi werewolves" and rebuking their irrational prejudice. He then sincerely and kindly lectures the group on the sheer nonsense of racial and religious discrimination, assuring them that every American culture, however, differs from ours, is still American in the heart? unless, of course, you're one of those damn "Japanese". There is a hint of hypocrisy in begging for racial tolerance while presenting a nation as a collective enemy, though you can hardly blame Hollywood for not being so enthusiastic about the Japanese situation in 1945. <br /> <br /> Sinatra directs his Aponte home with a wonderfully thrilling version of "The House I Live In," which was written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol. When the composer heard the song for the first time in the film, he was furious because the filmmakers had completely excluded three of his verses, which he considered crucial to the message. These omissions were probably due to time constraints, but Meeropol understandably was not very kind to them, and supposedly had to be expelled from the cinema. When it was released, "The House I Live In" was considered such an important short film that it won a Golden Globe for "Best Film for Promoting Goodwill International" and an Honorary Oscar for all involved. In 2007, it was considered "cultural, historical or aesthetically significant" and added to the National Library of Film Library of Congress, which was as I knew. While his approach may seem a bit cheesy sixty years later, this film remains quite watchable thanks to a young man named Frank Sinatra.
