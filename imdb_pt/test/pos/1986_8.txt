I've always believed that a movie that's plot is centered around a virtual reality game never sounds like it's anything special, but eXistenZ proved that I could not be more wrong. This movie is unbelievable and, while very entertaining, offers so much more than that. From beginning to end, this film conceptualizes you to the point where you can have so many ideas, you can not come to a final conclusion. David Cronenberg has a knack for it, as he does so many things. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ is pure Cronenberg; the way it is written and the way it is directed is very unique to his style and this can only be a good thing. Cronenberg set himself a clear target with this film and this was to keep the audience guessing what he did with apparent ease. His taste for the grotesque is not as prevalent in this movie as in The Fly or Naked Lunch, but there are still some elements, such as the game's pods and how they are made, that can make the audience shudder. Regarding your previous work, eXistenZ is more a combination of Videodrome and a less violent Scanners, an incredible combination. Putting the film in the not-too-distant future was a very good decision, as it allowed Cronenberg to be extremely creative with the surroundings of the films and also allowed him to visualize more concepts, allowing a less inhibited writing. It was important that the film did not become confusing and Cronenberg avoided it very well, keeping things relatively simple. Also, if he wanted to make an undisputed movie, he would know how to do it much better than that. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ has an extremely talented cast of character actors and they all perform very well. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives prominent performance as the game designer who spends more time out of reality than her. Leigh is sexy and commander in her role as Allegra and she actually gets her teeth into the role. The emotional outreach it shows in the film is particularly impressive, making it completely believable (if you believe in anything). Jude Law is also good and is very convincing in the fear of deploying his character. The chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film a little more flavor. Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are just two of the great actors who give more depth to the film with very colorful performances. The cast of the movie is not great, but eXistenZ definitely has the ethics of "quality is better than quantity", which works very well. <br /> <br /> In addition to being fun and exciting, eXistenZ addresses social issues such as control and loss of self. This further demonstrates the film as an intellectual vessel and can also explain why it was not a big Hollywood hit. EXistenZ has a lot to offer and, while not everyone likes it, those who enjoy Cronenberg's work or who enjoy science fiction will almost certainly enjoy this movie. It's one of those movies that needs to be watched with an open mind, but it's something really special.
