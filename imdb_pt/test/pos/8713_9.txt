Of all the 48 films of Brigitte Bardot, "Une Parisienne" is widely regarded as (one of) the best. What we see is special: for once the plot has a value of its own, it does much more than just provide a cheap vehicle for BB's loaded sex appearance. <br /> <br /> This movie is your true and well crafted. light comedy with a good and coherent story. Set in the government circles of France in the late 1950s, it entertains from beginning to end. Providing lots of fun twists and some slapstick - all staged by at least three protagonists, including Bardot. <br /> <br /> "Une Parisienne" (= French for "Parisian") focuses on telling a story, not on showing Brigitte Bardot. Brigitte serves the plot very well using her talent for acting in light comedies. <br /> <br /> When you settle down on your couch on a Friday night, tired and tired from a week's work, just call "Une Parisienne". This movie will make you feel better.
