I was privileged to be one of Still's photographers on the "Grand Champion" set and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days I worked on the film. I've been in the photography business for 25 years and I've worked on 16 films and I can not think of a time when I liked to offer my work more. The kids were wonderful to work with and the little Emma Roberts has so much energy that it is a real trip. She even picked up one of my cameras during the rehearsal of the Stockshow scene and started filming. Some of your pictures were used for PR. I could have made more money working for a production with a bigger budget, but I doubt I would have had fun and stuck around with so many great actors and wonderful West Texas people like me.
