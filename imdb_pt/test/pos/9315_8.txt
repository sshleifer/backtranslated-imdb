I've heard a lot about the Holocaust Porn and his twin movie Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead. Both films are interchangeable and were filmed at the same time in the same place, with the same actors changing clothes for each film (and taking them out). If you're expecting the genius D'Amato displayed in movies like Buio Omega or Death Smiles on Murder, you will not find it here. However, this movie has a charm that the exploration fans will not be able to resist. Where else are you going to see hardcore sex mixed with a zombie / monster and your huge penis that strangles and chokes women to death? Only from D'Amato. There is a quantity of blood in which many of the men are beaten to death. The film is set on a beautiful tropical island. As far as I know there is no subtitled version, so if you do not speak Italian you will not know what's going on ... but who cares right? In all honesty, Gore fans will likely advance through hardcore sex. And if someone is actually watching it just for sex, they will definitely be offended instantly. I can only imagine fans of modern pornography tracking D'Amato's production and coming across this atrocity! Of the two I find Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead far superior. But, do not bother to watch if they are cut. The Holocaust Porn is an extremely low budget, as expected. Even the monster does not look as good as the character of George Eastman in Anthropophagus. The film is worth watching for laughter and completing its mission in the film D'Amato.
