A very funny movie. The "do" by Michael Douglas is worth watching for this movie for no other reason. I would like to see him do more of these low life roles. He was great, as were all the performers. <br /> <br /> The movie looked like an American Roshomon, only funnier and easier to watch because it was American and did not need bad subtitles! <In a funny movie with a laugh every minute, two of the best were with John Goodman (he's not somebody I'm crazy) - 1. He's telling the priest about Jewel doing something he liked and saying "I had to clean the smile on my face. " The look shows that he is not smiling and clearly is a guy who never smiles, but probably does not know it. 2. The scene at the end between Goodman, all dressed up for Jewel in his police uniform, and struggling with Reiser bent over a table ... and the two then protesting that they are not gay with another character who happens on the scene - that's all deserved a special Comedy Academy Award.
