This movie tries to escape the typical 'I am fighting because I am forced to defend the motherland. The Nazis are all bad, I am against them (typical of the German war films). As? Not to mention much about it, and only referring to war and prisoners of war. However, I would like to see a German movie that would be somewhere between the end of Come And See and the "Das NAZI's" Das Boot. I say this because, excluding this factor, German films are the best portraying World War II and the German side. You easily see some of the German hierarchical relationships, very different from those of the US Army. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that tries to get a real view of what Stalingrad was, and I was not there, and I doubt most people were there right now, but if I chose a movie describing this battle , it certainly would not be the American Enemy At The Gates. Why do I say that? Because even the best soldiers are not heroic and, given the conditions, they can consider life itself instead of the motherland. This holds true for all ranks and in the end you see von Paulus setting the example.
