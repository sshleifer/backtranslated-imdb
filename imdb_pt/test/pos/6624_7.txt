After watching Ingmar Bergman's Skammen, I had many feelings, but, most notably, I was dissatisfied. I heard a lot of hype about this movie, but I even thought it was missing. Do not get me wrong, I can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film, but as far as depth and emotion, I was not so impressed. I found the characters unpleasant and unrealistic, which detracted from the dramatic effect. Moreover, the fact that the war was false led me to feel that the emotion was not real. Dramatic war movies, in my opinion, are much more effective if events (not necessarily the story itself) really do happen. I think that of all the films that try to show the brutality this falls in the middle as to the effectiveness.
