Usually, I'm a comedy guy. I rented this from the movie house with the comedy and I thought "Albert Brooks! Awesome!" and we rent. It looked like romantic comedy, and I remembered I hated them, and had the mindset to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong? <br /> <br /> Although this is a romantic comedy, it is represented by an incredible supporting cast and cast (Brooks, Hunter, Cusack and Nicholson), and everything works well on its own. The script sounds real and not forced, as this could be happening at the news station you're watching at night. It takes your emotions and makes you like Hunter and Brooks and detest Hurt, which makes the ending a bit nice and fruitless, but it shows how you do not need a happy ending to finish a movie, you just need a true ending, which is what everyone has. Not everyone's life ends well, and it appears in the Broadcast News. Maybe people do not like the ending because it's not the typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies ... but it works, it's real and it's cool. Broadcast News is a classic in its time, and a good romance movie with "Casablanca". Well, maybe not so loud, but it's the only other novel I can think of that I like. <br /> <br /> Broadcast News: 9/10.
