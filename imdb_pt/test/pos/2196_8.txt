Last year, I fell in love with Sweeney Todd's version of Tim Burton, so I wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and found this one in the library. Although I think Burton is the best, probably because I like filming rather than theater, this is still a great production in history. I have not seen any of the other versions, but I'm trying to get my hands on them. <br /> <br /> After seeing Johnny Depp as Todd, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role, but George Hearn does a fantastic job. Angela Lansbury is great as always and the whole corner is fantastic. I saw myself singing together. This is a game you will not want to miss, but try to watch it before you see the movie version so you do not have a biased view like me.
