Read a biography of the late George C. Scott and you will discover why he was so talented. He was asked by an interviewer what his secret was when he did every character he played. Scott answered, he had a burning fire inside him. In one of his last interviewers, he sadly revealed that he had lost the way. This was not the case when he starred in the movie "The Hospital". In this offer, he plays the talented Dr. Bock, medical director of one of the best hospitals in the country. However, life has caused him some disabling problems, such as the loss of his wife to divorce, the alienation of both promising children, and, worst of all, the belief of being physically impotent. At this point, he is now becoming complacent, morose and often fancy various ways to commit suicide. To increase his growing list of personal obstacles, his main reason for being, his hospital was besieged by students and neighborhood protesters, incompetent doctors like Dr. Welbeck (Richard Dysart) and a mysterious doctor. who is killing patients and doctors, because he believes he is "the wrath of the lamb." (Barnard Hughes) Few choices are left for Bock. One of them is the promising doctor Brubaker (Robert Walden), whom he confided, saying, "If there were an oven here, I'd lay my head on it." The second is a lusty young woman named Barbara who is attracted to Bock because he acts like a wounded bear. Paddy Chayefsky wrote the screen game and Arthur Hiller did a great job in driving that dark and dramatically interesting story but a vehicle, however, lit by the fire of George C. Scott. ****
