1956 was the 20th Congress of the Communist Party and Prime Minister Krushchev made a speech denouncing Stalin and the Stalinist purges and gulag labor systems, revealing information that was previously prohibited, publicly revealing horrible new truths, which opened the door to a new Soviet Union. Cinema led by Mikhail Kalatozov, once head of Stalin's film production. This film features a Red Army that is not victorious; in fact they are surrounded, in a retreat mode, with many people dying, including the hero, on a set of footage after 06-02-41, the German invasion of Russia when Germany introduced the Barbarossa Plan, a blitzkrieg invasion designed to bring about a speedy victory and enslavement of the Slavs, and almost succeeded, nearly 20 miles from Moscow in what was a Red Army extinction, a devastation of human losses, 15 to 20 million Russians died, or 20% of the entire population. Historically, this was a time of great trauma and suffering, a psychological shock for the Russian people, but the Red Army maintained and prolonged the war for another 4 years until they were victorious. During the war, Stalin used the war genre in films to boost morale, featuring ultra-patriotic, strong, idealist female heroines, suggesting that if women were so successful and patriotic, Russia could expect at least so much from its soldiers. Stalin eliminated the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced him with an individual and daring leader who managed to kill many enemies, an obvious reference to Stalin himself, who has always been portrayed in the cinema as a bold, wise and victorious leader. But Kalatozov changed that performance, since THE CRANES ARE FLYING was made after Stalin's death, causing a political meltdown and creating a worldwide sensation, winning the Palm D'Or Cannes Film Festival, as well as Best Director and Best Actress (Tatyana Samoilova). , awakening the West to Soviet Cinema for the first time since Eisenstein's IVAN THE TERRIBLE in the 1940s. This film featured brilliant, breathtaking and extremely mobile camera work from its extraordinary director of photography Sergei Uresevsky, using spectacular photos of crane and tracking, war images, battlefields, Moscow and crowded streets that are extremely vivid and real. Another brilliant scene shows the main heroine, Veronica, who has never heard of her lover, Boris, in the 4 years at war, so he is given as dead, but she continues to love him, expressed in a scene in which she runs in direction to a bridge with a train following behind her, a moment when the viewer was wondering if she could play in front of the train, instead, she rescues a 3-year-old boy named Boris who was about to be run over by a car. Another scene captures Boris's death on the battlefield, which dies meaningless, and his thoughts spin and swirl in a beautiful assemblage of trees, sky, leaves, all spinning in a kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams, including an imaginary marriage . with Veronica. This film presents the famous phrase: "You can dream when the war is over". In the final sequence, when the war is over, the soldiers are returning in droves in the streets, Veronica discovers that Boris has died, everyone is happy and encouraged by the return of the soldier, but Veronica is desperate, distributing flowers to soldiers and strangers on the street in a extreme gesture of generosity and altruism revealing "white and gray cranes floating in the sky". The film was released in 1957 in Russia and, according to some critics, "the silence in the theater was deep, the wall between art and life had fallen ... and the tears opened the doors.
