It took a film loan to Columbia for Gene Kelly's home studio, MGM, to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films. Cover Girl also became the signature of Rita Hayworth for the GIs and their fantasies during World War II. <br /> <br /> Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn, where Rita is a dancer and Phil Silvers. Of course Kelly gets in there. <br /> <br /> Hayworth catches the eye of millionaire Otto Kruger when Kruger loves and loses Hayworth's grandmother. In some flashback sequences of the Gaslight era, Hayworth also plays his own grandmother with Jess Barker playing the young Kruger. You may recall that Jess Barker was the husband of that other legendary film redhead, Susan Hayward. <br /> <br /> Broadway producer Lee Bowman is also attracted to Hayward, but he is not interested in nostalgia. He wants her for his magazine Ziegfeld Follies and in fact, the biggest number of Cover Girl is the title song of the movie. It is well done in Follies style. Hayworth also begins to sing Sure Thing in a number of the Gaslight era and in the only song of the show not written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, Hayworth also does an old English music hall number Poor John. When I say sing, like everyone knows Rita's mouth words. Singing here is done by Nan Wynn. <br /> <br /> The biggest hit of the show is Long Ago and Far Away, which is introduced by Gene Kelly. It was one of the greatest hits of the time of World War II and one of the biggest sellers that Jerome Kern has written. It happens, in fact, to be the favorite of an aunt of mine who with my uncle will celebrate 60 years of married in September. Long Ago and Far Away was nominated for Best Song, but lost to Swinging on a Star. <br /> <br /> What really sets Cover Girl apart and what makes it a landmark film for Gene Kelly are the two numbers that Put Me the Test and the Alter Ego number. Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B. Mayer had refused at MGM, to give Kelly creative control of his own material. Kelly later said that the alter ego number was one of the hardest things he's ever tried in his career. In it, he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate. <br /> <br /> In fact, after another film, Holiday at Universal, Louis B. Mayer never lent Gene Kelly the rest of the time he was at MGM. And he got creative control from then on. <br /> <br /> With dazzling technicolor cinematography, Rita's red hair and Gene Kelly's boundless creativity, Cover Girl was and is a classic and it will always be this way.
