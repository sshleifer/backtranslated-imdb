<br /> <br /> After reading the review of the unemployed reviewer, I went to a "Radio" exhibition without knowing what to expect. Fortunately, the unemployed critic now appears to me anyway, a frustrated film director / film critic. Your criticism is insensitive and totally unnecessary! <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will make you laugh, it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of pause! <br /> <paraphrasing a phrase from Actor Ed Harris in the final scene of the Barber Shop "... and all this time we thought we were teaching Radio, the truth is ... He was teaching us.He treats us all the time as we would have liked to have dealt with in part of the time! "<br /> <br /> Yes, the film pulls the strings of the heart. Yes, it's emotionally manipulative and yes Cuba Gooding Jr. (In an Oscar-worthy performance) is a little overdone at times (see the Christmas Day dance scene), but you know what? AND! Every now and then the community of America needs to be reminded of what tolerance can do for our great country. We need to be reminded of how big we can be. <br /> <br /> This is a solid cast. I was particularly pleased to see S. Epatha Merkerson, portraying Radio's mother, doing something outside the Law and Order. I've always wondered, is Mrs. Merkerson a great actor or is the quality of writing delivered buy a strong cast in Law and Order. After watching this movie, it's easy to see that she's really a great actress. <br /> <br /> Also joining the cast in small but important and powerful roles is Alfre Woodard as the Director, Debra Winger in a career. - resurrecting the role of Coach Jones' wife and Chris Mulkey as the protagonist, Frank Clay. <br /> <br /> We can no longer see the performance of Ed Harris as trainer Harold Jones. After reflecting on this movie and having grown up in the southern US, it's hard to really appreciate Mr. Harris and his contribution to this movie. As coach Jones, Ed offers a solid and solid performance like that of a man on a mission. Coach Harris will not let the city or circumstances divert him from what he knows in his heart, it's the right thing to do. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie, make sure you stay close to the final credits. You will be a treat like the real James Robert 'Radio' Kennedy, now in his 50s, is shown, still leading the T.L. Hanna's football team comes on the pitch every Friday night. <br /> <br /> One final note. If you were a teenager from the mid to late 70's, this movie is worth the price of admission, just for the soundtrack!
