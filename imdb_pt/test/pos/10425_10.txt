I do not know which movie or version Jeff saw, but this whole movie was amazing, not just Poitier and Going. The story was fascinating, full of suspense and engaging. And for the guy who complains of historical accuracy, stay true. Yes, there were some black delegates in Indian territory, but they had no authority to arrest whites outside Indian territory. As a general rule, they did not "patrol", but wielded warrants only against criminals. I found it odd that Corby did not seem to have "some" Indian friend. I know the number of them has diminished, but it still seems strange to me. Even as Corby returned to his people, his Indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless.
