I saw this movie when it was released and it is certainly touching. I liked the point of view of a child who came to know that what she was thinking of her was not really true. It's a shard for that little boy. And your quest to find out who she is. And before and after she knows about her, the relationship between her and her foster mother. This is a beautiful view. An R Rahman adds his stress for good re-recording and songs. In this film mani ratnam does not exaggerate or give advice (as in Vuyire), but simply narrates the characters as they are. And because of that, the film strikes exactly the audience. The swimming pool scene of chakkarvarthy and nandhitados did not convey perfectly what it meant. Mani Ratnam improved incredibly.
