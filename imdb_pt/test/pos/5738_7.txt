A group of teenagers decide to take the pajama party to an abandoned school where, 27 years earlier, a horrible massacre has happened. Unfortunately for them, the person responsible for the massacre still lurks the abandoned school hallways and he is not happy with their presence. <br /> <br /> This movie is not like most of the modern teen slashers we've seen. It is much darker, much more suspenseful, no wise assassin, etc., and I liked it for those reasons. From a cinematographic point of view, it's not great. Performance is below average. The writing was very bad and full of cliches, containing random references to American horror movies, some that did not even make sense (like ... "Did you see Scream 3?", A girl asks. nothing to do with walking through the doors of an old school, so that does not relate to this movie). But, hey, it's a horror movie, these are part of the fun. In addition, the underutilization of characters was strongly displayed in this film. There were six main characters (not including The Security Guard) and, to be honest, only three or four were actually used. Two characters (the symbolic black and another girl who was not important enough to get a label) barely spoke: among them, I would estimate about five or six lines in all. In addition, girls (with the exception of one) were not formed enough to differentiate them from each other. They could have replaced each of the girls repeatedly throughout the film and I would not have noticed the difference. The rhythm, however, works just as horror begins from the beginning and rarely ceases. The atmosphere is well used and the direction reveals some really scary moments. . . though, the overall appearance is a bit cheap due to, what I assume, low quality camera equipment (and operation). The end, although I liked the idea that they were going, was pretty badly done. He felt rushed and unexplained enough to make it effective. With the amount of time they spent running looking for nothing, they could have spent a little more time on completion to make sure they would not feel like a random event played for no good reason (which is a modern horror flaw movies are afflicted with). However, ignoring some annoying problems and trying to focus on the first 98% of the movie rather than the end, this really is a good modern slasher that should be checked especially if you are a fan of Spanish and / or Horror atmospheric. Slasher Elements Required: <br /> <br /> Violence / Gore: There's a good bit of blood and blood, done realistically, but no buckets. The violence is extremely well done, not in excess, but rather brutal in some points. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: Little, and with the hottest girl in the movie. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer: Well, security guards are hardly considered 'cool', but this guy is pretty mean. His scary smile was creepy. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: The suspense is high level. . . very tense, very well done. There are also some extremely scary moments that fuse scare jumps and scary atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Mystery: Absolutely none. <br /> <br /> - embarrassing dance scene: Of course: between a couple of guys and a half involuntary woman in the flashback. <br /> <br /> - Classic movie quote: "One More Trophy". <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 7/10. That may be stretching it, but Session 9 fans may want to take a look simply for the similar tone and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
