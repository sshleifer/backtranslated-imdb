If you want to see real evidence of what a misguided and uncontrolled government can do for "non-popular" people, this movie provides that. Read what some people are saying about the "Patriot Act" past after September 11 and then watch this movie. Worth it? Do we really want to give our liberties to these people? Regardless of what you saw on TV, you are not fully informed until you watch this movie. I apologize for quoting another reviewer, but it needs to be repeated: Roger Ebert of Siskel & Ebert said: "What's interesting is if you're looking for people who are unbalanced zealots ... you do not find them among the Branch Davidians, you meet them between the FBI and Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, these are the people in this movie that deserve to be feared, I think. "I think every person responsible for 9/11 needs to be brought to justice, but I think the government has not demonstrated a history of honoring its duty to protect people's rights, and this film proves this dramatically.
