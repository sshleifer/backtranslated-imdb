Bright movie! I regret to say that it resembles me a bit like Pulp F., but so it is with the post-cellulose era. Many photos are automatically compared to him because it's just a gangster movie. But this is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, look like something from Tarantino, which is a good likeness! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is about a guy in Australia who is mingling. with a tough crime gang, and ends up in a deep debt. For his assistance, his deceased brother (does anyone remember Val Kilmer in True R.?) To pay his debt and escape the gangsters who are in his wake. The gangsters are cold-blooded, but enjoy playing chess and focus on educating your kids! They also receive grandma's tea while planning a bank robbery and have problems with what to do with their children during the robbery. So a good-natured gangster movie with Heath Ledger in good shape (though I'm not a fan) and Bryan Brown in great action as a gang leader.
