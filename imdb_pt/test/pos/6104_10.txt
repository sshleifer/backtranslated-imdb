The main point of the film, IMO, is that Joanna's entire life was only a series of facades. The movie opens with her secretly dying her gray roots and hiding the used kit in an empty tissue box. What's weird is she's hiding it from her husband. If she has to hide her worldly things from her lover, one can bet she is hiding even bigger things from other people involved in her life. <br /> <br /> When Joanna accidentally hits Cory, she leaves the scene to call the cop. By the time she returns, the police and the ambulance are there, as well as the people in her community, noting "What kind of person hits a child and leaves it there?" Well respected in her community, she makes the decision to be quiet about what she did. But, she never realized how difficult it would be to keep the facades ... Great movie - I've seen it many times!
