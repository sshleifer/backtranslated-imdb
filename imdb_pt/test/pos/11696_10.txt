Crackerjack is a funny movie, everyone in the bowlo saw it and everyone says the same. The cheese wheel was a big part of the movie, also the speaker "Dear Mr. So and so you left your window right on". Or when Jack goes home and lies down on the couch and breaks a beer, "bowls is hard work," made me laugh. And when your roommate shows interest, joining the club and calling the bingo number. Jack bought all raffles to win the meat platter. Great bloody movie if you are in lawn bowls as you can relate to it, if your not a grass pitcher to forget it I think. The Evans Head Bowl would rank as the best club in Aus, friendly people, great company. Hi to Evans Head Bowlo Steve
