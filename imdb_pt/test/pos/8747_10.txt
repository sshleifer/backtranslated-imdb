I was disappointed with the recent (2000) American remake of this English miniseries. Although he followed the plot line closely, it seemed to leave the heart and soul of the original out. Not to mention the addition of heavy and offensive "messages" ... So my advice is to skip the modern remake and stick with the original. It is much longer, but exciting and totally well done. Interesting, complex and textured, without prejudiced self-righteousness ... and it's beautifully filmed too. <br /> <br /> I find it annoying that these heartless remakes of great foreign films have so much Hollywood fanfare on the Oscars (Although I liked Benicio Del Torro getting some well-deserved compliments ...)
