To qualify my use of "realist" in the abstract, not many elderly people I know go around pretending to be famous maestros, blind people, etc. - and I was never old. Those minor issues out of the way, the relationships between the characters in this film and the emotions expressed there were completely realistic and genuine. In fact, although we are not yet 30 years old, I could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife. For those who do not die young (there's a great phrase in the movie about it, when the two best friends are talking about dying young, and one of them says - and I'm paraphrasing, we missed our chance - we just have to stay out), we will all be where these characters are someday. I know that many movie goers would rather be driven from reality rather than stay with it, but even they could appreciate the sweet memory of our mortality - and the importance of living life to the full - that this movie is.
