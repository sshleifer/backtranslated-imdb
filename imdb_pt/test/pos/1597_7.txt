A movie to split your viewers. Only criticism points to its funereal rhythm, excessive zooms and persistent and persistent stares among the protagonists. Proponents point to the powerful performance of Dirk Bogarde and Pasqualino De Santis' reference photography from Venice. Taken into consideration, this may suggest an indulgent and romanticized elegance for the nobility of homosexual love (1971, when it was becoming legally consensual). In fact, Visconti was able to make a movie richer and more complex than a single vehicle. He united his ideas - weaknesses and everything else - in a meticulously rhythmic arc. <br /> <br /> Inside this, in fact, is the central performance of Bogarde's Aschenbach. Instead of being a gay homosexual, Johnny, he manages to give a pathetic composer beaten up by the tragedy and misunderstood integrity that sees salvation in Tadzio. Its hypnotized staggering around an increasingly infernal Venice after the boy is a direct metaphor of the artist's tenacity for truth in the teeth of the dilettantes' mob (and this is explicitly cut off with such a flashback). <br /> <br /> Mahler's music is possibly a bit overused, although it is quite appropriate. The Italian overdub is an anachronism, but fortunately the performance does not suffer much. 7/10
