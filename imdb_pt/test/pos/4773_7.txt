... But it's Minnie and Pete's too! Yes, the grumpy captain may not look like Pete, but hey! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters, both are very sweet and friendly. Curiously, Minnie is more of a lady in this than she is today and Mickey is less than considerate of what she is now. Pete is still the same old bad guy, but he looks a little different. <br /> <br /> In this famous episode, aboard a small steamboat, Mickey, Minnie and some minor characters have lots of fun and lots of irritation. Even in his first appearances, the three main characters are very developed. <br /> <br /> I really like this episode, although overall I prefer Mickey Mouse in the future. I like the animation, the theme of the steamboat and the music, the clever jokes - and, of course, Mickey and Minnie! <br /> <br /> Like many early cartoons, this is very random, Walt created a very basic storyline and ended up adding gags to "gearing up". There is also a side parrot character that is very annoying and quite unnecessary. These are the things I do not like about it. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about this episode, that a color version was not made for it (or gone, I've never heard of it)! <br /> <br /> Anyone who likes just Mickey Mouse and Disney will like this.
