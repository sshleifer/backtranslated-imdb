Surprisingly good film made following the Exorcist on a young woman who becomes possessed by a spirit after she goes to a des-sanctified church to restore a life-size and life as a crucified man. The play was Christ and the two thieves, however, Christ was long ago sold. The problem begins as soon as the figure is removed from the cross and seems to come to life and seduce the woman. From there, it becomes a battle for the soul of the girls. Scary, scary and way better than you think the movie works because your cast sells events that are decidedly adult. It helps these people to be really flawed and easier to relate to. I really enjoyed this movie, and seeing it again for the first time in at least a decade I was shocked at how good it is. Definitely better than any of their many ridiculous titles makes it sound like.
