What struck me most about "One True Thing" was how it was when the daughter mentioned her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie. As depressing as the subject was, it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being caught off guard by the revelation about the fatal illness of a 2/3 character in the film ("Love Story", "Terms of Endearment," etc.) . <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William Hurt give very strong performances that do not go over the edge. The characters they interpret look human; they are not perfect people. (Arguably, you can not say that about the "Martha Stewart" character Streep plays, but over the course of the film, I found her noble character in a non-sapping way. She's dealing with her situation the best way she knows. "One True Thing" is a family drama, not sentimental, in which the tears in the end were well deserved.
