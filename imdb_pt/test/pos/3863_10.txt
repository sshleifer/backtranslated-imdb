The 20th Disney cartoon is often criticized by many people as "mediocre" or poor in quality, but it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Too bad that "The Aristocats" does not get the credit they deserve. I personally see this as one of my favorite Disney classics. <br /> <br /> Despite being greatly underestimated, it is one of Disney's funniest classics. It's full of hilarious moments (some hysterical). <br /> <br /> Edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain in the movie, but it's a perfect comic relief. He's one of my favorite Disney villains because he's so funny. <br /> <br /> Every scene with Edgar and the dogs Napoleon and Lafayette chasing him are among the most hilarious you've ever seen, especially when Edgar takes his motorcycle down to the river and around the bridge, with the dogs running behind his. This is hysterical! <br /> <br /> But the classic humor does not come only from Edgar or the hunting dogs. Other characters also have their moments. <br /> <br /> On the issue of quality, it is not perfect, but remains at a high level. Even after Walt Disney's death, these artists knew how to maintain loyalty to Walt's spirit and "The Aristocats" is one such example. They do not do it like that nowadays! <br /> <br /> As usual, the legendary actors of Disney express the characters. In this case, we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram. <br /> <br /> The characters are cool in general: Thomas O'Malley, Duchess and her 3 kittens, the Roquefort mouse. , the street cats, the English geese, the hunting dogs and the horse. The human characters are also included: the eccentric and retired opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, the old comic lawyer of Madame Georges Hautecourt and Edgar himself! <br /> <br /> On the soundtrack, there are some cool and captivating songs, like Thomas O'Malley's theme (but I can not remember the name), "Everyone wants to be a cat" and "Aristocats" (sung by Maurice Chevalier), for example. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in Paris (France) in the year 1910. Above all, this is a joyful, enjoyable and very enjoyable film. A timeless classic that is often underestimated and overlooked, but very dignified. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be in the Top 250.
