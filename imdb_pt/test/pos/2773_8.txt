My kids loved this movie. We watched every chance we had. It was fun to have a fun movie. we watched it as a family and we all enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch with no uncomfortable point you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and would love to see it again. even after all these years they remember that. that Amy Jo Johnson was a really cute girl. All my boys had a crush on her. they loved her like the pink power ranger, and that's why we watched this movie to begin with. (As you can tell I'm rambling a bit to fill in the LOL lines). but seriously it's a fun movie and worth watching. Disney, please give us a DVD or replay!
