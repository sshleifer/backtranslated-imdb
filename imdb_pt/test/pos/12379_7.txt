* SPOILERS * I do not care what anyone says, this movie is hilarious. This is the sequel to Jack Frost, a movie about a killer snowman. The snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber, but the truck crashes with a truck carrying DNA manipulation chemicals that make the human DNA join the dirt or , in this case, snow. The first movie was boring and eventually the snowman is destroyed, pouring antifreeze into it. <br /> <br /> Or they thought. <br /> <br /> This movie happens about a year after the second movie. . Some scientists resurrect Jack Frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals. No explanation is given why they do this, they just do. Meanwhile, the sheriff who arrested Frost on the first one goes to the Bahamas. Unfortunately, the snowman comes with it. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all. There are talking carrots that can rise, ice cubes that explode when you put them in the mouth and killer snowballs. Yes, murderous snowballs. They even say "Dada!" like babies. I will have to give the manufacturers of this credit. Snowballs are some of the sweetest little things ever dreamed of. I wish I could have one as a pet. Frost finally freezes the island, as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence key weather patterns. <br /> <br /> Then there are the actors. There's Manners, the FBI agent for the first movie, except here he's wearing an eye patch. YARR MATEYS, TRAINING ME OF WOODS, BEING AN FBI AGENT! YARRR! And then there's the stereotypical British adventurer and the stereotypical Jamaican black with dreadlocks. And finally, Captain Fun. The most fruitful man on the face of the planet, without any. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, but it's hilarious. I laughed at my ass all the time, and I recommend this to anyone who likes a good "bad" movie. outside
