This documentary is as unique as the subject. And while D'Amato's clip was erotic, the movie manages to show some decent clips from the movies you can remember from the old days, Cinemax late at night ... One problem ... Joe did hardcore porn sometimes mixed with erotic even mixed in their gore movies. Gore movies are cult classics, going like $ 20 a pop for a dubbed copy on the net (not peanut for 20-year-old movies, folks). I want to see why these are cult classics. Also, as sweet as Joe looks (he looked more elegant than one might expect), the guy liked to crash. Both "Caligula: The Untold Story" and "Emanuelle in America" ​​show us rape, snuff and bestiality (in both, you'd be surprised at how far it goes in "Caligula II" with that, if you can trace it though these scenes might be uncomfortable in a documentary of a people's career, hey, he did it ... Also, I would have liked to see more interviews from people with whom Joe worked ... Maybe it's just me wanting to see as Laura Gemser looks like nowadays ... I still think she is a goddess and one of the sexiest women who has ever graced the genre.
