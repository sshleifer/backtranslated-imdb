so I will not disagree with the critics, but I really did not feel so thrilled with this movie. I was a little hesitant to rent it, since I'm going through some of the same things that the protagonist should be experiencing. however, I rented thinking I might experience some catharsis, or at least understand that I am not alone. while I understood the irritation of the protagonist with his careless cousin, I did not feel his inner struggle with isolation as much as I would like. I felt that much more emphasis was placed on his disruptive cousin, surpassing his welcome. is a beautifully filmed movie and I really enjoyed the use of silence to bring the feeling of isolation.
