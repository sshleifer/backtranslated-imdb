It was 1983 and I was 13 years old. I watched Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents were working. After it was over, I wanted to talk to someone about it right away. It turns out that my best friend also watched and became our favorite movie. Every weekend after that, we would watch until we could recite it. We woke up his parents late at night laughing hysterically. We begin to love the main character, Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I'm not saying this is a great classic. Although it is for me personally. And I understand that the whole Talk of the Valley Girl becomes annoying, but that was in the '80s. But deep down in the film, it's a love story and familiar, but good. The girl meets the boy and there are sparks on both sides, an immediate connection. Julie's friends do not like him, he does not fit, does not go to school, has no money. They like her the most with her ex-boyfriend, the soccer player, even though he's an idiot. She makes the greatest sacrifice - her own happiness for the happiness of her friends. And she has these really nice hippie parents. It is one of the first Nicholas Cage films and his first leading role. One minute he is absolutely hilarious and the next one incredibly touching and romantic. Your friend Fred is also very funny. If you were a teenager in the 80's, you will love this movie or at least it will bring back memories. It's no longer my favorite movie, but it's still one of my favorites, probably in my top 10. I look forward to it being released on DVD if they release it. You can go to Deborah Foreman's website to sign a petition to be released on DVD and there are two movie soundtracks that are required if you like 80's music.
