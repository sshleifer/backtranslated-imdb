I have to say that this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge is eyeing things that no one would notice, so in Office Space. Hemakes a statement about the doldrums of society and that the survival of the strongest is the dream of popcorn in 500 years. Pop culture and mass marketing of affluent companies tend to dominate the day. Yes, there is a lot of potty humor in it and it is to get the story moving and your point of view. But the genuine frustration on the face of Private Joe Bowers is invaluable and in some cases we may relate to him at some point in our lives. <br /> <br /> If you do not like humor, look at it from a different point of view and look at it again. I delayed watching it twice to really enjoy this movie for what it is? And with said after watching twice? I'm going to read a book now.
