I like Tom Hanks, and he is one of the few actors that attracts me to the theater, regardless of any questions I may have about the movie. I worried about Mr. Hanks coming back to "light comedy" as this is the arena where he made the transition from TV to the movie, remember "Big"? Well, "Charlie Wilson's War" is not light comedy. It is a political satire and an extremely well written political satire. The script is the star of the film, and the work of Aaron Sorkin is one of the best offered this year. <br /> <br /> Mike Nicols keeps the whole escapade together, delivering a movie that goes on. 90 minutes too fast (time is all in comedy, and nothing is funny if it creeps). Nicols 'choice in scenarios and lighting is also reminiscent of the TVs of the 1970s and' 80s, a movement deliberately used to root the play in the period. <br /> <br /> The return to use of work models and digital special effects photography also increases the retro look and credibility. Note to production designers on their choice of images: I know the difference between an F-16 and a MiG, and a Bell and a Hind. But that may have been part of the joke as well. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in Philadelphia. It was interesting to watch and listen to the public NOT get the historical references to their own history. History tends to repeat itself because recidivists have forgotten what happened the first time. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mr. Hanks and Chameleon Phillip Seymore Hoffman. Sorkin's script is brought to life by these actors, and the entire production team is at the top of the game. <br /> <br /> Heartily recommended.
