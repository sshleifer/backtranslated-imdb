In "Checking Out," Peter Falk plays an elderly New Yorker who summons his children so they can stay with him before he plans to commit suicide. As the movie progresses, we can see everyone's faults and other problems. While some people might interpret this as a "comforting" movie, I mostly liked the character of Peter Falk not letting anything take him down, and even engaging in a little obscenity from time to time. <br /> <br /> may not be the best movie ever, but still worth seeing. Long ago I think Peter Falk has the perfect look to play this kind of paper, with his glass eyes and everything. Also starring Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold and Shera Danese (Falk's real life wife).
