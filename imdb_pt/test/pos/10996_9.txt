I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a relaxing, fun-filled and thought-provoking movie. The absence of sex, vulgarities and violence contributed to a pleasant evening. I especially liked the Buffalo scene, but that's probably because I live within walking distance of there. Even so, this film could have been produced in any city; is the theme that is so important here. I am so grateful that Manna From Heaven has fallen upon us. Try it ... you'll like it!
