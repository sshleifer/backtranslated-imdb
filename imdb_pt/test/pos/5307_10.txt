This is an excellent movie and was immediately put in my top ten (trust me, I know movies!). It's one of the movies that really makes you think, not necessarily about the plot, but about yourself! The film is about a 15-year-old boy (Leland Fitzgerald) who kills an autistic boy. he is sent to the youth salon, where he meets Pearl Madison, his teacher. His relationship with Pearl slowly grows and eventually Pearl decides to write a story about Leland and his colleagues, but as he approaches discovering Lelands' motives, he discovers that he must deal with his own problems first. <br /> <br /> A great movie and a must see with good music by the elves and a fantastic score! Watch it!
