Take someone you love or want to love and go see this movie. <br /> <br /> He plays in all the right places. <br /> <br /> All the other critics here have said it all. Maybe the cynic is not impressed. <br /> <br /> They just seem to like the things that make you depressed for days. <br /> <br /> This movie is Ga-. Run to be with you for life. <br /> <br /> I am so pleased that the director is not trained by USC. <br /> <br /> This validates my premise that there is a lot of mediocrity and compliance. in the movies these days. <br /> <br /> It's because of the mentality and endogamy of USC. <br /> <br /> Hooray by Jeff Hare and Richard Marcus, cast and crew. Well done!
