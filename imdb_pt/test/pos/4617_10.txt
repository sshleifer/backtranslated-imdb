I have to confess that I fell into the cynical trap of believing that the Australians could not do drama unless it meant a lot of crying, and I'm Australian. Sad, is not it? Although this movie involves crying, it is not a dramatic cry, its sincere emotion shines. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie is a movie. I knew what the final result would be when I started watching, so I tried to guess who it was. I lost by a mile. <br /> <br /> I was shocked when I discovered that the director, Murali Thulluri, was only 21 when he made this film. I'd love to shake your hand. He knows how to make a movie. I hope he has more. <br /> <br /> All the characters we encountered before the main credit (about 12 minutes) are an anti-hero. All of them disturbed in their own way and all of them selfish like the next. Even when they are friendly. <br /> <br /> The saddest scene in the movie, and there are some that are difficult to watch) is the final scene in which we are formally introduced to the real main character and we are told of his nephew. This scene made me cry. <br /> <br /> My faith in the Australian drama was restored. We are masters in comedy, but I was getting bored with comedy. <br /> <br /> Murali, if you check this, you touched my soul and so I can only thank.
