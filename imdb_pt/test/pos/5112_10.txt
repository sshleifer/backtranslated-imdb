This is a great movie. There were several parts of the movie that I liked. This movie is very funny! Visit Ernest Fun Club's website at www.ernestfunclub.com There are several movies, like the following: Ernest goes to camp, Ernest saves Christmas, Ernest goes to jail, Ernest in the Army, Ernest goes to school, Ernest returns to run Slam Dunk Ernest etc. I recommend these for family movies. All star Jim Varney try again visit www.ernestfunclub.com What is Ernest's best movie? In my opinion, there are 2 Ernest Goes to Camp and Ernest Goes to Jail. So if you've never seen Ernest P. Worrell it's time to go see him. You will find it quite satisfactory "not what I mean"?
