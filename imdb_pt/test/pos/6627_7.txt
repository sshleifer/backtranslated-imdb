Shame, is a Swedish film in Swedish with English subtitles. The film is about a husband and wife named Jan and Eva. They live on an island working as farmers. There is a war going on and soldiers begin to attack people on the island. Once the war gives a little to Jan, and Eve is stuck next to the opposite side. Once released, even more problems happen and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in a situation of war, life or death. Winner of the CEC Best Foreign Film Award at The Cinema Writers Circle, Guldbagge Award for Best Actress (Liv Ullman, who plays Eva) at The Guldbagge Awards, NBR Best Foreign Film and Best Actress at the National Board of Review and NSFC best actress, best director (Ingmar Bergman) and best film at the National Society of Film Critics Awards. Shame, has good direction, a good script, good performances of both Max Von Sydow (who plays Jan) and Liv Ullman (who plays Eva), good cinematography and good production design. Shame, it's a well made and well made story of how people in a desperate situation sometimes do what they can to survive. The movie has a powerful message and it's a good movie. The reason I'm not evaluating this movie is because it's not a masterpiece like some other Ingmar Bergman films, like Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal or Persona, for example. The film did not have as much impact on me as I thought and lacked the thoughtful and philosophical dialogue of Ingmar Bergman. While nowhere near being one of his best movies there is still much to like about Shame, and it's a good movie. I probably would have liked it better not to have seen some of these other Bergman masterpieces.
