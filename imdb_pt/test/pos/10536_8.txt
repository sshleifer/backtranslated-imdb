I saw this movie in Galway Film Fleadh the year he won the best short film. I have to say that I thought the direction was fantastic and the performances of the top cast members were very memorable. Both main castles are definitely names to watch. <br /> <br /> The final shot on the cliff was fascinating and I would like to meet there if I was waiting for the end of the world to happen. The kiss was definitely a great return, done with great enthusiasm !! <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the film was filmed on film, and I heard that the DOP won a prize at the Tribeca Film Festival for their work on this film and I must say .... well deserved it. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who was a teenager in the 80s. I brought back some great memories and some scary ones.
