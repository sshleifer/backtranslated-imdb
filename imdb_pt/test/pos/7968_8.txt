Once you sit down to watch this movie "A Cannon for Cordoba", you get the feeling that it will be great. The reason? The film begins with an exciting track by noted composer Elmer Bernstein, who gave us memorable themes such as "The Great Escape and the Magnificent Seven." In fact, when you read the opening credits, the cast is none other than George Peppard as Captain Rod Douglas, you know you'll get action and a lot of it. Also, when you see actor John Russel playing General John J. Pershing, you know he has a heroic saga. The story is taken from the annals of the Mexican revolution and involves the US in a dispute at the border with the Mexican bandits crossing the Rio Grande in the early twentieth century. Among the most brazen of the rebel leaders is General Cordova (Raf Vallone). With his army of Mexican revolutionaries, he attacks Pershing, kills his men, and steals some valuable pieces of artillery. As the United States Army can not legally enter Mexico, Captain Douglas is sent on what is scheduled for a suicide mission, without orders and without the help of Pershing. Your mission is to retrieve the Cannons, destroy a rebellious fortress and bring Cordova back alive. Selecting the toughest, toughest, most experienced, certainly the most insolent men available, Douglas enters Mexico and attacks the almost impregnable fortress. The dramatic action follows, as well as a lot of explosive excitement. If someone asks for criticism, I would say the choice of the heavyweights. Vallone and John Larch are not very menacing. Not so with the men on Peppard's side. Pete Duel and Don Gordon (who is superb). However, this movie is recommended as a good preview. ****
