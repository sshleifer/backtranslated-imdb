When one refers to the realm of independent cinema in the United States, it often infers that this means that the filmmaker or the people behind the project had a lot more creative freedom and did what they wanted. This is not always the case today, unless someone is a solid "author" and creative freedom still comes with the proviso that it is necessary to find a distribution with one of the independent divisions of the great studios or to be chosen in some way low-level festival at a worthy film festival. But Putney Swope, Robert Downey Sr.'s film about an African-American African accidentally promoted to director of advertising guru in a producer, * is * independent film, the kind of work that accompanied the tastes or The Night of Romero The Living Dead and Cassavetes Faces, at the same time that they do not achieve a typical distribution of studio, but they cause waves, kicks and names in the world of the cinema. For all your moments that are rough and raw, it is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It's also a movie that is funny, very and terribly funny. Sometimes the sense of humor is so ridiculous that it is almost impossible not to laugh, from the mere appearance of President Mimeo with his wife to the dialogue speeches of the ads that the Swope team puts as "I can not eat an air conditioner" . a true "soul" voice. It's as smart as the audience that is targeting, which is anyone with two brain cells to mount who can see that this work is not offensive or * very * shocking because it is made to shake the cage, and this makes it pretty good in the first five minutes. Once passed, Downey Sr continues with his kind of filmmaker with nothing to lose: his protagonist is part of Fidel Castro, part of Isaac Hayes around 1972 (and yes, it is 1969 in the film) and part hard ad with a sequel of shots to make Mr. Space in the Jetsons seem kind. And do not forget those minor characters, dear God. <br /> <br /> There are so many memorable lines and moments that it's hard to keep up with. From perhaps the most hilarious unsuccessful assassination attempt on any film to the only advertisement for a Face-Off skin cream that includes lines that would give South Park a run for its dirty money, for just a few bucks with Jack's face The films of Hill interpreting the Muslim that continues chatting with Swope and that boy with the nun that curses a storm and impresses Swope quickly. It's a very straightforward message about media and publicity, but there are also many powerful moments when you realize racism in America, sometimes without having to make more than a gesture and sometimes doing something HUGE like having black panther types following this way and that around Swope's advertising scheme. And for a low budget production (I mean, super low, hence the comparison with Night of the Living Dead and Faces) Downey has some really good actors, all non-union, and it's hard to imagine that some of them might have had their first time on the camera here. It should be mentioned that Downey's style does not make him perfect: he is rude and sometimes very crazy and old-fashioned for his own good, and I'm sure I did not. I have some of the underlying mood of a couple of ads since I am a full generation after these ads went live (although the "Miss Redneck Jersey" was definitely not lost on me). In general, this is one of the best periods of time, a stinging satire and a feature with a predominantly black cast that is very well-known of what comes from an excess of energy regardless of skin color. It is, as one might say, "good s ***".
