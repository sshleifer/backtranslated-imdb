Some of these seemingly very real moments stand out. A manic sergeant Slaughter defeated then champion Bob Backlund with a riding whip after Backlund showed him on a fitness test. The Welts were all over the Backlund! Sarge made Iron Shiek look like a daycare provider! Slaughter also pitched a challenge for anyone who could break his feared snake control.

He claimed he was the true giant at 6'7 "and challenged Andre long before Big John Studd in 1984. Adrian Adonis used his menacing" Good Night, Irene "sleeper to take the competition. He was a menacing figure, and George "the Animal" Steele was far from a great pleasure for people.Even Jimmy Snuka was a scary sight when he left the opponents maim until Ray "the Crippler" Stevens handed a piledriver on the cement floor Snuka, a bloody mess, all these encounters happened a decade before hardcore wrestling was spoken.
