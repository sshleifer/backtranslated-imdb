Haggard: The Movie is the real-life story of Ryan Dunn, and his girlfriend who betrayed him, also with the help of his two friends, 1. A skateboarder living for nothing, and 2. The attempt to be a scientist funny (which does not really work) played by Bam Margera and Brandom Dicamillo. The movie Haggard The Movie also has a lot of Jackass characters etc, but to say it was written by Bam Margera and Co.. This is a very weak attempt, it seems to me that it was written when he was bored, or like a project they did not pay much attention to. Bam's girlfriend Jennifer Rivell, who plays Glauren, Ryan's girlfriend who basically betrayed him, again very misunderstood by Jennifer, another actor that some people may be interested in is Steve aka Hellboy, played by RakeYohn, that his character does not seem to be with the story, again bad acting, also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very annoying. but worst of all, it's Raab's character, the voice sounds like a smoker who basically has throat cancer, I also think he could have been improved! Overall I think the characters in this movie are not with the story, as in a scene, it would be in a certain character, a minute later, a different scene, different character. <br /> <br /> To say this is supposed to be a film, a kind of documentary, is not interpreted by the characters as a documentary, the acting makes you think it is an inexpensive attempt to make a movie with your free time . <br /> <br /> In the middle of the movie, we began to lose focus on the main character Ryan Dunn, although much attention was given to Bam and Brandon. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is OK, if you laugh at things that are not very funny, stupid stunts, terrible acting and the occasional nudity scene! Also I think there are many scenes of not talking and just music! 7/10
