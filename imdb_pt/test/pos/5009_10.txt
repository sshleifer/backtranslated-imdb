I say, remember where and when you saw this show because I believe that if Fox gives Talk Talk a chance, Spike will be up there with Conan in a few years because as Conan he's incredibly funny and seems to be grateful for have their own show. which adds to the mood. The funniest parts Spike has had so far are The Idiot Paparatzi and Comedy For Stoners and if you're not stoned and getting CFS, what does this say about you? <br /> <br /> In short, this show is funnier in 25 minutes than the SNL in an hour, so let's hope the Talk Show gets the attention it deserves, like half an hour extra, more money and a band .
