To understand "Crash Course" in the right context, you must understand the 80's on TV. Most TV shows have no purpose at all. The comedy overcame the drama of at least 3 to 1. They were still figuring out where the lines were so they could cross them. (TV shows such as "Hail to the Chief" was quite bold!) This Crash Course movie featured an All-Star cast, bringing together members of all the 1980s classics: "227", "Family Ties" , "who is the boss?", et al. Directors must have had a certain propensity for those stardom films. Still, this film offered very light passages and a simplistic view of heroism and maturity. And that's not bad at times. Viva Soleil Moon Frye.
