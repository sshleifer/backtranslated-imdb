The title of the film seems quite appropriate, given the persona of the main character, Fanda. He is an older man who lives in the late fall of his life but still enjoys himself as an exultant school boy who has just entered a spring meadow. The frailties of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions for him. His wife supports this idea when she remarks: "Fanda laughs at funerals and death." In other words, death is not something that Fanda takes very seriously; he has more important things to do than worry about what is already inevitable. Life, however, and the quest to live life to the fullest, is the philosophy that governs Fanda's existence. He is not someone who merely exists, but must live for each day and every passing moment, because tomorrow is not guaranteed. <br /> <br /> The film seems to make a strong comment about living as if there was no tomorrow, much less death. Many people take life very seriously and consequently lose the real living part of life. Fanda's wife, for example; she is so preoccupied with preparing for death, not in a religiously connotative way, but in a way too practical, even lifeless, that she forgets how to smile, laugh, and just have fun. Your humanity seems to have morphed into zombie autopilot mode. Fanda, on the contrary, is perhaps very cheerful and distracted for his own good. He needs a person like his wife, Emilie, to help balance him. <br /> <br /> It is as if Fanda possessed the invincible spirit of a child, like a child trapped in the body of an older man. He is presented as the adventurous type; he pretends to be people he is not to win, he wastes money, lies and always gives good laughs. In the end, however, he is a kind and gentle man who wishes to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife. The two fit very well, although none of them really appreciate the binary quality of their relationship until it metaphorically happens to death: that is, their divorce. It is during this court scene that Fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love. His wife emotionally remembers all his faults, but is lovingly drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior. At this moment of forgiving him, Fanda realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife mad and makes an internal commitment to make her happy. Ironically, however, after making that commitment, he becomes what his wife later calls "a living corpse." Does the vital blood inside it drain away as it becomes more like it ?? a zombie going through everyday movements. He does not seem to live any more, but he does exist. For example, he gives up his crazy pranks, does not waste money, quits smoking because of his wife (not his health), and generally just agrees with what she wants from him. Briefly, he changes by wanting to make her happy. Thus, the binary quality of your relationship begins to slowly disappear. Realizing that her husband is not who he used to be, there is a part of Emilie who misses the old Fanda. She misses the indifference of her husband and the quarrels she used to have, because it was in those moments that they were actually living, not simply existing. <br /> <br /> I believe the filmmakers were trying to convey a specific message here; that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient, but will often take the sacrifice and perseverance to go through the seemingly bad times. The possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live at every moment. Life is often taken for granted, but when threatened with death, be it literal or figurative, people wake up from their ungrateful sleep and are awakened to begin living life to the fullest. It's as if they're afraid of never going back to life, so it's best to make the most of it. Fanda and Emilie were married for 44 years with fights along the way, but it was not until they were both threatened with the possibility of separation from death that they began to show their true colors. As the old maxim says: "Love does not know its own depth until the time of separation." Both begin to see what is most important in life and are the people they encounter along the way. Most importantly, the intimate relationships they make with their significant others.
