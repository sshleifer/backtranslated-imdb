Jack and Kate meet doctor Daniel Farady first and then the psychics Miles Straume and they demonstrate that they did not come to the island with the intention of rescuing the survivors. Locke and his group find anthropologist Charlotte Staples Lewis, and Ben Linus shoots her. Meanwhile, Jack's group meets the pilot Frank Lapidus, who landed the helicopter with minor damage that can be repaired. Jack forces Miles to tell the true intent why they came to the island. <br /> <br /> The second episode of Season Four returns to the island with four new characters for the confusing "flash-forwards" and it looks like it will finally be the beginning of the explanations that I (and most fans and viewers ) expect to be provided in "Lost". Why the government's interest in Ben Linus and how he is informed of the boat are some of the issues I hope to see in the next few episodes. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
