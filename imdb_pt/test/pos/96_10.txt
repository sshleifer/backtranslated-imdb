Having been raised in Canada, I have seen this short many times mostly in CBC. I have seen it many times, in many times of my life, and each time the reactions are the same. It is a cheerful and pleasantly lively movie that pulls your heart out. I'm sure I have on some VHS tape somewhere digging around. <br /> <br /> Every growing child can relate to the situation, and want to fit in with their favorite idols. The scene and the looks of the children stay when his mother is filling the Eatons catalog and his jump in the room is priceless. I did not see anyone capturing that carefree youth mood in the movie, as well as this little short. <br /> <br /> Of course I'm a Montreal fan habs, and this makes my appreciation for it more special. But in the end, it's the nostalgic look of pond hockey and the memories of your family telling you that you should be grateful for what you get, even if it's not exactly what you wanted. And oh yes, the animation is beautiful too;) <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10
