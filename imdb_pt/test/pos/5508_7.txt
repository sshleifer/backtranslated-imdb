Everyone told me that this movie was not good, and I was sick, so I finally rented it and was stunned. I thought the torture would be much worse, but it was shocking near the end, but it was about that. I would not call it a horror movie, maybe a mystery or something from the Silence of the Innocents category and / or Kiss the Girls. It got silly sometimes, but the rest of the movie kept me at the edge of my seat. 7/10 <br /> <br /> R rated - for strong torture, violence, language and sexuality
