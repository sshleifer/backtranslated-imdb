Very memorable comedy. It's fun to watch the many situations that unfold and finally converge after a long journey in that largest collection of eclectic humanity (and the world's largest honky-tonk) - the great American Freeway. Like "... crazy, crazy world," he has immense contemporary talent, old boy politics, good comedy and dialogue. Contrary to that, it is the target you seek, not the ones who seek involuntarily - they have no idea what they really want as they walk the great road of America. Nor does it carry the weight of having a great hunter who is saved only at the end by a great laugh. But the final stunt sequence is nothing short of spectacular, with excellent movie editing, humor and timing, and the big city bank scene is hilarious, with very original acting from a very talented character in particular. The total proclamation of the inhabitants of the city in the face of chaos leaves a sensation like the proverbial fly on the roof. The slapstick is funny, but Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be heard and seen closely because it is surprisingly loaded with nuances and character reactions that are easily missed. All in all a very funny reflection of who we were and are, good or bad, and the bizarre situations we find ourselves. It was just to be funny and it is!
