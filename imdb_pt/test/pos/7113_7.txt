This is a fun movie in the Universal Horror series, featuring Dracula, Wolfman and Frankenstein's Monster. The plot revolves around Dracula (John Carradine) and Larry Talbot, the werewolf (Lon Chaney Jr.), visiting separately a revolutionary doctor. They both ask if they can be healed, and the doctor tries to find a way for each one. Under the doctor's castle, they find Frankenstein's Monster buried in the mud (apparently it's a reference to the previous Frankenstein movie). <br /> <br /> Of course, if things had happened as planned, the film would have been incredibly annoying. Instead, Dracula can not suppress his appetite, and the doctor is eventually infected, by a blood transfusion, with vampirism. As a semi-vampire, the doctor goes mad and awakens Frankenstein's monster. As in the entire Universal Horror series, the ending is completely unsatisfactory. A pretty woman with a hunchback, one of the doctor's two assistants, has a particularly horrible ending. Also, you just have to feel sorry for Frankenstein's Monster in this movie - he's been awake for about two minutes, kills a cop, and then another building (what's this, the fifth now?) Collapses on him and is consumed by flames. It is also unfortunate that the great character created in The Wolf Man (1941), Larry Talbot, is actually reduced here. People underestimate this movie and Chaney's performance on it. Here he would be justifiably criticized as wood. All in all, though, it's a really fun movie in just 68 minutes. A good waste of time. 7/10
