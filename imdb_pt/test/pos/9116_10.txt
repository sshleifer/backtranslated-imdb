I got to see the MTV premiere in this movie last night and I needed to tell everyone that this movie brought the thunder. Obviously, this movie will be most enjoyed by D fans as it has lots of inside jokes for those who have watched the HBO series and has more than enough D for younger fans and the mass of new converts. The song really shines with new songs "Kickapoo" (which is much better than it sounds), "Master Exploder" (possibly the third best song in the world) and "Dude (I miss you so much)". There is a load of excellent scenes (the car chase, the rock-off, the encounter) and cameos (including Dave Grohl as Satan!). I really could go on for hours, but I do not want to give the movie. Go see that. You will not be disappointed.
