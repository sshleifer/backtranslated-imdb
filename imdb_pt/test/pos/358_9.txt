One of Chaplin's longest films to date, Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then the well-known story of "Prosper Merimee" about "Carmen." I was a bit confused about the difference between the 1915 IMDb list of Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on the run time, I assume it was the 1915 version I saw, since the 1916 version is a good 20 minutes more, and from what I've read, it's 20 minutes unnecessary and unimpressive. From the outset, it is clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin's most complex and ambitious efforts to date, beginning with a long story told through inter-titles about the tragic love story . by Carmen. <br /> <br /> Carmen is sent by a band of gypsies ("A band that put the GYP in Gypsy"), to seduce a Spanish official so they can carry out their smuggling operation. It is an intelligent group of criminals, whose leader, Lillas Pastia, "spent 50 years learning to steal, thinking that he would be offered a job in politics." On a side note, I have seen some almost misogynist messages and jokes in some of Chaplin's earlier works, but probably none as evident as this. Near the beginning of the film, as the gypsy band is traveling, there is a scene where the mules and the women are carrying, and a title says that "the mules are those with long ears." If you do not know, I think. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays the role of Don Jose, the unfortunate officer who must be seduced by Carmen. He is described as "a brave soldier and lover of women". It is not exactly an effort for Chaplin, who has cast doubt on his ability to play a convincing comedian a few years later on the shining Shoulder Arms. And, of course, he did not have to act like a woman's lover. <br /> <br /> What is different here, of course, is his polished military uniform and his disciplined, interspersed manner, of course. , with some of its traditional palm-top movements. He seems to me a little boy in a position of authority, struggling to maintain the respect of his subordinates, exercising a hoarse and impassive exterior. Soon Carmen enters ("Loved by all men under the age of 96"), and she immediately starts flirting with Charlie. I must mention that, for a good majority of the film, it is surprisingly true to the original story, full of jealousy and tragedy. Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover, able to evoke a jealous passion that I have never seen of him. There is at least one scene in which it is genuinely a bit scary. <br /> <br /> Chaplin has some great visions in the movie, such as a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fights near the end. And his boyish charm and the role of a soldier is also definitely a winning combination even though there is another quirky trick involving a group of men pushing a huge door back and forth that was not very effective to start but continued forward ee so on, probably about five times more than it was worth. Although it was interesting that when it finally fell, it was clearly revealed as a prop film. I always appreciate these glimpses of the old movie sets. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is the strongest part. It has a striking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet, but when you think that Chaplin is going to lead a great thematic experience diverging far from his traditional style, there is a hilarious twist that is as old as anything I have ever seen. Good job!
