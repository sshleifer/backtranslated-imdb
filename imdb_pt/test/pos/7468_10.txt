This movie is great! On this date of April 8, 2007, he was in demand of the show schedule. It's been a while since I've seen him, but he's got Thomas Jane in the first role I've seen him in. At first, you see a normal guy who seems kinda ignored, with a wife who seems close to going his own way. The director I just watched has an opening scene that's cool. Paulina Porizkova is dressed as a type of cheerleader, looking very fresh and hot. Trying to buy coffee late at night, with no low notes, she rushes in hastily, Paulina shows that her name on her jacket is the real deal. Meeting his old roadmate, Nick, played by Aaron Eckhart, was cool at first, and he even borrows his wife's car to handle some business. Then he sees the silver case and the day changes to the strange and violent. There is a cast of real characters that parade through the next series of scenes. But, Paulina Dallas steals the show I think. She is telling a story of Casey to the doctor who is there to get a personal interview in an adoption application, it is scandalous. As a general rule, I never thought that tall women were so sexy, but as with any rule, there are exceptions. Paulina is like never before seen in the movies. Sexy and lethal, as in a movie with Tom Selleck, but with a malevolence never seen before. If you are looking for movie to add to your collection, this is worth the price. Paulina naked is worth the price alone, but this story has everything you can expect. Love, friendship, sex and violence in a fantastic mix. When I first saw it years ago, this surprised me, and I know you will feel the same way.
