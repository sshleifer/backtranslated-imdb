The Kinks warned of media heroes. Out of the movies, most heroes are also "Ordinary People". Society demands some drama, but what happens when it extends to the parent-child relationship? Do some parents try to improve themselves through their children and not vice versa? How do you provide a paper template, but not a paper? A brilliant swimmer who hates to swim; a brilliant musician who will not play. Unusual, funny (despite the description of "serious" problems), very good multidimensional performance of all. Many plot twists complement emotional tension. The celluloid heroes never feel any pain. I do not remember being disappointed with a Sigourney Weaver movie (even I liked "The Village"!).
