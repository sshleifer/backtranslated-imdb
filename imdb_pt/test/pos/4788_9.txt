I saw it when I was twelve. It was the movie that made me understand what really was a good mystery. I had read through the whole series of Happy Hollister children's mysteries and they were about a family of child detectives who always received their man. But we readers were not in a position to solve the mystery with them. This movie showed me that a good mystery is what causes the viewer / reader, in the end, to say: "OH !!!!! OF COURSE !!!!!!!"
