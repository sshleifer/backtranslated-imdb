I remember seeing this movie as a child in the 60s. It took my breath away when I was young. I was glued to my place in front of the TV in black and white. The cast was one of the best I've ever seen in my life. The musical was one of the greatest ever written. Please, for the Gershwin and Goldwyn Families, please release this on video or DVD so that the generations now and in the future can experience what I am sure of so many of us did when we saw this great work of art. the work of this great man is not seen for more years. I am praying and hoping that the hearts of these families will be softened and that the world will see this great movie again.
