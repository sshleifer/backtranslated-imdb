Gilles Mamouni is playing with the audience with Max (Vincent Cassel) in search of his greatest love lost (Monica Bellucci) shortly before engaging with another woman. Mamouni uses many sequences of flashbacks without warning, so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch the actor's haircut. Oherwise can get very confused ... Still a strong movie debut for Mamouni, beautifully photographed by Thierry Arbogast (the 5th element, the Messenger), and Monica Bellucci is a darling to watch ... I felt a bit disappointed near the end so I gave 9 out of 10.
