Wow .... it's been a long time since I last saw a hilarious movie like this !!!!! I've never been a big fan of French films, but since I fell in love with Catherine Deneuve's beauty and acting skills, I decided to see all of her films ... however, I did not think it would be as fantastic as it turned out . Lucky mine, which I bought even though I had some doubts! This is really a "feel-good" movie with class and quality. There are some great social topics and moral drama involved that are very close to the modern way of life today, which are shown very beautiful and realistic. I also really enjoyed the dance scene in the men's room! But my favorite is Catherine Deneuve's rather timid attempt to sing ..... she brings it the way it is, with much grace and modesty at the same time ... very tempting! In addition, I would also like to express my respect and admiration for Line Renaud, who played a fantastic role (I did not even know she acted .... I only knew her for her music). So, do not wait any longer and go see the movie ... you'll be surprised in many ways.
