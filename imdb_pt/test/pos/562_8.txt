Anyone who is looking for an episode of "Law and Order" or "CSI" would have to look elsewhere because the most basic elements of police or forensic work were totally ignored in this case. <br /> <br /> A murder took place, and all the police did was get a 15-year-old boy on the street and take him to the only witness - a man of 65 - and say that this is the dude who did that? Of course, the old man thought the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty. It did not matter that he did not look at all like the real killer and dressed differently. He must have shrunk, reversed his age for 5-10 years and changed his clothes. <br /> <br /> The police made absolutely no effort - and they admitted it! They did not investigate any of the evidence, questioned no other witnesses and beat up a confession of a 15-year-old. The saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred on the same street in Jacksonville, Florida. May all begin to speak of the "justice of the south."
