This is actually a very good surreal mystery movie, despite the description that tries to sell it as a science fiction movie. Balkan stars as a woman haunted by the mysterious visions and lost memories she is trying to gather. She spends most of the film trying to understand her visions. Very atmospheric and effective. It is true that Kinski does not appear much in this film, but the actors who face are very good. There is only one version dubbed in English available in the USA, and dubbing is not to be desired, but the actors do a very good job. Cinematography, by Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro, is excellent. An earlier Giallo by director Bazzoni, THE FIFTH CORD, is also excellent, and was also played by Storarro.
