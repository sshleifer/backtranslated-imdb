My friends and I saw this at the San Diego Black Film Festival. It was great. Stormy is a strong black woman and Nana reminds me of my grandmother. <br /> <br /> René is fine !!! Watching him undress definitely worth the price of admission. Can someone forward me their contact information? <br /> <br /> My friend thinks Flex is the best of the two. She's been a fan of Flex for years, so she can be a bit biased. The cousins ​​were funny and as insignificant as Nana described them. LOL. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to movie theaters.
