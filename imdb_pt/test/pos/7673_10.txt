I've seen this one time probably as most people my age (55) in the 60s. I understand the dissatisfaction with the end product of both families. But this is a great movie, it was a great opera; but as a movie is wonderful. This movie should be released at least for the video, other generations can get an appreciation of good music and storytelling. The cast was formed by some of the greatest black actors of all time, the majority already died; only Sidney P. is still with us. Please do not wait until it goes away and the movie as every old movie does, it becomes unusable for the ravages of time. Again, this is a great movie that is something you do not see often nowadays, if it is.
