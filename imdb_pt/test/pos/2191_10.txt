I've seen this version for about a decade, and I've been looking for it ever since. I just found an original VHS version and bought it for $ 125.00. It sounds crazy, but if you, like me, consider it one of the best Broadway musical stage ever produced, you would not even think twice. <br /> <br /> Why, just pay a little more Broadway ticket today. I really hope they re-release it on DVD soon. It's a musical play that screams to be seen by everyone!
