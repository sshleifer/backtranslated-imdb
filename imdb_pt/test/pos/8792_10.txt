I love this movie! I love all the characters and I can watch again <br /> <br /> and again ... and I used to listen to the soundtrack again and again. <br /> <br /> Although I've seen it about two years after it was made and I've never been as young as Jip and company, I can understand them and I love their stories. And if anyone thinks this movie sucks, I disagree and say it's full of positive energy and friendship and love ... and full of youth! <br /> <br /> The weekend has landed ... enjoy!
