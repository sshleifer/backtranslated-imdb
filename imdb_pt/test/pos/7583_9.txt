In the history of cinema, every great filmmaker had to create a first film. Often, when seen after they become a success, a light bulb goes on in our heads. The connection is made and we see the solid foundation from where they started. Then it's with HORSES ON MARS. It's the subtle humor around a seemingly straightforward narrative that tells a great story but allows you to enjoy the look at the same time. In the pictures, I found great attention to detail and a production polish that is rare in any student film. <br /> <br /> A young filmmaker always has improvements to be made. But if Mr. Anderson continues on this path, I think we will one day look back on this movie as the beginning of a great career. <br /> <br /> You should definitely see this movie. Nothing beats the grandeur of the big screen.
