Spoilers !!! To understand what really happened first you have to be a warrior, stay alive in a real war, think offline, analytically, critically and non-linearly. Otherwise, you will come to false conclusions that Maj.Gray was a dumb or unstable person. Truth is something completely different. He was a tough, tough veteran and the only way to get killed by Captain O'Malley is that he wants her killed. It was his exit. He chooses. He was not a man to retire. If you've never been on the front row, you can not understand. He intentionally prepares his own suicide. First he seduced Mary Jane, who intentionally acted like a fool, than an argument - ending the incident before witnesses (to protect her after she did what he wants her to do if she were to go to trial), than gave the son bullets (for assurance he could carry his gun later), came that night, loaded his gun, woke up, put the gun in his hands, acted as he was attacking her, after firing first time he raised a knife and shouted "One kill "so she threw him again and before he died he put the knife as if he was trying to get him back after the first shot. He also gave her a message with his last cry. "After first killing everything will change inside your mind and destroy your life, this is the only way I die as a man, even though being killed by someone I love is my choice and my only prerogative, war and army is not the that you have thought so far, to finally grow and save your life until you can. " She left the military life in the end. She understood him. And he did not die in vain. The man who helped him prepare all this and after completing the trial and the result of this trial was Colonel Sam Doran with the help of Lieutenant Tim Macy. Macy did not know what was really going on and what the outcome would be, but he did what he was supposed to do. He took pictures of Mary Jane and Maj.Gray, by order of Colonel Sam Doran, who gave the order because Major Gray asked him to do so. After she refused to leave the army (which Col. Doran asked her to do) Colonel Doran persuaded the prosecutor to accuse her of a premeditated murder (he knew she could not be found) instead of manslaughter (there was some possibility of being found) with pictures taken. Cor.Doran also suppressed the speech-closing incident to prevent the prosecutor from having any doubts about the premeditated murder charge, but to have it revealed during the trial which greatly influenced the jury. I have no doubts about the outcome of this trial. Why did Colonel Doran do this? Because he will do anything the Maj.Gray asks him to do. Because? Because he saved his life on the battlefield. Why did Mary Jane choose to go to trial? Because she was a person who has integrity, principles. Which is why Maj.Gray chose her. It has to be worthy, honorable. Keeping her secret about what really happened that night, she also proves her honor. <br /> <br /> Miroslav
