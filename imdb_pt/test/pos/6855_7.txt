I saw Anatomy years ago - nicknamed in a friends house, I do not remember much, and then I saw in the video store that there is a second - not very related to the first Franka Bridge makes a small special participation. And he was not as good as the first. I'm seeing the first one again tonight - not dubbed the Collectors Edition. I really like German films like this, it's very interesting and people and culture like the movie could exist, I guess, I do not know. But it's very grossly fun and scary. Anatomy 2 is a bit different and the characters are not as good as the first. But if you really thought Anatomy was interesting and good, you should see the second.
