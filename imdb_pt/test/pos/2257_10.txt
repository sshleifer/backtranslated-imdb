I found this movie incredible. I was a bit skeptical, since I really had no idea what it was, but it was a beautiful story. I cried a lot and also laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> I think it's very important that there are films about the Holocaust and how it affects people (it happened only 60 years ago!) I was in Germany and Eastern Europe and I studied the Holocaust, so this movie meant a lot to me. I think this movie did an incredible job capturing this story (I will not go into details, I do not want to ruin everything) But I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a movie that, I know this may sound clich√©, but it will change your mentality in things.
