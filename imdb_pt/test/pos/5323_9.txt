This is a movie that really makes you think about your life, our culture, family structures and situational actions. I'm not going to give the plot in this post, I think others have already beaten me for it. I hope that despite reading reviews on this site, you take the opportunity and see this movie for yourself. I went to see this movie with my husband and a friend and I must say that after the movie was over, there was a total silence in the theater. After a few minutes, I looked back and everyone in the theater was staring at the screen, lost in thought. It will cause you to delve into your psychological abyss to reflect on various things: <br /> <br /> How much does society influence my life and the life of my generation? <br /> <br /> How long does anyone have? to pay for mistakes they made? <br /> <br /> If there is a second chance given, has this been noticed already? <br /> <br /> Is it better to live in a box or not to live? at all? <br /> <br /> My questions are not intended to show my approval or disapproval of Leland's actions. I do not want my opinion on them somehow dictate what you're going to get out of this movie, so I will not give it. See for yourself. I'm still lost in thought, trying to answer my many questions from the movie. I liked it a lot and I hope you do too. This movie is not trying to answer questions, tolerate any action or promote any punishment. This movie is trying to get everyone to evaluate our lives and get the pink glasses that most of us see the world. <br /> <br /> Great movie. 5 out of 5 stars
