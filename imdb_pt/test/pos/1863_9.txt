This is definitely a moving film and a great expression of Charles Darwin's personal struggle. The film is not only about its struggle to get its book "the origin of Species" published, but also its relationship with its eldest daughter. Her daughter was, at first, the only person in her family to approve of her views, something she also had to pay. Sometimes more than him. <br /> <br /> Now, this is not an evolutionary propaganda film, in fact I think it has managed to remain very neutral. A hard thing to do in my opinion. Of course, it does not condone the way the characters were treated by the church, just the opposite. If you need me to use the big words to clarify this movie; will be appreciated by deists and atheists, but it goes away from theism. The movie talks about evolution, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible. Of course we can all think of Darwin as that funny-bearded old man, but this movie revolves around the man in his late thirties, early thirties. Jennifer Connelly (Emma Darwin) is great as always, but the actor who impressed me was Martha West as Annie Darwin, daughter of Darwins. Definitely one of the best children's actors of the decade. The story is about Darwin and his daughter, and is beautifully represented. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a few jumps in time that was momentarily confusing, the production of this movie is flawless. Some scenes were Darwin notes that nature is simply marvelous, and it is almost like retreat from a high-yielding national geographic documentary. <br /> <br /> I must admit, I'm not sure why they chose "Creation." as the title. I doubt it is an irony, the film is very respectful for that. Well, I'm sure there's a meaning too, just do not let it scare you. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 9/10. This is truly a great tribute to Charles Darwin, and please take a chance.
