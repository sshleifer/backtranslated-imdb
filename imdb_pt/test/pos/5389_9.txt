If you like Gary Cooper, this is one of his best roles. His gentle intensity to correct a mistake is what made his career. "Blayde Hollister" arrives in Dallas to take revenge on Will and Brian Malowe, who burned their farm in Georgia and killed their family. Inept Marshall enters Hollister's path, attempting to arrest him when interrupted by a street shooting between Hollister and Wild Bill Hickock. The shooting is staged to take away Hollister's law, and he takes Marshall "back east" under his wing to keep him alive in Texas while they switch identities. <br /> <br /> This was a great start, and the image continues to the end. The action may be a bit "slow" by today's standards, but it's one of my 10 favorite movies.
