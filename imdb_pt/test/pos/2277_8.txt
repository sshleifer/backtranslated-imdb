"Japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own," while this may be true, applies to everyone except for one thing, whatever, ..... Major League Baseball .... but do not worry "Mr. Baseball" is there to try to change all that. But who will change who, is the part of the movie that really makes it rock! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines in his comedic roles. The plot may be true for life, however, the sub-plot is fatal. The Japanese people are a kind and respectful people, with ways and traditions very different from those of Western society. All these elements and obstacles combine to create a fun and entertaining film. Definitely worth watching!
