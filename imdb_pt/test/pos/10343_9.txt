Great movie. Good acting, a wonderful script. It's exciting to find out what people are thinking and how they react to the situation they are in. Feather of the end; a "page" of text about how Nynke's life went, rather than moving images, was a bad choice. I hope this movie attracts a lot of people; Worth it!
