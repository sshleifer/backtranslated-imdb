This film addresses the themes of loss, personal struggle and transformation in such a clever, resourceful, sensitive and visually stunning way that I was completely transported. It's a rare gem of a movie in the way it honors beauty and women. You will have to see for yourself. Dreya Weber (Jane) masterfully portrays the subtleties of a remarkable personality, though not somewhat broken, in a way that every woman relates. I found the honesty of the emotional interactions between the characters very refreshing and deeply engaging. There was nothing in this movie that told me "low budget" in terms of quality. Anything. The fact that it's a low-budget film is a tribute to the creators of the film. The final sequence during the credits will also bring down your socks. It's a brilliant celebration of Jane's choice. Unexpected and inspiring.
