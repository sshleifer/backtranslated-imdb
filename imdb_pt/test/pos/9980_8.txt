Shia LaBeouf impressed me before with his acting ability, but I can honestly say that I look forward to his next efforts ... his portrait of Francis Ouimet, a 20-year-old caddy who ignores his father's insistence that golf is not his . place in life and enter the 1913 US Open tournament in his hometown ... the beginning of the movie drags on a bit, but it is necessary to configure the subframe that Shia works so well ... the whole cast is well chosen and they work very well together in a story that, based on the actual event, has an ending that everyone can discover before seeing the movie ... but even knowing that the information does not spoil the fun ... Josh Flitter is charming as Eddie Lowery , Francis's caddy, who keeps him anchored and loose while at the same time proving to be an invaluable part of Francis's effort ... Stephen Delane is highlighted as Harry Vardon, the legendary British golfer whom Francis idolizes but does not fear. ... and who knows the background Francis comes as he also had a humble start ... Bill Paxton makes a movie of formulas and makes it worth ... bravo Mr. Paxton and brave to the cast ... from images to history to people who bring her alive, this is a movie to get, enjoy and enjoy ... it's good to have movies like this that we can feel good watching ...
