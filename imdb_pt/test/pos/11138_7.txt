I was surprised to see this on TV on Friday and I liked it. Between the presence of Bobbie Phillips and the numerous references to everything that could be considered "cyberpunk", this was a fun movie to watch. I liked the story, which reminded me of a book I read ("Earth", David Brin), and it was fun to watch on TV. Bobbie looks great but I also enjoyed her performance as Kam because she looked different from everyone else. But the best thing about this movie was the atmosphere described in books by Gibson, Sterling and others. It was fun watching you on TV.
