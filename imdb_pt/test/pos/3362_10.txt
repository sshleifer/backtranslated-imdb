In my opinion, the parenting army is the best British sitcom ever. I believe that if you watch only one episode of the show, you can not fully judge this episode, (this includes the movie) You should at least watch a series of this show, enter the characters, become familiar with the environment and situations where they are. When you become familiar with the program, it will begin to appeal to you. Now the movie has some changes in the series, which is a little disappointing, but still works. Watch one or two program series before watching this. You will not be disappointed. Good episode to watch is "No Spring for Frazer"
