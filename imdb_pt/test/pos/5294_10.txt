I had heard news about this movie from the Hayao Miyazaki anime legend, and I wanted to see it. But I was lucky enough for the online movie on YouTube; after watching the movie, I knew it was another Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli classic. <br /> <br /> This movie, inspired by my favorite fairy tale "The Little Mermaid", is about a 5 year old boy. named Sosuke, and his relationship with a goldfish princess, whom he called Ponyo, who wants to be human and be with Sosuke. I will not give you more details, you will have to see the movie for yourself. So overall, one of the best animation films ever made, with lots of fantasy, adventure and humor ... I loved it!
