This movie is so 1980's and that's what I really like about it. He does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade. The reality is that Russian nuclear weapons can wipe you out at any moment. Reagan in the White House telling everyone that things were great as more and more social programs were cut. The youths gave up, but not as much as their parents of the 1960s did. The young people were still going to school, they just smoked so much drug that their sensibilities were practically dead. Nothing affected them, not even the death of one of his colleagues at the hands of one of his friends. How strange to realize that the murder was wrong, but you're not sure why. Watching the characters dealing with crime is fascinating and revealing of a very sick society. Glover is great, Keanu is great, Hopper is awesome. One of the most memorable movies I've ever seen.
