This is a superb versatile film. An exciting experience full of real life excitement. There are lessons to be learned here about love, sex, work, religion, and American culture, regardless of one's sexual preference. <br /> <br /> Although this film is also a blatant indictment of the Mormons' belief system, any conservative faith could easily take its place. But it's a bit ironic that homosexuality is currently condemned by Mormons in unmistakable terms. Here is a faith that has determined for generations that believers practice polygamy! And these true believers just gave up on this practice because they were forced to do so by the federal government to get Utah into the Union. Talk about a unique form of hypocrisy! <br /> <br /> The sex scenes portrayed in the unrated version are tasteful and surprisingly brief. There is nothing here that offends someone with an open mind. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so obvious is that homosexuality is perfectly natural for people who are gay, as heterosexuality is for people who are heterosexual! While love and sex are obviously very different needs, it is absolutely beautiful beyond words, when both occur at the same time between two adults! Deep erotic love is one of life's most precious gifts! Congratulations to the filmmakers for a job well done!
