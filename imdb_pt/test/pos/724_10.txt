I've seen a lot of movies and it just amazed me. The trauma, the suspense is simply incredible. I ended up so hurt in his psychological fear and philosophy, and relating it to reality. Movies that touch and challenge your mind are movies you do not forget, those that make you doubt your reality. One problem may be quality, but that does not detract from the essence of the film. <br /> <br /> The idea is brilliant and the ending leaves you completely shocked and with the question for you to look for the answer. I totally adored it! So many clues and contortions and puzzles. One of the best films of all time, by far.
