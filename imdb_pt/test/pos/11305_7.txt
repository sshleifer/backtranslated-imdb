My 5 year old daughter is very much into the Barbie movie series. I had mixed feelings about this - not wanting her to believe in the Barbie doll image, and recognizing that the movies are a marketing move to convince girls to buy more dolls and make more money for Mattel. This morning, though she asked me to watch this movie with her, and - being a lazy Saturday morning and not much else to do - I agreed. I do not know if the films were made to help market the dolls, they seem to be losing a little of what I heard or if the dolls are there to market the movies (or, more likely, a bit of both) but whatever which is the case, I have to admit - somewhat to my surprise, this was not kind of bad. <br /> <br /> It's a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and memorable people and characters (Basically, Annika ("played" by Barbie) has to find a way to build a "wand of light" for to reverse the evil spells of the wizard Wenlock, who among other things turned his sister into a flying creature. but it's usually pretty good, and although the film is obviously tailor-made for girls rather than middle-aged men, I still had enough twists to make me wonder how things would end. story, or at least some logical inconsistencies, but again, it is necessary to remind the target audience that they would not think of such things.
