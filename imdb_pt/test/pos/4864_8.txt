Did I get a DVD on the 1st ?? discount, having no idea what it's about (but at this price I can not resist ..) In summary: I was positively surprised. <br /> <br /> So much that I did enough research. In the German DVD (part 2 of a series of 3), the episodes were recombined in two parts of 85 minutes and out of order. Here are my results, based on the list of episodes from Wikipedia: "Apocalypse" is In My Boots + The Voice (final episode). <br /> <br /> "War of the Machines" is Hel & High Water (1, 2) + Pod Listener + Juggernaut Down. <br /> <br /> Well, what can I say. Undressed girls are naturally interesting to older men. I've never watched Charlie's Angels so much, so I can not compare, but the more I watched, the less I searched for bikinis and their fillings. Instead, the characters (both me and f) became more interesting. I can imagine feminists having fun with that too. All in all, maybe a guilty pleasure, but it was a pleasure: ^)
