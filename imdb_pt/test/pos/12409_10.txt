This photo does not have big bursts or expensive chase sequences. However, he has truly wonderful performances and an exceptional script that puts it at the top of my "indie-must-see" list. Taylor Nichols and James Remar are great together. The young cast surprised me with a really consistent performance. Usually, indie images have a weak link, but there are no weak links here. Impressive. Go get this one.
