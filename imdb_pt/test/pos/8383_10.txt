I must admit that when I saw the preview of "Inglorious Basterds" I gave myself great expectations. THIS MOVIE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. <br /> <br /> Rarely when I watch a movie with such high expectations, I have these expectations overcome or reached; this movie did that and more. Even more rarely do I applaud at the end of a movie, this I and everyone else in the theater did. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I'm a little inclined towards Quentin, I grew up with "Pulp Fiction". "I watched it when I was 12 and it's still my favorite and most influential movie." Quentin has not really lived up to his billings since then. (I never saw Jackie Brown, and then there's Grindhouse.) That's up to "Inglorious Basterds." What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a Western feeling of spaghetti that could only be made by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone is dead, Tarantino is the self-appointed subject in this masterpiece. So let's look at the movie that I will not give. <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> The performance was under erba !! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, really. I do not say that often, but honestly the man should make one for this movie, he spoke every language in the movie and presented such an incredible touch and posture. He stole the show in a movie that everyone was incredibly impressive. <br /> <br /> I have no problem building this movie, because this movie is the best movie I've seen all year, and probably every year next. . Frankly, the more I think about it, this movie can decipher my best films of all time, and it's Quentin's best film since "Pulp Fiction." Get it out of me, watch this movie. I loved not making this movie enough justice. <br /> <br /> I watched it yesterday and I'm still impressed. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie. You're back to the top again, my friend. I can not say enough for "Inglorious Basterds!"
