The film was great and all, but, there were many mistakes in the "football" scenes, I wonder if any of the guys who were working in the movie have ever seen a football match before ..? First of all, I do not understand how she wanted to try for the boys' team? in football boys and girls can not play on the same team and these are the rules of FIFA. And do not get me started on who, when they found out that she was really a girl, they let her continue to play ... !! secondly, players can not paint their faces with color and play like that, again the rules of FIFA are not mine. <br /> <br /> And do not tell me about how they scored goals that was ridiculous completely unrealistic. and all the players did not seem to know Jack about football. <br /> <br /> And when the duke was training Viola, why did they only concentrate on filming what happened with passes and dribbles? or was he throwing in his only problem? and why the hell were all the posters on the wall of his room for Chelse players? Do not they like other players from other teams? it was like this was the only team they know ...! but otherwise the movie was good and I liked the rest, only the training and the scenes of the game were unrealistic for me. they really should have consulted someone about them ...!
