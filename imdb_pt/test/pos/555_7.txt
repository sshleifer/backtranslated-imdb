This movie was a new direction for Natalie Portman. A much more adult role, though it comes from the traits of a child in the film itself. Ann (Portman) and Susan Sarandon, who plays her newly divorced mother, Adele, travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to Beverly Hills. There, these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as the Portman character grows. Unconsciously, at first, for Adele, she grows up to become a better mother to her. <br /> <br /> Ann sees her mother saying she wants to be an actress, or so she thinks. Adele uses this crutch every time there are problems in their lives. We see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms with each other and to be alone, leaving their old lives behind. <br /> <br /> The performance is top quality of both. They apparently become mother and daughter before their eyes. You can almost feel that there is a bond beyond the actual movie. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not really lead us to new paths in these types of films, the fact that the acting is well done, and the story is not so imperfect, I recommend it. <br /> <br /> I'll say, however, it will probably go away soon, I do not believe you can have the staying power needed for a great Christmas season of movies starting in a week or more. See now, before that happens, if you like any of these actresses.
