After spending five years in prison, Dr. Thomas Reed, played by incomparable Vincent Ventresca, exiles himself on Purgatory Flats and ends up at the bar. He soon finds the lusty, angelic Sunny (Alexandra Holden). "You're evil." he tells her. "You have no idea." she responds as she takes her Slo Comfortable Screw and languidly drags her cigarette. Reed is entwined in the violent problems of his family and the history of the femme fatale unfolds against the desolation and despair of the western city, drained by the oil. <br /> <br /> Canny's direction. Great performances Excellent work environment. And some scenes of lust that sizzle like the sun in Purgatory.
