If I write movies or do them, I would like one of them to be like this. I like the sense of humor and the jokes contained in the ball. This movie does stupid things without seeming. The names of the places and characters are invaluable, generic New York High School, Lula Calimari (George's sister), etc ... genius. I've seen this movie so many times because it was a cable TV clamp while I was growing up, of course I did not get all the jokes back, but it was still funny. This movie is a classic without time.
