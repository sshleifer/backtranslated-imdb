Walter Matthau is wonderful as the "womanizer" dentist Dr. Julian Winston, whose frequent lies to girlfriend Goldie provide textbook proofs about the dangers of lying. Goldie Hawn's shearer, Toni Simmons, certainly deserved to win her Oscar. Ingrid Bergman's work as an obstinate nurse Stephanie is also playing to see how she comes out of her shell, slowly and nervously. This is a great movie to watch in the spring, or anytime for that matter. It is greatly underestimated; I've never heard of it until I found it in the store, and what a find!
