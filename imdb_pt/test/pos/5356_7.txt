What ho! This is very good. I say very well, ol 'chap. Or should I say "ol beans"? My domain of British terminology is a bit dusty. Anyway, my motorcycle boots and I entered this triage without prior experience of Wallace and Gromit. I'm glad to say that my boots and I were happy to have met. <br /> <br /> Although not as accessible to adults as Toy Story, W & G still manages to be smart enough to provide adults with a little humor that will definitely hover over the heads of young people who are too busy cackling with the burps of the Were-rabbit to have any clue that something is wrong. I suggest you pay close attention to any time you see books or words on screen because there are quick glimpses of puns that you will lose if you are not paying attention. My favorite is a book of monsters that refers to the Loch Ness Monster as a "tourist trap". If you've ever been known to say, "I can really relate to Kevin Federline," or if you're just illiterate, not only will you miss these jokes but you probably should be spending your time learning to read instead of going to the movies. Consider this as a public service announcement. <br /> <br /> The most impressive aspect about W & G is its clay animation. Thanks to the tedious process, it took five years to finish the movie! According to press releases, there were a few days when the ideal goal was to perform only 10 seconds of completed film. Personally, sometimes I find it hard to find the motivation to end up responding to a handful of emails or add captions to images to my reviews (a point that is proven by the lack of photos in this review); so I can not even imagine having the patience needed for this. <br /> <br /> I really like the rough and practical quality of claymation figures. The fact that you can see fingerprints in the clay is a nice and personal touch. How can you not be impressed with clay characters that show more expression and excitement than Paul Walker and Keanu Reeves combined? The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is, as director Nick Park said, the world's first vegetarian horror film to entertain children and adults. Basing himself (and as a man who prides himself on his shaggy masculinity and graceful beard, I hesitate to use that word) cute and (oh man, I probably should not use that word too) adorable characters rather than outdated ones. References to hammers, W & G is proof that DreamWorks can create fun animations when it chooses intelligence because of the cheap joke.
