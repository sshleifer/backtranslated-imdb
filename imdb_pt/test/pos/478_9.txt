I picked this up at Chicago IndieFest and have to say that you're alone is a lot funnier than the other reviews and even the site would lead one to think. No HA HA Wedding Crashers is funny, but sick, twisted, I can not believe she just said this, but it's so funny. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bohl, who deservedly won the award for Best Actress, is amazing to watch. There's never a time when you think, oh, I'm watching a movie and she's an actress. She is very real to words. <br /> <br /> Actually, there are 2 scenes I'm still laughing at, and I'm not going to distribute them, but in one of them she's in the bathroom talking about how much she gets paid to perform a certain service and how "Incredible" is. (I almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing!) <br /> <br /> In another, it talks about a definition of "sex" versus an adult, and if it is not Truer dialogue than I've heard in a movie for a long time, I do not know what it is.
