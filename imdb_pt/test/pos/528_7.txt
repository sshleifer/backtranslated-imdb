Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the city of London, I was very excited to see this movie on the list of the Vancouver International Film Festival. This film has great photos, an absolutely great soundtrack and interesting insights into a "not-so-known" London. <br /> <br /> The film is performed completely in 'dark' colors, which I personally do not quite like. Besides, the narration was a bit British and the comments sometimes got a little boring. Other than that, there are some great reviews by Londoners and great photos. FINISTERRE does not glorify London, showing all the great attractions of the city, but it gives a deep insight into what London really is like. From the east end to the vibrant center with its music scene, as well as the "special little retreats" for Londoners. <br /> <br /> In all: <br /> <br /> + Fantastic soundtrack + Nice pictures + great insights <br /> <br /> -Narrar -Tierando watch at times -Very dark picture /> <br /> Worth watching! I give a 7/10
