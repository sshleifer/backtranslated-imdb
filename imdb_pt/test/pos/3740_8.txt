When discovering something, the journey is much more fun, much more surreal and much more emotionally stimulating than when you finally reach the destination. Falling in love is perhaps one of the most opulent feelings in the world. You feel energized, invigorated and alive. You simply want to be close to that person every second of the day and the very sound of your voice leaves you excited and sometimes excited. Love, and all the accompanying physical and emotional side effects, are pure bliss. Where you go from here, nobody knows, but when you start your journey together, nothing compares to that. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane and Richard Gere play Adrienne Willis and Paul Flanner, two psychics with emotional scars. elderly individuals. In this movie, they are about to embark on this mystical journey together, where love and discovery of emotions along the way will help to save them. <br /> <br /> Lane is dealing with the typical jerk of an ex-husband who still loves her, but in her eyes, just because the woman he cheated with does not want him anymore. As hurt as she was for him, as much as she does not really like him, there's a part of her that's actually considering taking him back. Why you might ask? Because in life and in love, sometimes comfort replaces intelligence. Yes, this man betrayed her, but she has children with him, she has built a life with him and obviously there is still a connection with him. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere plays a recently divorced husband and distant father. He also lost a patient when he reacted negatively to the anesthetic. He is now being sued by his family and he is guilty, but hardened on the subject. That's what drives you to Rodanthe in the first place. Although his lawyer said no, he felt compelled to visit his wife's husband in Rodanthe. It is in the inn that Adrienne is taking care of. Soon, they find comfort in each other's arms and discover that they too may have a second chance at life. <br /> <br /> So far, this sounds like a simple idea for a movie, and although it may be something you've seen or read about before, Gere and Lane simply own the movie. Diane Lane lights the screen with her smile. Her eyes shine in the dark and the life she brings to the character is worth watching. Gere's character is a bit different. He is more hardened and bitter. It takes Adrienne's pain and her passion to get him out of his shell. He blames himself silently for his tense relationship with his son and she secretly blames herself for the patient's death. Outside, he tells anyone to listen that it is not his fault, and that she was one in 50,000 victims. But deep down, it erodes him. They meet at a time when they both need someone to listen to. <br /> <br /> Gere and Lane have been together in the movie before, but this is the first time they play lovers. They got married in Unfaithful but here they play lovers meeting when the people in their lives have abandoned them. They have a spark and a real chemistry. I would love to see more movies together. In fact, I'd love to see more movies with Diane Lane, but that's a story for another time. <br /> <br /> Nights in Rodanthe is a very passionate and romantic movie about two lost souls who are saved. Both become better people, both become stronger people. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone, not just couples. This is a movie about redemption, absolution, and second chances. <br /> <br /> He will also ask you to bring some tissues. <br /> <br /> 8/10
