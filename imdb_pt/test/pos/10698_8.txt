I have always been fascinated by ninjusu, who would know that it goes beyond the beyond. In "Ninja III", it's fun and intriguing. A ninja is hit by the police and uses his spirit as revenge. The victim, a beautiful young woman named Christie (Lucinda Dickey). She falls in love with the cop involved in the shooting. The love scene where she spills the V8 into her body knocked me over! The death of the ninja catches the attention of another in Japan named Yamada (Sho Kosugi) he comes to America not only to save Christie, but to put the ninja back to the grave. Simply because he placed the left eye of Yamada with a shuriken (throwing star). The fighting scenes were excellent. I liked the part when the plywood falls on Yamada, and he splits it with the foot. And when he was caught, he tells the cop that Christie was involved, that everything will be all right. Rule of thumb: Never underestimate a ninja. He took the other cops out without killing them. And he did his thing without worry. Of course, Chirstie did her best by putting the ninja in her place by using it as a revenge tool. It was a good movie, great for martial arts fans. 3 out of 5 stars!
