If you've never been "Tromatized", this is the Troma movie to see first. Incredible acting, supercharged soundtrack and busting humor perfectly match the unique brand of stories and special effects from Troma. Although he deviate from a word to recount the word of Romeo and Juliet, the fact that it remains in iambic pentameter gives the strange feeling that it is closer to Shakespeare than that exaggerated music video with DiCaprio and Danes. I assumed he had seen the best Shakespearian comedy when the cast of Moonlighting reviewed The Taming of the Shrew, but nothing comes close to Tromeo and Juliet. I strongly recommend the DVD version, which contains a second audio track with director Lloyd Kaufman, who is just as much fun as the main track.
