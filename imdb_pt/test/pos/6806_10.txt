My daughter already wrote a review of this movie on my login ... but I want to add a few words. <br /> <br /> "National Velvet" was one of my two favorite movies as a child. (The other is "The Wizard of Oz.") Cinematography, acting, screenwriting and music come together is a small, wonderful drama of heart that can still bring tears to my tired eyes. Based on a book by Enid Bagnold, the script followed the book very well. The characters are so carefully crafted. It's easy to get emotionally involved with the whole family and the small Irish village they live in. The premise ... complete outsider believes in her horse and herself enough to try a chance on the world's largest horse race ... is inspiring for any young woman, especially a young girl in the 1940s ... a time when girls were sometimes ignored as human beings, let alone athletes. You would have to be very hard not to appreciate its merit. <br /> <br /> But the perspective I most enjoyed in this film is the integral innocence in its moral message. It's almost magical like 'mama and apple pie' the movies were back then. I was very surprised by IMDB's reviewer, who asked ... "Was the world really that confident?" and then proceeded to punish the director for his complacency regarding the unaccompanied night trip involving the two main characters. My answer to his question is unequivocally YES !!!! The movie world was the one I trusted in the 1940s. My grandparents remember to take my mother to this movie when it was released. Then my mother took me to see when I was young, and my daughter was lucky enough to be born at a time when she could watch it over and over on videotape. Now we have it on DVD. It has been a family favorite for generations, though generations of horse lovers. It was never about sex ... it's about maturing! It's about believing in yourself and working hard to achieve your goals. Also, so old-fashioned that it was not even about the cash prize! It's about the girl who understood that her horse had what it needed to be the best. And yes, the director was really worried about Elizabeth Taylor's lack of physical development because the book made a big deal about Velvet Brown (the character of Liz Taylor) having to cut his hair and tie his chest so he could pass as a jockey when she went to the Grand National Steeplechase. This was a sport only for the guys back then ... I think only 12 women competed in this race. It's almost an insult that someone would bother to think about the Lolita thing about that particular movie ... besides, anyone who had anything to do with a teenager and her horse would know that the only thing they thought about stars was eyes have four hooves and a tail. <br /> <br /> And now, for a lot of trivia ... the stunt was run by the now-famous "Horse Whisperer," Monty Roberts. I believe he is mentioned by his participation in the film credits. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 out of 10! I never tire of watching it again.
