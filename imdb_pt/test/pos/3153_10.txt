I blew my brain to another movie that reminds me of this. I really can not think of one. I think it's because most of the films that approach this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style. There are some great ones out there, all better known than the US TM, I'm sure, but they claim to be informative and bring their emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in a way, may seem more intellectual, but in fact it is not. It is philosophical, perhaps, but it ignores the mode of information and goes directly to the same place that a piece of music does. It makes you feel, but sometimes you do not even know why. You've just been taken somewhere in a wave of feelings. When you watch, realize how well it is put together. It may not be for everyone, but it is for everyone looking for a rare cinematic creation that respects you.
