This film was a piece of cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood and the little things that shaped who Tom Hank was. Using a very puzzling story, they were able to give you an idea of ​​what really happened to the character of Tom Hank as a child. And while scenes like the flying machine may never have happened, this has helped show how even denial can help tell the truth. In all good conscience, I could not rate this level below 9 out of 10 great performances by all the actors, and although many may not have understood the puzzling ending in which the brother is murdered by his stepfather, and Tom Hanks covers using a story absurd about a flying machine, pay close attention to small details like the turtle that he still has, though his brother has "flown" with it. Truly, a beautiful piece of cinema and every actor deserves recognition for this.
