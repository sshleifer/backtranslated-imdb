I saw this movie a lot like Skywalker02, but when I got to see it again and with formal training in movies, psychology and life took time to really get me by the hand and start hitting me, I actually clicked on the movie . I remember that payment for cable service channels played almost completely, much like the poltergeist when it was first released, and many other popular movies. I felt back so it was not worth the noise and constant "airtime" (I know cable is not really in the air), but I was very young and adult drama situation would not have and should not have worked. However, the recent screening of the film illuminated me in the film. I think Susan Surandon and Molly Ringwald were probably studying the script together, and I would be a bit surprised if Surandon had trained Ringwald during this project. Ringwald's other projects, though good, have not shown her the potential depth as this role. Surandon preached hers, as Raul Julia did as well. Cassavettes and wife did acceptable performances, but I admit that sometimes the first class becomes mediocre. A constant ebb and flow for acting happens during many scenes, but overall I can see why history might require the dynamics to become more subtle. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not think this movie is the kind of boredom festival that "take me out and drown me," as Skywalker02 would like you to believe. I think maybe with the correct psychological training and a little more difficulties in strategically placed domestic life along with some movie courses, maybe this movie will look different. I would say that if you are feeling a bit gloomy and eager for a simpler life, and you have had your share of marital discord between dysfunctional family units, then maybe this movie can provide more insight and entertainment than you realize. I feel it's a classic and I find it a lot more fun than the conventional films that supposedly share many of the same elements, like the Terms of Endearment that, in my point of view, can be stripped of some of Jack Nicholson's extraordinary performances. , then ceremonially burned until nothing is left. (How could a movie like this get more attention than this? Talk about boredom.) Best thing, do not accept my word or anyone else's, watch the movie and support our industry.
