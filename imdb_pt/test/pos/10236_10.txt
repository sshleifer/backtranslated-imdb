Do not ask me why I love this movie so much ... Maybe it happened at some point in my life that I desperately wanted to fit in, maybe it's the incredible effects of monsters, maybe because I enjoyed the novel "Cabal", but it's probably because I love Clive Barker. I think it's fair to warn you about the movie and the novel does not have a true resolution and like me you probably have a WTF moment in the end. At least two sequences were planned, but they never happened due to the fact that the film failed for some reasons. The studio made drastic cuts in the film, cutting a good 30 minutes or so, and they did HORRIBLE work to promote it. The ads made it look like just another cheap slasher showing mostly the Decker "button face / mask" character. This is a movie about the monsters! About fantasy! About a place called Midian! It's a story where monsters are the good guys. There's really nothing else out there like that! It's not a movie at all, I suppose, but it's one of Clive's great works. Sit down and be prepared to be taken to Midian - where the monsters are.
