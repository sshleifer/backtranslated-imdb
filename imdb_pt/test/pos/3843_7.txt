After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a double pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it, since both films were childhood favorites. <br /> <br /> The Aristocats are a classic, definitely. It may not be a five-star classic, but it's a fun movie and makes for a good night of entertainment. It's a bit refreshing from the darkest and most serious Disney classics. The Aristocats try to be a lightweight musical comedy, and I think it succeeds. <br /> <br /> The plot does not make much sense and I do not think the plot is particularly strong, but it certainly is not weak. The animation and backgrounds are a bit rough in some places, typical of the movies of the 70's, but it has a rustic and old-fashioned charm. <br /> <br /> The strongest points of Aristocats are the characters, the music and the music. humor. The music is very memorable - try "Everyone wants to be a cat" in a hurry! The songs are written by the Sherman Brothers, who also made the song for The Jungle Book. There was a song called 'She Never Felt Alone' that would be in the movie, but unfortunately it was not included in the final film. It's a shame because I think it would fit nicely. <br /> <br /> The characters are unforgettable. Thomas O'Malley is voiced by Phil Harris, and is basically Baloo in a feline form. Eva Gabor gives the Duchess this warm and maternal feeling and the voices of the kitten really sound like children, not an actor imitating the voice of a child. The minor characters are here by the dozen and yet you end up understanding their personalities. Edgar, the butler "villain" plays a role similar to Cruella De Vil, but he is more comical than scary, often ending in funny situations. Even though he's the bad guy, he's still kind anyway. <br /> <br /> The two British geese - Abigail and Amelia really made me laugh along with their crazy (and drunk) uncle. I also like dogs, which tend to argue over who is "the leader". I could go on, but I will not ruin everything. But I can tell you, The Aristocats is funny and will entertain everyone without having to resort to the rudimentary mood of the bathroom. <br /> <br /> The end result - The Aristocats may not be Disney's greatest achievement, or even their strongest movie in the '70s (this award is a draw between The Rescuers and The Many Adventures of Whinnie the Pooh) . But it's a nice joke and it's sure to entertain. If you are looking for a stunning work of art, it may be best to watch Bambi. But if you want a fun night out, the Aristocats is the way to go. It's a lovely and lovely film and it's impossible not to like it. Appreciate! (And besides, it's good to have a movie where cats are not seen as villains).
