In my analysis just sent I mentioned the young actress as Katerina when it should have been Veronika. I was so involved with the character and the action that I think I was not so worried about the names. Anyway, she and the movie are brilliant. As I said, cinematography and the use of the editing by the director are worthy of Eisenstein and his cameraman, Tisse. The production design is top quality. The placement of actors in the foreground, middle ground and background within any scene is worthy of study. Dazzling and memorable camera movement, and an ending that has an emotional impact that leaves Hollywood movies behind. Gee! Heroic self-sacrifice instead of riding in the rainbow. Thanks again, John Hart
