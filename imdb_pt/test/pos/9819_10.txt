This is one of the few movies that was recommended to me as absolutely brilliant, which it really is. If you give this movie a low rating than you really missed the point. You could describe Fosca as manipulative, but if it's really serious, she gets sick when the love she's sure is not answered. But what would you do when you were sure that the other loved you and was "just" rejected because you were ugly? Would not you fight for it? At least I think it's better to fight for it than to die bitter. And it reminds me of the fact that I, as a man, react at first sight completely to the physical ugliness of Fosca and not look at the person who she is or could be. This film confronts me with very solemn issues about respect, trust, manipulated feeling and so on. How do I now if someone manipulates me or is just trying everything to make contact? What I think is the most striking feature of this film is that Ettore Scola has made it absolutely believable that Giorgio falls in love with Fosca.
