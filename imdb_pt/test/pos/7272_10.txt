Wow!! I chose this on the rental shelf because I loved Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in 'Trainspotting'. This is a phenomenal movie; has action, romance, suspense, intrigue and wit. When I was not laughing, I was on the edge of my seat. This is definitely a movie I would recommend for people who appreciate a smart dialogue and a new perspective from the eighteenth century. This movie has everything to keep me happy!
