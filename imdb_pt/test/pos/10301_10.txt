This movie is based primarily on the emotions and interactions of people. There are only three places (the school, the shop and the coach house) that are actually used. It's mostly in the coach's house, though. A movie does not need special effects or incredible views to be incredible in itself. <br /> <br /> Four friends who joined up during the basketball days meet. One is rich, important and has no real love out of money. One wants to be mayor again, but his competition is making him sour. One wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family. One is a traveling alcoholic. <br /> <br /> First, I love the actors in this movie. They were all familiar names to me. They proved their worth here. <br /> <br /> One of the most crucial moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, explodes on the bus. He screams and complains about how the coach cheated on the winning game. He blows the coach's whistle and shouts back his catchphrases- "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned!" It's amazing to watch, with energy that just chills you. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for anyone who understands human emotion and does not need bright effects to interest them.
