I'm from Ireland and I thought this movie had the odd minute or two where the accents were a bit off but no worse than any Brad Pitt or other American doing the accent. In addition, I have rarely seen any British actor dealing with an American or Canadian accent, except Colin Farrel in the Minority Report. This movie is a little movie and it was fun. No, it was not Blockbuster Hollywood production, but frankly I'm sick of that shit. I laughed more than a few times and had fun. Definitely worth the rent. The main character is a spoof on other tough British gangsters. At least that's how I see it. If you're expecting a production of $ 100 million, you'll be disappointed. Enjoy for what is, a little fun movie.
