They were alternatives before there was an alternative, the locals are a band like no other, and I love them for it. This has all its classics, from 'Hello Skinny', 'Third Reich and Roll', in honor of the great James Brown with a vision on 'This is the world of man of a man'. But that's just the beginning. As a bonus, he still has Renaldo & the Loafs astonishingly beautiful 'Songs for Swinging Larvae' and even features the cover of The Residents. Needless to say I recommend buying this DVD, I also recommend buying your latest album 'Demons Dance Alone', it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> Uncle Willie Eyeball Buddy # 502
