It was evident until the final credits that this film was made in 1989, as all the elements of its production were made to look like 1960 - the performance, characterizations, sets and props all had an aesthetic of an earlier time. The film opens for the moments before the atomic bomb was launched in Hiroshima and how this tragic incident affects a family: a young woman, Yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. Even in black and white, and using special effects that are quite primitive to modern but emotive and effective standards, the depictions of the immediate consequences of the bomb are rather horrible. Family members become unrecognizable to each other, others look like zombies as they roam the dirty streets in shock. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the rain that fell shortly after the bomb, which was mixed with radioactive ashes, and which Yasuko is caught. Rumors of Yasuko's being in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing affect his prospects of marriage and later discover that the black rain is indeed causing illness. The film is not only concerned with the physical effects of the bomb on the Japanese, but about the social and psychological damages that were caused. <br /> <br /> I found the film compassionate and a fascinating journey into a unique culture. While the film is primarily concerned with the pain felt by a family, the gentle political message of the film is relevant today and probably forever - wars have terrible consequences, and should not be introduced unless absolutely necessary. It is said that history repeats itself, and the current leaders of the "Coalition of the Ready" have learned nothing. Although atomic war has not resurfaced since 1945, other deadly effects have been caused. This movie is a compelling sight.
