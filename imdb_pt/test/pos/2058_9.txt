I liked this movie immensely. I really like movies where females kick a lot of ass, so this movie has already given me hope for decent entertainment. My hopes were met and it was less than 20 minutes in the film. The action, humor and intelligence that this film contained easily made him one of my favorite movies of all time. He had Sam Jackson and his undeniable onscreen presence, Geena Davis like I've never seen her before, demanding their respect and trying to take you even if you do not want to. Geena plays Samantha Caine, a desperate amnesiac to remember something about her past, but realizing quickly, the more she discovers that the more she wants to forget and eventually becomes consumed until finally Samantha is much more and Charly is all that remains. But now, Charly and Sam, two completely different women, can exist in the same body? We have characters coming in and out of the movie that feed each side of Sam / Charly, like Sam Jackson and Craig Bierko. Craig is also irresistible as Timothy, the sexy evil guy with no conscience. <br /> <br /> This film was perfectly fused, and acted perfectly, over the top and wonderfully fun. You watch the impossible happen and applaud when it happens. So it's worth your time. Beware, you will not regret it.
