This show is not stopping hilarity. The first joke will make you wet your pants. And that's probably the weakest joke of all. I started to watch when the second half of the second season began to be displayed. and immediately. I'm addicted only two weeks after starting to watch. I downloaded episodes and bought the DVD. Recurring clips such as "Ad Road Test" and "current affairs" are quiet hilarious. Then there is the ad that they take "Use Emo. Use your own tears for more effective use" Also funny in politics Side of things. Nothing is wrong with them doing it. it is funny. Any Australian who does not find it funny. Do not complain and do not watch. TODO TUNE Australian on Wednesday at 9 on ABC
