Yes, this movie was hilarious and the acting was top notch from the entire cast. Except Shelley Winters The German accent was not that good, but it does not matter, since she's hardly in the movie. So, if you're her fan, beware! The two main stars of this film are Laurence Harvey and Julie Harris. Now, before this movie, I would only see Ms. Harris in East of Eden with James Dean and I got an audio tape from The Glass Menagerie that she did onstage with Monty Clift and Jessica Tandy, so I was not sure how she'd be in this role and BOY, she impressed me. What was she like? I love ham! ;-) Mr. Harvey, he tickled my fancy! I am now a fan of Laurence Harvey full time! This hair!!! * laughs * OMG! It's almost like Burt Lancaster, that confused and crazy look, does not get any better than that. He's young and so innocent in this movie. SEE NOW! It's definitely in my top ten! :) I'm so glad I found a copy that is all mine! Unfortunately this movie is sold out and very difficult to find on video. Btw, watch out for the hospitable hospital room scene! It's one of the best parts! Or when Mr. Harvey has convinced himself that he is sick and is trying to kneel, you know how doctors do with that rubber hammer ;-) Well he does it himself and his leg kicks and kicks the table * cool * Look the look on his face, so innocent !!!! I can not describe this, but for all the people who say he could not act very well and other cockamamie reviews, see this movie and you will see what a great actor he really was. You will get hit! If you are not, then I fear there is nothing I can do for you, you are hopeless. ;-)
