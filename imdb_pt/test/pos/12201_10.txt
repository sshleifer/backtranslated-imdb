I've seen the entire first season and I can say that I have not enjoyed a show of this standard in a long time, it's great to see a show like this in the pipeline and I hope there are many on the way to the final season was the best bar none can expect by season 2 as far as I'm concerned about things can only get better as will milles continue to change will rick get your family back and how they will get off the roof of the church with the performance of this level is easy See why the show is a great success with people, as long as people do shows like this, I'm going to keep watching, I find it difficult now to have an original idea, since many programs already covered a wide variety of subjects. one as original as it is refreshing
