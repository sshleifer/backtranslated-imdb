A self-styled major league baseball player is forced to continue his career in Japan, he argues with a culture that is alien to him, a seemingly humorless manager, an attractive Japanese woman, and his own professional and social insecurities. There is a certain subtle charm that flows through the performances of Tom Selleck. There is humor, sometimes gently underestimated, as in this movie, sometimes slapstick as in "Folks!", But there always seems to be some greater purpose involved. Throw in a self-doubting individual who struggles to solve his personal difficulties, standing firm to "do the right thing," and you end up with a both funny and thought-provoking movie. The cast fits like a champion team, and even if neither the cast nor the film win awards for their efforts, they will leave viewers feeling good (and maybe those are the best results, after all). You will want to watch this movie more than once and, every time, Mr. Baseball comes home.
