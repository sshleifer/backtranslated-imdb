Fat Man and Little Boy were the coded names of the two atomic bombs that were launched in reverse order in Nagasaki and Hiroshina. How these came to be and came to be in American hands is the story of this film. <br /> <br /> The terms by the way are the code names of two bombs fed with plutonium and uranium. The Fat Man was the plutonium bomb and that was launched in Nagasaki and Little Boy was used in Hiroshima. <br /> <br /> The film is basically a conflict between General Leslie R. Groves of the United States Army and the physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, who led the team of scientists who developed the bomb under the direction of Groves. With two men from backgrounds as divergent as these, the conflict was inevitable. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who throughout his life was a disarmament activist, does General Groves. To his credit, Newman does not interpret a man whose views he would have very little in common with any kind of caricature. Groves is a military foreman with an engineering background. He wanted a combat command as trained military professionals naturally wanted in this greatest of wars. But because of his engineering background, Groves was able to spearhead the Manhattan Project, which was the code name. So be it, Newman is determined to make his contribution to the war effort. Most of us first became acquainted with team Dwight Schultz as H.M. Murdoch, the pilot whose control of reality is tenuous at best. If anyone was just familiar with the A-Team, one would think that Schultz had a great future in comic roles. <br /> <br /> Instead, Dwight Schultz is one of the best actors in the English-speaking world with amazing reach. of dramatic parts since they left the television series. J. Robert Oppenheimer in life was a complex man who recognized the dangers and benefits of atomic energy. The challenge of the problem also intrigues. Later, Oppenheimer entered into a real connection because of his left and associated political views that everyone knew walking in the Manhattan Project. Some of the less important roles that stand out are Bonnie Bedelia as Mrs. Oppenheimer, Natasha Richardson as the Communist lover of Oppenheimer whose romance with Oppenheimer took him to such a draw later, and Laura Dern as a nurse in But the best is John Cusack, who, like Michael Merriman, is a composite of some real-life scientists who can be accurately labeled as the first victims of the atomic age. His scenes with Laura Dern, especially with what happens to him, take on a real pungency. <br /> <br /> The debate over the bombs as their use is still a matter of violent debate. Fat Man and Little Boy present the facts and let you decide what could have happened if an alternative use of them had been made.
