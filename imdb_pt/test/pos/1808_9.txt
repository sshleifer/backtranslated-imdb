Glen Girl is the definitive 1980s movie with slogans filtered throughout this wonderfully acted film. The characters are so compelling that you forget it's a movie and not a true "everyday" video from any high school in the USA. This movie is for the 1980's what the TV series Brady Bunch is for the 1970s. If you do not like it then "tease me with a spoon".
