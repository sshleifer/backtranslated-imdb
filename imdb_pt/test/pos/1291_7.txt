"You were on your way and you stumbled into a skirt!" Gilligan says to Jim Leonard. This sums up the plot of this story of Leonard (the young Humphrey Bogart), when his dream is diverted by the heiress Carol, played by Dorothy Mackaill. Leonard has been working on a new and improved engine, but now his love life and motor company both have their ups and downs in this 68-minute shortie. Bogart had not yet developed the calm, thoughtful style. Good performances from most supporting characters - her butler, her co-workers, a sister, intruders along the way. Some themes for adults, since they were made just before they actually apply the movie's code, but are still tame compared to what's on TV today. Directed by Thornton Freeland, a year before Freeland directed the incredible "Flying Down to Rio".
