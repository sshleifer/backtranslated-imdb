NBC was releasing very good product when this series came out, but none of it was attracting the viewers. At least according to their executives who have wisely canceled good shows like Star Trek & My World and Welcome To It because of low ratings. NBC advertisers were getting a bargain from NBC's ignorance. <br /> <br /> This show stands out as the only time that James Garner was not enough to attract viewers. It's amazing how amazing this show was by Stuart Margolin (later Angel in the Rockford Files), from Neva Patterson to Margot Kidder. <br /> <br /> It was in a western town of 1900. Garner was playing a sheriff who did not want to use violence to fulfill his obligations. It was small town thing, but it was great. It was not long before Jim Rockford brought Garner back to success, but for my money this show was good enough, it was not the right time, the right place, or the right opportunity. <br /> <br /> The show was so good that most of the people who worked on it also got jobs in Rockford.
