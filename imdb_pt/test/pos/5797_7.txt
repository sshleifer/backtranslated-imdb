In Russia, ordinary teenager Vera (Natalya Negoda) lives a free life with her drunken father and her simple-minded mother, not working and waiting for a call to a technical telephone operator. His brother Victor (Aleksandr Negreba) lives in Moscow with his own family and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and Vera, and is always the subject of discussion. When Vera meets university student Sergei (Andrei Sokolov), they fall in love with each other and decide to marry. Sergei moves to Vera's house, but lives in conflict with his father. This relationship leads the family into a tragedy. <br /> <br /> I have just seen "Malenkaya Vera", and I really enjoyed this deep family drama. I am not familiar with the lifestyle in the former USSR, but there are some unusual behaviors that I find very interesting. The first, when Victor tells Vera that she was conceived not because her parents wanted to have her, but because they wanted to move to a larger apartment. Another, when the family goes to the beach in a truck. Many difficulties of the family of Vera and its friends, the repression in the park and other situations portrayed in the film are common in the countries of the Third World. This low budget film is very well directed, and the story is very deep and real. The cast has great performances and the actress Natalya Negoda is very beautiful. On the cover of the Brazilian VHS, released by distributor Sagres, there is information that Natalya Negoda was the center of Playboy magazine. I'm not sure how accurate the subtitles are in Portuguese, since many long phrases in Russian are limited to short translations in a few words. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "A Pequena Vera"
