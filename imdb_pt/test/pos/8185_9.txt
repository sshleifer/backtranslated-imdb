Chen Kaige gives us magnificent depth of atmosphere. Yes, it is a 'period play', but the artistic use of images by Chen makes it something more. Actors often behave like players using the stylized diction, postures and facial expressions of the Beijing Opera. All the actors in a scene play on the "back wall", even when they go to each other. They are like spirits of the past, enunciating with powerful clarity a history with urgent meaning for those who are in the present. Combined with attention to scale and masterful cinematography inside and out, "Jing ke ci qin wang" is an impressive tale told with great reverence in his own language that captivates completely.
