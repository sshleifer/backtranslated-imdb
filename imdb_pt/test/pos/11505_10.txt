The film Angels of the Universe is a pure masterpiece and proves once again that you can make a brilliant movie with a low budget, for example American Beauty and Blair Witch Project. Director Fridrik Thór Fridriksson gives the novel Englar alheims a new life on the white screen. The film is a major breakthrough in Icelandic cinema because it is the biggest and best film ever made in Iceland. <br /> <br /> The song of the film, played by Sigurrós, is very symbolic for the film. is absolutely brilliant. I recommend to all who are able to think of going and seeing this movie as fast as possible, you will not be disappointed. Would I bet on this movie to win the best foreign film award next year? all around the world!
