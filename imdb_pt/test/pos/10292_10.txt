This sad romance is unattainable because the director decides to break his narration and offer the views of each character. So there are many flashbacks of re-shooting the same scene. But, it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments to see the result! <br /> <br /> And it would be worth it, because it is for me, just one of the best French films ever made! <br /> <br /> It has everything: <br /> <br /> Cast: first steps of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such presence and such voices, even for a lack of hearing! It's symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this movie! <br /> <br /> Directing: his camera is bright, alive, plays with the scenes or can be mysterious with a long close-up "Ã  la David Lynch". <br /> <br /> Photography: the light is beautiful, between gold and rust, as their love! <br /> <br /> One never seen before Paris: It is a Paris out of time more precisely, a compound of many districts! Huge research here! It's similar to Gotham City, modern and old at the same time! <br /> <br /> Music: Not the great orchestra, but in perfect harmony with the pictures. And the music of Charles Aznavour made me discover this great singer! <br /> <br /> Ah, ?? the story! Like I said, it's a love story, but tragic: to say that love can be for nothing, that it does not make all people happy or that it's not guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because that message is not often said! Love is passion, which is derived from the Latin "pain". You can suffer a lot when you're in love! Because of the why, the endless waiting, the lack of courage, the indecision. <br /> <br /> And when you can relieve yourself, fate, destiny, god (?), devil (?) can stab you in the back, just because you arrive too soon or late, and most of all, because Love means 2 in a world of billions! Many things can happen and many stories can be written! So, what is love? <br /> <br /> Personally, I lived a few moments like this: in a car with the loved one. Your cell phone rings and you know it's your "special friend" to whom she says goodbye (not you, even if we're always together). So, you want to get out of this car to leave them together, not to hear the sweet but cruel words, but you can not because an incredible hard rain has begun! <br /> <br /> I discovered that this movie portrays these moments of tragedy like no one else!
