I'm trying to find a place to buy a DVD / VHS copy of the movie "Is not it shocking?" I was 7 when I saw this movie and lived in the city where it was filmed. Some items from my family were used in the film as props and some of my friends' houses were used in some scenes. The filming very well took place in the city and surrounding community. I only saw the film once originally and I would like to receive a copy so now I can show my family the movie. I did extensive online searches with no luck and I was wondering if anyone would have any idea of ​​trying to get a copy of this movie?
