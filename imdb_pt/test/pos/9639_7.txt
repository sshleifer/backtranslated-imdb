Good footage of World War I ships and airplanes completes this excellent war drama set in the Adriatic. Walter Huston is excellent as the commander who knows his place and his place has no room for personal feelings. The safety of the ship and the mission should always come first. Robert Montgomery is the lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role a leader must play in combat. He makes bad decisions, endangering the submarine and its crew, but ultimately becomes a "real man" after being tried and fired from the Navy. Robert Young is a junior level lieutenant and Jimmy Durante is a cook. At the same time, the war drama is an equally important love triangle between Montgomery and Madge Evans, who plays Huston's daughter and the wife of a tragically wounded aviator. Recommended.
