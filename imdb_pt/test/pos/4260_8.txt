This film shows that the system of free enterprise and the quest for the almighty overcomes all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately, the market determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes this point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is dominated by a group of street African Americans, presided over by a common-sense black who wants to make money and believes he can sell products by telling the truth. But the film shows that no matter how much he tries to do something different, the market and the political system require him to adapt, making him different from his predecessors. Interesting, off-beat movie.
