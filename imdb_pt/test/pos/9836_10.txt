This show is a show that is great for adults and children to sit together and watch. The stories are a bit slow for adults, but still good. There are a lot of kids in my family, boys and girls, and it's hard to make everyone agree on what to watch, but they always agree with each other when they want to watch the Mystic Knights. It's a wonderful show and I hope they continue to do so. All the kids in my family and I think Vincent Walsh is the best of them all. We have seen that he has done many other jobs and thinks he is doing a great job. We wish all the actors, actresses, writers, directors and producers the best of luck and we would like to say that we continue the good work.
