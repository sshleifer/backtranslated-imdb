The following is a little-known British film of 1998 which was done with a budget of Â£ 8,000 and has a run time of 70 minutes. By watching it, would you never expect your director to stay in Hollywood and become one of the most acclaimed and celebrated directors of the 21st century? well, everyone has to start somewhere, I suppose. Follower's director, as you probably already know, is Englishman Christopher Nolan, who shortly after Follow would direct the acclaimed independent film Memento; some years later, he would be hired by Warner Bros. to direct the new Batman series, which later earned him acclaim, and so on. My point is, does everyone have to start somewhere? even if it's not the most amazing debut? and Christopher Nolan introduces himself to the world in 1998 with Following. As I watched him, I could not help but resemble the other directorial debut, Eraserhead, of the avant-garde auteur David Lynch. The following is not a surrealistic psychological horror film in that sense, but the similarities are visible; most notable, is engraved in grainy black-and-white and has an atmosphere that makes it unique. It is difficult to describe in words, but vaguely resembles the smoky atmosphere you would find in the old movie noirs. Thus, it can be said that Follow is a contemporary film noir or a neo-noir. Overall, it's a fusion of this and a psychological thriller, and the story is more appropriate for these two genres. <br /> <br /> The main character has no name, and the title of the film derives from an obsessive-compulsive trait precocious. he owned ?? randomly picking people on the street and following them, sometimes for hours on end. During one of these "chase expeditions," the main character is noticed by one of the people he is following and is confronted. It turns out that the "confrontation" is a man willing to befriend our narrator, and he introduces himself; his name is Cobb, and he is an insignificant mugger who invites the narrator to follow him in his assaults. <br /> <br /> From there, the main character becomes caught up in Cobb's world, and he engages in crime, passion and violence as he gets more and more intimate with Cobb. The following is not so much a character study, but a film that follows the tumultuous relationship between these two main characters and the devastating ramifications he has in our narrator. Nolan manages to make the film resemble a film noir and emulates well the respective atmosphere. <br /> <br /> As a thriller, the following is tense and atmospheric; However, as a movie in general, it is a little disappointing. If it was not for that, then one could definitely call it astonishing. Is the entire film filmed in a non-chronological, non-linear fashion, and makes the story and film experience unique to some extent? this style was done so many times now is almost common technique? and history itself is unique to some extent. <br /> <br /> However, the following is ultimately nothing astonishing for the entire movie, and it is disappointingly mediocre. Does history ask for more? more action, more suspense and more emotion? but she becomes very entangled in her own story and instead focuses on creating a complex story. The following is successful, but without other elements it is a noir movie that does not work; has a sense of emptiness that is not huge, but still noticeable. Also, the film's shocking revelation in the end? almost a mandatory convention in the film noirs? is the one that makes us feel cheated; is unpredictable and comes out of nowhere, but in relation to the story is disappointing because it essentially makes the previous scenes, and the whole movie, seem like a huge waste of time. <br /> <br /> But the positives outweigh the negatives, and in the end Next, turns out to be a flawed but satisfying movie, yes, everyone has to start somewhere. Christopher Nolan does this with Following, and he does it in a terrific way. A quiet, meek and good way. It's not the most amazing film, and it's not worth the praise the director would receive in the next decade, but it's still a good movie. By highlighting Next, you find a well-made, tense, atmospheric thriller, one that has no noticeable nuances or innovative style, but still manages to win over the public.
