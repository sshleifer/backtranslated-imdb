This is the fourth feature film by Marc Recha. In the third 'les mans buides' - Empty hands - I promised myself not to cut my veins any longer. But this time the plot is completely different - a kind of homage to Ramon Barnils (Sabadell, 1940 - Reus, 2001), a Catalan journalist. The visuals of the trailer are impressive - a glittering river bathed in sunlight - and the promise that Marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother - none of the two professional actors - convinced me six weeks after its release. Leave yourself in this unusual road / river movie. Learn almost nothing about Ramon Barnils, but his most poignant legacy: his constant struggle against amnesia than we Catalans have chosen to forget. 'La batalla de l'Ebre' - look at the Battle of the Ebro on Wikipedia - was lost not once, but twice because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of carefree democracy nobody did much to remember the legitimate side of the War civilian and those who fought. This movie is about lonely people walking the same places with little awareness of what happened 70 years ago. This movie is about the landscape.
