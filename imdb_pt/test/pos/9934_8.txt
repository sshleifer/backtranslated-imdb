After the main actress of the opera is killed in a car accident, her young replacement, Betty, is brought to the fore. That's very lucky for her, with one problem: she has an admirer who has decided that he will kill all her friends and make her watch. What is your connection to the opera and what is your fascination with Betty? <br /> <br /> I love Dario Argento with every part of my body. And I'm not an orthodox fan, I guess. Many people, particularly critics, praise their previous work ("Suspiria" and "Deep Red"), but they really disapprove of later films like "Sleepless" which I liked. My favorite, "Phenomena", is usually very underrated. "Opera" tends to fall somewhere in the middle. Some consider him one of his last great films, others see it as part of his so-called decline. I loved it. <br /> <br /> The image is sharp, the music is great (unlike other critics, I love the metal soundtrack), the female protagonist is someone I can feel (not unlike Jennifer Connelly's "Phenomena" ") .And the wonderful images ... Great cinematography and some incredible killing scenes.The concept of etching needles into a person's eyes so she can not blink ... bright My assistant Tina thinks this it seemed false, but even if it does, the idea is more than enough to make up for it.And some great effects, like a knife blade popping into a man's mouth? <br /> <br /> Awesome. <br /> <br /> Jim Harper calls the film "dazzling" and draws attention to "groundbreaking cinematography, well-constructed scenes and exceptionally violent murders." I completely agree with that - a shot follows the camera through winding tunnels, and there is a very interesting visual use of crows along history Mike Mayo also calls it "visually fascinating" and praises the "crisp, fluid editing of camera work." It's really a wonder that this is not one of Argento's most praised works. <br /> <br /> Argento returned to the opera with "Phantom of the Opera," which was a bit of a flop, despite the cast of his daughter Asia and Julian Sands. Even more interesting this same year was the release of "Stagefright" by Michele Soavi, who (like "Opera") has a murderer released inside a theater killing people involved with the performance. Both are great movies, with Soavi more on the slasher side. (Soavi actually served as director of the second unit in "Opera" ... you can draw your own conclusions.) <br /> <br /> My only complaint with this film is the duration and pace. Although it is very well filmed and the killing scenes are glorious, they are not as frequent as they should be. The first one takes more than half an hour and then we shorten the time between them. The lead actress must be in constant terror, but she has time between the killings to calm down as if everything was normal again. It's not legal, Dario. We need to keep the suspense low and the intensity high.
