When I saw this movie for the first time, it was around 1956 and, despite having seen it recently, I have not changed my mind about it. I think it was the best Robert Ryans movie because he played someone like my father, and he was a real-life schizophrenic, my father, although he never killed anyone but was most affected during World War II. Having to humiliate him just to survive and spend the day was so appropriate. (My mother and brother had to do this.) When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of that kind of person, and I was impressed.
