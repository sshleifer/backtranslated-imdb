The first time I heard of this while searching the Net for comments on another Italian giallo / horror effort, the contemporary THE PERFUME OF LADY IN BLACK (1974, whose DVD of Rare Video, by the way, I recently purchased)? ? where it is referenced as being similar, but also as good as. Having watched STEPS myself now, can I see where this reviewer was coming from ?? in which both films deal with the psychological collapse of its female protagonist. Stylistically, however, does this owe much more to Art-house cinema than anything else? in particular, the work of Alain Resnais and Michelangelo Antonioni (and specifically LAST YEAR IN MARIENBAD [1961] and THE PASSENGER [1975] respectively); So some accused of being "deadly boring"? an epithet often linked to this "pretentious" rate (read: cerebral)! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film involves the search for a woman (Florinda Bolkan) to determine their movements in the previous three days ?? of which she seems to have no memory. Following a series of cryptic clues, she travels to Garma's "mythical" land (nearby sites, then, bear the equally fictitious names of Muda and Rheember)? where she meets several people (including Lila Kedrova as a regular aristocratic of the resort) who ostensibly recalls the heroine who stands there during his 'blackout'! Most prominently, however, is a young man (Peter McEnery) and a little girl (Nicoletta Elmi, from BARON BLOOD by Mario Bava [1972])? the former always seems to happen on the scene at propitious times, while the latter apparently confuses Bolkan with another woman (boasting long red hair and a mean streak!). <br /> <br /> Although essentially a piece of humor, this is nonetheless an exciting puzzle: inevitably, vague events happen at a deliberate pace? and where much of the power of the film stems from the remarkable central performance (which can be seen as an extension of Bolkan's role in the beautiful Lucius Fulci giallo THE LAGARDA IN THE SKIN OF A WOMAN [1971]). However, there is no denying the contribution of director of photography Vittorio Storaro (which provides a large number of camera movements and an effective color scheme? Adopting orange / red / blue filters to create atmosphere and create a saturated look to the end disorienting and bizarre, and the melancholy trail of Nicola Piovani (the composer is best known today for his Oscar-winning work on the Roberto Benigni-themed tragedy of the Holocaust, LIFE IS BONUTIFUL [1997]). > With this in mind It is worth discussing how STEP BY STEP was presented in the version I watched: well, being seemingly difficult to achieve in its original form (I can not be sure if it is uncut here or not, except to say that the film had 89 minutes while IMDb links it to 96), this edition is drawn from a VHS in English (dubbing is surprisingly good, given the international cast) with burnt Swedish subtitles addition, the DivX copy froze for a few seconds at a crucial point in the story around the 82-minute mark)! Still, we received a welcome bonus, that is, a 9-minute 'Soundtrack Highlights' in MP3 format. <br /> <br /> I know that I have not yet mentioned the subplot of the moon's mission, to which Klaus Kinski's presence is restricted: incidentally, around that time, he played an equally brief but fundamental role in another thriller good artistic with sci-fi gradients (and also set in a different location)? that is, LIFESPAN (1974). While I was watching the movie, I could not understand the possible connection this had to the central plot - except that Bolkan mentioned a recurring dream about a movie she had once seen, though not until the end, called "Footsteps On The ". Moon "(a somewhat misleading alternative title for the film itself)? Playfully, she at first remembers the image as being called BLOOD IN THE MOON (which, of course, is a classic noir of 1948 with Robert Mitchum and directed by Robert Wise!) Having said that, I took advantage of this "detour" as just another strange touch to the film (also given Bolkan's former job as a translator at a conference on the future of the Earth) and certainly did not expect astronauts to show up in the Garma beach at the end to chase the female lead, where the sand then becomes threateningly on the surface of the moon! <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie will probably make more sense in a second display ?? however, to be honest, this is best approached as a visual / auditory experience and one should not expect it to provide a narrative that is somehow clear and easily rationalized! Apt before this movie was the giallo straight THE QUINTH CORD (1971), starring Franco Nero (which I recorded in the late evening on Italian TV); Some time ago, I managed to get your version of the Spaghetti Western from "Carmen" titled MAN, PRIDE AND VENGEANCE (1968) ?? also with Nero and Kinski ?? like a DivX (after I had already lost a matinee broadcast of it), but the conversion somehow turned out to be defective and, consequently, the disc would not work properly!
