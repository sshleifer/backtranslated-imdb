The '7' rating is not necessarily defamation - this movie was made on a low budget - but it was well within its limits. <br /> <br /> A usual plot of boilers - The ship that carries a prisoner is destroyed in space, people and prisoners escape in pods, land on an unknown planet where their presence awakens something. Clutter happens, a lot of ammunition is wasted. <br /> <br /> Special effects have been spared and done right, emphasizing tomorrow's technology with displays and holographic controls rather than relying on bulky, inexpensive plastic props. In addition, the story has changed without allowing the viewer to fall into boredom, where they begin to separate things. <br /> <br /> I think this is like a Saturday afternoon movie. You can stand up and hit the refrigerator without stopping and it will still be nice. Better yet, your girlfriend can talk all the time without damaging her pleasure - and she will be happy: after all, she has to talk to you! It's that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the real story has few holes after they hit the planet, but hey, this is an action movie from Guns 'n' Ammo. Coherent story lines are not necessarily necessary as long as you have beer and chips in hand. So do not get into a cramp during the end.
