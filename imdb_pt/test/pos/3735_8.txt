Being a middle-aged mother, I really enjoyed seeing a romance between grown-ups that gets entwined in the many issues that affect us. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict a mother spends, wanting to do what is right for her children but still have a happy life. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Richard Gere, but he always does a good job with the guy who is kind of an idiot but learns something about himself. <br /> <br /> Romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic films. When Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman fall in love all over Australia, barely talking to each other, it's considered a great novel. We have much more here with Rodanthe. She redeems him. He sets her free. It's beautiful. <br /> <br /> The intimacy they create sharing their deepest insecurity, the fans in a flame of passion. How long it takes is irrelevant. Maybe the film was a bit subtle at the point where it was the letters they shared the next year that deepened their relationship - another real and honest way to meet a person. <br /> <br /> As much as I liked the plot and themes, the dialogue was not consistent in quality. Some lines sounded so true, and other lines were embarrassingly banal and flat. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed relationships with Adrienne's teenage daughter and her best friend, reminding us that there are many kinds of love, not just romantic love. <br /> <br /> This is not a carefree love. romantic comedy, plus a romantic drama. It has a very relaxed pace that some may consider very slow. <br /> <br /> The beach house is a fabulous work of art. Look at the wooden bench floating on the balcony in the first pan-over the house- very beautiful. I also enjoyed the music and the scenery, which combined to create the effect of the place as the third main character. It was this place far from their regular lives that allowed them to see each other and had a different light. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to appreciate these themes and are in the mood for a good cry. Get out of Kleenex and enjoy this movie.
