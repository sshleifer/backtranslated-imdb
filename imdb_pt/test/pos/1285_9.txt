I only saw this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal' way, once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this doozy of a movie noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story intertwine), and once with the comment of the running director. Quite surprising. A skeletal tale, reckoned with more talent, energy and substance than most of the big-budget exaggerated features being released today. <br /> <br /> I think this is an even more complete movie than the subsequent Memento, which led me to Nolan in the first place. I can not wait to see what he does with a bigger budget (and bigger box office stars) in his next movie, Insomnia.
