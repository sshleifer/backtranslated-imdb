Assy McGee is a show you really have to take a certain age to enjoy. Otherwise, you're likely to miss references to the 1980s crime films and simply think it's a joke about a straight leg. Do you think it's a childish poop humor? Go watch the Stallone movie 'Cobra' and you'll see what I mean. This show actually has a very subtle mood, which says a lot, both for a show that aired in adult swimming, and for a show about a walking ass. <br /> <br /> All the cliches of the standard genre are in place that made films like Dirt Harry and Cobra are great and ripe for parody. Sanchez is a partner of Assy, who is - according to the genre - level-headed and constantly apologizing for his partner's homicidal behavior. The chief of police is, of course, a tough case that resists fire and lives shouting, "I want your badge on my desk tomorrow morning!" The exaggerated, and sometimes utterly absurd, way in which the 1980's movie 'Renegade Cop' is parodied fits in well with the subject. For example, while breaking a bus robbery, one of the criminals stops to ask Assy: "Hey, where are you going, asshole!?" To which the title character comes out of the one-liner: "I'll ... shoot you". <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for anyone who likes 80s action movies, and has seen enough of them to understand humor.
