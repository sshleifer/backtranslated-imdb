What can I say about Kramer Vs. Kramer? On the surface it is quite simple, but underneath it deals with emotions greater than life itself. It offers many great moments, makes you laugh, makes you cry. You sympathize with the characters and care about them. Many movies fail at this, Kramer Vs. Kramer is a success. <br /> <br /> I think everyone would agree that acting is superb. Once you watch Kramer Vs. Kramer, for some time the acting in most other films begins to look plastic and without emotion. The actors seem to get along with their roles and the characters actually live on the screen. There's a fine chemistry between them. I think the best performance of the movie comes from young Justin Henry. He's unlike any other child actor I've ever seen. He is incredibly natural. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is some kind of neurotic beauty in Meryl Streep. And Dustin Hoffman offers one of the best performances of his career! The story is very well written. It's simple but complicated at the same time. The concept is the simple part, the associated feelings are the tricky part of it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, you're definitely missing out! See now!
