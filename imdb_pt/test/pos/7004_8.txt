I must say that I did not expect too much sitting to watch "Pitch Black", but I got a lot back in terms of excitement and pure fun. It's the kind of movie where you can simply lean back, relax and have fun just having fun. This is not a deep movie by any means. Everything he offers is recycled or stolen from other films like "Alien", "Predator" or something like that. But when I watch a robbery, I want it to be good, and this robbery is great. <br /> <br /> Opens with a galaxy of stars. Some of the greatest films of all time open with this kind of scene - "2001", "Star Wars", "Alien", "Predator". A ship is sailing through space when all crew members are cryogenically frozen. The ship was hit by something. They fall on a nasty little planet with three suns. All leave the ship when they discover that the transport of prisoners, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), escaped from the confinement. They scour the deserted planet for him and end up finding him, but they can not get their ship to fly again. They seek the planet for water and civilization, but it seems that all of a sudden they have disappeared from the planet not long ago. <br /> <br /> So they discover that every 22 years the planets line up in a solar eclipse and the whole planet the planet turns black as pitch. There are also hordes of aliens living in the darkness that live on the planet - what are the chances? They are on the right planet when the eclipse happens - what are the odds? And Riddick has a rare talent - he can see in the dark - again, what are the odds? <br /> <br /> There seems to be a lot of coincidence in this movie, but a movie like this is not out to get Oscar for originality or credibility. It's there to entertain the audience - this happens with ease. Vin Diesel is a great gorilla of a man with no acting talent. But I have to say that if there is anyone who can fit into the part of a useless and murderous criminal, it's Diesel. Listen to him grumble, "He did not know who he was talking to." Great stuff. <br /> <br /> The aliens in this movie are a mixture of hammerhead sharks, those of "Alien" and Predators. They have long, horizontal heads like a hammer, the agility of the aliens, and the stealth of a Predator. I assume that David Twohy (director and screenwriter of the film) did not expect the public to believe that their creatures were really something never seen before. At least I hope not. <br /> <br /> "Aliens Redux" may be a better name for this movie, but again, it's better than the second and third "Alien" movies put together. At a time when apparently finished the series are being revived - "Terminator 3", "Alien 5", "Predator 3", "Alien vs Predator" - "Pitch Black" stands out as a new series. Two more sequels are planned. Let's just hope they do not get carried away. I can imagine it in twenty-five years: "Aliens vs. Predators vs. Black Aliens: * The Fight of the Year." <br /> <br /> * Fight of the Year title can be shared with others. Next Movie "Freddy vs. Jason vs. Michael vs. Leatherface vs. Norman Bates vs. Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator vs. James Cameron vs. Barny, The Dinosaur." <br /> <br /> 4/5.
