I've become a big fan of Barbet Schroeder's work, so maybe I'm a bit biased, but I think this movie is great, although there may be some lengths. It's a romantic romantic vision of the Great Liberation in the late sixties, stylistically unbelievably polished (great set design!) And in my opinion still very watchable. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is an ironic reprint of the story of Adam and Eve being expelled from paradise after they have tasted the forbidden fruit that has turned from an apple into a hypodermic full of heroin. The woman seduces a man to use it, thus accelerating its destruction. I say accelerating as the guy seems to be doomed and thank you for an intensive life and an early grave since the great title sequence onwards. There is no place for any hope. <br /> <br /> Although the story is quite sad, I was captured by the beauty of the beautiful location Ibiza and Mimsy Farmer. I found his character at once superficial, enigmatic, captivating, annoying, interesting and boring. form, it represents what men see in women in a basic and non-offensive way.Architecture and artifacts built in general are put to go much od use ?? which appears to be a trademark of Schroeder. <br /> <br /> There is even a bit of humor, mostly delivered by Stefan, the main German character and his accent. Is not your main enemy a snake, but an older German of dubious reputation? and heroin provider - called Wolf. Although it is a German name and Stefan is German, he pronounces in English and in jealous attacks spits the name on his girlfriend at regular intervals ?? Becoming a boy who cries ... Sometimes Stefan has to work to win a cellery. "At the same time the guy goes snorkeling and then awkwardly climbs a rock with his rubber fins ... he never has male frontal nudity was funnier in the history of cinema.
