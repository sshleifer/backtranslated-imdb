Am I the only person who believes that this American version is so much better than the English 1934 film? The English version does not have suspense, seems old-fashioned and with very low budget, and has exceptional performances (except for Peter Lorre). The 1956 version, in addition to having high production values, shows James Stewart as the perfect American 'innocent' overseas, and gives Doris Day its best role ever. Of particular note is the music - the music of the American film is almost classical; compare the "Albert Hall" sequences of both, and you'll agree that Bernard Herrmann's music is much more exciting than the original version (though it's basically the same song!). The only flaw in the 1956 movie is the ridiculous encounter at The Taxidermy Store, I would appreciate any argument that could prove to me that the English version is better.
