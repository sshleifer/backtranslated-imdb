Once again John Madden gave us a magnificent film. A simple but beautiful story, located in a real paradise, and the music can not be better, Stephen Warbeck enchants us once again, and good performances, but ......... why Penelope Cruz is in this movie ? I asked the same question while watching this movie. Of course her Greek accent is not believable, she is incapable of acting decently even in a scene. Not even in the end did she do a good job, after so many events, after years she finally got to see Corelli again and she could not change the same face of stupidity that we had to endure throughout the film. Anyway, Cage was very good at one of his best characters; Hurt is also great at his and the rest of the cast all did a great job, so the end result is a movie that is really worth watching. This is a beautiful movie that neither Mrs. Cruz managed to ruin it. So far I think it's Madden's best work, so no fan will be disappointed.
