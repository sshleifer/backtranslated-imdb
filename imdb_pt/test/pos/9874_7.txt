For some reason, I always like movies that people hate when I do not really think they're that bad - and that's one of those movies. In the case of this movie, I think it's too much criticized, I'm really not that bad. Actually, I think this is one of the best sequences. "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" begins the night before Halloween, where Michael brutally kills Jamie Lloyd (who was taken captive by "Man In Black" in part 5) after she gives birth to her baby. Next, we are introduced to the Strode family, who now live, coincidentally, in the old house of Myers (which seems to change in each film). Kara and her son Danny are the main characters, along with Tommy Doyle, the now-adult who survived the original murders. They must fight together to save Jamie's baby from an evil cult that takes care of Michael while Michael himself is led to kill by an ancient Celtic ritual where he must sacrifice an entire family in Haddonfield. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of the best sequences in the series, in my opinion, anyway, and I can not understand all the hatred this has caused. Had a good suspense, an interesting storyline (but sometimes confusing, I admit), some scary moments here and there, and many blood and knife strokes to appease all of you gorehounds. Not all acting was not particularly good, but it was convincing enough for me. Marianne Hagan is the protagonist and she is very friendly. Paul Rudd plays an adult Tommy Doyle, and is also very talented and does his part very well. The rest of the supporting cast (aside from the brilliant Donald Pleasance) is not much to commend, but it was not too bad considering all things. I'm still not sure if giving an explanation as to why Michael kills was completely necessary but ended up getting well in the end and I was not upset at the way they tied everything together. The open ending was also kind of weird, but it could have been something else. <br /> <br /> I also saw the infamous "Producer Cut" of this movie, his original cut, and I think in some ways, it's better. This further explains the curse of Thorn that Michael directs and has some extra scenes that really helped to support the film, but the ending was much better in my opinion. It seemed more natural than the conclusion given to us in the studio cut of the film. I would like Dimension to release this alternate version of the movie because I personally think it is best. Chances are they are very small, though. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" is a very good sequence and will appeal to all fans of the series. This movie is not the best of all horror movies, but definitely worth renting if you want to see Michael doing what he likes. Just do not expect glitz, and you'll have fun. 7/10
