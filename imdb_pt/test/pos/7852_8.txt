This is a good movie, I will not go into detail, as the other user comments do a good job in taking care of this. However, I disagree with the statement that this is Eastwood's best work. This is not a very defensible position based on the volume of strong films he directed and starred in. I'd like to note that I find it interesting that two of the actresses who played in this movie, Pattye Mattick and Peggy Drier, never again appeared in another movie or television show, despite giving good performances. Does my curiosity make me wonder what happened to these two actresses?
