A friend of mine asked, "Is not it necessary to be pro-euthanasia to like this movie? Is it a mistake in the movie to infer that most quadriplegics want to end their lives?" Interesting questions. <br /> <br /> As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), there's only one tetraplegic who wanted to end his life in The Sea Inside. I think Ramón Sampedro tackled that in the movie too. He's the one who wants to die. It is he who is fighting for his right to decide his death. He is speaking for himself and not for other quadriplegics. While your pioneering work, depending on someone's perspective, may be beneficial or detrimental to tetraplegics in the future, your primary goal is personal. But one thing that this movie does (my opinion, anyway) is that it forces viewers to ask themselves the inferred questions my friend so briefly put forth. <br /> <br /> After my first exhibition of the Inner Sea, I walked home in a conflicting blur. I struggled to reconcile myself with this exasperating idea; Why did Ramon want to die? Given the love, care and sacrifices so unconditionally poured into Ramon by the people around him, why would he cling stubbornly to his painful decision? Then, on my second showing, a shared thought between Ramón and the lawyer came into my consciousness. He made a revealing remark: "... total dependence comes at the cost of intimacy." Most humans long for such intimacy. Of course, how much we value such "needs" depends to a large extent on the individual. As a person with a biased family sensitivity, I strongly sympathized with the caregivers in this film. Why can not Javier consider the sacrifice and love of his family and friends? Is he blind to all this? I think not. The miracle of the Inner Sea, therefore, is its insightful representation of a very humanist tug-of-war. When we are faced with the tutelage of a healthy but incapacitated entity who has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intention to die, what is the right thing to do? To care for and keep this loved one alive, against his will, a pious gesture? Does this show the value of our love? Or merely calms our "selfish" fears of irreplaceable losses? With so much understanding given to caregivers, their invalid accusations, submitting to the total dependence of others for survival, would not they also be a neglected act of sacrifice? Rhetoric or not, how much does "dignity" worth to an individual? Is he living (or dying) with dignity a privilege or a right? If we really care and love a person, should we also respect their final decisions in life (as in death)? A torrent of questions that the film could have done, whose answers I am not in a position to provide. <br /> <br /> In our eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of pro-life or pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of ​​gray that is swallowing the most intimately affected people, caregivers, and caregivers . The Inner Sea therefore attempted to present the delicate but complex dynamic relationship between them. Intuitively, this movie understands one thing; that the nature of "sacrifice" is never one-sided. In this tug of war, we must strive not to win arguments, but to watch closely and hopefully determine who the "stronger" party is to make that sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The Inner Sea is a disappointing movie. It opened my eyes to things I do not want to see. And for that, I'm grateful.
