Victor Sjostrom, who is the grandfather of Swedish cinema, directed this realistic and existentialist film about atonement, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption and the darkest moments of the human condition. He stars as David Holm, a good non-nick who responds to a moment of kindness, returning to his drunken habits, only to later have to negotiate his soul with the driver of the ghost carriage: death. <br /> <br /> Unlike many silent films during the period, the film is almost absent scenes with over-action. The rhythm becomes tedious with his overly familiar Dicksense narrative. However, examining the film in retrospect and in comparison to others of its time, is a very daring and unique film. Audiences of the time were not exposed to this subject, and cinematography is tremendous, symbolic and accompanied by dual-exposure effects and multiple-layer flashbacks. It's a genuinely scary and scary movie for young people, for sure. <br /> <br /> Watching the film, it is easy to see the later influences that this film had on the Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Most of Bergman's great themes are here in full display. Sjostrom, of course, later starred in Bergman's masterpiece of alienation and loneliness: wild strawberries. This would be Sjostrom's final performance as an actor. Sjostrom based the script on a novel by Swedish writer Selma Lagerlof. *** of 4 stars.
