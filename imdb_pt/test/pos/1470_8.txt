Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park, finally slip out of their exhausting schedule to talk to the cameras while drinking champagne in their hot tub. At first, when I saw this, I did not feel as much sarcasm as there was in that. I knew they were joking when they complained about different actors in the show and when Trey said he would not give money to his mother, but there is a lot of sarcasm, that this documentary is more of a mockumentary full of inner jokes. <br /> <br /> This "documentary" shows everything about South Park (until the second season anyway). It shows what happens behind the scenes with the animation and recording. He has interviews, many of which are fake interviews, but some, among all the fabrications, give insight into the show. Clips from both Trey Parker's Spirit of Christmas shorts are shown, as are many clips from the show. If you were a fan of South Park, that should have quenched your thirst for demonstration knowledge by the end of 1998 when that was done. Now, obviously, the show has changed, but that's still interesting. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a fun documentary in which Trey Parker (especially) and Matt Stone are arrogant idiots, and that is exactly what they wanted to come out as. They may be that way in real life, but here was a joke, a 51-minute joke. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out of ****. 51 min. Not classified, contains language and sexual content.
