I loved that the weather was light and airy. I loved that the main character wanted assurances about his future, and that his roommate put him "straight" with everyone. I loved that they deal with the dynamics of how members of the men's group dealt with each other, considering that this was run by a lesbian, the whole theme of masculinity was put there, ridiculed, dissected, and questioned. What does a man do? What makes a straight, gay or bisexual? You are not sure if our main character has decided who he really wants; he is living in the moment and has thrown caution to the wind. These and other reasons make me love this movie.
