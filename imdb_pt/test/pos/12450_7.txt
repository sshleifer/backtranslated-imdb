I remember seeing this movie in the theater in 1984, when I was 6 years old (you do the math). I just loved it. I was Tarzan for 2 weeks after seeing this (climbing the furniture, jumping around to make monkey sounds). It began a fascination for Tarzan and monkeys, but curiously a lasting love for Christopher Lambert (keep in mind that I saw Highlander soon thereafter). 1984 was the last time I saw the movie until about a month ago. It happened to be at the cape while I was getting ready for bed at 3:30 in the morning and even if it was late and I was tired and I had to be at work at 9:00 in the morning, I stayed awake to watch this movie that I I loved it as a child. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing it, I realized that it was not such a good movie, and even stranger than that, that Andie MacDowell's voice was dubbed by someone else. Ian Holme was naturally solid as usual, and surprisingly the jumpsuits still held, but the most surprising thing was how good Lambert was as Tarzan. It was great! The depth he captured in so few lines, his primitive body language and, most importantly, his ability to bring that character through his extremely large ark were simply incredible. <br /> <br /> As I stated earlier, I am Lambert's fan. , but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. In this film he was really very good and it's a shame he never had the chance to portray a character so deeply again. <br /> <br /> So to make a long story short, I was a little disappointed that the movie was not so good but I was glad to see that Lambert was good and I do not regret staying until 6 : 00 to see.
