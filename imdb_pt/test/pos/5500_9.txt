'In the Line of Fire' is one of those Hollywood movies that pops up on TV a bit, but although I've seen it a few times, I usually end up sitting all over again. Because? - It's good! Clint Eastwood is great as always, and the character he plays is interesting and fuller than usual. The character, agent of the Secret Service Frank Horrigan, is haunted by the fact that he was in the detail that failed to protect President Kennedy in Dallas, and now he is forced to coincide with a professional assassin who is openly declaring that he will kill the President. However, the film does not make him a depressed, thoughtful and obsessed character. He is charming and gentle, and is realistic as a guy who has had a lot of experience in life and is comfortable in his own skin. He is even quite convincing when he flirts with the younger agent played by Rene Russo. The assassin, played by John Malkovich at his best, is cerebral, deliberate and likes to play high stakes of life or death. He still catches the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth. <br /> <br /> The film is consistently enjoyable, and delivers all the goods - suspense, action, romance and drama - all in their proper quantities. It's a fun movie that is really helped by the great actors!
