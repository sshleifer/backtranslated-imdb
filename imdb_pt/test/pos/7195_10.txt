It's the first time I remember where an adaptation did exactly like the book ... In fact, only jokes were added to the story instead of mixed content or removed! <br /> <br /> Like the Egyptian slave Cellularis who had difficulty transmitting, um, communicating, LOL! Or when Tidivinnus was cast as a quasi-Sith Lord and became angry when the Roman Empire suffered a coup, the general ordered the Empire to ...? Oh, watch the movie people! <br /> <br /> I can easily believe that this photo was one of the most expensive in the history of French cinema and, for my part, it was worth it, Depardieux was excellent as the Roman bashing and the boar chewing Obelix. Clavier playing the small, untamed Gaul was perfect and very different from his days as Jean Reno's squire in "Just Visiting". <br /> <br /> The fighting scene between Artifis and Edifis was hilarious and cool The Matrix theme was not borrowed to steal a perfect battle! <br /> <br /> Barba Ruiva, the pirate and his crew nearly stole the photo, from sinking their own ship to being the engine of Otis (Edifis's Assistant). invention used at the end. <br /> <br /> I understand there's Asterix and the Olympics with many of the same team back, by Toutatis, I plan to see that too!
