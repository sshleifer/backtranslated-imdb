I remember hearing about this movie and how it played at almost every drive-in movie theater here in Toronto. It's about a group of girls who are not accepted by the other brotherhoods in their colleges, so they start their own, and of course, call it H.O.T.S. It's a fun movie, it's full of drive-in nostalgia! Lots of T-shirts, vans, fights and a game of football matches like no other! It has been compared to "Animal House", which is a good movie by itself, but for me nothing compares to H.O.T.S. It has its own brand of fun and character. If you are looking for a classic T n'A movie, look no further because the H.O.T.S. girls are to the rescue, boom-boom shorts and everything!
