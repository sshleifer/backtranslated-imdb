Firstly, I would like to say that before watching this film, I considered myself an accepted individual. Someone who cared about others, appreciated others, found almost no judgment against other people, and this movie changed (I think) my life or point of view dramatically. When I watched, I did not particularly know what it was about, I knew it was about some kind of forbidden relationship, but some that I had no concept of, and when I started to see what was happening between these two beautifully portrayed characters, I was in a state of shock, disbelief, confusion and surprise. The first time I watched, I was blind. Blind to their love, their intimacy, their connection, their purity as human beings, to their relationship. I watched it a second time because I finally figured out how hypocritical I was being, saying to myself and others, "Oh I accept all kinds of people, and I try not to judge them" while I still judge this wonderful story and incredibly insightful, because of my fear, I suppose. The second time I watched this movie, I opened my eyes that had remained closed the first time, and actually looked, not at the kind of taboo relationship I had heard all my life but simply for two humans. in love. And I loved it, I loved the plot, I loved the broken but strong individual people in the movie, I loved the sharing of feelings and I loved the strong bonds created. It's really an opening movie, beautiful that made me cry at times, and I hope people who read this and see the movie eventually remember that everyone deserves love, no matter what form or format it is presented. ....
