There were about 60 different films and television pieces, plus the classic opera from this tale of a sex-crazy girl and her unfortunate soldier-lover. This story has been made so many times, in many ways. <br /> <br /> Vicente Aranda directs the script adaptation of Joaquin Jorda's classic novel & part of Prosper Merimee. <br /> <br /> This is the ONLY story of Bizet's opera, Carmen <br /> <br /> Pas Vega is an exciting Carmen, full of passion and ability to lead simple men to do terrible and tragic things . Leonardo Sbaraglio is the unfortunate soldier who is entangled in the stubborn web of Carmen and driven to do bad things. <br /> <br /> Jay Benedict is the author Prosper who tells this story. <br /> <br /> There is not much action, BUT there are some very hot sex scenes. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is almost an NC-17 movie. <br /> <br /> Since I've seen this tale so many times in so many disguises I was not too impressed. <br /> <br /> It's a very well done film and it will appeal to those who may not know it, <br /> <br /> My not very enthusiastic comment too. It may be that I miss the fantastic Opus track of Bizet. <br /> <br /> See this as you may like it more than I did.
