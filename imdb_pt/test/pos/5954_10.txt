As a Frenchman, I found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype that is made of French like that, in some Western standards, in the spy movies, etc ... and in many other things also, on the way. ... I've seen 3 times and every time I discovered new things and I laugh to tears ... Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Béjo, Aure Atika the director and all the cast, all the crew did a fantastic job. This movie is funny, but it is much more than that: it has several levels. You laugh because of simple jokes, because of some humorous critics (the film is brave enough to be critical), because of the physical comedy, because you believe in the characters etc ... Aesthetically and musically, it's a success also. Go see if you can.
