Less a suspense than a colorful adventure with elements of suspense, THE MAN WHO KNOWS MUCH should not really be compared to Hitchcock's masterpieces like VERTIGO, BACK WINDOW or PSYCHOTIC; instead, it's more like playing nice games than catching a thief and the north in the northwest. Filmed largely on location in Morocco and London, the film tells the story of a couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) whose holidays are cut short when innocently come into conflict with a murder plot - and when their son is kidnapped for James Stewart and Doris Day are quite effective in their roles as the All-American couple, and the characters get an unusual twist: Stewart, a midwest doctor, is outgoing but has a touch of "the ugly American overseas" about his personality ; Day, who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired after his marriage, has a suspicious nature. These qualities of personality and experience play very well in history. <br /> <br /> THE MAN WHO KNOWS A LOT Contains several famous scenes; both the scene in which Stewart Day drugs before telling him of the abduction and the very complex Albert Hall sequence, involving what looks like hundreds of cuts, are very powerful. Less often noticed, although in my opinion equally if not more satisfying, are the subtler scenes in which Hitchcock combines a suspense tip with perverse humor, as when Stewart tries to spot in a taxidermist shop and Day sings "Que Sera, Sera" (written for this film) in an inappropriate way at an embassy cocktail party. Although the MAN WHO KNOWS A LOT does not have the depth and impact of Hitchcock's larger work, it remains a pleasant and entertaining film. "One that compares very well with his work as a whole. recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
