This black-and-white movie arrived at the Spartan movie house in my village Frisia, about 18 months after its release. At that time, much of our feature-length comedy came from Denmark (Nils Poppe, anyone?), So this movie sounded like lightning - made me cry with impotent joy, ROTFL as we now say. Okay, so some of the vision jokes were actually recycled into vaudeville 'schtick', but how did that 'barefoot boy with brass cheeks' know that at the time? Anyway, my favorite scenes had the unique mark of Jerry's frenzied antics, like that boxing match in Hawaii. Seeing "Sailor Beware" again fifty years later, I still laughed at the events. Granted, without the nostalgia component, it would probably be just another comedy just for mediocre. But then another film that once left me in even more impotent spots, Spike Jones's "Fireman Save My Child" now seems dated and affected, plus a few short snippets of orchestra and Doodles Weaver scenes. It should be some special ingredient that makes the Martin & Lewis product stay fresher longer. For me, this one at least ranks eight out of ten.
