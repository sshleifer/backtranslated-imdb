If vampire tales are your glass of blood, then this Goth festival based on the Vampire Chronicles of Anne Rice should prove to be a satisfying experience. A true consort of undead in a contemporary setting, "Queen of the Damned," directed by Michael Rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness, and the unhappy souls that dwell for all eternity. <br /> <br /> The vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), bored with a world that no longer excites him, has been asleep for many years; but suddenly the sounds of that world he hears from his prolonged sleep change and, liking what he hears, he ventures to investigate. What he finds is a world full of new sounds, a new kind of music - driving and penetrating - sounds that strike the senses and make him feel alive and well. And he knows that his time has finally come, that it is time for him and those like him to go out on the field and face the world on their terms. To that end, he becomes the man facing a band - a singer and performer unlike any that the world has ever known. He introduces himself as a vampire, and quickly creates followers who go beyond London (where it all begins), and finally takes him to Death Valley, California, where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything. Have you seen or experienced. <br /> <br /> Lestat is powerful, no doubt, but there are those of his kind who do not accept favorably the fact that he has revealed them, one of whom is Marius (Vincent Perez), a powerful vampire in his own right - the vampire, in fact, who "made" Lestat so many years before - and they are meeting, joining and making plans to find Lestat at the show. And they are not going to music. But there is something else too: at one point, Lestat inadvertently awakens the 'Mother' of all of them, the most powerful of all vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), who is about to make his presence known to all, and especially to that which she chose to rule at her side as her King: Lestat. And at the concert, rest assured, Akasha will be present, without fail. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this is the story of Lestat, and Rymer presents it amid a rich atmosphere and with some exquisite moments, although his film has less content than saying "Interview with the vampire "or" Bram Stoker's Dracula ". It sets a good pace, and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills, but overall the movie is not as steeped in threats as it could be, or as far as one might expect. At the final count, in fact, the amount of meat that is incinerated overcomes the actual blood loss, although there is more than one taste of blood, and more than a fair amount of lips and mouths dripping with red material. There is also a good F / X in the hand, especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of vampires as they move and launch through the air faster than the naked eye can discern. It's a decent job for Rymer, but he could have put more teeth into it if he had interpreted the alienation suggested by Lestat; as it is, you have a sense of your detachment, but not enough to fully envelop it. In Interview with the Vampire, Tom Cruise brought some charismatic power to the role of Lestat, but Townsend is even more effective with a look and attitude that captures Lestat perfectly. He interprets it with a sense of acceptance and, upon closer examination, you may even find a hint of remorse and desire. It's a good performance, and one that sells your character convincingly. Like Marius, Vincent Perez does a good job too - he's actually one of the film's strengths - his character is a bit ambiguous; this, however, has more to do with the way it was written than with Perez's performance, which is very good. Marguerite Moreau, like Jesse, is a very curious young woman for her own good; and the beautiful Lena Olin as Maharet, Jesse's aunt, who finally plays a crucial role in the outcome of the drama involving Lestat and Akasha. <br /> <br /> And like Akasha, Aaliyah is an absolutely fascinating presence. What more can be said about her than she is a talented talented, with tremendous talent and beauty. And, tragically, she left us very early. <br /> <br /> The support cast includes Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman), Matthew Newton. (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Maudy). With a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre, Anne Rice fans will especially be pleased with Queen of the Damned, a very well-crafted film delivered by director Rymer and his engaging cast. By focusing attention on the drama of the story - and the way it is presented - instead of concentrating only on providing some cheap emotions, Rymer has managed to produce a true horror film that is definitely a cut above, and one that can only sharpen his appetite for more of it. And this is the magic of cinema. I rate this 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
