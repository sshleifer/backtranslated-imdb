Coming from the "druggie" generation, I found this movie hilarious. This definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up to date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way. I would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They do not like drugs, but they know enough about them to understand the comedy of the movie. It's been so long since I've seen that I can not remember a few things. I would have to say the funniest part was when Dr. Jekyll dozed off his lab table and inhaled the straw while snoring, then snorted at the drug powder he had invented. The funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie.
