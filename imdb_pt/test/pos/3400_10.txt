I've always heard about this great mini-series, but I first saw it this week, July 2007. I can see why so many young actors started their careers. The story is intriguing and gives a wonderful insight into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during that time. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the nineteenth century. Many historical facts were thrown into history and it was interesting to see the history books coming to life. The costumes and sets were beautiful! I really enjoyed watching both parts I and II. Part III is a disappointment.
