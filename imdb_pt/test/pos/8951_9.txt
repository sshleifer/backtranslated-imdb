Very beautiful love story between Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina. The whole story is very bizarre and funny. A funeral director (A. Molina) loves a married woman (B.Blethyn). They try to fake their death to escape the husband and the village. A scenario of strange situations begins. As good as ECONOMY GRACE and LONG LIVE NED DEVINE.
