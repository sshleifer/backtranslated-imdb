As a diver, I can appreciate the incredible physical strain that camera operators must have endured for taking underwater shots. This series is MUCH more than that, though. The narration is perfect, the scenes that border on the implausible and the subject are captivating. The day to day struggle for life that occurs outside the sight of us, land dwellers is incomprehensible. This set of DVDs opened my eyes to another planet right here on Earth. I ask everyone to watch this series.
