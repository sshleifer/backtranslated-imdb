This miniseries is a reasonable sequel to the original Gone With The Wind. If someone sees this on their own merit (and not immediately after the original), it comes out very well. I'm sure most viewers will question the performances of Scarlett and Rhett, but it seems unlikely that anyone else could have done better. Many of the characters here are new to this plot, so the comparison in these cases (Rhett's mother, Uncle Henry Hamilton, Will Benteen) is not a problem. No one will be Vivien Leigh or Clark Gable. <br /> <br /> The best part of all the production is the beautiful spring landscape of Charleston and Ireland. Watch for it alone. Obviously, this was a high budget TV miniseries. He follows the book for a while, then has a whole new plot when Scarlett goes to Ireland. <br /> <br /> The acting is believable if nothing special - how I feel about Roger Moore after Sean Connery for James Bond.
