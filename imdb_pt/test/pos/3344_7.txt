I probably would not have bothered to comment on this movie had it not been disturbed by the constant references made here in North America as a porn movie. Our obsession with what is or should be considered pornographic remains a relic of the "guidance" provided to the filmmakers by the Hayes committee for many years and now is the time to relegate it to the past. So far, we have not gone much further than establishing a somewhat arbitrary split between what we now call "soft" and "hard" pornography, with the two carrying the same pornography label. It's about time we all recognized that neither the release version of the movie nor the unrated version (hard porn?) Available on DVD were pornographic anyway. <br /> <br /> Legal Terms Pornography is defined by its ability to deprave or corrupt. Many classic books like Lady Chatterley's lover, Fanny Hill, Women in Love, The Story of O or Moll Flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content, tried by jury and authorized based on this definition, but in practice most ordinary citizens do not are interested in what they consider to be a legal misconception and apply a simpler test that is quite rigorous when applied to books or movies that are very close to the line but serves to quickly clear most others of any pornography spot. Although the Hayes Code classifies AIW as unacceptable for both nudity and depictions of sexual activity, in practice, most people accept that the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to stimulate the development of stable family relationships long-term. in which the participants find real satisfaction, can not be considered pornographic (this does not mean that work describing unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognized as pornographic, only that they may need more sophisticated evaluation). At AIW, we have a movie about a young librarian who has had a well-educated education and keeps her suitor at bay because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do. After he becomes very frustrated with it and threatens to leave her, she falls asleep and dreams that she is transported to a Wonderland (intimately based on Lewis Carroll), where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about her sexual needs. She is shocked, but is a gentle person who takes things when she finds them, then, in a short time, she discovers that her own prejudices gradually disappear. She wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break the courtship, but her attitude toward him has changed so completely that their relationship has been fully restored, and the film ends with them living "happily ever after" with their children in a house with a white picket fence and a family dog ​​- a final clearly aimed at the romantics who remain very young at heart. <br /> <br /> Pornographic? - Hardly. <br /> <br /> Suitable view for children? "Well, it probably is not like that unless they have very progressive parents. <br /> <br /> Classification R? PG would be more appropriate today. <br /> <br /> Fun for viewers in most age groups? - Yes, but the film has its flaws - these are discussed in many of the comments here on the IMDb, however most commentators clearly enjoyed and liked. <br /> <br /> I believe the only pornography associated with this movie was the reported claim by a "scientific proof" anti-porn activist that a photo of Kristin deBell's magazine was a photographic montage of face pictures of a ten-year-old child with various body parts of adult models. These and other comments seriously undermined the career of a very promising young actress, but today the film seems to be about to become a cult classic. Several home video productions were released in VHS and DVD formats; the latter was a DVD containing the R and unrated versions of the film, released by Subversive Cinema in 2007. Copies of this were readily available until a few months ago, now they are almost sold out and mail order suppliers still have copies in stock are often selling their original price - a situation that often quickly results in a new DVD release. This continued interest almost 35 years after the release of the original film points to an almost classic status. <br /> <br /> Commenters in this database should provide their viewers with useful guidance on whether it is worth watching or even collecting a movie. my comments here were intended to emphasize the continuing damage to industry that still results from the pressure on the major studios to abide by the recommendations of self-censorship originating from the Hayes Committee. In this database, these general comments are quickly labeled by readers as "not useful" and rarely do; but fortunately I still have room to add that, in my opinion, this movie is quite unusual and worth watching or even buying. It's flawed, but Kristine deBell gives a great performance and the film delivers a unique and rewarding visual experience. Overall, I would rate it at 7 stars and will be buying a copy of the next DVD edition, if and when it appears. If Mrs. DeBell is still alive today, I would love to hear your comments both in attempts to suppress this film and in the late recognition it has gradually achieved.
