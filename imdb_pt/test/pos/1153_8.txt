One of the previous reviews of this movie ends with "Only for big fans of the main actors or exotic / romance movie fans Holywood ...", as if those were not enough reasons to love him! Anyone who, after seeing this movie, complains about Connery's accent, or the lack of historical verisimilitude, the realism of political motivations or any other extra-film concern, simply does not like movies. See it and be impressed by the stellar power of the two tracks, the exotic, the romantic, the photography and the music, and the daring adventure of a truly escapist movie. This is proof that Hollywood can "do it like they used to" when it really wants to. A 8/10 solid.
