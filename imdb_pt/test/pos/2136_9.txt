I only saw this movie once a quarter of a century ago but the impact never left me and I still remember my reactions to it so far. I was mesmerized by the breadth and beauty of much of the photograph. I was surprised that an American studio could produce a European film with its slow pace and unfocused plot. The lack of any strong character seemed a flaw, but I was enraged at the completely unnecessary end of the yacht, which seemed to have been tied to some sort of plot cohesion and which was totally at odds with the style of the rest of the group. It was also refreshing to see a Westerner who made no pretense about the brutality and exploitation that so often were the debris of the American dream. The western scenes and scenes also had an authenticity that was entirely new to me and foreshadowing the recent Deadwood series. The film was massively cut out for the American public and it is my very real wish that in these days the Director's Cuts that Michael Cimino is given the opportunity of a new edition in the light of reflection - a cut that could make this sick film doomed to the work- that had the potential to become. I've seen the first cut first and the network of relationships makes a lot more sense, though Christopher Walken is primarily responsible for it. If only De Niro and not Kris Kristofferson had played the leading role, there was still a great deal of concern about creating reality and atmosphere at the expense of a good script. However, the camera work was so cleverly manipulated that sometimes you could almost believe you were inside the action. And there were many special moments. Everyone arguing in the hall in different languages ​​trying to overcome their national differences and seeking some unity of action in the face of impending disaster gave a real insight into the difficulties faced by US welding: especially when the threat came from a combination of the old elite and money . Nate's hesitant approach to Ella when she first visited her hut contrasted with the violence that would follow and was another. I had a special exhibit with a large group of friends to see the new cut and we all enjoyed it, although having varied bookings. This revisionist and much closer to the true version of the events was probably too much for the Americans to take when the film was the first one released but we all felt that it had a huge merit and that its place in film history was also due to major review
