I'm not the kind of person who watches TV shows because acting is usually a drug or it's unrealistic or dramatic TOO! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for their sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a bit funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She prides herself on wanting to attend Harvard and the boys / boyfriends always come second in her book. She is a loyal friend and always the creator of peace. There is a subtle romance that is what I personally like. Not the exaggerated romance that many people fail to have in their lives, but a realistic kind of romance. Each character eventually succeeds, and they do not find their prince charming at first glance and they do not just "fall in love" with all the guys that appear on their way. It's a realistic show, but when you watch it, it's best to brush your movies, pop culture and random facts because Lorelai Gilmore is always making referrals. I fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance, you too.
