Do you like explosions? How about fighting? Well, this movie has both. You know the other thing you can not have a movie without: a motorcycle boot, the guy who rebounds someone's head and knocks it down at the same time. You bet the Stabilizer has one. There is even a classic cliff scene. <br /> <br /> On the whole, I'm very proud to have seen this movie ... and even prouder to have my review being the first ... YES!
