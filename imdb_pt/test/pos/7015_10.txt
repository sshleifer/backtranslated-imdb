So good, acting, cutting, driving there may not be the best ever, but the dance, the movements, the heat and the passion in this movie is definitely the best (well ... at least for me ^^) really touched me , inspired me to learn to dance. I'm still especially registered on this site just to be able to vote for it and contribute my support for this movie. for this movie, it literally gave me shivers when I watched. I love it. Jennifer Gray is so beautiful! Patrick is so sexy there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the first thing I'll do tomorrow, on my way to university, will be to go to the video store and buy a copy of it, watch it again and again until I'm old and wrinkled and can not dance with the movie any more. before I need to learn all the dances moves there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
