Cleopatra 2525 is a very fun and entertaining show. You should not take the whole show seriously, but if you want to have fun, this is your TV show. Being made by the Xena producers is a guarantee of quality, and Cleopatra 2525 is no different from Xena. The formula of the female warriors is brought into the future, where they do not have to fight against warriors or gods, but dangerous robots that inhabit the surface, and humans are forced to live underground. Throughout the two seasons of Cleopatra, they develop an interesting and fun underworld, and we know the three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). All are different, but as a team they work very well. The three main actresses have appeared previously in Xena, like most of the regular guests (there are some familiar faces of Hercules also, or of both shows). I especially liked the character played by Danielle Cormack (Ephiny in Xena), which is very different from any of the roles I knew previously. So if you liked Xena and Hercules, you'll love Cleopatra 2525. If you do not know, try it: I'm sure you'll like it.
