I do not understand why more people did not comment on this, other than the fact that perhaps not many have seen it. It's an incredible cast of characters, one after another after another, all done by the guy who wrote the play. If you do not like theatrical plays, you may not like it (after all, the pieces generally do not look good on the TV), but it's a one-man show that will make you pay attention to the whole movie . Highly recommended.
