Okay, here's the deal. There is this American pilot who is flying, minding his own business, when he is suddenly overtaken by evil, cowardly and non-American fighter jets (they are from the Middle East, but enough to say they do not like apple pie or Elvis Presley), who proceed to overthrow him. Now this American pilot was doing nothing wrong, but those bad non-Americans did not care and, before you know it, he was attacked in a foreign jail and sentenced to death !! <br /> <br /> Now, what usually happens here is that the US military would bomb a couple of nearby towns until the pilot is released, but not this time. Those evil types of love of peace probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of massacre of retaliation. As you can imagine, that does not please the pilot's family and the evil alien dictator has that happy and satisfied look on him. It will make Americans pay, oh yes, indeed! <br /> <br /> But he did not count on Doug Masters, the 16-year-old driver. You see that Doug has been able to fly a plane for longer than he can drive a car (which can not be that long) and decides to fly to the country from the evil, foreigner and get his father back. Then, with the help of his friends, Doug and his wing, retired pilot Chappy Sinclair, Doug launches a two-man airstrike on foreigners. <br /> <br /> Now you would think this plan would be doomed to fail, but you would be wrong. Of course, these guys from the Middle East can be all veteran riders, but Doug has an ace up his sleeve, he hears rock when he flies! After dropping a dozen enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery, Doug lands at an airport and picks up his now-injured father aboard the plane. Understandably, evil, not so convinced, the dictator gets very annoyed by these tricks and takes to the skies to try to overthrow Doug. But the young man listens more rock and knocks down the villain from the sky. HURRAY! <br /> <br /> After Doug and Chappy shot down 90 percent of their air force, the aliens sent their last planes in a rather bad attempt to overthrow Doug, but at the right moment, a US F16 flight appears and it scares them. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. It was the first VCR movie I brought, and until I was twenty, I expected my father to be shot down by a foreign country so I could rescue him. But he does not like to fly, so it did not happen.
