I love this movie...! I've seen this 1000x on dvd and I can not say enough about that. It has everything, comedy, incredible action and incredible acrobatics / fx. Samuel Jackson steals the show here great time. I do not think there is a time when he is not funny! "Everyone knows that when you make a guess, you make a butt out of you and umption" !! The f / x's are great! The blast from the bridge / truck is amazing, although the sound is not so good! When Samuel leaves the truck, the sound is a little out of the ordinary and what he says is invaluable !!! For those of you who own it on DVD, put the audio in French !!! It's halarious !!! Even the emotional moments are great when the thug discovers that Sam / Charlie's daughter is his, it's great ... This is a great movie that no action fan can do without ... I also recommend Cutthroat Island ... Beyond of all negative publicity, it kicks !!!!
