Good combination of giant monster and samurai genres. The giant monster Majin, mountain god, is an indifferent and threatening figure who looks very much like the God of the Old Testament, raining destruction and punishment of those who desecrate his sacred soil - but it is interesting to note that what finally awakens him is not the suffering, but a sharp and personal insult. It is beautifully photographed, with solid performance, great miniatures and a great trail of the great Akira Ifukube. Majin is not a monster over 400 feet like Godzilla - he is 2 1/2 times the normal size, so the evil samurai he steps on the ground gives a good look into his eyes of contempt as he squats in his fortress and the breaking into small pieces. Not much in terms of extras, but it's nice to see this forgotten minor classic rescued and restored to the digital format.
