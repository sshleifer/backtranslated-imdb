Happy 25th Anniversary to the Valley Girl! Great soundtrack, plausible story, wonderful performances ... captures the spirit of the 80s; the jargon of the mainstream and the excluded. A wonderful interpretation of high school life and the "sandy city center" from a suburban perspective. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack contains songs by Modern English, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola, Josie Cotton, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic Peles, Men at Work, The Flirts, and Bananarama. <br /> <br /> This film is really Romeo and Juliet (minus double suicide), set in the 1980s in Los Angeles. Julie's father, played by Frederic Forrest (Sonny Bono, someone?) Is hysterical as an idealistic hippie parent who wonders how he created such a materialistic offspring. However, he does not judge, do you type?
