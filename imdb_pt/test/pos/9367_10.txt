The best 1947 film also deals with anti-Semitism and is superior to GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT by Elia Kazan (the eventual winner at that year's Academy Awards) in virtually every department. Edmard Dmytryk's almost perfect direction, John Paxton's concise script and the brilliant expressionist lighting of J. Roy Hunt are marvelously stimulated by an excellent cast. Although Robert Young (who plays a relaxed, methodical and very nice cop) and Robert Mitchum (who actually occasionally has a witty commentary) are the nominees for the film, Oscar nominees Robert Ryan and Gloria Grahame - as well as Paul Kelly , in the small but fundamental role of Grahame's pathetic husband - who presents the film's most memorable characterizations; Ryan proved to be as convincing as a homicidal racist who ended up being labeled for some time, standing out in equally villainous roles in such films as ACT OF VIOLENCE (1948), CAUGHT (1948), THE RACKET (1951), CLASH BY NIGHT 1952). , THE NAKED MIRROR (1953) and BAD DAY IN BLACK ROCK (1955). The film is also notable for its atypical structure in which Ryan's flashback sequence, a complete production, is filmed in a direct manner, while the truth emerges from the obscure and distorted memories of the true protagonist of the film that, moreover, does not is neither touched by any of the movie's stars! In addition, CROSSFIRE originally dealt with homosexuality (as in Richard Brooks' original novel, "The Brick Foxhole"), but this taboo was unacceptable to Hays's office at the time - far removed from the situation we have today (at least) 3 gay-themed movies are competing for the top Oscars this year! <br /> <br /> The impression used for Warner's DVD transfer shows some pitiful signs of wear sometimes, but the audio commentary by noir experts, James Ursini and Alain Silver, is good, although I do not share their view that Dmytryk's career has steadily declined after his problems with HUAC, such as excellent images like THE SNIPER (1952), THE CAINE. MUTINY (1954), BROKEN LANCE (1954), YOUNG LIONS (1958), WARLOCK (1959) and MIRAGE (1965) prove widely; having said that his RKO collaborations with producer Adrian Scott and screenwriter John Paxton - MURDER, MY SWEET (1944), CORNERED (1945; we hope this is part of the upcoming Warners Film Noir Box Set) and CROSSFIRE - are his better jobs. In any case, in my opinion, the latter is not only one of the leading films of the 1940s, but also one of the best noirs ever made, period.
