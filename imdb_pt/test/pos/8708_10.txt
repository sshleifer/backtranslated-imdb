This is a perfect example of a Full Moon Pictures classic movie. Any fan of Horror / Vampire Flicks should definitely check this out. Original plot and good, easy to follow story. In addition, this movie has some heart racing scenes that combine Horror with action. As of now, the only sequel I've seen for this movie is Part IV, which I have to say is almost better than this original. <br /> <br /> I give 10/10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this should check out the Puppet Master, the Slumber Party Massacre, the Skinned Alive, the Sleep Away Camp and others movies from Full Moon Pictures.
