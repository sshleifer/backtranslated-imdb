Now, before people start to have a collapse about this movie (those who play rugby anyway), this is a movie! It has been given Hollywood treatment to entertain people and therefore those who play rugby (myself included) are naturally choose holes in the game's choreography in the movie. All in all, it's a decent movie and brings to mind the morals and ideas behind the rugby game. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a real team, a true coach and his work helping to guide the kids right. direction to be better people in the future, and is also based on real people who played for the upland team. It's just a typical sports movie with a character who is wrong and eventually finds his way on the right path again through the middle of rugby in this case. It is usually a good movie that is enjoyable but has flaws in terms of picture of the game. However, as I said, it's a movie under the Hollywood treatment.
