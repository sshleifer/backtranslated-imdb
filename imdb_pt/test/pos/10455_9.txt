Maybe this movie was not funny at all. Maybe it was to make teenagers horny in all nudity. But what I took out was really something that many people believe. And that is, "Cool guys end up last." <br /> <br /> There's a phrase in Angel Heart from Lisa Bonet's character that says "It takes a bad ass to make a girls heart beat faster." True. Probably. Women always say they want flowers and candy and politeness and everything. But (at least at an early age) they end up going for the handsome, slimy, disrespectful, indomitable guy. The one they know they can not adapt to their beliefs. And that's part of the attraction. After all, what's exciting about a guy who is already the way you want him to be? I believe this may have happened to Boaz Davidson. And what he has to say in this movie that is disguised as sex and nudity and partying and everything else that teens can relate to is that you will have your heart broken. It happens to everyone and it will happen to you. And that's a strong final statement in the movie. But having said all that, the movie is fun. It's funny and it shows the shenanigans of the school's students very well. <br /> <br /> This is a rare movie that is sleezy enough to please the teen audience but also smart and poignant enough to show what it is; I wish I could have your heart broken. No high school movie has ever done it better. Like I said, I think writers must have experienced a situation like this first-hand. Maybe we all have. <br /> <br /> This is an old movie, but if you come across it by gathering dust on a shelf at your local rental store one night, take it, you might be surprised. It's a hell of a lot better than it's ever been kissed.
