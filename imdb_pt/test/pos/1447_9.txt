If you like your movies to take your emotions away from you, if you like your movies with a guy you can twist and relate to, if you like your black and white movies, you have to see this movie! Watch from start to finish, because you do not want to miss a beat. Sometimes it's slow, and makes you wonder when something is going to happen, so when the plot begins to unfold, you'll be on the edge of your seat! I know I did! My mom told me about this movie as our family had some of the same things going on as the movie does. We love Frankie, who plays convincingly. What you think about Frank Sinatra, put that aside, in the movie, he's skinny and he does not sing, so keep an open mind. For the era in which it was made, it tells a story that is still being told today in homes across the country and possibly the world. Please note, if you like old movies, try this.
