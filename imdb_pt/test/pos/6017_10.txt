Watching this on Comcast On-Demand. <br /> <br /> Every time I see this musical, I'm impressed by the songs ... one show-stopper after another. <br /> <br /> This interpretation is for me, magical. The songs shine ... the vocals, orchestrations and choreography are amazing for a "made for TV" movie ... better than the many stage versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> The debate about Bette just does not make sense. She's Mom. Her voice is bright and yet full of emotion from the mother who lives in her daughters. I still have tears in the end when she finally has her moment of glory, no matter how faded that glory is. <br /> <br /> The Tulsa / Louise duet / dance is now. Fabulous. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondheim is the king of musical theater. His lyrics come out of the tongue like silk ... Styne's music is perhaps the best ever written for the stage / screen. <br /> <br /> Thank God, we have this masterpiece of the American Musical Theater on DVD.
