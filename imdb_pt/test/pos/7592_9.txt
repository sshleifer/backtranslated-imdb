Although little more than a pleasant 11-minute musical drift (it's considered a "Musical Tabloid") EVERY SUNDAY is one of the most famous and precious documents in film history as it offers an invaluable insight into the talents of two of the most talented musical artists and screen loved ones: Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland. <br /> <br /> Although often cited as a screen test, produced by MGM to test the adolescent appeal of studio contractors Durbin and Garland, whose options were supposedly coming to renewal, this statement is not entirely accurate. By the time all Sundays were produced in July 1936, Deanna Durbin's contract with MGM had already expired and it had been immediately signed by Universal a month earlier in June 1936. <br /> <br /> < > Meanwhile, a provision in Durbin. MGM's contract allowed the studio to exercise an option over its services for up to sixty days, since it had not yet begun working on a photo in its new studio. As Durbin's debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, was not yet ready to start filming, MGM chose to pursue its option and although officially under contract with Universal at the time, Durbin found himself back on the MGM lot filming this pleasant subject. Judy Garland. Along with Garland's much more extensive previous professional experience / training (which included appearances in several previous short films), it may explain why ALL DOMAINS often seem to favor Judy Garland over Deanna Durbin, giving Garland more lines to speak and a original song ("Americana") to sing, while Durbin offers the popular classic art song, "Il Bacio" by Luigi Ardiiti. Of course, it would make perfect sense that MGM wanted to favor one of its own contracted actors over another of a rival studio. Ironically, although Garland's character is the most openly proactive two girls in this short, it would be the persona of Durbin's "Little Miss Fixit" at Universal, which would propel her into instant world stardom as the world's first "Teen Idol" with her debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, while Garland a more passive teenage image of "melancholy wallflower" would often see her in supporting roles, playing alongside frequent screen partner Mickey Rooney and (in ZIEGFELD GIRL) promising Lana Turner. Not until her fifteenth MGM feature, 1942 'FOR ME AND MY GAL' (which was also her first totally adult role) Garland would reach the ground above - the billing title and status of "solo attraction" of a true star who Durbin had struck instantly six years earlier. It is totally inaccurate, therefore, to claim that Garland was the only "superstar" attraction of the two girls, as Durbin achieved that status with the press and the public for nearly a decade. before its MGM rival. Literally in closing at the time of its signing, the on-screen evidence strongly suggests that Universal was much faster to realize Deanna's complete superstar potential than MGM with Judy, and it is noteworthy that almost all notable achievements Garland achieved at MGM, have starred specially written vehicles to show off their talents and appeal, to be asked to plant their footprints in the Chinese courtyard of Graumann, to receive an "Honorary" Oscar in recognition of their talent, Deanna Durbin received well before his talented contemporary MGM. <br /> <br /> In any case, EVERY SUNDAY is a delightful, totally unassuming musical short. In its plot (Durbin and Garland use their singing talents to save Durbin's grandfather from being forcibly taken away by the prefecture of driving her Sunday concerts in the park), foreshadows the plot lines of both Garland's musicals, "Let's Put On a Show" with Mickey Rooney and Durbin's 100 MEN AN D A GIRL. Unlike Garland's later BABES films, the short never treats the insubstantial story seriously and, consequently, its eleven-minute runtime passes. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the true magic of EVERY SUNDAYS is to notice the already remarkable realizing talents / presences on the screen of Durbin and Garland at the beginning of their legendary careers. Both girls, even at this early stage, had remarkable screen presences and are totally natural and unaffected in their presentation as singers and actresses. Garland practically explodes on screen with vitality as she literally takes the lyrics off the animated "Americana." As she measures the number with appropriate gestures, Judy literally seems to be chewing the words of the song as she squeezes her mouth and looks down at her intense eagerness to show what she can do. <br /> <In contrast, Durbin's presentation on "Il Bacio" is much more modest and modest. While entirely suited to her "classical" selection, the delivery of Arditi's waltz by Durbin is far more than the traditional "stand n n" variety than Garland's physically emotional turn. However, although "miniature diva" Deanna does nothing to draw attention to herself, with her candid eyes, dazzling smile and delivery without art, she easily holds the screen with "jazz baby" Judy, and her delightful duet "American" in the short film The final makes it even more regrettable that producer Joe Pasternak has never been able to fulfill his dream of pairing Durbin and Garland in a music feature (because Universal refused to lend "Number One Asset" Durbin ). <br />> An invaluable document of the nascent talents of two remarkable and absolutely unique talents. See this if you have a chance!
