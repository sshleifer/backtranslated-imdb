A young woman becomes a friend of wartime, and when he visits at the end of the war waiting for someone a little more "available," comic complications happen. Everything finally works fine, of course, but not before everyone involved has chewed the stage. Errol Flynn's dead printout of "Casablanca" Humphrey Bogart is a highlight, as are several images of his own buck image (the scene of "jumping" in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is a riot). It is Tucker, however, who "shoves" the film under his arm, lowering his head and barrels on the goal line. He demonstrates the most fully developed comic talent twenty years later in "F-Troop" and conveys a vivacity and energy that Flynn repeatedly performs to raise his own performance. Eleanor Parker does a great job as the woman being chased, and little Patti Brady delights as Tucker's real friend. A fine, light comedy "coming home" in a gentle environment that kids and romantics of all ages should find fun.
