After learning that his sister Susan is planning on divorcing, Kate decides to travel to the woman's remote country house and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is not in sight. That's because someone murdered her and stuffed her body into a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister might have gone and puts her own life in great danger ... the killer is still in place! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery delivers a solid dramatic performance. Merwin Gerard's teleplay is based on a short story by McKnight Malmar. The tale of Malmar was first brought to television in 1962 as an episode of Boris Karloff's anthological series, THRILLER. Thriller followed the story very closely, which is a shame as it could have used a little punch. Granted Malmar wrote a moderately scary number, but Gerard (creator of the show ONE STEP BEYOND) adds several clever ingredients that increase tension and suspense.
