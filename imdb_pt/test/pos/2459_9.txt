<br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful play HOMEFRONT and turns it into an engaging movie. <br /> <br /> THE WAR IN HOME has an exceptionally strong cast - all seemingly digging deep into their characters. The performance here is TOP NOTCH! <br /> <br /> The credit should also go to the director Emilio Estevez. The visual transitions between past and present were ultra smooth. The sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and effectively added to the tension. <br /> <br /> Remove all elements of Viet Nam from history, and there are still interesting characters struggling with the good and evil of history. range of family dynamics. (A viewer can see this point more clearly, keeping in mind the scene "discovering the old picture" from the beginning, while the rest of the film is watched). As a movie, I found THE WAR AT HOME to be more direct and direct than BORN ON JULY 4. A good effort - almost ten. <br /> <br />
