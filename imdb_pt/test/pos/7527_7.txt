And so was born the most loving skunk of all time to adorn the silver screen. While the plot has an abused cat painting itself as a skunk and inadvertently attracting Pepe Le Pew (named Henry here), Pepe certainly steals the show. There is no doubt that Chuck Jones realized that this love-seeking member of the Mephitis genre had something special needed to be a star in himself, and then he founded Pepe on "For Scent-Imental Reasons" four years later, firmly establishing persistence of PLP. presence on screens everywhere. So while "Odor-Able Kitty" might be a place otherwise, I try to imagine watching it for the first time in 1945. One might have guessed that this character support would soon join the ranks of Bugs , Daffy, Porky and the rest? Whether or not someone, Pepe remains one of the most friendly characters to date. C'est l'amour!
