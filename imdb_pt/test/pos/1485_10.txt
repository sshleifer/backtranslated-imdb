The 1990s were a great decade for the British sitcom with many popular creations such as ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS THE THIN BLUE LINE, BRITTAS EMPIRE and MEN BEHAVING BADLY coming to the TV screens for the first time. <br /> /> However, MR. BEAN is undoubtedly the biggest sitcom of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> MR. The BEAN represents the first major attempt to rewind the era of big names like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for several decades. It brings to the public a single character - Mr. Bean - played to perfection by Rowan Atkinson. <br /> <br /> Many people who commented on this page, as well as in the message boards of this and other sites, have engaged. in debates on whether or not Mr Bean has a mental disability or if he has significant learning difficulties stemming from such a disability. However, I believe that this debate is unnecessary because I very much doubt that the creators of this program would expect anyone in the audience for a single moment to consider Mr Bean in such a context. <br /> <br /> Bean is shown as a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems alone without the guidance of others. Some of your methods for tackling day-to-day tasks, such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist, are bizarrely addressed to anyone who is watching the show. That's where humor comes from. Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he may just be an eccentric person, accustomed to handling things his way. And, of course, some of his methods to complete a single task often result in disaster, which we then see Mr. Bean try to solve. <br /> <br /> Sometimes we see Mr. Bean showing a petty or petty tendency, often trying to compete with those around him or making fun of the less hopeful. But no real harm comes to anyone at the end of the day and the results are always comforting. <br /> <br /> Unlike most examples of British comedy in the last 30 years, MR. BEAN is simple, harmless and harmless entertainment, suitable for all tastes of the family. It is for this reason that the TV series has become a big hit in dozens of countries around the world. That's also why it will still be remembered in several decades from now, when many other TV shows have come up, gone and forgotten. <br /> <br /> Some critics say the show only appeals to children, but I just laugh. both in Mr. Bean's antics and the first time I saw the episodes as a child in the 1990s. Rowan Atkinson used his natural ability to create effective visual tricks that look as funny in repeated visualizations as the first time. <br /> <br /> The TV series has until today generated two derivative films, BEAN and SR. BEER HOLIDAY As one familiar with the kind of mood shown in the TV series would expect, it does not translate into success on the big screen. The two films do little justice to the TV series and can not truly capture the magic of the episodes. The biggest flaw in both films may lie in the change of scenery. In both films, producers take Mr. Bean out of England's normal environment for America (the first film) and France (the second film). As a result, the characters in the film around Mr. Bean respond differently to their behavior than their counterparts in the TV series. Both films reuse the jokes in the TV series, and evidence shows that the jokes were made the first time. In the second film, Bean behaves like a character out of character, with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point that some jokes seem stupid rather than funny. At various times, I found myself thinking that the character I was watching was not Mr. Bean, but a pale caricature. Of course Rowan Atkinson was not having as much fun as on the TV series. His heart was simply not in performance. After the second film was released, he publicly stated that he would not play Mr. Bean again. I realize how he felt. Returning to the TV series, each episode shows evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and performing in each scene. Even the weaker episode is still very nice and well ahead of the two films. <br /> <br /> My favorite episodes are the first three - they set the high standard that should continue. I consider the final episode to be the weakest but still hilarious. <br /> <br /> To summarize, MR. BEAN is a truly fantastic sitcom, suitable for the whole family. Rowan Atkinson is a true comic genius and the evidence is in the 14 episodes of this TV series. My recommendation - watch and enjoy. But just watch the movies if you consider yourself a stubborn fan after watching the TV series.
