Well, where do you start? I stumbled on this one in 1993 and just hit "record" on the VCR out of habit, more than anything else. "Citizen Kane" certainly is not ... but if you've had a bad day and you want to beat up something that is not very intellectually stimulating, then I timidly suggest that this is just your "thing." <br /> <br /> We have a lot here - a great title track, more stereotypes than you could do, unconscious comedy, the most impetuous fighting scene of all time and more, more, more! David Hemmings plays the diametrical opposite of his role in the 1960s classic "Blow Up" - still a photographer, still hormonally stimulated but not "completely" the same. <br /> <br /> John Philip Law is easy to beat as an actor who makes a log seem sloppy, but this would not be fair seen as he had about 5 minutes in advance before accepting the role. <br /> Wexler as "Amanda"? Needless to say, it was her only role in the movies! The real star of this film, however, is Ethel Evans, who plays, say, the secretary (?), With the morality of a street cat and the ambition to combine. The way she can reconcile her current life with that of a future with her future comedian husband is indeed quite touching in a worldly, sandy style, which is being-to-be-to-be. <br /> <I love this movie when I'm in the mood for it ....... and I would not play it with the proverbial barge when I'm not. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the cast to keep a (relatively) straight face when shooting. <br /> <br /> A "classic" at the Edward D Wood school of filmmaking endeavors!
