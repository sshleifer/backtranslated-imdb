Separate lies changed my life. In fact, the Q & A did. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers or if you have already seen: <br /> <br /> Emily Watson character betrays the character of Tom Wilkonson. My first reaction to Emily, with doggy eyes, was, "It's over. For some reason, he stayed around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept their needs. Sometimes he had to leave. But he stayed with her and let her live his life. But I still wanted to see her. <br /> <br /> Then, Julian, the screenwriter and director, talked about the movie. I am glad he did, because frankly I am also you and was too immature to understand before he broke for me. Tom's character loved her, and no matter how his quest for his needs might disagree with what he wanted, he would always love her. The relationship and love they shared was not a lie, all of a sudden, just because she wanted to be with someone else. The fact that she wanted to be with someone else did not make her who she was. When you grow past fifty, there is a strong chance that finding the love of your life will not appear again, so you can not be as indifferent as you were when you were younger. You have to try to make things work, because the alternative can be much worse. She needed what she needed, and she could not help it. He had to learn to let go if he wanted to be the complete man he could be. He helped her chase after her lover, even when it hurt him. <br /> <br /> Another thing: Julian said that the strongest tool of a controller is to blame. <br /> <br /> Again: A controller's strongest tool is to blame. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Tom released her from her burden. He felt the need to let her know that he loved her, but not in order to get her back; he wanted her to know that she did not have to feel guilty or think bad about the relationship, just because it ended in such a terrible way. <br /> <br /> It's not my way of reviewing a movie based on the message, rather than the execution, especially when I better understand this message when it is explained to me by the director, but I make an exception here, since I feel more mature than I would have enjoyed watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The film was a good British performance. Rupert was visceral and revolting. Tom and Emily were his characters, usually solid and real.
