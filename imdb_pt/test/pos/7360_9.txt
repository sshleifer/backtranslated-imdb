I changed this (cape) on a whim and was treated to a surprise ... although very predictable this movie turned out to be quite enjoyable ... no big stars, but well run and just plain fun. With all the exaggerated crap out there, it's great to have an unexpected surprise once in a while ... and this little movie fits in pretty well. 9/10
