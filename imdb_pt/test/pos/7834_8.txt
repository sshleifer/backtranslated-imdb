Forget everything you've ever read about the direct release for Mallachi Brothers' video "Snakes on a Train," especially if it's a negative review. This movie is a lot more fun than the movie that obviously rips: "Snakes on a Plane." Frankly, I'm surprised more people are not thrilled with this low budget Asylum Release. Instead, most of the reviews I've read are nothing of a gentle or critically valuable to say except the usual idiotic idiocy of flock, as the acting was amateur, the action did not numerically represent propaganda, and the whole thing amounted to a horrible loss of time. Of course, it does not help that the title is a hint to the obvious nature of the movie. In fact, I felt that "Snakes on a Train" topped "Snakes on a Plane" for a number of reasons. First, the producers used genuine and genuine snakes until the last fifteen minutes, when they replaced giant fake snake heads or computer generated a super-giant snake that consumed a whole train like Amtrak. How many movies does a snake eat a train? As a result, "Snakes on a Train" is the first movie to scale that time. <br /> <br /> Second, this low-budget movie employs some macabre effects. The woman who coughs the baby snakes - the real ones - was fantastic! The special effects of his forearms being torn later in the film were visually appealing! Also, you begin to see a little white girl being eaten alive by a snake. She was as cute as she could be, no more than 10 years old or so, and she died screaming all the time as mysterious giant cobra head swallowed her. Not only children in danger but boy eaten! This is exactly the kind of graphic material you will not find in 99% of all Hollywood theatrical releases. Of course, it was not eaten by a real snake, but it is subversive thinking that counts. <br /> <br /> Third, he's one of those damned in movies where Alma (Julia Ruiz of "That Guy"), the main female character - no heroine - has a curse placed on her by her parents because she does not married the man they recommended. As a result, it is full of snakes, coughing up amounts of fluid from green radiator fluid and then sucks a baby snake. Imagine Medusa, the mythical characters who had snakes for hair, only with the snakes in their belly. Her psycho-shaman type boyfriend collects all the snakes that come out of her because they are going to LA on a train to see a relative of him who can put all the snakes back inside her and return her to normal. Talk about a crazy character running stomach-wrenching routines. Prepare for much mud, blood and blood. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the train had only about twenty passengers, not hundreds. However, it seemed that the Mallachi Brothers filmed this above average horror movie aboard a real train with real snakes and they played with the rocking motion of the train on the rails. <br /> <br /> Fifth, the snakes glide for the first hour, silently infiltrating the train before they become weird and attack all. In other words, it's suspense, suspense, suspense, before people start dying of snake bites. <br /> <br /> Until the last five minutes, when the snake grows more than the runaway train and swallows, "Snakes in a Train" is deformed, wonderful and outgoing. It does not have the Attention Deficit issue of a major Hollywood movie. It is a fantasy about an unhappy Hispanic woman victimized because of her feminist attitude, at odds with society. <br /> <br /> In total, you have things like gory fantasy; suspense snakes gliding around the train, and I'm gigantic over-the-top snake in the end. By the way, they board the train because a bunch of other Mexicans bribed a train employee and the Mexicans on board think the girl is so cute they leave her and her boyfriend for free. <br /> <br /> I think it's better than "Snakes on a Plane" if you want a hard, small, and independently produced horror movie.
