It may interest people to know that this film was made without any recourse to Phoolan Devi himself, and when he finally saw parts of it, he was so enraged that he announced that the film would not be shown in India or that it would cover itself. in the gasoline and set fire to itself. I do not know if it was shown or not, but given to her standing at the time as a rising politician, I doubt it. Since then, I have seen a report that she was expelled from office and accused of more crimes of her day Dacoit, and hid as a result. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside your own worries, this is an excellent film, made even more so by its pleasantly brutal approach; Nothing of the rosy melodrama you would expect from a typical Indian movie. It should be noted that the concerns about how the film's messages really are feminist and similar are essentially irrelevant: it's a true story. Their doubts are, it seems, not with what is described, but with the way the film describes it.
