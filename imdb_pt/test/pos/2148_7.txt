" - Eric Idle <br /> <br /> Harry Nilsson left Brooklyn, "Feeling like Holden Caulfield, I was fifteen." Eventually, he ended up working as a presenter at LA Paramount and within a few years he stepped back into one of the greatest careers of composers in the history of American music. 'Who is Harry Nilsson (and why is everyone talking about him?)' It tells the legendary life of 'the best composer of our generation'. Writer and director John Scheinfeld produces Brian Wilson and Al Kooper's Paul Kings, Randy Newman and Ray Cooper, "Their voice was a medical instrument. It would cure you." Varied archives include his 1969 appearance in 'Playboy After Dark' and the Nilsson special on the BBC. John Lennon, Alexander Cognac, Smothers Brothers in the debacle of the Troubadour comeback-show show is a memorable tale among so many who seem to virtually tighten Nilsson's enchanting music from this all-embracing, bittersweet bio-doc. <br /> <br /> "He was a wonderful perpetrator." <br /> <br /> "I woke up three days later getting a massage in Phoenix."
