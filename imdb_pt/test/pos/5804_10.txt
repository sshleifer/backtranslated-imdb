Madonna has been shaking the boat for over 20 years, and with that comes a lot of experience - obviously - and a lot of knowledge. She was never the only one to think yesterday, on the contrary, she seemed to know what will be popular tomorrow. It bravely takes all new trends, technologies, and incorporates them into its own actions. Their world tours were never "medium". When Madonna introduces herself, she gives 120% - everything is bigger, better, theatrical and significant. It takes inspiration from the East and the West and makes them unique. Everything is given a deeper meaning, and The Confessions Tour is no different. From the beginning, you are sitting on the edge of the chair. She starts with a bang, so she makes brave circus poses on a horse in the sky, she does everything she can to entertain him. She remakes her own songs, giving them a modern feel. She sings in a disco cross, she almost arrives in the middle of the stage, and with her incredible dance team that knows no dimensions of fear, the show is absolutely more than you expected. It is a spectacle, an audiovisual orgasm that can not be put into words. Luck is the ones who really tried to see Madonna on stage. Pushing fifty, she's still in an incredible shape. The recent Sticky and Sweet Tour is even more innovative, which does not prove anything, that Madonna was, is and always will be the only and the only queen of pop.
