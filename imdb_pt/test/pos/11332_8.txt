The title of the Chinese film "In the mood for love" is "fa yeung nien wah". It can be interpreted as "those years of flowering (which have already existed)". <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a well composed piece. A complex love story told in a simple visual approach. Director and screenwriter Wong Kar-Wai choreographed a dance of hearts - it's her, it's him, it's love. I can hear the theme of Galasso: a dum-dum, a dum-dum, and the ropes - almost like heartbeats. A play with prelude, stanzas and epilogue. <br /> <br /> The director optimized the use of music (score by Michael Galasso, Nat King Cole singing in Spanish and Chinese songs / songs). Rhythm and lyrics lead viewers to what she and he are feeling / thinking instead of verbal dialogues. I can hear Nat King Cole giving us clues: "That" green eyes "(that thing, pitch, green eyes) plays when the two meet, and" Maybe, maybe, maybe " indecisive <br /> <br /> Nostalgia permeates the whole movie. Abundant design details: bags and ties; Novelty of Japanese rice-cooker; cups and saucers and plates of green glass with wrinkled streaks (I remember Dad having valued those at home); mahjong session; kitchen area; bedroom furniture; the thermos bottle for the pasta she jumps on when she walks. Maggie Cheung, slender and well-formed, looks exquisite in those patterns and colors of the fashion of traditional Chinese women's clothes - 'cheung sam'. Every change of dress denotes another day, again in history. Wong Kar-Wai is ingenious as well. <br /> <br /> The scenes can be from the same place, but in a different mood, advancing to the next stanza. Going up and down the stairs to the won-ton noodle stand. Standing by the wall around the corner to the apartments while the rain drips. Along the corridor, back and forth, to your writing corner. <br /> Trivia: Then she helps him with his writing of his martial arts novel. Maggie would be able to help as she has been in kung fu movies / martial arts. "Eastern Three Heroes" 1992 is a fun action movie with Maggie Cheung (Thief Catcher Chat), Michelle Yeoh and Anita Mui as three super heroes battling evils. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Tony Leung's performance, do not miss "Chungking Express" 1994 (in the second segment - romance rhythm with a difference) and "Happy Together" 1997 (an intense and emotionally colorful painting of Friendship, Faith and Destiny), both written and directed by Wong Kar-Wai. Being able to understand the Cantonese and Shanghai dialects, and having visited the official website, I realized that the epilogue was not completely translated. Here is sharing my version of Chinese legends: It was an unbearable encounter From the beginning she kept her head down Giving him a chance to get closer He did not have the guts to be closer She turned, left. <br /> <br /> That hour and place had passed. Everything that belonged, no longer exists. _______ <br /> <br /> Those disappeared years, apparently separated by a powder of glass, can see, but can not capture. <br /> <br /> All the while he longed for everything he went through. If he could break that dusty glass He'll return to the long gone times. ________ In Wong Kar-Wai's "climate for love" brings to mind the simple poetry and wisdom of Rumi, the Sufi philosopher - the "inner and outer," the "spirit and body" of the life. , love and life. <br /> <br /> [Resend.
