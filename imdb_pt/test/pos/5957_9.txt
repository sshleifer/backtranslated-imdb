I just saw this movie last night and I must say I loved every minute of it. If taken in the spirit of a parody of Bond-esquire movies, it is truly superior. The real comedy of the film is in its blatant disrespect for political correctness. Misogyny, cultural insensitivity, and quasi-laughable machismo of films of this genre are used for a great comic effect. He also calls the illogical and stereotyped task elements with Agent OSS 117 constantly learning insanely fast difficult things (such as Arabic and how to play a traditional instrument) while missing some pathetically obvious clues. Some of the lines in the movie left me laughing for hours after the movie ended ... and I have to say I learned a little ... interesting ... French vocabulary that would probably have my teachers exasperated with me if I were to use it. Overall, I found this movie to be excellent. Intensely funny and the first movie I've ever seen really spoofs every aspect of the espionage film.
