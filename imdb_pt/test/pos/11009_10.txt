It is an interesting fact that the metaphysics of Platon and Aristoteles, formal logic and abstract ontology form on those sciences that most people are not interested. But then, about a thousand years after Aristotle, the computer began to usurp human thought, and humans who refused to reflect questions of being other than biological, physical, and chemical suddenly felt paralyzed because they could not deal with the consequences that these computers would bring "during the night". RW Fassbinder's "Welt Am Draht," along with Tarkovsky's "Solaris," and Godard's "Alphaville," is probably the first film to address the philosophical issues of computer science as the basis of a story to be told in film. Confused questions about identities and realities are cleverly constructed in different intertwined criminal histories that the public really tries to follow because they are interested in resolving the cases. Fassbinder was a master at selling highly abstract content to his audience, incorporating theoretical knowledge into practical and appetizing forms. The basic problem to be understood is that an identity defines a reality, but, on the other hand, a reality also requires identity to be perceived. The idea of ​​a person with multiple identities is known to us only from the point of view of psychiatry. However, logically spoken, the only reason we have only one identity, is the fact that our logic has only two values ​​(right and false). Now take a logic with just one more value, that is, with three: So, as you can easily see, you already have three identities. What happens now, when, shall we say, Dr. Stiller is dead? So it is quite possible that only one of the three identities is abolished and the other two remain and are capable of rescuing the individual from death. Another question is whether a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once. The idea, however, of displaying these sets of identities upward or downward, as shown in the scene with the elevator in the hotel, is misleading, since identities and thus realities are not structured in the hierarchy but in a Heterogeneous form. Strictly speaking, there is no "artificial identity," since each identity is defined on two objects that share all their resources with each other. Therefore, the idea of ​​assuming that each individual has only one identity is only a consequence of the old two-valued logic (a second identity would imply that a person at the same time exists and does not exist). But now look around and see that one and the same object (which is, by definition, identical with itself) is perceived by each subject in his own way. If, therefore, each subject sees an object in a different way, why would it not be possible for the individual to open the boundaries of his corset of individuality of two values, with the effect that different people can exchange their different individualities? Fassbinder would, five years later, pick up this topic in his masterpiece "Despair, A Journey to Light."
