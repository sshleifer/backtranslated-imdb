Darling Lili is a blend of perfection and magic! The stars; Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson could not have made a better attempt if they tried. It is full of all the magic a young lady desires and makes it seem like everything can really happen to you. The director's brilliance; Blake Edwards is shown to be at his best. He was actually capturing the woman he loved on the screen! <br /> <br /> The mix of each song, matched perfectly with the timing of the film. The Film premiered with Julie Andrews singing Whistling Away In The Dark and closed with the same song by Andrews. <br /> <br /> For a film of this excellence to have been a failure when it was released, it is a total shock ... <br /> <br /> As it is: "Inspiration ... Purely ... Inspiring! " ~ One of Andrews most memorable lines in this movie!
