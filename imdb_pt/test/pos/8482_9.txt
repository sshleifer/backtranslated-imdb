Like almost everyone, I'm familiar with the music of Ray Charles. Who has not heard "Georgia ON My Mind" and "The Mess-Around" and some of the other wonderful songs featured in this movie. But about the life of Ray Charles I was sadly ignorant until I saw this. I have to say that Jamie Foxx brought Ray Charles to life in a brilliant way. His performance was powerful, down to the mannerisms and voice inflections. The film also provided a restricted account of some of the trials and tribulations Charles dealt with throughout his life, and with some demons from the past that haunted him into adulthood. Perhaps the most powerful scene in the film was the heroin withdrawal scene, which was painfully realistic. The film portrays Charles's growing awareness and involvement with the civil rights movement, culminating in his refusal to play in front of a segregated audience in Georgia, which led him to ban his performance in the state. His addiction to drugs and extramarital affairs is also well documented. The film revolves around an appeal of his mother when he was a child: do not let anyone or anything turn you into a cripple. "The point is that the drugs did just that, and to honor his mother's memory, he had to beat them. There is not much here about his later life and career after breaking his heroin habit, but up to that point, that is something really powerful.
