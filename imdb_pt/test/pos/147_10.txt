Of the Korean films I've seen, only three actually stayed with me. The first is the excellent horror A Tale of Two Sisters. The second and third - and now the fourth as well - were the films of Park Chan Wook, Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, and now Thirst. <br /> <br /> Park kind of reminds me of Quentin Tarantino with his irreverence to convention. All his films are shocking, but not in a gratuitous sense. It is more like he shows us what we do not expect to see - typically situations that go radically against the morality of society, like incest or a libidinous, bloodthirsty and still devout priest. He is also quite artistically inclined toward cinematography, and his films are among the most beautiful I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Thirst is all this - being about the said priest and the repressed, unconscious woman. he falls in love with - and more. It's horror, drama and even comedy, while Park disarms his audience with many inappropriate but funny situations. As such, this may be his best work for me yet, since his other two films that I saw were missing the element of humor that would have made it more palatable to repeated views.
