I had actually seen the last parts of this movie when I was a kid. Thanks to the plot search feature, I was able to find out his name. For years I did not know the name, but the movie stayed in my head. The ending left the hope that the main character would eventually return to Earth. It was a pity not to get to a series. This movie reminds me of Journey to the Far Side of the Sun. Also known as Doppleganger. If you liked this feature, the other one is worth watching. It was made before The Stranger, but shares a similar storyline. Still different. I just got The Stranger on eBay on VHS. I hope they make a DVD, but it's dubious, unless it comes out on DVD's of the dollar. Some pilots are doing on the budget DVD and maybe this one goes.
