"A tale of two sisters" is a brilliant South Korean psychological horror that left me speechless. The film offers some delightful moments of ghastly horror and is extremely scary. The small cast of actors is really excellent, with the leader Im Soo-jung being especially memorable in the lead role. Kim Ji-woon's direction is well-treated and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The plot is a bit confusing but some scenes are wonderfully strange. The action is rather slow, but I was not bored. The house where the film goes seems incredibly threatening and isolated. "A Tale of Two Sisters" is along with "Ringu" and "Kairo" one of the most original Asian horror films I have ever seen this masterpiece as fast as possible. My Rating: 10 out of 10.
