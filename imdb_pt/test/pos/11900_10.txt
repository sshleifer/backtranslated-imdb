This movie was one of those I've waited to see for some time. I was happy to know that everything was anticipated. The writing of this film has been so well crafted and researched far beyond what is seen by the public. I found it funny that so many people watching did not read between some very important lines, but in fact if not the movie will make sense in a different way and is very bright. The film has many stories and characters woven around this character Kilo, a man who has risen from the streets amid many problems and has become a very powerful criminal. After spending some time in prison, Kilo finds a breach in the judiciary and, through a disturbing turnaround, is released only to find that everything is nothing at all than it seems. Kilo finds himself going against the higher realm of society and political royalty in order to make clear just how important a Word of Man is and represents. A war begins when the street is in arms against the Lords of wealth and corrupt power. <br /> <br /> A construction of explosive and powerful twists and turns. This movie will leave you fascinated. I found the cast of this movie to be excellent and there is a movie to be ignored. Great. Go and rent it today !!
