I made a promise that if I ever post a comment that was less than courtesy, then later on I would feel different about it, I would come back and make my change of opinion. So far, this is the first time this has happened. <br /> <br /> I'm really starting to like Hack. Something has clearly changed. The stories seem to be much stronger. The plot may still be a bit surreal, but the characters have developed in a much deeper way that a surrealistic plot can be forgiven. I attribute this to good acting. <br /> <br /> Not every show can leave the starting portal as a winner. Some need time to speed up. I'm glad I continued to watch this show, and I really hope it lasts.
