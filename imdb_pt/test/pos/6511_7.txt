If you like silly comedies like Airplane, you'll love this movie! It's definitely in the style of airplane and horror movie. A fun movie! It has the weirdest cast of characters in the same movie. Michael Jackson, Evan Marriott, Joyce Giraurd, Stuart Pankin, Charlie Schlater and Eric Roberts. The special effects are fake, but I guess they are supposed to be since it's a silly comedy. Apparently there are two versions of the movie, one on Blockbuster and another on the official website: MissCastaway.com. The one on the site appears to be a preview release signed by the director. There's a bit of backstage footage filmed at Neverland with Michael Jackson as well. The film was filmed in 2003 and says it's fun in the box.
