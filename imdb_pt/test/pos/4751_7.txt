Seven-Ups is a good and catchy movie. It's packed with credible performances by Scheider, LaBianco and a scary and effective performance by Richard Lynch - though most of the characters are tough guys. The development of characters does not evolve on the screen. The only thing we know is that the good are the good and the bad are bad. Diverging from the standard of crime history, the Seven-Ups are able to play Scheider and his team in the middle of a building plot with a unique touch of writing. Local locations in New York City and an excellent chase of choreographed cars highlight the film. The only downside of the movie is the slightly confusing plot at the beginning. They give the viewer little evidence that the men being kidnapped are related to the Mafia (until later in the film). If someone had begun to blindly watch the film may be a bit confused with the story. Otherwise, the Seven-Ups is a nice time and full of testosterone.
