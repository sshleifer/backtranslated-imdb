This movie is BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> I do not remember this movie even being in theaters, so thinking it was a "straight to the DVD" I have very low expectations, even though I am a big fan of Mike. Judge. It has the same kind of satire as the comic future of "Brazil" and "Demolition Man", but taken to the next level. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the cast; Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard, who were all brilliant in their roles. Needless to say, this movie won me over in the first 5 minutes, where it shows above-average people having fewer children and the poorest, stupid, trashiests who have many ignorant children, and how this is leading to a kind of reverse evolution. It takes this concept and then shows where we are going with this pollution of the gene pool. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I do not think this will take the 500 years as described, but probably only about 50. I already see the shocking rise of "moderate retardation" in the general population, media, and culture. People who love classical music and art are ridiculed rather than respected. The lowest common denominator seems to dominate, especially in Hollywood and on TV (for example, "Jackass the Movie" and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate yourself for money). <br /> <br /> the political / social satire aside, this movie is also just a laugh out loud funny! And I do not say it lightly; some movies really make me "LOL", but this actually made me. <br /> <br /> Many of the best jokes are word jokes / vision in the background, so you really have to pay attention to get some of them. I even had to pause and zoom for some of them (like when Joe got his government ID and for "hair" he said "yes" and for "eyes" he also said "yes"). In addition, the prison recorded in the front "House for Individuals Individuals", since the cops in the film (much like real-life cops) call all "individuals" instead of people, etc. Again, this was on screen for only one moment ... this is one of those movies you can watch again and again and dissect it to go through the layers of grace. <br /> <br /> In addition, I usually watch movies with subtitles, and this gives me a clue In some jokes that can go through your ears in the dialog box, for example, the police constantly talks about people " enjoying "instead of" escaping, "and there are many other misleading pronunciations that have shaken me. But again, I might not have realized just by dialogue mixed with music / sound effects; It's very subtle, but still hilarious. <br /> <br /> In addition, the special effects were REALLY GOOD for a science fiction / social satire. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but overall I think this is one of those movies that if you do not think funny, you're probably making fun of YOU! I plan to recommend this to many people!
