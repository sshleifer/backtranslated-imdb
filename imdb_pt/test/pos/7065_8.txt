I can hardly call it a great movie, but it's fun. In my case, at the time this movie was released, it was the same age as some of the film's youngsters. For me, watching this movie brings back the memories of my years of camping. While some of the pranks that take place in this movie, such as taking the camp director out on his bed and leaving him at the side of a road, hanging from the trees or on a lake, are a little overdone. the other games are not. When I went to camp, campers and advisors did similar stunts, such as putting their underwear on the flagstaff, canoe battles, and boys invading the girls' booth. As I grew older, I realized that these nightly attacks on the girls' booth where I attended were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we would not find the girls in embarrassing situations, but at the time I thought it was real and fun. That's what MEATBALLS (MB) is. <br /> <br /> MB captures not only the scenic beauty of the camp environment, but the beauty of being young and carefree. MB gives a great example of pre-teens, teenagers, and young adults living the summer without worries as well as boys joining girls and girls joining up with boys and booths having as much fun as they can before returning to high school and college. The opening title song that says "Are you ready for summer? ... no more homework, no more books, no more teachers with dirty looks ..." describes exactly how summer is seen by school children . <br /> <br /> I personally enjoyed the two campers Spaz and Fink. What kid, nerd or athlete, did not spend all the camp trying to snuggle in some pretty girl? What face did not want to be accepted by the other campers and advisers? Although these two characters are a bit exaggerated, I bet that everyone who watches the film can not help liking these two guys. These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown from PEANUTS and Jack Tripper & Larry Dallas from THREE'S COMPANY. I would bet most viewers even cheer for Spaz in the egg conveying competition and for Fink while he tries to "hit his stomach" in the hot dog contest. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie had normal kids and advisors. There are no supermodels for counselors or campers who wore trendy clothing. It's fun to just relax and watch this movie and remember when life was as much fun as this movie.
