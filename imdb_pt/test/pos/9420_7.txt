It is one of the paradoxes of Basil Rathbone's wartime Sherlock Holmes (Terror Voice, SH in Washington, and this one) that although the plot and scenario are mostly terrible, he is so good at them . Despite a strange wind-swept hairstyle that makes you look younger, it burns through every scene with so much bite and attack that you hardly record how fragile the tangles are. Here he also has a great acting relationship with Lionel Atwill, who does a wonderful and repulsive Professor Moriarty - a cockroach with many eyelids and good tips of sadism and depravity (may not have been an act, children). At the climax, transformed into a lab coat to drain Rathbone's blood "drop by drop," he is as sinister as Seinfeld's nemesis, Newman. The film itself is an old children's cuisine, but benefits from the attention of director Roy William Neill to the staging and atmosphere. He also seems pretty clear in restoring the UCLA DVD - do not even think about buying any other edition, all faded prints, in the public domain.
