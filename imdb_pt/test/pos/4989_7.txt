Too much added with much taken of a great western that was written by McMurtry on the Texas Rangers Vs. the Indian. This script takes this just to fill this miniseries with a lot of hot fuzzy relationships that were actually secondary to the main storyline. It ends with a totally unbelievable and distant ending, not written in the book that makes you question how we'll be transported to the Lonesome Dove. <br /> <br /> The main characters of the series were, in fact, very well presented, the filming locations. were excellent, but this mini series should have stayed true to what a great book is.
