Being a bit of a connoisseur of junk, I found this little treasure. Action, romance, corrupt cops, violence. It's all here and not a single was taken from the right. I was in love immediately. Then a funny thing happened the second time around. I got hooked. I thought it was going to be a rental movie and a laugh. <br /> <br /> Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie. He did not have the money to make it look good, but he did it anyway. That is very commendable. It also shows that he was making the movie for himself. I do not know how many of you have heard Rudy Ray's music, but if you do not have it, he has a huge amount of albums reaching his fifties.
