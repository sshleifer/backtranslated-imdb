this episode is not incoherent as someone else said. the source agreed to help because he would not keep his word, if you pay attention ... he says after she (Phoebe) agrees to stay down in hell, "FUCK YOURSELF AND BALTHAZOR, SO CAN NOT WORRY WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE "... and also, he did not leave COLE WARN AS SISTERS AS PHOEBE REQUESTS IN EXCHANGE ACCEPTING THE BUSINESS, THAT'S WHY PRUE DIED, because she was hit harder than PIPER and in the head, and not there was PHOEBE to call LEO this time, and in the past LEO SAID THAT SHE ALMOST KILLED. pay more attention next time! and there is not a "TO BE CONTINUED ..." after this episode. is the end of Season 3, and Season 4 they can not show anything from the PRUE because it has the "PRUE" rights, so producers would have to pay for anything they show. this is the last episode she's in!
