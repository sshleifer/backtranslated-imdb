I've seen more than 2000 Studio-Era sound films - including many Universal features from Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Shirley Jones and Deanna Durbin - plus a decent amount of comedy and live musical opera and studio recording. And I assure you, no one in charge of singing in front of a camera and microphone, or maybe anywhere, HAVE DURBIN'S SOLO TOUCH here ... monkey soundtrack and crap of 1930s microphones and everything. The boy from Canada sings this bit of "Il Bacio" as she lived and wrote herself and then went on to appear for a retrospective in Italy at the end of her career, not as a child she learned from her music teacher. > <br /> If you skip this Extra on the DVD - or jump to Garland's solo - you are only depriving yourself, as this MGM teaser has just captured one of the greatest performances of 20c.
