There is a great danger when you watch a movie that had such a profound effect the first time 20 years later it will not have the same magic as before. I must admit I was not expecting it to be as good as I remembered but was pleasantly suprised. P'tang Yang Kipperbang is still as fantastic as I remember when I was 12 years old. This movie has a certain type of brightness that many movies do not have. It's catchy, it's brilliant and best of all it makes me feel like a kid again and there are not many things that can do that. The films of John Albasiny and Abigail Cruttenden in this movie are 1st class and I had forgotten how good they were until now. I ask any teenage parent to seat them and see this and see if it has the same effect on them as it does on me. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! 10 out of 10.
