The manna of heaven is heavenly. This is a family movie - teenagers and grandparents can have fun together. But it's not sweet or silly. The characters really are "characters". The plot is a little complex and you have to pay attention, but it's like setting up a puzzle while everything fits in little by little. The beginning of the period is like watching an old photo album or remembering when. It is extremely well done with very precise hairstyles and attire. The story moves quickly with twists and lots of fun. <br /> <br /> A special treat is to watch the large cast of familiar faces, many of which we have not seen in a long time. Part of the fun is recognizing them and naming them mentally as they appear, although this can be a distraction. Cloris Leachman by the end of the movie looks like she had a transformation in "Oprah." I had never seen Faye Grant in a movie - I only knew her as Grace's mother in the TV series "Saving Grace." She was great except for the southern accent. And I did not even recognize Shelly Duvall. The five sisters who created this beautiful film are a very talented quintet and Sister Theresa is a heavenly treasure.
