"Tourist Trap" is a strange thriller that came out in the 70s, it's about 5 friends Molly (Jocelyn Jones), Jerry (Jon Van Hess), Eileen (Robin Sherwood), Becky (Tanya Roberts) and Woody (Kevin McDermott) who is faced with a cloistered museum SLAUSEN'S LOST OASIS, a curious and sinister museum by the side of the road. This gold mine of decadent, but strangely living mannequins is run by Slausen (Chuck Conners), an eccentric, but seemingly harmless. Slausen has a warning for the young: Stay away from Davey, Slausen's reclusive and disturbed brother. <br /> <br /> The curiosity of the young takes the best of them and they will explore. The trap is suspended! In the midst of flying objects, doors slamming, handkerchiefs strangling on their own, strengthened by some hidden force, the trap slowly approaches the group. The "Creator" Davey and his army of murderous mannequins do brutal and quick work of their friends, until only one remains. Although not a Slasher movie, Tourist Trap still contains elements of horror movies such as chase scenes, chase, and the fact that the killer uses a mask. <br /> <br /> The killer's seemingly telekinetic abilities to lock bolts and animate wax dolls are used to great effect. Perhaps the scariest thing about this movie are the mannequins, which are admittedly scary enough to begin with, but are scary here. The movie succeeds despite, or perhaps because of an obviously meager budget. These wax dolls are shamelessly plastic toy dolls - but this will only serve even more when your eyes move with an incredible human. The acting is really very good, Chuck Conners gives a complete and scary performance like Mr. Slausen, Jocelyn Jones. great as female lead.
