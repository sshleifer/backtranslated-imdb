This show is absolutely fantastic. It provides all the great drama and romance of programs for teenagers like The OC and Dawsons, but it's a lot more fun. It is a show with morals and values, without everything being coated with sugar and sanitized (7th Heaven wing). We do not have brotherhoods or fraternities in Australia, and our university system is completely different, so I have no idea how precisely Greek life is portrayed. But I do not care! Because this show is my new favorite! Any writer who can make me love a homophobic confederate racist must be a genius. <br /> <br /> And Cappie is my new Pacey. Sorry Josh Jackson, you were dethroned!
