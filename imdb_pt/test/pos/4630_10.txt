I think this movie has to be one of the most moving and moving films of recent times. <br /> <br /> The movie basically begins with a suicide in a school bathroom. You do not see who you are, so you go to the beginning of the day, and we know 6 characters, and they are going through some pretty heavy things, anyway, eventually one of them will commit suicide. <br /> I've been teaching Physical Education in schools for 8 years, and never in a movie have I seen such a precise picture of what 'really' happens in school life. <br /> <br /> The movie is filmed beautifully and sounds incredible. <br /> <br /> The ending is so shocking, and then what one would not expect, is something that will haunt me in the days to come. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one to watch. <br /> <br /> I think the fact that the Director / Writer has been in school for only a few years is an important contributor to the raw honesty expressed. in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is filmed in two separate 'modes' if you like. First of all, there is the gentle observation style where we meet the characters in their school environment as they go through their drama, but the impressive part of the film is in the interview sections where we can get to know the stories of the characters and their stories. deeper and darker thoughts. <br /> <br /> You keep asking yourself, who will be (who commits suicide) and as the drama unfolds, you keep changing your mind, until bam, hits your face five minutes late. I'm everywhere in my writing, but I just saw it at a media screening in Australia, and I'm still in a bit of a shock. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best Australian movies I've seen in years.
