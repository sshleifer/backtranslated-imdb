The slasher subgenre is practically depleted - in fact, even in 1979, just one year after the so-called "first slasher," Halloween (which was released seven years after Bay of Blood) was released; the subgenre was not far from exhausted; But Tourist Trap represents one of the most unique tours. The film follows the same basic formula as most slashers - that is, the man kills a load of children, but takes his originality from the fact that the madman is shown from the beginning (as opposed to an invisible aggressor or a man with a mask) get some tips on your character. The fact that this killer also has telekinetic abilities, including the ability to control the wax dolls that fill his home, enhances originality. We start with a great opening sequence, which shows a young man having trouble with a flat tire after meeting at a gas station in terror. The scene is incredibly scary, while the wax dolls insult him and things fly off the shelves - and this gives the public a great vision of what is to come; that is, a very scary horror movie! <br /> <br /> The credibility of acting is as nonexistent as one would expect of a criminal of the seventies, but to be honest; it's not so bad. Girls look hot, boys do not matter; and Chuck Connors is more than frighteningly scary in the role of the psychopath. He is not exactly Anthony Perkins; but still, good enough. It's not acting that's the star of the show, however, and as you might expect - the creepy atmosphere takes this award. Models of wax, as proven by the likes of House of Wax (Vincent Price version ...) are very scary; and the film makes better use of that fact. There are very few things in the theater that can be scary simply because they are there - but the wax statues are definitely one of those things. The killer's special ability could easily have gotten in the way of the atmosphere, but the film makes the best use of this fact, even having several things coming off the shelves and this goes well with the rest of the movie. Overall, this is a very good movie. While tourist trap may not be absolutely essential viewing; Worth seeing and I can recommend it.
