Excellent introspective / interpersonal piece that actually had some teeth without feeling hopeless or worse, manipulative and artificially rewarding. It can be a good double feature with American Beauty as well. The best performance to date I have seen of Anita Mui, and every actor in this seems to be a power. Let's take the hat to Ann Hui for the direction and Ivy Ho for the brilliant script. Seriously, one of the best dramas I've seen at a time, especially if you have a taste for classic poetry ALA literature. Again, excellent.
