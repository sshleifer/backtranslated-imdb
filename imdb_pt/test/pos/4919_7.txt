To be honest, fellow reviewers of IMDb, I really enjoyed this program. The reason? Well, it did not try to be more than it is; I mean, a sitcom with regular expectations, with a well-known and repeated storyline, funny and talented actors, and intelligent jokes geared toward a post-college audience. <br /> <br /> That's what Grown Ups is all about: trying to be mature, but in a fun way. <br /> <br /> Jaleel White is funny as always and offers some witty and hilarious jokes. The mood is very 90's without taking into account the trends of the new millennium and this is the main reason in my opinion because the show was unsuccessful. He was arrested in the 90's. Oh and Mrs. Ribisi were very funny and cheerful. <br /> <br /> My favorite show has to be the one that deals with Karma by biting its butt! It's not a cult classic, but I'm sure it's part of the nostalgia of the early 2000s.
