The film begins with an old Broadway producer (exceptionally well played by veteran actor Richard Carle) being led by a man who hopes to sell a story for a play to come. However, there is a storm and your car gets stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for somewhere to spend the night. Fortunately, there is a mansion nearby, although it seems very strange that the people inside know the writer and he says he did not realize that it was the home of a man he knew (and despised). However, although this sounds like bad and invented writing, it is not ... since all of this is part of a ruse drawn by the writer for a group of actors at home to interpret his plot. However, halfway through the gimmick, the producer and his intimidated assistant discover that the mystery of the murder occurring at home is untrue and they think the case is pretty funny. What no one notices, however, is that an escaped maniac is loose and is about to enter that little plot - doing some wonderful twists and turns. So when it looks like there's a real murder, the actors are really terrified, while Carle and her sidekick are convinced it's all a fake. Although I have explained part of the plot, there are many other aspects of the movie that you will have to discover alone - and it is certainly to keep you entertained and guessing. Since this is a B movie in the public domain, I certainly did not have high hopes for this little movie. However, I was thrilled when the film turned out to be a much better-than-average movie - with a very interesting and innovative twist on the old-fashioned clich√© plot about a dark and stormy night spent in a mansion. Also, while plotting the movie was very good, the dialogue was even better - with a lot of intelligence and a light and cheerful rhythm. Full of pleasant surprises and worth your time.
