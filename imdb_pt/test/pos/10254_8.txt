... instead, watch it as a great tale about African-American males in the mid-1960s in the ghettos of Chicago. For all of you there under 50, "What's Happening" was a lightweight and rather quirky comedy with few serious moments that lasted four years (1975-1979) about a group of young African Americans living in high schools . a working-class neighborhood. I liked it a lot - it just has no real connection with this movie. "Cooley High" started as the basis for "What's Happening," but its serious nature did not fit well with the auditioning audience, so it was remade as a comedy, even though the "What's Happening" credits still read that it was based on this movie. <br /> <br /> This film begins with light but touches many aspects of the unique life of the turbulent 60's and also some other aspects of growth that are timeless. The guys deal with sex, betrayal, unemployment, hopelessness and even premature death. The ending is quite powerful and serious, and the movie has a great Motown soundtrack. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, this movie is not new enough to be played on premium cable channels and is not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and played in the few venues for these movies as well.
