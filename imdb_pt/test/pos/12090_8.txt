A European musician and composer decides to capture the musical diversity of Istanbul. A lover of sound experience, Alexander Hacke (from the German avant-garde band Einstürzende Neubauten) walks the streets of Istanbul with his mobile recording studio and "magic microphone" to put together an inspired portrait of Turkish music. His journey leads to the discovery of a broad spectrum ranging from modern electronic, rock and hip-hop to the classic "Arabesque". As he wanders through this seductive world, Alex collects prints and tracks from artists such as neo-psychedelic band Baba Zula, fusion DJs Orient Expressions, rock bands Duman and Replikas, rocker Erkin Koray, Ceza (Turkey's response to Public Enemy) , breakdancer artists from Istanbul Style Breakers, digital dervish Mercan Dede, renowned clarinetist Selim Sesler, Canadian singer Brenna MacCrimmon, street performers Siyasiyabend, Kurdish singer Aynur, "Elvis of the Arabesque" Orhan Gencebay and the legendary divas Müzeyyen Senar and Sezen Aksu.
