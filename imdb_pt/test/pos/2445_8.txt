The Outsiders is undoubtedly a classic Australian TV series. Well-defined characters, tight scripts, varied and interesting venues, great invited stars and a cinematic ambience combined to make this series special. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Andrew Keir & Sascha Hehn of Germany does not (unfortunately) seem to have enjoyed small-screen success in his home country. ABC has repeated the series many times, but the release of a DVD is yet to happen. <br /> <br /> The series is timeless. It is as likely to hit a resonant tone with viewers today as it is on your own day. Let ABC ... release the strangers on DVD !!!!!
