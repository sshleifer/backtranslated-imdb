Wow!! It's hard to put my feelings into words for this episode. Ice is one of the best episodes of season one, for sure. It's my favorite of the season. Six people and a dog in a claustrophobic isolated structure in the middle of the Arctic with an unknown organism that causes killer aggression, the drama can not be better than that. The paranoia reigns as Mulder and Scully doubt each other's sanity. I've heard people complaining about the similarities of this episode with the movie 'The Thing'. I did not see, so I would not know. Ice is more than worth seeing just to see Mulder and Scully truly testing their still developing trust in each other. This episode is intense and full of suspense to the end. You will NOT be disappointed!
