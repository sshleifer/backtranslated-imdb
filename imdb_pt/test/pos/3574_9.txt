A smart and well-made movie is worth exporting! <br /> <br /> In this really clever and full-length movie filmed entirely in Bogota, you can feel the full meaning of the word "Bluff" (although it is a Colombian film, the title is presented in English); ! <br /> <br /> The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who finds his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (owner of a magazine; after that Nicolas has no girlfriend and no job. Nicolas revenge on Mallarino is to follow him and get photographs of him with his new affair Alexandra (Carolina Gomez) to blackmail Mallarino in order to get money in return for not showing the photos to Margarita. <br /> <br /> The story is really clever and well-connected, to the point that you fully understand the meaning of the title, the movie shows a thriller with many scenes and comic characters, resulting in a real pleasure for someone who enjoys the movies focused on A good script. <br /> <br /> I emphasize here that this film is different from the typical Colombian films that show a dark and violent image of our beautiful country, which is something really refreshing. Some critics say that this story does not show the typical Colombian lifestyle, so it can be held anywhere in the world, I disagree: (1) the film is totally filmed in Bogota, so you can see streets, and images of the real capital (I hope that some Americans and filmmakers watch this so that they stop showing the Amazon jungle, or small Mexican cities in Bogota like in some Hollywood movies), (2) the characters, dialogues, accent (with the exception of Nicolas who is from Argentina) are totally from here, Rosemary (Veronica Orozco) has a typical Cali accent, (3) you can also see social and cultural differences from the common people in Bogota. I hope that all this, besides a title in English, will bring people from other countries to watch this Martinez masterpiece. Excellent performance by Veronica Orozco, Luis Eduardo Arango (Detective Wilson Montes), Felipe Botero, prominent as detective Ricardo Perez, and good performance of Mallarino, Catalina Aristizabal and Federico Lorusso. <br /> <br /> A film worthy of being exported, which people from all over the world will surely understand and enjoy!, Do not miss this movie 9/10!
