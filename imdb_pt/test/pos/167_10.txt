Bloody Birthday touches on the supposed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jayne, credited as Billy Jacoby) and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) were born the same day during an eclipse. In addition to sharing a birthday, they also share a love of murder (and they are not picky about who they kill as well). Young Billy, Elizabeth and Andy play the parts of these monsters without emotion, but they know when to use the charm too. But they can not continue to deceive everyone. This is a good horror movie, not too unrealistic, there are some good moments of suspense and the children portray the roles well (although adults are quite impassive). I'd say it's worth seeing (I own a copy myself).
