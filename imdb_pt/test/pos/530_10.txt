I just saw this movie tonight. On entering it, I thought it would be good, because I really like Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon is also a great actress, but it was much better than I could imagine. You leave the movie feeling great. The performance was excellent, something that may be difficult to find lately. Natalie Portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at NYU, I think it's great that she's going to school instead of just being an actor. Anyway, back to the subject, the movie keeps you interested all the time and I definitely think everyone should go see it. I would give more details, but I do not want to give the movie.
