Five minutes later, I started to feel how weird this looked, you have a completely non-heroic hero and your foolish and overweight friend. Seen everything before, yes right. I was getting ready to be bored for a few hours. This is something I got used to ... we do not have all of them. Then after a few minutes of testosterone fed insults and such, the truck appeared. Okay, the filming techniques used to make it look fast were awkward, but who cares! This truck is incredible! Soon, however, this is taken away again and we are back to the nerd and his friend overweight. But now I'm glad that at least it's not so terrible. I am then impressed again and again by the cleverness of the film. There are so many jokes at your expense, it's as if everyone in the world were at it, except both. The mind behind makeup and effects was a genius, I swear. Believe me, if you are a man, you miss many of the jokes in this movie, there is much here that only a girl can understand. Brother Bob is by far the best backwoods killer that can be found anywhere, the fact that he is sewn only enhances the effect. There are, of course, some bad scientific facts here, but it is not always so. When our 'hero' has a bloody nose and using blood to bring Brother Bob to his death, now that's rubbish. There is no way to bleed the nose can be so bad and does not mean a cut artery or something. I'm all over with a lot of blood, but this is going too far. The jokes about incest are a little predictable, but funny, though. And the way Brother Bob finds his ending is more than classic. Overall, this movie rules, this really breaks the melodramatic tension of horror that we had both in 2003-2005. The end of this movement simply could not have been better. <br /> <br /> This is a definite must pay attention to those who like their horror with various parallel orders of gore and attitude.
