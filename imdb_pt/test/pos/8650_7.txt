The whole movie made me think of the first circle of Dante's Inferno where the souls who 'cheat' themselves into believing that they are happy are going to. They never realize they are really in a hell, but nothing is enjoyable, they just move on without any emotion. In that sense, Dante thought they were in the worst part, for they would never actively try to change their situation. No one can die in that place, but surely try to hurt. I'm not sure if the writer based his story on this medieval manuscript or not, but the resemblance is absolutely stunning. <br /> <br /> I did not enjoy the movie when I was watching, as I was expecting climax that never came. However, it made me think later and now I really think it's a good movie - sure enough it continues.
