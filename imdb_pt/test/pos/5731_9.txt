This program was quite interesting. The way the show was shown made it even more interesting. The String Theory is also very interesting to listen to as well. The whole three hours, in my opinion, were worth it. I liked to listen to the ideas given by the physicists. Extra dimensions really impress the mind. If you get the chance, watch this amazing documentary.
