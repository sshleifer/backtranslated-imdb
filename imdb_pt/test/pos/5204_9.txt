I've only recently seen this movie hoping to see a precise picture of the bloodiest battle of the 20th century. I got what I expected and more. Just to think that I came across this movie by luck, before I'd ever heard of it. It's a German film made in 1993, so I suppose I'm not surprised it's almost completely unknown to the modern American public. It's a pity, because this is a really remarkable film, I dare say it's as good if not better than Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse now, and All Quiet on the Western Front; all of which are iconic war films. <br /> <br /> 1942: World War II is in full swing. Nazi Germany overtook continental Europe and parts of northern Africa, after Adolf Hitler ordered the full invasion of the Soviet Union. A decisive move that, in the end, condemned Nazi Germany to defeat. In the early stages the invasion is going well and the German armies conquer large sections of Soviet territory, but a critical battle ensues in Stalingrad, a city that has great symbolic and strategic value. The battle soon turns into a bloodbath of epic proportions, a nightmare for the fighting German and Russian soldiers. On the verge of seizing the city, the Germans are suddenly counter-attacked by the Russians who end up cutting out the entire 6th German Army in Stalingrad. To make matters worse, the Russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the Germans. All this battle is seen by the eyes of some young German soldiers struggling for survival not only against the Russians and the harsh winter conditions but also against their own sadistic officers who care only for medals and glory and generals who have little consideration by the average infantryman. <br /> <br /> This movie will haunt me for a while. The German soldiers the film focuses on are so young and naive, so their humanity and sanity are removed from them and you really feel sorry for them because they are not the Nazi demonic people who are often portrayed in the movies. All that they were fighting is no longer important, and everything they believed in was destroyed, and after waging a battle against the Russians inside Stalingrad, we see them worsen with the onset of winter, causing many to freeze to death. The Battle & Winter scenes were like a horrible nightmare, but it also seemed so real. It is amazing at first to see young people crumple at the height of their lives, and in the end they have a shell of their egos stripped of everything. After witnessing so much carnage, these men lose their will to live, it was very sad. When finally there is a moment of hope, they are betrayed by Hitler, who finally abandons these men to a horrible death, which is just another of Hitler's crimes, abandoning the men who fought him to be massacred by the Russians. <br /> <br /> A good anti-war movie describes the horrors of war and that's what this movie does. The battle for the sequencing of the tractor factory It's the closest thing that comes to hell on Earth, but it's really like the Battle of Stalingrad. The German and Russian soldiers were portrayed with humanity, it was only rotten apples (specifically from the German side) that condemned men. The bottom line is this movie is amazing because we see how men break physically and emotionally during the war. We all have our limits and these men have been pushed far beyond their limits into the most deadly battle of our time. What the average soldier suffered at Stalingrad was beyond imagination. Even if they had survived everything they had seen and done, they would have healed for life. <br /> <br /> Stalingrad shows us why War is Hell, and how exactly hell looks.
