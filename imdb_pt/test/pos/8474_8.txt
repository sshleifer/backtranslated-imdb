I agree that this movie was spectacular. The way in which Jamie Foxx captured, not just the impression of Ray Charles, but the essence of Ray Charles actually made the film. Your life made a great story and it's good that it's finally being told. I also found a great interview with Jamie Foxx about this role by Ernie Manouse of InnerviewS on the KUHT, Houston Channel 8. The link is http: //video.google.com/videoplaying? Docid = -3001837218936089620 & q = innerviews + jamie + foxx & hl = en. I encourage everyone to check it out as he takes a deeper look at what happened in his role and his personal feelings towards Ray Charles. The only problem I could cite with the film is that the style of filming was somewhat bland at times, but in the end I think it helped make the story more realistic and stay focused on the person, Ray Charles, rather than the movie Ray.
