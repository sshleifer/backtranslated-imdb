First, let me say that while I appreciate Mike Judge's work, I was lukewarm in my response to Office Space, King of the Hill, and Beavis and Butthead. I usually prefer a smarter comedy, and here lies the irony regarding Idiocracy. <br /> <br /> In a future world where the personification of the views of Beavis and Butthead, most basic instincts and intellectual abilities are the structure of a chaotic, half-messy, semi-mad Max The semi-Blade society Runner, where every fantasy of a trailer guy comes true, a man with medium intelligence is menacing and accused of talking gay, and the mentality of the crowd takes over. And this world is also incredibly funny. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is obvious that executives at Carl's Jr., Starbucks, Costco, and Fuddruckers will be appalled at the distorted values ​​given to their products in the year 2505. <br /> <br /> There were some lost opportunities with the movie, and the relationship between time travelers - the other being a woman of medium intelligence who is concerned about the pimp's - could have been stronger; the chemistry is there. And there do not seem to be many women in the future. <br /> <br /> I came out with a smile on my face, but the experience is a little better than the memories. So, it's my kind of popcorn movie, and it will be fun to revisit on video. Recommended! Watch for credits for an extra scene.
