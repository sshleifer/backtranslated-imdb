I have not seen so many people crowded out of the theater since Star Wars Episode III. Both shows sold out and for good reason. The man with the screaming brain was the best movie to watch with a crowd full of geeks. (Hey, I'm an idiot too) Bruce Campbell was present and had the whole crowd in stitches! The film was tacky in the best way possible. It may be the funniest movie Bruce has ever made. Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian hip hop-itude and facial expressions, he's a laughing mutiny! Who knew Ted could rap? <br /> <br /> I changed my mind, the person who stole the show was actually a robot. There's nothing funnier than a robot ... making the robot. <br /> <br /> As for Bruce's performance: "I take the fifth." Thank you Bruce. Thanks for being cool, thanks for taking the time, thanks for all the fun.
