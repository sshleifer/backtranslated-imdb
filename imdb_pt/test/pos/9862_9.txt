After reading some of the previous unpleasant remarks, I had to put my two cents. This show was not, despite what that silly Essex thinks, the worst thing that has ever aired on TV. I think most of today's TV is much worse (when this stupid "reality" fad is going to end?) And there is not a current show I can watch. Give me the things I grew up with. I'm a baby from 1965 and I'm not ashamed to admit it. <br /> <br /> This program has been my all time favorite for almost 30 years. I was in high school when it was aired, and I think it helped me to hold on for all those miserable days. I was so misfit at the time, and "Fantasy Island" attracted my imagination. Since I was a novice writer in those days, it provided incredible opportunities for me to practice the craft. What a wonderful premise! I will not say that there are no flaws. Sometimes the scripts were very bad and some of the problems seemed trivial; but it could be good too, and it was a blast to watch and still is. As for the tacky factor, well, I find it unfair to label every 70s product as tacky. There was a lot of good stuff back then and that was in the ranks. (BTW, most stations aired in the 80's !!) My favorite episodes came from seasons 2, 3 and 4 mainly. <br /> <br /> For those who despise Herv√© Villechaize for his strong French accent and short stature: GROW AND LEARN SOMETHING! It's so easy to have fun when you're "normal" and "perfect." That man did the best he could in life, and if you do not like it, it's hard. Have a little compassion. He's been dead for 15 years and it's easy to cut someone who can not defend himself. There is simply no more shame. <br /> <br /> I love this show. So it looks old fashioned. I hate to say that, but we did not have special effects and Blu-Ray discs. We were fortunate to have VCRs. Live with it. Accept what is, and this is simply fun. "Escapist TV" describes perfectly, and was what it was for me - an escape from my rotten real life. And still a lot of fun to watch.
