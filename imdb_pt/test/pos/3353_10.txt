This is what pornography used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it's a musical based on a real book! Is there a real plot for him and how many porn movies can he boast about these days? This belongs to an exclusive list of true pornographic film classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with "pornographic movies" these days is that it's all about "pornographic" and not about the "movie". Alice in Wonderland has graphic depictions of sex, for sure, but she's actually telling a story at the same time. Not one of the typical "Oh, Mr. Police Man, do not write me a ticket" plots, this takes one more step further and makes it a musical! Fabulous! If you want to see an example of "good" pornography, this is one of the best.
