I started watching this hoping for the worst, I was happy to find out that the movie turned out to be enjoyable, a bit confusing in parts, like when all the joust started singing. This gave me a chance to see Daniel Wu in action for the first time, he is a better actor than I thought, sometimes he seemed a bit out of place. I thought that the purple storm deserves the release of its Hong Kong legends, as it is unlike most HK movies, it is about a man's emotional struggles when faced with memory loss, it may seem mushy but when he eventually separates what and who it really is that really makes the movie a lot more interesting. Once you enter the movie, you are surprised, as if you lost a little bit, so much of the movie would make sense, for example, I lost a little at first and I recommend it to anyone who sees it they do not miss any of it. So I can say that this movie was worth watching and a pleasant surprise to me, which I liked.
