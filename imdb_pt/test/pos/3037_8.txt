Our America is multicultural, with so many subcultures. This film simply tells the story of a time snapshot within one of these subcultures. It's basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives indifferent to the rest of the world. Usually a good movie. It amused itself, provoked thoughts and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, even in our own backyard. Must be seen by all. Having lived in the USA all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here who did not know they were citizens. This film helps to illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state. The obvious conclusion: if this is really real, then what else is out there that we know nothing about?
