as a former TV editor, I can say that this is as authentic as possible. It even got the producer of Letterman (thought to be a source) to give up (eventually) to real life. Letterman was outraged (OK, so one stupid thing is that he's throwing softballs at a tire swing on his property; total fabrication), but the main info is hilariously true, from the silly war by Letterman when he decided to leave NBC for Leno problems with an agent who was not ready for the big time but who let him perform the show (almost a disastrous exit) of his famous loyalty. If any of your kids do not understand the idea of ​​why Letterman is jealous to this day, check out this tape.
