This is the best movie I've ever seen and I love it so much it's so sad and loving that I could watch this movie over and over again. When I first saw it on the Disney Channel I was like I would love to see this movie again. I would love to watch this movie every day and I recommend it to anyone. This is really a good movie. For those who have not seen this movie and are thinking about it, it is better to go and see it because it is really good. I love the part when the boy found out about the girl and since then I was just in this whole movie. if I could watch two movies every day, it would be this and loved these are my two favorite movies I really love them
