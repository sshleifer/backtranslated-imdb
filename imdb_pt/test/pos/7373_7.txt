I decided to watch this on FearNet on demand for free because I realized well, nothing else looks nice. And it turned out to be a good surprise of terror! The film serves as an anthology of four urban legends told from the point of view of four teenagers whose car breaks in the middle of nowhere. After they decide to build a bonfire in the woods, they begin to tell their scary stories and film transitions to the events in the stories. <br /> <br /> The honeymoon, a newly married couple traveling from cross country in an RV to Las Vegas is terrified when it parks in an area lined with evil beings that hunt on the full moon. Hook-Amy Smart and James Marsden, (probably the most famous people in the movie, plus the beautiful Christine Taylor) play the young couple who comes face-to-face with the maniac who has a hook by a hand in this most recognizable shorts. <br /> <br /> People can Lick Too- this is probably the scariest and darkest of stories. A young woman talks to another girl on the internet, but it turns out that in fact she is a man obsessed with her and starts to invade the house when she is alone. That was really creepy. <br /> <br /> The Medallion - This is also a great story with Glen Quinn and Jacinda Barrett, who play a motorcycle rider and a beautiful dumb girl who are terrified by ghosts from a previous century in a mysterious story. farm house. That was good, but it was the weakest of the entries. <br /> <br /> The group around the campfire slowly develops their own terrifying experience in their segments between the stories, and the end of this film is amazing and truly amazing! Overall, this is not frighteningly scary, but it's certainly a great guilty pleasure that horror fans definitely think is worth it!
