This is truly a cult classic from Australia. If you are one of the lucky ones you have seen, then you are very lucky. It was released in most countries, but not in Australia for some reason. I have a DVD copy of the UK. Not a great transfer, but I bought it, having seen it previously at a film festival. The direction is in place and the performances are really cool! This is a scary film dark movie, but often very funny in some parts. I urge you to watch this movie, there is a coolness about it that you do not see in 99% of the typical Aussie fare. The script is very well crafted and sends you on a journey where you know it will end badly, but until the last ten minutes, you simply can not choose how much. Great work from the four leaders, especially Lachy Hulme. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done: Great work on display!
