I had the pleasure of watching this movie at the Big Bear Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things going. He also has a great thrill running through it. You do not know what will happen next, as the main character tries to deal with the perception that his new neighbor may not be the most ideal person to live in front of him. The jokes are quick and unexpected. The plot keeps us guessing. The dialogue seems very real. I thought the direction was top notch and director Travis Davis shows a lot of potential to become big in the world of studio comedies. No small compliment, considering that he is also the main actor in the film, so he had to do triple duty on it, writing, directing and starring. If you get a chance to see this movie in iTunes, it's worth downloading. It will make you laugh out loud a few times. And that's more than most of the short offers these days.
