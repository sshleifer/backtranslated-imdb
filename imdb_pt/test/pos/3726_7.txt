Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really caught me right from the start. This movie was not that. It followed in a slow and deliberate rhythm in the first 40 minutes, but there was really nothing in it that I was terribly interested in - there is an intriguing and mysterious dispute between the character of Jean Reno and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, with whom I did not know much and could not identify myself at the time. He wanders alone most of the time; he knows no one; I imagine the director was trying to describe the loneliness of the human condition in this post-apocalyptic world or something, which is fine, but I still wish it would trim from 40 minutes to 15 because it can get incredibly annoying. But after those 40 minutes , things start to get very interesting. I guess I will not say more than that because I do not want to ruin anything. So if you've seen the first 15 to 30 minutes of this movie and are thinking of turning it off (like I was), stick with it - it gets a lot better. <br /> <br /> The most interesting things I found about this movie was the fact that it did not have any dialogue, which really made me think about what was going on, how the characters were feeling and what they were their motives, because things were as they were in this apocalyptic post world, all this gives history a lot of room for public interpretation. And it's amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors are not saying exactly what's going on.
