Burt Kennedy wrote and directed this western from a novel. Kennedy was a well-known writer and director, most of the Westerners. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum was a star for more than 20 years when he did it. This role was as many he had already done, one can see why he was a big star for many years. <br /> <br /> He filled this paper easily as a well-worn glove. The title character is played by Robert Walker Jr. (his father, a great actor Robert Walker - died tragically at age 32 - his mother is known as actress Jennifer Jones). Robert was light build and even though he had talent he only made some movies. (he was in the last Rita Hayworth movie.) <br /> <br /> ROAD FOR SALINAS --- the same year and it was very good. He looked a lot like his father, but he did not seem to have the charm of his father. He did just a few more movies. He is still alive and I wish him well. <br /> <br /> Most of his scenes are with another son of a great Hollywood. The son of John Carradine, David, who is still making movies. they made a good team. <br /> <br /> In westerns, you always have a female character and she is usually a dance hall artist. (today they call them prostitutes), Angie Dickinson plays this role well. also featured Western supporters, John Anderson and Jack Kelly. It was filmed in Old Tucson, outside the center of Tucaon Az. & The scenery is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Typical of older westerns, there is not much action, there is a good mood and the usual ending is thrown out. <br /> <br /> It's a nice fast 89 minutes.
