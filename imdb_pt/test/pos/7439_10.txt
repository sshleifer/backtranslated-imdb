unfortunately this film in Portugal is not even a shadow of it ... and I agree with an earlier opinion, only fans of FF will really give the film the real credit ... but for the rest .. I will challenge to watch. the story is great, and I thought the game ended the story, but the writers gave us a great story for the god of all rpg's ... the more, as usual, came from heaven;) ehehe but the little details that they gave us (we fans of the game) are beautiful .. as the touch is the winning music of the game battle, and even some movements are quite familiar, just watch, it's a great story of a great movie, a great animation ... only a 10/10
