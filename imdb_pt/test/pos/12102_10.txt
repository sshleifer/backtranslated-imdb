If you are a fan of Turkish and Middle Eastern music, you are very lucky. This film is a documentary of current music in Istanbul, spanning the traditional to the modern. It's very good. You could not do better if you went to Istanbul. We got interviews with Orhan Gencebay, concert clips of modern musical icons, a road show with a Romani (gypsy) audience, Turkish hip hop (surprisingly very good) and more. Some of the best female vocalists I've ever heard. A Kurdish woman singing in a hamam (steam bath) that will rip out her heart. A lot of social and political formation. If this is your thing, you will have a great time. I could barely stay at the movies. <br /> <br /> CD soundtrack now available on amazon. Expensive.
