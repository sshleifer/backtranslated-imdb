One word for that. Hilarious. I have not seen movies like this in a long time. In some moments of the movie, I completely forgot that it was a movie, I just felt like I was back watching Viva La Bam, or even watching saying, my own friend going through something like that. It was realistic and I liked how Bam, Ryan, Raab, Rake and Brandon and the rest of the guys did not try very much actually actually acting. They, to me, were just acting like their famous idiots. There were some scenes that I loved more than others, like Raab in the shower, holy, I laughed so much. He honestly was probably my favorite character besides Bam. He really, in my opinion, made the film a little more hilarious. It's basically a must see for any fan of the CKY team:]
