If you love drive-in cheeze from the early 70's, you'll love this one. How could you go wrong with a low budget movie about bloodshed at a lunatic asylum? You can not! Crazy people and sharp objects are always a fun combination. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have been filmed inside someone's house for about $ 320.65. For me, just ads for the fun of watching this kind of thing. The blood is a little soft compared to others like that, but there's enough to make us sick with blood (like me) happy. Some horror movies draw parts and leave you waiting for something to happen. That is not the case here. The characters are fun enough to make each frame quite enjoyable. There is never a moment of boredom from beginning to end. The climax of melting the mind at the end is unbelievable. I liked it so much that, shortly after the final credits, I watched for the second time. It is an absolute must to see for any drive-in horror drive-in. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 on the drive-in Freak-O-Meter ... Preview required <br /> <br /> Yes, I love you..I love you ... now get your Thorazine and put your clothes back ... please ... 8)
