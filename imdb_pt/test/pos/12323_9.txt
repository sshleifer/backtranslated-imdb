So many literary adaptations are disappointments. There are many reasons for this, but it is usually the need to reduce a complex novel to the size of a screenplay. The Dead is unusual - it had to be "padded" since the tale itself is a tiny and relatively short jewel. It may, in fact, be the best tale of the English language. In beautiful language, he speaks of Gabriel Conroy's realization that his life and the lives of so many around him are controlled by the memories of the dead. Even his own wife of many years loved a man now dead more than he. <br /> <br /> Bringing such a short story to the movies would always be complicated. John Huston did a magnificent job. He never gave in to the temptation to play or use sophisticated techniques to expand the story. It is simple and true, with exceptional performance. The only small flaw is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy. <br /> <br /> It is rare that a film version of a literary masterpiece is a masterpiece, but I think it is fair to use it. this term for this movie. It's not a brave movie, but it's simple and pure - I always think of Ozu movies when I think of The Dead, it's that level of purity and simplicity and deep wisdom.
