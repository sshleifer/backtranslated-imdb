I was really pleased when I played this game. The graphics were something new. The missions were great. But still, I felt I wanted more from this game. For a James Bond game is very good, but not as good as his other games. It would be great if they could do a 360Remake for this. It would be much better then. This may be just because I'm into games like Resident Evil, Dead Rising and those kind of games. Then it could be better, but it was OK to play. One thing I absolutely hated about this game was Natalya! She was annoying dying all the time and she could not run either. I recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games more than I do.7 / 10 STARS
