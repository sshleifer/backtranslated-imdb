Just reading why this show was canceled makes me a little drunk. This was one of my favorites as a kid and I always watched it happen, no matter how many times I watched the episode. Of course the effects were not great, but they were not horrible either. They did a reasonably good job with the costume and had the nice vibe of the 70's to it which is always nice to see and hear as the music was also very 70's. He did not really have any comic book villains, but most of the adaptations of live comic shows had nothing to very few real super comic villains. Spidey's powers were a bit different here too, he had his sense of Spider and he could climb walls, but he was not as strong as the Spider-Man of the comics. He was super strong, although I remember an episode where he invaded a room, breaking the door knob, it just was not the car the comic might be. The show was set in Los Angelos, so there were no male buildings, but they got on well with the web. It's good that this show really does have web shooters and not the organic movie shooters. I love the movies, but part of me would like them to start over and make the smarter Spidey pants that have mechanical web shooters. This show had a good star like Peter Parker and he was just like Spider-Man, it's good to see a Spidey who does not basically live in the slums as he does in the movies. Neither this program nor the movie, however, has a Spider-Man who is quick with insult like that in the comics. Still, this show was fun without being as tacky as the Batman show.
