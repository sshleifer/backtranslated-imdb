The Jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie. The only part of science fiction is the Woolly Mammoths that live today. <br /> <br /> Elephants are attacking villages in a part of India and these attacks are also killing people. An expedition is sent to investigate and one of the members of this, an American hunter blames those elephants who are being frightened by Woolly Mamutes, who are supposedly extinct. Nobody believes him at first, but they do it when mammoths appear at the end. An earthquake kills them. <br /> <br /> Jungle was filmed on location in India and has a lot of nice scenery and good Indian music, including some songs that keep the movie moving well. Mammoths are actually real elephants with fur coats and long prey tusks. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Rod Cameron, CÃ©sar Romero (The Lost Continent) and Marie Windsor (Catwoman of the Moon). <BR> The jungle is worth seeing, just for scenery and music. Very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
