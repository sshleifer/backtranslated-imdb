In Dublin, crippled rebel Rory O'Shea (James McAvoy) moves to the disabled home of Carrigmore, affecting the lives of the residents. Roy is able to understand the unintelligible speech of Michael Connolly (Steven Robertson), who was left in the shelter by his prominent father many years ago because of his cerebral palsy, and they become close friends. Rory convinces Michael to move from Carrigmore to an apartment in Dublin, and they hire the beautiful Siobhan (Romola Garai) to help them. Living together with Rory, Michael faces a new world, finding friendship, love and freedom and learning to survive on his own. <br /> <br /> "Inside I'm Dancing" is a wonderful story of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story. The acting of Steven Robertson and James McAvoy is incredible and I do not understand how they were not nominated for an Oscar with such magnificent performances. Romola Garai also has a high level performance and is extremely beautiful and sexy. The script is playing, never tacky and without redemption and the precise direction of Damien O'Donnell is very sensitive. Unfortunately the Brazilian title of the DVD is shamefully ridiculous, giving a wrong idea of ​​this excellent film. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Best Days of Our Lives" ("The Best Years of Our Lives")
