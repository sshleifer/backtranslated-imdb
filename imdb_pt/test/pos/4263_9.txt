Jarl and Moodysson are part of an agonizing race of political filmmakers. The Swedish population must realize that they try to uncover the truth when the government and the media actively distort and cover up the events surrounding the EU meeting in Gothenburg. It is absolutely painful to see how these innocent children were abused and drugged by Swedish police and sentenced to prison on political trials for sending text messages and as revenge for other actions. The unfortunate thing about this movie is that it will not reach the masses in Sweden as it will only be shown in theaters and will not be released on video or screened on television. <br /> <br /> The political movie is important. how it can bring new perspectives and insights on complex issues and has a role to play as a mass educator.
