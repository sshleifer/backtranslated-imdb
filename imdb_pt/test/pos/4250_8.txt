"Putney Swope" is a unique, low and low preciousness of the late 60's, which would probably have been forgotten in time if it were not for two things: Paul Thomas Anderson (who named Don Cheadle's character in "Boogie Nights" , Buck Swope, after the homonym hero of this film) and the limited release of the DVD. Watching "Putney Swope" is like listening to hardcore punk rock: it may not make much sense (at least for me when I first watched), but you have to respect the film for your blatantly rebellious passion and message. I did not understand many things about "Putney Swope", but mostly I liked it. The more I think about the movie, the more it grows in me. <br /> <br /> The movie is billed as a parody of New York's Madison Avenue, best known in the 1960s as the advertising capital of the world. Generation X and Y members may get lost with this concept, but fortunately "Mad Men" is on TV to provide us with this missing piece of US History. What you need to know before watching this movie is that these advertising agencies were largely male, and even largely white establishments. <br /> <br /> With this premise in mind, the movie opens with a board meeting of advertising agencies. Members are predominantly white, with the exception of Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson, who bears a strange resemblance to Dick Gregory in this film), the African-American symbol on the board. The council members are so selfish and soulless that when their president falls dead in front of them, their only concern is who will become the next president. Without even removing the body of the boardroom, they begin a paper ballot to elect the next president. <br /> <br /> Putney Swope is elected by a landslide, but not because the other members feel that Swope is qualified. The vote for Swope was an ill-fated attempt for these council members to sabotage any other member from being elected president. With his plans backfiring, Swope takes over and "sinks the boat," dismissing everyone except one of the original members, and hiring all the colored people in his place. <br /> <br /> After that point, the film became (for me) very strange and difficult to follow the plot. It may not have been a plot, actually. The whole idea of ​​the movie seems to be a "what if" scenario, with the result being that the new "Truth and Soul Inc." firm would be unconventional, but successful anyway. The firm ends up making so much money that members build a huge glass case to keep money for unexplained ends. It may be because Swope does not trust banks, although this point is not addressed or explained in the film. It could also be metaphorical in some way, but who knows. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place inside the advertising agency, with occasional scenes in the White House with a president who, for some unknown reason, is a dwarf. My guess is that some political joke was being made, but I can not figure out what. Did the filmmakers say that the president is a small, insignificant part of American life? Were they saying that the last elected officials (Nixon at the time) were insignificant? I do not know. I found it a bit scary, however, that the man representing the president had a striking resemblance to the future President Ronald Reagan. It's funny to make that connection 40 years after the movie was made. <br /> <br /> What this movie may have benefited from is how consumers outside the agency reacted to the new ads. Of course advertising material had a strange and funny appeal for its unconventional creativity, but did those ads convince people to buy the product? If yes, how? The film suggested the idea that the new advertising campaign was successful through customer interaction and calls from the White House. However, it would have been revealing to see ordinary people, since demographics have always been more profitable for advertisers. <br /> <br /> Although the parodies and political messages that this movie may have made probably did not stand the test of time, this movie still had many unique qualities. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X factor for him that greatly benefited him in this film. Swope's rough voice was actually director Robert Downey, his nicknamed father's voice sometimes evil, but he fit the character so well by being an authoritative puzzler. He hires and dismisses workers randomly, but earns everyone's respect, except one of the employees, for revolutionizing the advertising agency and seeking new ideas. <br /> <br /> The film's premise was, and still is, incredibly risky, especially since the film was written and directed by a white man (Robert Downey, Sr.). However, this film refuses to fall victim to negative black stereotypes that would lead to the rise and fall of the blaxploitation genre years later. While some of the sex scenes might be a bit daunting to some viewers, the main message is that a black owned and operated company can thrive through innovation and risk-taking. Many people may not take a positive message away from this movie, but I just did. <br /> <br /> "Putney Swope" remains a forgotten film of a strange era, and Downey, Sr. (even though his son's recent comeback) never got the recognition as a director he deserved. However, if you find a DVD of this movie, buy and watch it. If you're on Netflix, ditto. It is a film that can be confusing at times, but it is worth noting the enthusiasm, the ambition and the nonconformist stature, even with the current standards of the cinema.
