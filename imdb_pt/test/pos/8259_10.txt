Superbly adapted to the canvas and extremely faithful to Mary Webb's early novel, this film is a true masterpiece. In addition to the uniquely talented rising star, Janet Mcteer as the protagonist and one or two established actors, the film used mostly little-known names. However, the drama was even more compelling for this. The social and personal tension is almost tangible and I felt as if the cast was reacting to each other as if they had done it in real life. I saw one commenter asked if Janet McTeer really had a cleft lip, a testament to how good her characterization was. I saw this on TV when it was first shown, recorded and then the tape was lost. But it stays clear as anything in my mind. If you have some affection at all for the social period, it is an absolute must see.
