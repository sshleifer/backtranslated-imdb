A wonderful family movie and a beautiful horse movie. Over 75% entertainment. Casey, Buddy, and Kelly Marsh are very interesting and kind characters. Horses are real beauties. <br /> <br /> There is horse racing as a backdrop to show how luck is sometimes just common sense. It shows how children can do stupid things for stupid reasons. It shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The very realistically portrayed characters turn the film's unrealistic theme into something that everyone can identify with. <br /> <br /> Andrew Rubin performs a wonderful performance as Buddy, the sensible older brother. A little reminded me of Aidan Quinn (eyes, speech, facial appearance). <br /> <br /> Casey makes you fall in love with the character because of the seriousness. Sarah Blue is also well portrayed by Alexis Smith. Lloyd Bourdelle, the father, is played by Walter Matthau and he is the character. <br /> <br /> Although there is room for improvement in the film, it is a very nice and enjoyable film.
