As for fake documentaries (fakumentaries anyone?), This one is up there with the best! It seems very real and that's what it aims at. In the recent light of the events (Guant√°namo) this film is even more scary so you could say that it was ahead of its time when it was released in the 70's! <br /> <br /> We can only hope that such a government does not exist! Looking for terrorists and interviewing people like that? Of course, all respondents seemed to have the same mindset of the 1970s: fuck politicians and politics in general. Maybe it was not so smart for someone to think ... but hey, do not forget: it's just a movie! O)
