I grew up with the films of Abbott and Costello, A. because my father grew up with them and both of our surnames are abbott, so we owe a little respect to deo, I did not realize the flack of that movie and others from there. It was really a classic, it was funny because abbott and costello were always the same characters but it was so funny, now what I like about jack and bean foot is that although the love story is totally annoying and that a prince song sung, omg, bland, but I like the angle they took in love, story, the couple have to get married because a kingdom is running out of money, they meet in the cell and fall in love because both pretend not to be real and they end up being the couple, so happy end, I do not think it was the original version, if it were they should have cut out this movie, but I think it was original and I love it. but watching this sucks, lol, also when the movie really comes into action with the giant + abbott and costello is sooo funny. when the giant knocks on the door and the mast shouts "OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR" is very funny. And that once a joke where Jack starts screaming prince, the prince and all the dogs jump on him. half idiot, but really original. I wish they had at least tried to remaster it, although I got that Africa screams \ jack and the bean foot, and I do not care about the cause of the quality when I had on tape was bad quality too, so the which I think. the beginning is kind of funny, the medium is very funny, and the ending is not funny, but I'm 19 and when a film made in 52 makes me laugh a lot, it's great, this movie is very funny. I love their style. also the chapters are bad. also the part where jack is climbing on the beanstalk and they are all singing a song about what a dipstick jack is and he will be dead, this is very funny
