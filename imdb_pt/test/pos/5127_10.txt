I saw the movie "Hoot" and then I immediately decided to comment on it. The truth is that NATURE needs protection from us because we are the dominant species on this planet. Some people think that if they have money, they can do whatever they want, which it probably is, but if they think about the future, then they think of themselves that they would do something useful! This movie is not just about kids, this movie is showing us that kids are usually the ones who care more about it than adults. When I was twelve, I saw some water lilies and knew they were protected by law and did not dare touch them without fearing the law, but fearing that I might actually harm them. (I currently have 15) What so ever, the performance was great, the 3 main characters are well played and we all have to learn from them. I hope everyone thinks about what they saw in that movie !!! and enjoy!
