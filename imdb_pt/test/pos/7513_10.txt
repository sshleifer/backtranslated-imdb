Patty Chayevsky was years ahead of the most successful writers and playwrights in tackling tricky issues. In that 1971 film, he followed Sinclair Lewis and A. J. Cronin (in ARROWSMITH and THE CITADEL, respectively) while critically analyzing the world of medicine, although his target is centered on a special stage: a modern hospital in Manhattan. Chayevsky's point of view is quite straightforward: they are places in the hospital for people to go to improve, or they are money-making organizations where people often die because of incompetence. <br /> <br /> As a person who has recently been to a hospital many times (and soon will have to come back again) I find the HOSPITAL a very timely and rewarding satire. George C. Scott is Dr. Block, one of the heads of the Manhattan Surgical Center, a major teaching hospital. He just started his day when he was told that one of the second year residents died overnight in apparent confusion. It looks like he was sedated and drugged while sleeping in a bed (he was having an appointment with a nurse), and someone tampered with an i.v. who should have contained water with glucose (later on he received an overdose of insulin on i.v.). Soon Scott discovers that whenever he turns around, another team member dies of heart attack or poorly done operation. The key to all this seems to be a patient who came to the hospital ten days before for a regular checkup, and has since lost a kidney, almost lost his other kidney and is now in a coma (Barnard Hughes). <br /> <br /> Hughes' daughter (Diana Rigg) wants to bring her father in a coma to his home on an Apache Indian reservation in Mexico. Scott is not totally against the idea - after all, hospital errors almost killed Hughes. In addition, Scott is suffering a middle-aged crisis with the collapse of his marriage and family, and his growing doubts about what his chosen profession actually accomplishes. This is not just a case like Hughes's. The hospital is in a state of chaos, where the regular staff (Scott, Stephen Elliot, Nancy Marchand, Stockard Channing) is overloaded and overworked, and is at war with the business team (typified by Frances Steenhagen in a really cold performance) . The local community is hostile because of hospital expansion plans - but when they meet to "discuss" matters with Elliot, they prove to be divisive among themselves (Black Panthers vs. local clergy vs. women seeking birth control and pro clinics types). Rigg (who falls in love with Scott over the course of the film) is becoming more and more certain that leaving the insanity of the city makes sense, and Scott also jokes about the idea. <br /> <br /> Scott was at his disposal. height of performance in this film, what with ANATOMY OF A MURDER, THE HUSTLER, DR. STRANGELOVE, and PATTON before the HOSPITAL is done. His anguish registered when he and Rigg met (it prevents him from killing himself because of his despair). He does not know if anything done at the hospital is worth it and shouts out the words of the "Summarized Line" out the window. Although he later relaxes a bit about how good his teaching was for doctors studying with him, Scott is never really sure about all of this - he nevertheless fully accepts his own sense of responsibility that others simply give up. Rigg was also at the height of her international fame (if not her acting skills) - her task as Mrs. Peel in THE AVENGERS was a few years old, but she was recognized as one of Britain's top talent at the time, also as one of the sexiest women performers of that period. <br /> <br /> Supporting actors are also good. In addition to Steenhagen's refrigeration (requiring Medicare / Medicaid / insurance information for comatose patients in the E.R.), there is Hughes as a religious maniac who wins, and Elliot as the hospital head bouncy. There's also my favorite cartoon: Richard Dysart as Dr. Elwell. Elwell is a butcher who found a real home for him at the Great Securities Council, having incorporated himself into tax incentives. Anyone who remembers their performances as ethical types, like the head of the LA law firm or Melvin Douglas' friend and physician to be there, watching his greedy Dr. Elwell see another facet of the talents of that underrated actor.
