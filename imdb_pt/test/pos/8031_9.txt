Throughout the world, the unmistakable mark of the American C.I.A. can be found in the many messy messes they left behind. In the beginning, their goals were simple: to spy on, to remove enemy agents, to steal sensitive information and to destabilize unfavorable governments. The years have gone by, and although his mission remains similar, his black clandestine operations now include domestic espionage, discrediting US citizens, and infiltrating American organizations that criticize the US government. This film, however, focuses on the worldwide hunt for C.I.A. by the infamous 'Carlos the Jackel'. The film is called "The Assignment" and tells the story of the lieutenant commander. Annibal Ramirez, (Aidan Quinn), a US Navy officer who bears a striking resemblance to the leader of so many terrorist bombings. Recruited by Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) of C.I.A. and Amos (Ben Kingsley), a special agent of the Israeli Mosad, Ramirez is secretly trained to search, pose, infiltrate the illusory organization, and from there discredit the true Jackel who works for the Russians. This movie is explosively thrilling, and filled with wild chases, murders and inter-country chaos. Quinn is wonderful and amazingly artistic playing both sides of the war. Easily one of your best efforts. ****
