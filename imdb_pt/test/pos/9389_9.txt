I love B-horror movies. I, however, am not usually a big fan of "so stupid and funny" movies. I had to evaluate it so simply because the bed of death: the bed that eats, is so unique, and so unique. there are plenty of question marks, lots of holes in the plot, and the WTF factor is increased to 11, but I really was not bored for a second. I really could not call it scary anytime, every minute I was saying to myself "what the hell is this bed / movie going to do next!" I watched this with a friend who is by no means a fan of horror movies or B movies, and even she was pretty into it. the effects were really very inventive and the colors and atmosphere were very good. maintains a very consistent and uniform tone throughout most of the film (despite an incredibly ridiculous consistency) and the acting was NOT TERRIBLE. I can see from the point that there are certain inconsistencies in the actions of the bed that make suspension of belief almost impossible, but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept that this fact did not really bother me. Seriously, for me, this movie hit the realm of one that I will not just never forget, but I guarantee that I will find myself thinking about certain scenes in the future. Does anyone else know of any other movie in the inanimate objects that people eat genre? totally fantastic.
