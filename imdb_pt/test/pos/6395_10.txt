It's one of my favorite TV shows. A wonderful cast, a great script and a plot out of the way. <br /> <br /> Watching the Kyle family's routine is granted to great moments of humor and great comedy artists. Let's see: - Damon Wayans: no comments. He is one of the best today. She has a perfect timing and always understands the joke. <br /> <br /> - Tisha Campbell: Your paranoid and sentimental Jay is wonderful to see. <br /> <br /> George O. Gore II: Perfect for the role. It is impossible to imagine another person as the adorable (and dumb) Junior. <br /> <br /> - Jennifer Nicole Freeman: the self-centered Claire found the perfect actress. Beautiful and talented. <br /> <br /> Parker McKeena Posey: impossible not to fall in love with her. Noah Gray-Cabey: This boy has a future, I'm sure I'm very sad when it's over, but this show will be in my mind forever. Michael, Jay, Claire, Junior, Kadie ... we love you!
