This was an amazing movie with flying scenes that were incredibly realistic! I've seen it several times and kept my attention all the time. I myself am a big fan of the Air Force and I love watching any movie where I can catch a glimpse of an F-16 flight. If you like Top Gun then I guarantee you will love this movie too. Except for a few swear words, this is a great movie for the whole family. It has a great plot and does not have a moment of boredom throughout the movie. Every second is action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. So once again I recommend this movie !!!
