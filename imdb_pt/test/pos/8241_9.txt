A good Australian movie. It beautifully recreates Sydney's appearance as it was in the 1950's. This film impressed me a lot when I first saw it during the initial release of the movie and still works very well. Good directing work by Phil Noyce, wonderful camera work, clever lighting and some great performances across the board. An absolute "Must See" for all the students of the 70s Australian cinema. One out of the box!
