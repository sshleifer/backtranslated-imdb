I was surprised and touched by this emotional film that moved me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy at the same moment. I think a lot less people will pay attention to this movie. But hopefully at least some will see and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their physically disabled, who (in a team) beat up the medical welfare system and fight for their rights. This film shows a side that some of us would never understand, nor much exaggerated, but presented emotionally. I hope this film helps us better understand some of your desires and realize how important it is to have a friend in the world, especially when you almost can not express that fact.
