This is a forgotten classic of a movie, and Harmony Karin lent a ton of it to "Gummo". Gummo is good, River's Edge is so much better. It's no secret that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor who walked the earth. No, actually, he's a horrendous actor. But he was born to some roles: Ted Preston, Bill Esquire and Ted, and his role in that film. He is perfect as a sort of good-natured teenager, but very apathetic and confused. Then there's Crispin Glover. I think your performance in this movie is the best of your career. He is phenomenal as the wackjob drugged character. Then there's Dennis Hopper, who is perfect too. This movie is simply amazing, and if you have not seen it yet, run and watch it today. It's brilliant. One of the best portraits of modern America I've seen.
