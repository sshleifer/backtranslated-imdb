I do not think the world was ready for this movie. I know I was not. It was expected to be a standard low-budget exploration potboiler. Instead, I have had Shakespeare's most clever rephrasing since Peter Greenaway's Prospero's Books. This must become the definitive film version of Romeo and Juliet. It is not clear. But this is the loss of the world.
