The original Female Convict Scorpion is a masterpiece of all time. The first sequel, Jailhouse 41, was not so good in my opinion, although it is still notable for having taken the idea of ​​the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito was able to do the same thing again with this film; the story is a bit different here but still he managed to catch what made the previous entries excellent and better than many such films and create something quite unique around him. Once again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a. "Scorpion") and this time she is out of prison and not very interested in returning. After escaping from pursuing cops, one thing leads to another and Scorpion finds himself with a prostitute and his retarded brother. The prostitute ends up being impregnated by her retarded brother (...), while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged by someone from whom she made an enemy out of prison. But Scorpion does not like to spend time behind bars and it does not take long for her to do what she does best. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great start when we see Scorpion cutting off the arm of a copper. with the intention of taking her back to jail. From there, however, the movie slows down a lot and Beast Stable ends up being more of a drama than the two previous films. That's not to say that there's not much action yet - the Scorpion still spends a lot of time in 'revenge mode' and the movie is not exactly short on the overall sleaze. Meiko Kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and is another discreet, almost speechless performance. Her presence on the screen is great, though, and she manages to have a menacing presence even though she is only physically small. The plot structure for this movie is similar to the other two in which everything turns into a crescendo of revenge. There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this film than in the previous two, so this section occupies a fairly large part of the film. There are some surreal sequences, not as many as in the first film and not near as in the second, but the film remains with the rest of the series at that point. Overall, I would say this movie is in the top two in terms of quality - not as great as the original and slightly better than the second.
