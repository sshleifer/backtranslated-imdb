Where to start, I like the scary snow monster named Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for me, we thought he'd be back and he was. Changing the place to a tropical resort works. Seeing old friends and meeting new characters. Scott MacDonald does a great job as Jack Frost, you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain, you can see him or, in this case, hear him in the performance. Yes, Jack Frost 2 is a welcome sequel that is better than the first. I have a complaint, the little Jacks or the Jacklings as I call them. They looked like hand puppets. I think they could have done a better job with the Jacklings, the mouth could have opened up more, but the CGI was good and as a whole, the whole movie is worth being watched over and over again. If you liked JACK FROST, then you will like this sequel. No questions or discussion, 9 GREAT STARS.
