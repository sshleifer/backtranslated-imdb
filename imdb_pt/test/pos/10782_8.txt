Oliver Stone, always ready to make films with political themes, does another one here. "Talk Radio" is loosely based on the career of Alan Berg, a radio host in Denver who was murdered by white supremacists. In this case, the character is Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosian), a frank presenter in Dallas who loves nothing more than annoying people who call. As it is, most of the people who call it are a racist bunch. And things may be heating up more than anyone realizes. <br /> <br /> Bogosian's performance brings a slight comedic tone to a serious movie. I really liked the scene in which he plays with a country boy calling. I would not call Oliver Stone's best ever film, but it's a good reference in a time when the media gets more and more concentrated. Good performances by Ellen Greene and Alec Baldwin also help.
