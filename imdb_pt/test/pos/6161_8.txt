This is such a beautiful movie! It not only portrays war, but also has friendship and love. Slama's life is full of sadness, every aspect of his life has been broken. I can only imagine how he would feel when his friend made the final sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I see a slight resemblance to 'Pearl Harbor', which is also about two pilots falling in love with the same woman. However, this film is much better done because it does not portray the woman to be unfaithful and easy to deal with. The friendship between the two men is also much more convincing and well built. I would definitely recommend this movie to all people.
