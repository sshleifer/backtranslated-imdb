I remember a college professor commenting on how disturbing this film was, reflecting the apathy of teenagers (this was before Generation X). <br /> <br /> In a way, most of us are a product of the same consumer culture; these high school kids spend their time drinking, getting high and wondering what to do with the body left on the riverbank. <br /> <br /> What would they do today? Would things be different? Some Very Important Issues There are some excellent scenes with Keanu Reeves and the dysfunctional family with whom he lives; his 11-year-old brother leaving to be wasted; the mother has no idea what to do - she spends her time drinking with her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This film was just before its time when it tackles the problems of lower-class American society; these children had no way out; What is available to them in this dirty water city? . All in all, some interesting social comments are presented and there are no solutions. 9/10
