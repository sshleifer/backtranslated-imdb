This was one of the few shows that my wife and I agreed to watch. I was annoyed to hear that it was canceled, especially since I did not know the ratings were so poor. As far as I knew, I was doing very well with many viewers. Almost all my friends and most of the people I spoke with watched the show. Now we're stuck watching bad shows or DVDs. How bad was the show? Does anyone know the actual results of concert shows? I know when it was on Thursdays, it was harder for me to pick it up. Thank you G * d for DVR's! <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was a real surprise to know that there will be no more "The War At Home". If any other network see this, PLEASE TAKE THE SHOW !!!! PLEASE!
