I watched this movie for the first time today, and just loved it ... Yes, it's simple in its history, the sweetest love story, and how any woman can not fall in love with Callum Blue me <br /> <br /> The scenery in Italy was as you would expect, Beautiful, the bandits lost at the end, and the two lovebirds meet again in the end, it was wonderful, but that scene where a certain Italian was sweeping the confetti after Eric and Wanda's wedding, perfection! <br /> <br /> Have a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie, yeah, better have a scarf ready to be captivated, I know I was and hope to get on DVD soon. All the actors played their part perfectly, this was a WW2 movie that you could believe in, as it was so realistic, and without going over like in other movies ...
