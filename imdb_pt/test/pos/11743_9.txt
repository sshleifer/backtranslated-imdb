This movie always thrills me emotionally in the end. Although the issues of the film - interracial romance and adultery - were controversial at the time, this film goes far beyond these narrow parameters of groundbreaking novelty and striking singularity. Here we have a true love story, as written by the woman involved in this love affair, told in a brilliant and aggressive style that exalts the virtues and glory of mad passionate love. I "love" this endorsement of the only emotion that makes life really worthwhile. Jennifer Jones is full of grace and William Holden is simply magnificent in his role as a reporter. A wonderful film that only people who have been in this kind of love can truly appreciate and understand. And for those who have not yet fallen in love, even the hope that one day lightning can hit you makes life worthwhile - because it's worth having love even for a short time - even if you lose - because love is the "things" - the essence - of life. This movie works for me. A warmly felt experience!
