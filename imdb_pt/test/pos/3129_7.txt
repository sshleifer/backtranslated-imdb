Although I have enjoyed this western, I have to say, it's not one of my favorites for John Ford Westerns. For me, it just lacks a certain something that most of his other movies (the ones I saw anyway) have) I am I do not know what this thing is. It is not something tangible. Either way, the essence of the story is about a Mormon train being used by a band of thugs as a hiding place for a chasing legion. Ford employs many of its patrons here. there are some interesting characters, a nice scene, a little action and excitement. it all boils down to an attendant experience. Certainly not boring. But it's not exactly the usual John Ford standard. For me, Wagon Master is a 7/10
