The series of decline is incredible and the director PS does not get enough credit to make these films. I'm a bit surprised to see that not many people have seen this or the other two, but it's worth digging up if you want the image of punk in the trans-formed years between the late seventies and early eighties. The film begins with an exciting collection of clips played about the music of band X. Many interviews with bands and punks offer an enlightening perspective on what it was like to survive on the bottom rung of the mainstream rock ladder. No internet, bad jobs and all hostility collide in that genre. For the new kids who have not heard of these bands or are just getting one of them, this movie is a real lesson on how to rock. All the band's performances (and there are many) are incredible, especially FEAR that never fail to amaze me. This and the second installment are amazing time capsules, offering to those who care for a rare glimpse into the life of these crazy people. It's true punk, as in the interview with Darby Crash's girlfriend when they remember a painter who mysteriously / suddenly died away from home and it took a week for them to find out, they take pictures next to the guy and everyone, including the EMT had a chuckle about this, and in true form the interviewer asks his girlfriend if she was sad or upset that this guy had died while painting her house, the answer "I do not hate painters". How about Black Flag renting your apartment / rehearsal space for $ 16 a month! My jaw almost dropped at that moment, seeing I'm renting a ten-by-ten locker to practice 400. Between watching this and Deadwood I feel like I was born in the wrong period, only missing out on those days of cowboy and old-fashioned nights . The people and bands associated with the film have paved the way for what music is most difficult today, and they did it in a unique way. Brilliant movie, ten stars, see part 2, as well as part 3, although I do not know what to say.
