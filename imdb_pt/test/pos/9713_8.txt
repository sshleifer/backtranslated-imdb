This film surprised me - I only saw two episodes of the series, I never saw the first film, but went to a pre-show where Johnny Knoxville himself introduced the film, telling us to 'turn off our sense of moral judgment for a movie. hour and a half. ' Was he right. As a movie, this would probably give it a 2 note, since it has zero plot, no structure beyond randomness and very little production value. However, that's not the point. Everyone in our theater was laughing and panting all the time - not just some of the feats were creative (see trailer if you need to know, but they hide some of the best (or worst depending on how you want to look at them)), but some of the things they did took us by surprise. These guys do some things that are not going to come in their newspaper reviews (and probably can not even be posted here), involving many things under the belt. However, nearly 3/4 of the acrobatics are fantastically hysterical (even if they are morally reprehensible, but remember Knoxville's statement), and if you're in the right mindset, this movie is hysterical to watch. Only about 20 minutes of that movie could actually have been shown on TV, so consider being warned about what you're getting yourself into - some things are disgusting, but instead of being repelled by it you end up laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all. As a person who thought Jackass, the TV show, was an exaggerated fad with just a few funny sketches and a lot of unnecessary pain, the amount of fun I had in this movie made me realize that having no limits is the best environment for these movies. guys to work with. It's a lot of fun and it should be a great dose of comedy until the Borat movie comes out. With this movie, you may think you know what you're getting, but these guys are a few steps ahead of you - I guarantee you'll be amazed at the third sketch. So enjoy it, and do not worry: you will not want to do almost anything from your things at home.
