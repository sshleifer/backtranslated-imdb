I just finished showing El Padrino in Germany. A great movie. We look forward to seeing more Mr. Chapa's films in the future. It was wonderful to see such a well-assembled film with so much suspense and a story that should remain an instant classic. The ending with little ambiguity leaves the story open for a sequel. Seeing a movie with great quality truly describes Chapa's serious potential and skill as a writer, actor, director and filmmaker. Plate has impressed many with his triumphant performance in "blood in blood and blood" and now he has proven to everyone who has seen his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed filmmaker with genuine artistic control. Something few filmmakers can afford.
