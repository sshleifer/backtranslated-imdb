Of the 600 or so Spaghetti Westerns did this have to be in the top twenty somewhere. I can not believe this has not received any comment! Gemma is excellent at it. Van Johnson is also good, although his voice is somewhat out of voice, but this is the charm of the Italian style. Beautiful photography and some excellently staged action. All supporting characters are well played. The severity of the racist tendency in the bad guys is very difficult even by today's standards, which creates an emotional depth to the character Gemmas in some of the situations that happen. Absolutely fantastic score by Luis Bacalov. See this is on the wonderful wide-screen DVD from Japan. A spaghetti must have.
