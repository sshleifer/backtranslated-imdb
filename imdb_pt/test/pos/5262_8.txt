An excellent comedy drama about the powers of friendship. Despite being a remake of a 1939 film of the same title, it would probably be compared to Sex And The City. I would not totally compare to that. The story begins with Mary (Meg Ryan), who looks like the life most women envy, she is well-married, has a good daughter, great friends and a great home. But Marys's perfect life is not what it seems when she discovers that her husband is cheating on her with Crystal (Eve Mendes) of Zach. Maria is confused and does not know what to do. But her four best friends, Sylvia (Annette Bening), Edie (Debra Messing) and Alex (Jada Pickett Smith) try to be there for her in any way they can. I really do not want to give anything more. But I found it nice, and I'm a man. Meg Ryan is great, it's good to see her on the screen again, after a series of failures. And the rest of the cast is also great, including Eve Mendes as Crystal. Just a cheerful and enjoyable comedy.
