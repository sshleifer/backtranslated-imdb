This movie would have embarrassed the typical "whiners" of Hollywood. The emotions portrayed are subjugated and underestimated in a very comfortable way. The plot is clich√© enough with a leading role having terminal illness (this is not a spoiler and was well established quite early in the movie) The method of execution is somehow unique to most of the love stories you have ever seen - not even one kiss was being exchanged and yet you will feel the huge current of love between the two clues. Initially, I assumed that this "restraint of emotions" was something analogous to typical "Eastern values", but then I decided against it. <br /> <br /> This film is so discreet that if you compare it to films like "Cinema Paradiso", CP would have felt manifestly manipulative in comparison. So, definitely not the cup of tea at all. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I have the strong impression that Hollywood loves movies, (or love movies everywhere, to be exact) has glorified the romance or passion and label it as "love ". I'm sure we all have our own definitions and I would not say that these qualities are mutually exclusive. But, I would venture to say that the movie will let you wonder if there is any additional dimension that you have with you, that you loved one. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that I really like this movie. Considering the fact that the film is so simple in appearance, it is paradoxically one of the most "cinematic" films I have seen lately.
