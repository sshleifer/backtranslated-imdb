I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was released and it looked pretty cool. I've never had a chance to see this. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I thought I should watch it. After all I loved "Silence of the Lambs" and "Se7en", and if you liked those movies, you can have fun with "The Cell". The concept of the whole story is very interesting. Going physically to the mind of a murderer, I can not imagine the world in which they live. The acting is actually pretty decent. Jennifer Lopez is the only one I have to say that was not great, but she does a credible job. I would recommend for a scary suspense. <br /> <br /> 7/10
