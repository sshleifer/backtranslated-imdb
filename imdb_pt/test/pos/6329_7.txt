Bergman and the comedy do not go well together. Some of your comedies are so na√Øve that you almost shudder. This movie has a strange naff moment - the last 30 seconds are the nadir, but overall it's a lovely (not funny) piece, enjoyable everywhere. Bergman conjures up several of his usual well-performing suspects. There is a big scene on the train between David, Marianne and a rude salesman who will stay in the memory. Part of the wedding stuff is the typical and cynical Bergman, but this is Bergman in a way that is lighter than somber. <br /> <br /> This movie has its moments and is worth the 90 minutes. Not one of their classics and not the place to start if you want to fall in love with Bergman.
