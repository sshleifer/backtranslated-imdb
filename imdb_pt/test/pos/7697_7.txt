It seems to have been made as a vehicle for W.C. Campos and Carol Dempster and they dominate it. Campos already has his well-developed movie character. Carol Dempster seems to dance through the film and her performance reminds me of Mary Pickford, who also worked long in D.W. Griffith Typical of Griffith's later films technically. <br /> <br /> Later rephrased as Poppy (the original title) with Fields in the same role.
