I saw this at a test show in Chatsworth a week ago, and went with a bunch of my friends. We all really loved it very much. James Franco is amazing and so hot, I would just see to it !!!!!!! but Sienna Miller is also very good and plays a southern girl who is so in love with him that he can not let go. David Caradine who was in Kill Bill plays a cowboy and he's perfect for that. The story is kind of weird, but if you believe in the power of love and magic, you'll love it! It's really original, and it's also very funny and everyone laughed a lot, but in the end it gets more serious and we all end up crying. I will see you again with my friends as soon as you leave, it's very good !!!!!!!
