There are not many TV shows that appeal to so many different types of fans like Farscape ... I know young and 30 to 40 year old male and female fans in as many different countries as you can imagine wishing this TV miniseries. It has elements that can be found in almost every other TV show, character-driven drama that could be from an Australian novel; yet in the same episode has science fact & fiction that would give even the toughest "Trekkie" a run for his money on the brainbender stakes! The Wormhole Theory, Time Travel in a truly equational way ... Magnificent. It covers cultures across the map because the possibilities are endless, with multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from. <br /> <br /> With such a wide scope; it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep the illusion going for long, but here is where "Farscape" really comes into its own element ... It succeeds where everyone else failed, especially the likes of Star Trek zero element of Kaos!) They ran out of ideas very quickly + they kept going over them! Over the course of 4 seasons, they are able to keep the audience's attention by using good continuity and steady evolution of characters, with multiple segments for each episode, with unique personal touches to the camera, specific to certain groups of characters within the whole. This structure allows for an extremely large area of ​​subject matter, as loyalties are forged and broken in many ways in many respects. I happened to see the pilot (Premiere) passing and just had to continue tuning after that to see if Crichton would "get the girl" after seeing them all on the television I was very happy to see them available on DVD and I have to admit it was the only thing that kept me sane while I had to do a night shift for 12 hours and develop chronic insomnia ... Farscape was the only thing that got me through those extremely long nights ... Do yourself a favor; Watch the pilot and see what I mean ... <br /> <br /> Farscape Comet
