First of all, before starting my review, I just read every review of 'The Muppet Movie' here and I can not believe anyone can give a negative review to a movie like that. (Fortunately there was only one). I mean, I can understand how someone might not like 'Star Wars' because of all the science fiction genre, but I do not like a movie starring some of the most lovable puppets in human history. is almost sad. <br /> <br /> Ok, I'm going to leave my stage now and review this movie. 'The Muppet Movie' came out when I was seven. All my friends wanted to see it as their birthday movie, so I think I've seen it four times in the first month in theaters. <br /> <br /> As a child, many things attracted me to this and to all others. Muppet movies and TV shows. The corner was probably the main one. Most of the songs in 'The Muppet Movie' are classic. From "Rainbow Connection" to "I'm Going to Go Back Someday," they're fun and thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I see 'The Muppet Movie' in almost a whole different lightweight. Yes, the things that thrilled me as a child are still there, but it's the little jokes and things that are just hilarious. <br /> <br /> I mean, when you think about it, Jim Henson is a sick man. <br /> <br /> Caco is a frog and is in love with a sweet pig wearing purple gloves and that karate can cut you into two pieces. Fozzie is a stand-up comedian bear. Gonzo is a "whatever" who is fond of chickens. So you have two old guys playing, a dog playing the piano, a rock band with a maniac drummer, a Swedish chef you can not understand and several other characters who are simply eccentric. <br /> <br /> However, for these reasons and more, Henson entertained millions of kids and adults, giving us something special to watch and remember him. "The Muppet Movie" will always remain in my heart for many reasons, but I think the biggest of them is because it's a movie, unlike many recent children's movies, which I feel comfortable having my movies. children watch. Also, I do not get bored with jokes that are stupid to my children's level. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie that is sure to be remembered forever.
