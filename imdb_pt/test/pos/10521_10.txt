Another that escaped the radar of almost everyone. This little pearl produced by B is so full of new ideas in an old genre and so absolutely refreshing and inventive that a terrible feeling about the lack of cojones in today's cinema slowly surpasses your body. The final piece is so innovative in its setting and style that prefigures everyone, from Tarantino to John Woo. Oh, and if you think "lines that are dying" are all clich√©, wait for the FF death line. A piece of dialogue that could have torn you with laughter will take your heart. A real treat. Search and see. You will not regret.
