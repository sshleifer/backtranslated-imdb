Less Than Zero could have been the movie of the 80's that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form if they actually joined the damn book. But where they did not, this movie presents the work, and leaves you with the most chilling feeling when it's all over in ways that are not done until the late 1990's with Larry Clark's' Kids' and ' Bully '. <br /> <br /> Marginalized teenagers in society face a curious dilemma (they do not treat him much like one) when their distant friend (Daniel Roebuck) boasts that he has killed a teenager near the river's edge. in his suburban city. Keanu Reeves may be the only civilized character among the group, the only one willing to display any kind of consciousness, anyway, while others do nothing about the girl's death or want to help her friend hide the body. <br /> <br /> I do not know who is sickest in this movie - Crispin Glover - who becomes almost obsessed and quite paternal in trying to protect his friend and hide the crime by smuggling him out of state. . Dennis Hopper, a drug dealer (who clings to a female doll) who befriends teenagers (as a drug dealer, of course) and suddenly becomes involved in events. Or, Josh Miller, who plays Reeve's younger brother Tim. He seems to be the most apathetic of all, at least until his emotional breakdown in the end. It's definitely not the teenage 80's fare, obviously. And it certainly makes clear the serious distancing with which these kids deal (despite a bizarre series of events) thanks to many great performances around the world (even Reeves proved some acting ability). <br /> <br /> Help yourself to a comedy to recover if you sway too strong.
