A refreshing interview with the legendary Italian director-producer-director who passed away in 1999 with about 200 credits in his directorial resume. A large part is spent on D'Amato's softcore sex movies, including her notorious EMANUELLE entries with Laura Gemser. They also briefly cover his porn career, which has kept him afloat during his last decade. More interesting to me is the section focusing on your horror and action efforts. D'Amato has many anecdotes about actors and his low-budget film production, including a story about an assistant accidentally collecting real bones among the fake while shooting a 2,000-year-old catacomb. Other respondents include George Eastman and Al Cliver. I would have liked a little more talk about your productions on Stateside Filmirage (not a single question about TROLL 2; it was not the cult movie it was now).
