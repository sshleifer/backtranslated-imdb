HOT. not for those who want hardcore porn. Instead, this film is a forerunner of many 1980s cult classic / fraternity films like REVENGE OF THE LERDS and PORKY'S and a post-cursor for the world-renowned ANIMAL HOUSE. A good time if you enjoy a bunch of 70 and 80 year old girls, like Playboy, and a shocking comedy - but nothing very remarkable if you want to use it as a raw material ... <br /> < > HOTS is an "unauthorized" brotherhood of sexy margins struggling with the popular and modern Pi girls. This one has jokes, a guardian of Auntie Jemima's house, and even an overheated robot that makes it relatively fun to see if your breasts are your "thing" ... Well ... I like Takes so much (or probably more. ..) like the next guy - but with all the scumbags I've seen, I could not help but crave some hardcore scenes to make this really worthwhile. I knew this would not happen, but I still wish H.O.T.S. had a little more sex and a little less cheeze. Not as notable as NERDS, PORKY'S, or ANIMAL HOUSE, but it's worth looking at the fans of these types of movies ... 7/10 PS .. and I forgot - this has consummated douche - agry Danny Bonaduce probably in the best role of his career out of his "reality show" ...
