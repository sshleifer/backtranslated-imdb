When I read the synopsis of "Messiah" in the television guide, I was not prepared for what was reserved. The story follows DCI Metcalfe trying to solve a case of terrible murders being withdrawn in London. He soon notices a pattern, there is a serial killer on the loose, killing people with names and jobs similar to those of the 12 apostles and their deaths are identical to the corresponding apostle. The two-part series kept me on the tip of my seat, with Metcalfe chasing after the killer but always missing him in a few seconds and discovering the terrible mess he'd left behind his ill-fated victim. "Messiah" will certainly cause a lot of controversy, but it's still the biggest drama the BBC has shown in a long time.
