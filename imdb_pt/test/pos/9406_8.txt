This great TV movie told of the murder in 1975 of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut, by a nephew of Ethel Kennedy. Martha's "ghost" use to provide some of the details has been very effective and has added much heart to the story. Christopher Meloni seemed to capture Mark Fuhrman's personality very well. Furhman, who received very little publicity in the O.J. Simpson trial was certainly justified by his contribution to bringing the murderer to justice after about 27 years.
