After the highs of the darkplace, it was never conceivable that Holness and Adobye would be able to create something as good as garth marengi. However, I think that man for man in his own right is as good a show (in good episodes) as the dark place. I can not argue that 2 of the episodes really are that good, but the other 4 certainly make up for it. If I had to choose two great episodes, go to the Formula4 driver, Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and the great Garth Marengi. having a little understanding of the program is a real advantage, since Dean Learner makes many inner jokes, but even if you have not seen much Dean would recommend this, since some of the speeches he makes are cool, ie. Your argument with Def Lepord over their names. All in All is a great show that only loses the full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes.
