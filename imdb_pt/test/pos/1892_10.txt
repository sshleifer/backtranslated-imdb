I do not know what some people were thinking when they said that this movie was bad. It was great. Bruce Campbell's classic, yes, was low budget and the special effect showed that, but that's not what you see a Bruce movie for you to watch it for Bruce. Also Ted Rami was excellent. I found this movie hilarious and fun that I still crumble when I remember Bruce on that pink moped. Now I will admit that this movie is not for everyone, if you do not like B movies, you probably will not like this if you want big budget effects and the actors get away. But if you like taco pens and the science fiction wall, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Save the Baby King!
