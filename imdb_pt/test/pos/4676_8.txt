One of the advantages of my job is that when things are slow, I can watch the movie in our downstairs theater (I work in a small two-screen theater) in the cry room and still keep an eye on the concession. I've seen Italian probably 20 times, and I'm still not tired of it. The atmosphere reminds me of Ocean's Eleven, although the acting is not so good. Mark Wahlberg is fine, Charlize Theron attracts the boys, but Seth Green is AMAZING in this movie. I thought Edward Norton did a great job throwing a dirty bag, although a lot of people disagree. I also liked Mos Def as the explosives expert who is afraid of dogs. I highly recommend this movie, and I will continue to watch it whenever I can!
