Jimmy Wang Yu, an authentic Asian star, directed and wrote this film that I only saw in a dubbed videotape version. The widescreen form (Shaw Scope!) Has been lost and the original actor's voices are missing, but this is still good to watch. The story is the usual martial arts school that fights against the villains of Japan, with our young hero to win in the end, knocking on lots of assorted bandits. <br /> <br /> Combat improves as the movie unfolds. At the beginning of the film seems hard and monotonous, but then there is a big scene where Wang Yu fights hordes in a game of chance, then enters a snow scene and takes a few more villains with knives, sword and fists. This part is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Very good, but it would be interesting to see a widescreen version not dubbed, if there is one.
