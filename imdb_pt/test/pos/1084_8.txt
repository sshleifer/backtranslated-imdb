Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictional story around a police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agashe is a tough and hard cop, leading a crime squad that makes a name by killing dangerous criminals at staged police meetings rather than arresting them in prison. His loyal officers obey him without question, but a fault forms when one of his officers, Imtiaz, becomes frustrated with Sadhu's high-ranking status and is secretly competing with him for killings and criminal status. A new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and Imtiaz becomes angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead in his first case. More changes come in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of Sadhu's tactics and everyone gets caught up in domestic politics. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see such a well-directed action thriller coming from India. The camera work is great, the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds. The action, rhythm and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood, sweat and tears of a personal and close view and that events are based on reality, which is no doubt because we are told that is not at the beginning of the film, although it is likely that the director, Shimit Amin, has taken liberties with factual accounts. However, Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished film.
