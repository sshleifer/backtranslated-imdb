I watched my good part of the Bollywood movies growing up - you know that the typical drug dealer finds a girl, girl rejects boys, dakus (bandits) takes a girl, boy rescues girl killing hundreds of dhakus and they marry cheerfully (of course I omitted one hour of musical style numbers). Well entering Hari Om watch, I was expecting another typical Bollywood style film; however, to my delight, it turned out to be atypical and, in fact, quite comical. Hari Om of Bharatbala is what could be labeled as one of those Indian films, such as the ever popular South Asian hits like Monsoon Wedding, East Is East or Bend It Like Beckham. Being decent South Asian and having watched several classic Bollywood movies, there was a lot of humor and sub-dialogues that could be picked up that reminded me of the fun and charming side of Indian culture (eg the various Indo- pop songs that were actually remade by Nitin Soni or the spirited Indian slang that were used). Hari Om can be enjoyed by all South Asians, and is also fun for those who are not accustomed to Indian humor, since the characters and plots cater to all audiences. <br /> <br /> In a cocunutshell, the movie is auto-rickshaw driver (also known as 'four-wheeler' for those of you who traveled to India know) played by Vija Raaz (from Monsoon Wedding) who receives himself involved with a thug and ends up owing him some money. In order to avoid selling his four-wheeled 'Madhuri', he accidentally escapes with 'Madhuri' and a very charismatic and lovable French woman, Isa (Camille Natta), who is escaping from the boredom of her boyfriend Benoit (Jean Marie Lamour who was in the pool). Is the movie about your travel traveling through the beautiful landscape of Rajasthan? the land of love stories; through humor, you see the two main actors trying to figure out who they really are. <br /> <br /> What made the evening more memorable was having the director, executive producer, principal editor, and even Mrs.'s mother. Natta present in the screening. After talking to Bharatbala (who actually has a history of zoology) they discovered many interesting details of the film: having the film finished just 10 days before the Toronto International Film Festival and taking only 45 days to film, having only five actors in the film. movie. the play (the rest were all real actors the first time). Coming home I noticed two things in the movie - that there is always a human connection between any of us, despite our differences, and secondly, as the director put it, "Everyone has a love story." <br /> <br /> It's a must see for everyone!
