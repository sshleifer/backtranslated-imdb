It's a wonderful movie about people. Weird people. The characters in the film have a very tragic past, so everyone has their problems. His problems evolve in a way that makes the plot of the film very absurd; but that does not make the movie worse, only better, as it is filmed in a rather fanciful way, so nothing is real. This review may sound a little strange, but again, the film is not normal ... It's also a hilarious movie on many occasions. If you have not seen it yet, see. Appreciate!
