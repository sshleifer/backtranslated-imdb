I was glad that this movie did without the supposed depth of many pseudo-serious interracial films. race was an issue, yes, but it was also class ... and loyalty ... and honesty, etc. <br /> <br /> I also loved the idea that the love affair was not just expressed in the 'decorative' aspects of the appearance of both characters. it's not our divorce courts (on both sides of the Atlantic, I would say!) filled now with enough couples who thought "looking good. together.' Is it all that it takes to make a solid marriage? in any case, the tenderness and sensuality of both characters were thick enough to cut scenes of love that would have brought a rainbow to any dark day! in other words, a lightweight movie that is by no means light!
