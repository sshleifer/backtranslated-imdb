A great movie starring Mary Astor as an entrepreneur who works as a paper company, but when the owner has to sell for health reasons, she creates a scheme for employees to buy the company with an idiot. seller (Robert Ames) as the "front" even though she is the brain. <br /> <br /> Of course he becomes a big hit and she becomes his executive secretary, basically still running around and teaching him class. She loves the drug, but he never realizes how he tricks around with a series of bimbos. She is pursued by a married but separated man, Ricardo Cortez, who is not free. But when a society girl picks up Ames, everything goes to hell. <br /> <br /> Astor is simply wonderful as the overly intelligent woman who almost makes a big mistake after losing her man. Ames is good as the idiot (but what does he see in it?), And Cortez is good, but he does not have much to do. Kitty Kelly is good as her partner, Dolores. Charles Sellon is the original owner, Cather Dale Owen is the society cat, and Edna Murphy is funny as Daisy. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look.
