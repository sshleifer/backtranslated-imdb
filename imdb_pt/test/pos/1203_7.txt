(May contain spoilers) I feel disappointed with the criticism this movie gets. While it certainly is not perfect, it is much better than it deserves credit. The acting and the photography are excellent. Some of the musical numbers are great; including the title number, "Where Am I Going ?," "Easy to Be Hard," and "Black Boys / White Boys." Although I have not seen the musical stage, I think it obscures the judgment of many. This is not the musical you see in theaters. Do not try to compare them. The theatrical musical may have been sensational to watch, but it would never have the same effect on the film, so a plot had to be added. And the end that was added is incredible. The film left me feeling like I had really watched something important, unlike most of today's movies, which only satisfy on one level.
