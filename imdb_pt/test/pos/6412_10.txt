This film, one of the best I've seen, talks about incommunicability. It is plunging into a livid Taipei, spotted in cold colors, where the rain falls incessantly; a DAMP world. This shows us the story of two people living in this world, a man and a woman. a coincidence, or fate, connects their existences, but they are not able to open to one another with words. The characters are the mirror of our society's difficulty in relation to interpersonal relationships. An incommunicability that is pushed to extremes here. all the characters exchange only a few words during the film, the dialogues are almost absent, and when words are spoken, they are often weak and empty, far from describing people's true feelings. So the progression of the story, the revelation of the character's feelings is developed (brilliant idea!) By the seemingly meaningless musical tours that dot the film. The process of the sentimental event and the drama of the female protagonist lead us to a splendid, strongly symbolic end. A totally different movie from the usual, an intelligent realization of a director of great talent. PS. Forgive me for my bad grammar !!
