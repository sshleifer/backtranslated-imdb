After watching Oldboy, I was a bit disappointed with the rest of Park's work, some of that is fine, but it never comes close to the level of humor and originality Oldboy had. This is nothing like Oldboy in plot or style, but the same level of quality is there. <br /> <br /> The performance is good with Kang-ho Song, OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin delivering excellent performances. Kim, in particular, manages to trade the frightening scenes of terror for the surreal comedy without the slightest misstep. <br /> <br /> The plot is strange, with many twists and turns in the vampire cliches. <br /> The direction is spot on with tons of pace and humor along and some of the most memorable scenes I have ever seen. She has what is probably the strangest love scene you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie.
