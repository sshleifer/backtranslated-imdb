Very good for a French movie. I have not seen any of Catherine Breillat's previous films, and so I have no opinions on this compared to her previous work. French cinema generally sticks to the movies that have just been shown, and leaves shoot-em-ups and stars for Hollywood. This is probably a good business strategy, as the film industry of no other country will likely have the resources to compete in these types of projects. Films about filmmaking are often boring because it has little resonance for people who are not in the business. But it held my interest far more than I thought. Despite the title, (strangely in English) it's not really a comedy, despite a few funny moments. I've only seen a few of Anne Parillaud's films, but she shows a generous amount of talent and variety, from the psychological action / drama of "La Femme Nikita" to the ironic comedy "Innocent Blood." This film also extends her reach while she plays a more or less ordinary woman, but is still appealing on the screen. Kudos also to Roxane Mesquida, whom I was not familiar with. She plays a very unimpressive actress for most of the film, whose talent is drawn at the end. If you do not have to have car chases and blasts to have fun, check this out.
