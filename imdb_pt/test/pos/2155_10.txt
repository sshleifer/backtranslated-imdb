Sony Pictures Classics, I'm looking for you! Sony has the rights to Harry's albums - you need to distribute the movie and you'll get radically bigger sales from your catalog! Anyway, this is a great study of a fascinating musician, regrettably unknown, full of great stories, bigger music, and could have been 3 hours longer and I would have loved even more. I watched the American Cinematheque Festival Mods & Rockers at the Aero Theater in Santa Monica, where he played in a crowded house. They were pushing people out the door! I've been to many of the Mods & Rockers festival films, and let me assure you that no other movie has come close to selling, let alone pushing people away. Watch the movies, buy the DVD and make sure a company that is taking too long [* cough SONY cough *] get it as fast as possible!
