This movie is about a teenager who is struggling with his social status in school. He is a "good Christian" and feels he is missing all the fun in high school. So he wishes he had never become one. After getting his wish and trying a mundane lifestyle, he realizes that his quality of life has been dramatically diminished and wants to go back to being the person he was. Good family-oriented film with a positive message of being proud of who you are, even if you are not the most popular.
