The excellent storyline makes this movie one of the classic cult ninja movies of all time. The plot is that the soul of this woman is possessed by a ninja spirit of evil. I want to be honest if I could get ninja skill through the tenure I would do. Also, being in the 80's and such the fact that the ninja aspect was much bigger in this particular decade is evident and despite all that, Ninja 3 The Domination manages to keep it original from the American Ninja cut molds that plagued the the 80s for so long. This girl is definitely Michael Dudikoff on steroids .... I mean, the first American ninja was great but let's get real people who have nothing in Ninja 3
