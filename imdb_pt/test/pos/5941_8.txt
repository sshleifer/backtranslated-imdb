Of course, there are some scenes in this movie that seem a bit unrealistic. The rapturous woman first panics and then, just a few minutes later, she begins to kiss the young man while the old man is right next to her. But as the movie progresses, we learn that she is a girl who is a bit volatile (or vagabond) and that partly explains her behavior. The cinematography of this film is well made. We get to see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective, and some of these images and scenes actually increase the tension. GÃ¶tz George plays his character well, an aspiring to be aged and dominated by young men like the character Jaennicke. Wolfgang Kieling, who I admired in Hitchcock's TORN CURTAIN, offers a great performance that, despite not saying much, is by far the best actor in this play. One critic complained about how unrealistic the film was and that, in a real case of emergency, nothing really would happen. But again, how realistic are movies like Mission Impossible or Phone Booth. Given the fact that we are talking about a movie here, and that in a movie you always have to deal with some scenes that are not very likely to happen in real life, you can still enjoy this movie. It's a lot better than many things I see on German TV today and I think the vintage style of the 80s added something to that movie.
