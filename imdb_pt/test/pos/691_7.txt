If you are in the midst of a fierce war and it is still not clear that you will come out on top among the things you will be worrying about is keeping the morale of civilians ... to demonstrate that our troops have the bravery, the dedication to overcome all odds in a noble cause. And that is exactly what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with the 1943 naval war film We Dive at Dawn. After more than 60 years, it is not surprising that part of the film is dated. It does not help that class stereotypes that help define enlisted men of officers can be shocking. Here, as in so many other British war films, men invariably have a thick regional working-class accent, while officers speak with an educated fluency that would put them at home in the best leading-class establishments in England. In this movie, Freddie Taylor (John Mills), the captain of the Sea Tiger submarine, is smart, confident, resourceful, aggressive, in control, good with his men, humorous with his colleagues, quick to make a decision. And that helps him get lucky. His men are jolly tars, for the most part, competent in their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense. Although we spend the first third of the film getting to know these people while on leave, things get tense quickly. <br /> <br /> Taylor and his sub are condemned to destroy the Brandenburg, a new German warship. They simply miss the ship when they enter the Kiel Canal and enter the Baltic. Taylor assesses the risks and decides Sea Tiger will follow him through minefields, anti-subnetting networks and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to his base. After several tense situations, the confrontation happens. The Sea Tiger releases six torpedoes, but has to dive, not knowing if he did his job. After a clever subterfuge, Taylor tricks some German destroyers, but realizes that there is not enough fuel. He plans to sink his submarine and surrender when, at the last moment, James Hobson (Eric Portman), a sailor who was grumpy and lonely and speaks German, says there is a small Danish coastal village that had been a fuel. deposit. He thinks it might still be for the Germans. The last third of the film is an exciting sequel to the film while the sub-lieutenant's crew tries to hold the Germans long enough to pump enough fuel to take the Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a propaganda movie about war, so do not expect failure. And the Sea Tiger really knocked the Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and girlfriends? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and young son who left him smiling for the first time? Did Freddie Taylor finally get a chance to make use of all the female names in her little black book? You will have to see the movie. <br /> <br /> There are propaganda war films and there are propaganda war films. Some, such as Powell and Pressburg, of one of our planes, and the 49th Parallel, still stand today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators did not use obvious cliches of shorthand. Others, like We Dive at Dawn, were made with enough cliches that when we watch, we have to remember how terrible the moment the movie was made. Still, Asquith can create a lot of suspense even with a few cliches. The sea tiger forcing its way through a subnet was tense. The pursuit of Brandenburg and the conspiracy necessary for the firing of the torpedo were realistic; John Mill's sensible demeanor as he prepared to strike was well dealt with. Preparations to make the Sea Tiger appear to have been destroyed by depth charges were as realistic, on and off the submarine as you might expect, and the battle over the fuel tank was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war movie, but it is a well-done and well-exemplified example of its kind and timing. <br /> <br /> John Mills, worth noting, had a long and long career. Especially in the fifties, he played in a series of serious movies looking at those days of World War II. He had the ability to show courage, joy and perseverance, but also to be trustworthy, a man whom England could be proud of while fighting in the war. The highest rated film was Eric Portman, a great actor with a unique voice and the ability to give looks so cold that you would like to put on a sweater. Everyone in the sub is very much in play mode, but stiff-upper-lip, but Portman manages some complexity for his character. Mills and Portman did great work working together on this film.
