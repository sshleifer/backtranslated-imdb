Kramer vs. Kramer is an almost cheery drama about the shocking and drastic additions of the two guys from a failed couple. Meryl Streep, amidst her trademark maternal sensitivity, plays an unhappy mother who feels confined to such a role and in the first five minutes of the film leaves her husband inattentive, in a fantastic performance by Dustin Hoffman, to find another role for himself it. Hoffman is stunned, having absolutely no idea what to do with himself, having taken so much for granted that he does not know the first thing about taking his son to school in the morning. <br /> <br /> Hoffman perfectly characterizes this husband as such a burden of setbacks. He is restless, implacable and impatient, but even if the positive side of these three adjectives should include just the opposite, he is tirelessly fixed on everything he seeks. He has focused on his career in advertising, and when he is left to raise his son Billy alone, the chaos enters immediately. He is the only one who makes temper tantrums and stops in the middle of an activity. After a while, as he befriends his neighbor and former friend of Joanna, played by the sexy Jane Alexander, Hoffman cools his jets long enough to understand why his wife left. Meanwhile, his unlimited energy redirects to Billy's creation and he loses his job. <br /> <br /> The battle for custody of the title is a brilliantly gray circumstance. Even if the ending is a bit unmotivated, subjective to the audience, the last line and the last scene still have that witty touch of writing on the screen that seemed to subside after the magic 70s.
