Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 founding masters of Japanese cinema, the other two being Ozu and Mizoguchi. This is an interesting and honest movie about the life of the retired geisha. Whatever happens, when that woman grows old and loses her charm and mystique? Well, for those who are interested, watch this movie. One: Okin, is successful as a money lender, but the other two have to borrow from her and resent. Okin has no children, but the other has children. Okin discovers that his old love is coming to visit her and is excited. Naruse is a master at subtle studies of the characters of his female protagonists. Bangiku finally attracts the viewer to the study of the issues of happiness and life value. Pretty good movie, actually.
