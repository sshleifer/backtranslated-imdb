Truly original and stunning film by Jules Verne's "For The Flag" by Czech master director Karel Zeman. Although the story is enacted in a rather discreet late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore, Bennet and Riou illustrating these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies. Photographed in black and white, the animation is of the highest order and not the Saturday morning variety. There are underwater sequences where the fish that swim are drawn with such precision that they can be used in a field guide. There are pictures of ships, submarines, flying ships, castles and machines that are designed with such precise details that you need to have a freeze. frame on your VCR or DVD to pause the scene and study the remarkable details that went into this production. The late Victorian atmosphere is designed to look like this world that has never been and delight us with the magic of science that made Verne the great father of the genre. If that is not enough, there is also the movie soundtrack that is probably one of the best ever created for a fantasy or science fiction movie. Truly a forgotten classic, it's worth hunting and buying. Always one of my favorite movies of all time, it sure will be one of yours as well. And remember - this was done decades before CGI or computer animation. Many compliments to the great artists who have obviously put their heart into it. It shows. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this film. A movie that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it love it and value it. A remarkable achievement, this remarkable movie only gets better every time you watch. A true cinematic masterpiece by a visionary director.
