This DVD usually sells for about $ 20. I would not pay much for the DVD if I knew what I was getting, but regardless, this is a great record. He displays Knot in all its glory, with footage from his shows ... playing Surfacing, Wait and Bleed and Scissors among other tracks, including the "Spit it Out" video, which was apparently banned from MTV. Slipknot, for those who do not know, is essentially a symphony of the condemned: nine masked men who display total chaos on stage, with machine-gun drums, guitar shrieks, and vocals that will rip their faces off and leave You want more. For those who have never seen Slipknot before, I can not recommend it enough for you to get this DVD ... probably off of eBay or Amazon so you can make a good deal. <br /> <br /> A short show, though well done, of the knot. <br /> <br /> Seven in ten.
