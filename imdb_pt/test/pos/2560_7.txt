Better than I expected from a movie selling itself under the premise of nymphomania and interracial slavery. The music is great, and cinematography focuses a lot on turning Ricci into a Betty Paige trailer and it works. Samuel L. starts to scream a lot, which he is good as well as playing a lot of blues guitar, which he seems cool doing. Even Justin Timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend. I have the impression that this material under anyone else would have been complete, but instead I was only able to create its own transgressive pulp niche, still being an effective drama.
