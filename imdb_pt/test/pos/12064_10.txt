I'm from the US I'm from Central Europe and I think the show is incredibly good. Can easily be compared to married with ... children. My title says it's not a show for a conservative audience. I mean, I'm not that liberal, but it might be a slight difference between European conservatism and the US cons. Anyway, the show is starting to be very popular in our area and it's very bad that it only contains two seasons. Last episode opens many continuous and funny moments. Anyway, I and many people would be happy if this continued to play. The last thing I'm excited about is some very nice moral education packed in funny scenes. I mean, I have seen many comedies that have more than two and even more minutes of very sad in tragic scenes that absolutely do not fit the comedy. War does not contain something like that and is meant to laugh. It's like the Simpsons and the married, who also have no sad or even bland moments. I'm apologizing for my terrible knowledge of English, but I still hope you understand what I mean.
