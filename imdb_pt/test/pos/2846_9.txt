I just saw a very original movie that I recommend to everyone, including "the young and restless." However, I find that some of the swearing, violence and sexual innuendo in the film are not suitable for "all your children." Anyway, before the sand fills the hourglass, let me tell the name of the movie: "Nurse Betty". Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She's a Kansas waitress who falls into a trance and thinks she's a real-life character in her favorite novel. Because of this, she makes a trip to Los Angeles to meet up with her supposed novel lover, Dr. Rubell. To add fuel to the fire, she is also being pursued by some cruel 'one life to not live' who think she stole her drugs. You could say that this is how Nurse Betty spends "the days of her life" throughout the movie. This very "unimportant" situation ends up leading her to the "hospital" set of her beloved novel. However, the only problem is that Betty thinks this is all real. It's as if her mind were in another world. It's ok! Enough! I clean my mouth with soap and I do not mention any other soap names. I have already registered my vote for Renee as best actress for Oscar. In addition, Greg Kinnear's performance as Dr. Rubell was as good as he gets in his acting biography. To summarize, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call "Nurse Betty". ***** Great
