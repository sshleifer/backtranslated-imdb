This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I've been on the water since I was 13, so I have a lot of humor and I also recognize many of the landscapes close to Earth (the film, though happening around Virginia, was filmed around the San Francisco Bay), most notably the naphthalene east of Benicia Bridge, where Kelsey Grammar's character was first introduced to the USS Stingray, and the San Francisco Pier at the end of the film (including a boat I worked on). As other people have said, the actors seemed to have fun making this movie, as well as making it fun. The line "We're getting to the bottom, sir! I can hear two lobsters vomiting" is, at least to me, priceless. <br /> <br /> I am one of the many people who are eagerly waiting for a letterboxed DVD from Down Periscope to be introduced.
