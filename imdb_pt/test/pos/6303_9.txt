Le triunenze dell'amore (2004) is a beautifully made film that takes small steps carefully positioned towards its end, which need to be savored to be enjoyed. From the contrasting landscapes to the closed world that the hero inhabits, we are taken by the director and controlled from the moment we enter the hotel. We, like the hero, will never escape the stifling intensity and paradoxical monotony of his mobster world of criminals. That the film resists the Mafia stereotypes while delighting in them, makes everything even more successful. The concrete tomb, the inevitable brutal executions, and overwhelming manhood are exposed and exposed for what they are. Just brutality and business, not more. Life is about being part of the corporate machine that is organized crime and not about love or living for yourself, family or others. Our hero is indeed a hero, for he gives up his life by the touch of the beautiful waitress, the resolution of the misery suffered by his only neighbors in the hotel and to escape his decorative prison. The consequences of love are indeed beautiful and brutal at the same time. Look!!
