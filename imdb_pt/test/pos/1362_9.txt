I liked it a lot, but I have friends who hated it. There is no sex, but there is very little nudity in any of the episodes - which is a good thing. In addition, Keitaro has a bathroom fixture that is explored in at least half of the episodes. (Bathrooms are much more advanced in Japan.) Hmm, I'm wondering why I rated it that high ...? Certainly not that I like naked girls. In a way, Keitaro Oe (the main character) is analogous to Johnny Bravo, except that instead of being an obnoxious and muscular athlete, Keitaro is a hyperactive nerd. Or you can think of it as Japan's answer to Larry's Leisure Suit. It's easier to pick up if you watch the caption instead of being dubbed, but it grows on you anyway if you give it a chance. He's Goldenboy. <br /> <br /> The formula is the same for each episode. Boy meets girl, boy tries to win the heart of a girl despite being an idiot pervert, the boy somehow succeeds against all odds. Typically, the girl does not realize that she likes Keitaro until he is beaten and / or has done something spectacular like creating a modern operating system in a week or winning a race against a gasoline powered bike. Episode # 1 features a rich software tycoon. I think animating her breasts has a big budget impact because she's the only woman who has this kind of animation. She also dresses completely unprofessional. Most people who evaluate this negatively probably never went beyond the first episode. <br /> <br /> Episode # 2 has the rich young daughter who likes to tease. She's only 16, but that's the legal age in Japan (and in some US states, I might add). His father is also a brutal type of yakuzza who has a reputation for killing people interested in his daughter. <br /> <br /> Girl # 3 is the sweet innocent daughter of a noodle shop owner who is mingled with a bad boyfriend. In addition to Keitaro running interference to the maiden and being kissed by a guy, there is almost no ecchi of any kind in this episode - a sharp drop from the previous two. However, Keitaro and the evil boyfriend actually hit each other. <br /> <br /> Episode # 4 has Keitaro trying to impress a top swimming coach. Keitaro seems more "straightforward" about his intentions with this particular girl than with any other ... and she's pretty straightforward in return ... Girl # 5 is the biker's cat. She is probably the heaviest of the 6 (though not super-buoyant as the # 1 girl) and 'racially' in terms of sexuality and vulgarity. This particular episode is easily overstated in terms of (lack of) realism. Keitaro should have broken all the bones of his body at least twice during the race against the rider, but I think the producers and writers said, "It's just a drawing! We can do anything!" This lapse of realism makes him a fan favorite. <br /> <br /> Finally, episode # 6 features a new girl (who works in animation) and the 5 previous girls help Keitaro as he tries to deal with impossible time and resources. restrictions to get an OAV out of port on time. In terms of ecchi, this is also very tame, but there is a lot of humor. The finale has all 5 extremely beautiful girls from the past team to hunt Keitaro, who escapes unnoticed, ostensibly with the intention of raping him in a group. Yes, this - ALMOST - happens in real life. Someone crossed Ukyo Tachibana (ala Samurai Shodown) with Steve Urkel (Family Matters wing) ... All in all, there is no middle ground for that. You will hate or love. If you're new to anime, you probably do not want to start with that. At the same time, if you can support characters like Happosai (from Ranma 1/2) or Johnny Bravo ... or you like comedies that lean more heavily for nonsense, but that have very sexual tones, you should try.
