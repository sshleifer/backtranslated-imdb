I think this movie has it all. There are really cool songs I can never get out of my head. There are cool characters. It's really funny (you know, the kind you're going to break on the floor and you'll keep telling the funny parts every day for three weeks). Despite the bad acting, bad cgi, and bad story (about cops going after a robot), it's pretty cool. It's one of those movies that you and your whole family can watch, get together, eat pizza, laugh like crazy and watch two more times. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny parts, like when Kurt was trying to get Edison's attention and give him his finger, and then threw an inkball gun at him so they could play paintball. In that part, I kept saying "Remember, Remember?" For my cousins ​​who saw and showed what happened. There was also a very funny part when Edision ran into the room and Kurt was there (shortly before they fought) and Kurt was talking about his "strange dream" and how he was "Superman." I loved that part, although it's been a while since I've seen it, so I do not remember that part. Everything the actors said was funny, as Kurt says: "I adore you, like a God!" to the robot. <br /> <br /> Although there have been some bad things, in all it was a great movie. Dude, I can not stop laughing. I wanted to have this movie. );
