How is the bear paw, the elephant trunk, or the monkey brain for dinner? Let Tsui Hark tell you in this wonderful and cheerful comedy about the art of cooking the traditional (?) Chinese way. <br /> <br /> This movie shares the common structure of an American sports movie, but instead focuses on baseball centering around cooking which makes it even more interesting. I even think the character of Leslie Cheung looks a lot like Charlie Sheen in the Major League ... This movie also contains a bit of Zhao Wen Zhao x Xin Xin Xin fighting (loving to see more of this later The Blade) and a funny joke about a pop song Leon Lai ... <br /> <br /> Maybe it's not the ideal movie for the strict vegetarian.
