The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an anime that left a good impression on me. Partly for the characters, many of whom fit fantasy stereotypes / anime sci-fi, but putting those stereotypes in the rather mundane environment of high school is a twist that I enjoyed. Then there's the insane title character that's something else: a stubborn, almost amoral girl with a ridiculous amount of talent and a secret she does not know. <br /> <br /> The set-up for the series is a bit of a mental journey. Essentially, Suzumiya, unknown to herself, is a kind of superpower, capable of divine deeds of creation and destruction, how she can destroy and rebuild reality at her whim. Our narrator and main character is Kyon, a schoolboy whose sympathy / curiosity for Haruhi seems to lead her to drag him, against her will, to a club she's starting to spice up her life, because she's bored with normal life. In pursuit of adventure, she claims three more unusual members, each with secrets and all of them end up being dragged into their crazy schemes. <br /> <br /> There is a crazy but pleasant philosophical consideration, from early debating whether the world is merely the creation of Haruhi, for she gets bored with the old and whether our characters exist to serve her or serve her to continue to exist or could exist without it. It's a riddle, but a pleasure anyway. Although science fiction / fantasy scenarios occasionally occur in the series, I think the joy of the series lies in how things are normal, while this tension remains in knowing that if things are too boring, Haruhi can destroy the world in the hope of becoming -The most interesting. <br /> <br /> The art is clean and in line with what I expect from the anime that is normally imported into the US; I like the design of the characters and although there is not much action in the series, I think it looks better this way. The series is narrated from the mind of Kyon and he does not interpret an omniscient narrator, but only comments on what he knows and what he feels. He has a lot going on in his head, but he does not say much, so it's good that we listen. <br /> <br /> English dubbing is acceptable enough, but I prefer the Japanese acting on it. There are some strange aspects to the series, some of which are parodies and trades in fanboy-ism, which I found amusing. For the first season, I have to admit that there is a lack of closure, since the series does not really have a larger story arc, but it seems to take things one at a time, so it's an easy series to pick up and drop. , though I find that, because of its rather amusing qualities, it is still very difficult to quit. It is also based on a series of light novels and the author was directly involved in writing the series. <br /> <br /> Even though it's based on the novels, I still wish the series along had stronger story arcs, but I love the way we naturally watch these characters develop and how well the series can play the moments of silence, as well as the craziest. Seeing Haruhi's cultivating was a real treat, as well as observing the relations between the SOS Brigade (Haruhi's club). <br /> <br /> It is not for everyone because of its premise of twisting the mind and "extraordinary beings." in a mundane world. "It's probably not going to quench fanboys who are into action / science fiction / fantasy and may be a bit out of date for drama lovers more relationship-oriented but for those unwilling to try something a little different , or something oddly peculiar series such as this, I think the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a rather refreshing series unique and enjoyable.
