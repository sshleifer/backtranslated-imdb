It's great to see a movie starring children whose idea of ​​"acting like an adult" is not engaging in sensuality. Instead, these children see a problem in their community and take responsibility for helping to solve it. Hoot is a film directed directly to families looking for a day of fun in the movies. Production figures are good, especially the panoramic views of Montana and Florida. The Jimmy Buffet soundtrack is perfect. The young actors are witty and refreshing. <br /> <br /> The plot, about a trio of children working together to save some dead-nosed owls from the hands of an unscrupulous empire builder, will involve the children. So many movies make kids seem powerless, it's good to see a movie that shows children working hard to make a difference. And even if the parents are absent or temporarily distracted, it has been nice to see children who want to follow in the footsteps of their parents and try to correct the injustices. <br /> <br /> If you are tired of all the self-indulgent story lines about kids filling the movie theater, give Hoot a try. Then take the time to talk to your children about the adventure of serving others and caring about the world in which they live. A positive message from a positive movie.
