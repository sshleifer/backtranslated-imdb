"Hoppity Goes to Town" was the second and last animated feature by Max and Dave Fleischer, who created a parallel universe for Disney. While the Disney movies are well remembered today, both Fleischer's films "Gulliver's Travels" and this are forgotten. <br /> <br /> "Hoppity" is a fascinating original, not an adaptation as the first photo. That is a great advantage, one might think. No, the critics, rarely on the side of the Fleischer, began to attack them for this. Yes, the story is not as tight as "Gulliver," but how can you hate a movie that exhibits itself so gaily? <br /> <br /> He's full of great musical numbers and a very engaging storyline that would be a crime to reveal. The characters are lovely and charming and there is heart in this movie. <br /> <br /> The Fleischers really excelled here and never did it again. Most of the time it would be dedicated to one of the launchers after that happened at the box office. It is a pity that they will not continue to make resources. Who knows? Their next attempt may have become the masterpiece they intended. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
