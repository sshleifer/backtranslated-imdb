This is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on TV. I own all 9 seasons on DVD and literally I have watched them over and over again. Anyone who does not find this show hilarious, emotive, funny and laughing hysterically, is crazy! Kevin James is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there. My boyfriend and I love to go to comedy shows in Boston (where we live) and have seen Kevin James twice and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny) once. Both are so incredibly talented and plan to be smart with their work. There are so many comedians out there who are terrible and Kevin and Gary really show the true side of true comedy. Leah Remini, despite being a real snob and bitch (so I read), is an incredible actress and deserves more credit than any other woman on sitcoms. She really does the show ... along with Jerry Stiller! This show is a must see and you will get hooked within one to two episodes!
