The philosophical and meditative tone of this film makes it unique. I would give 10 stars for this alone. That said, however, what impressed me with special strength was what I understand, possibly incorrectly, in being his Art Direction. Many of the internal sockets feature a rich blend of color blends, apparently based on very discrete progressions of the Munsell Color Model and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the film probably unrealistic for the contemporary eyes, but, for me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself. I think this film is genuinely unique to this quality and, if for no other reason, it gets a complete, thorough, and digital restoration. Fox, are you listening?
