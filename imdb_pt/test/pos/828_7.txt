It's great to see that the Van Damme movie is slowly improving lately, and especially compared to the "Derailed" and "Second in command" class C flops, which were both tragic and not well on the way. The Sheperd: Border Patrol is a good action movie with great action / fighting sequences. It's good to know that Van Damme still knows how to retaliate by seeing how his latest film "Hasta la Morte" had no martial art in it at all! <br /> <br /> That said, this movie is significantly inferior to "Until Death", which was really a good turnaround for Van Damme. "Until Death" did not have the exaggerated action of most of Van Damme's films, but it was somber and brave, and Van Damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film. Still, The Shepherd is definitely a movie worth checking out especially for Van Damme fans or just fans of action films in general, but if you're looking for a movie with a little more history ... you might want skip this one <br /> <br /> I believe this film was done well enough, especially in what little budget would have been filmed. The only real problem I have with this movie is the title; "The pastor"? I did not understand! I suppose "Border Patrol" just does not have the same ring for this without the word "Pastor" in front of it !!! <br /> <br /> My rating for this movie is 7 out of 10 but that's because of Van Damme movie standards not in any other movie category. <br /> <br /> It's good for a Van Damme movie.
