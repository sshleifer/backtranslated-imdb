Great 5 star performance makes this a must see. <br /> <br /> Based on a play, THE SILVER CORD is about "mother's love" at its worst. The film was very controversial because of its implicit homosexuality of the youngest son and the unnatural "romantic" feelings of the mother by both children. Irene Dunne stars as the new fiancee (and biologist) who travels with her husband (Joel McCrea) to visit family before leaving for New York for his new jobs. But something seems wrong. <br /> <br /> Mother, Laura Hope Crews, seems rude to the younger son's (Eric Linden) (Frances Dee) bride. But Dunne puts those thoughts aside and ignores some of the strange things his mother says. Then she discovers that "her" room is in McCrea's hallway, and her room is next to her mother's bedroom. <br /> <br /> Later, she enters when "Mommy" is hiding McCrea and kissing him (in her mouth) good night. Mom is also working on Linden and making him doubt his feelings for Dee. Everything explodes and with Dee running in the snowy night toward the frozen lake. As the boys chase after her, Mom shouts out the window for the boys to come back and get their coats! Dee falls on ice and is rescued. <br /> <br /> When the girls leave the house the next morning, Dunne lets her mother know what she thinks of her and her connection to the boys. But the mother has a strong grip, faking illness and always bragging about her sacrifices. The girls leave, but the boys are behind ....... The crews are magnificent as the voracious mother (repeating her role on stage); is a part that few actresses would dare touch. The sexual tones are incredible for a 1933 film and Crews enjoy their best role in the movies. Dunne is also excellent as he tries to steer the course without losing McCrea. Dee has some great scenes after she's abandoned by Linden Bewildered. All 5 stars are fantastic in this drama that is bizarrely underrated and unknown. <br /> <br /> A neglected jewel for those who enjoy great performance ......
