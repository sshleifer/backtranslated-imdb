For most of us, life is a process of unfolding love. For others like Soo-mi, however, it is dominated by darkness and fear. Based on the Korean folktale Jangha and Hongryun, Kim Ji-woon's brilliant gothic horror story A Tale of Two Sisters revolves around two sisters, Soo-mi (Lim Su-jeong) and Soo-yeon (Mun Geon -yeong), are part of a dysfunctional family living together in a chilling victorian-style mansion. Feeling alienated from the world, they cling to each other for survival with old Soo-mi, obsessively protecting young Soo-yeon from danger. For Soo-mi, however, not coming to terms with the circumstances surrounding his mother's death means mental illness and a mind at odds with reality. <br /> <br /> Although we may recognize basic items such as haunted houses with apparent apparitions, doors that open and close by themselves, a cruel and arrogant stepmother, and other events of high strangeness, A Tale of Two Sisters superbly explores psychological meanings deeper, including the inability to release inner demons and the desire for revenge. Soo-mi says, "Do you know what's really scary?" "You want to forget something." "Totally wipe it from your mind." "But you never can." "He can not leave, you see. like a ghost. " There is a timeline, but it is left for the viewer to unravel. The plot can not be summarized, just suggested and the movie makes us wonder if what is happening on the screen is objective or subjective. <br /> <br /> At the opening of the film, Soo-mi, an obviously troubled young woman, is being questioned by a doctor in a setting that looks like a mental institution. When the doctor asks her to describe what happened "on that day," the film returns when Soo-mi and Soo-Yeon return to the home of their father Moo-hyeon (Kim Kap-su) and stepmother Eun-joo (Yum Jung- ah). The stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant, but it is obvious that it is Soo-mi who is really suffering. As the girls try to readjust themselves, they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house, which can be a nightmare or a supernatural occurrence. <br /> Soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of his bed hovering over her. and pours black blood, a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into convulsions, a monster emerges between the legs of one of the sisters, people mysteriously disappear from the photographs and many other maniac schizophrenic devices to keep the spectator rocking on the edge of insanity. While we sense that much of the story is the projection of someone's mind, we do not know who and the film keeps us constantly challenged, at least until an important clue is offered in the second half of the movie. Filmed in low-light cinematography, The Tale of Two Sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that transcends all scares, and there are many. It is haunting you in more than one sense of the word and your images can look at you when you least expect it or want it. Although the film does not offer much to the weary traveler, it shows us where we can end if we choose darkness. In the words of a wise observer, "Guilt is never the answer - either blaming yourself or others. On the contrary, the answer lies in getting out of judgment - both yourself and others. cure. "
