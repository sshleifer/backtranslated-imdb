Mullholland Drive proves once again that David Lynch is the master of cinematic expression. At the screening last night, I witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema. The performances are amazing, the punctuation extensive and the photo hypnotizing. David's ability to weave the many elements of film into a unique and impressive cinematic experience is unparalleled. While watching Mullholland Drive, I could not help but realize that with David Lynch in this world, we are truly blessed. Film is blessed too, for in David Lynch's films we show that a man's vision can be realized with impressive results. We know that blockbusters are not the only way. We realize that a true cinematic artist has a chance in this world and that we are truly blessed.
