This is a harrowing movie, and it moves relentlessly. Yet it is absolutely unique among war films, in that it focuses exclusively on civilian experience, the loss of humanity that ordinary people suffer during the war. The two young married musicians undergo a slow process of degradation at the hands of both sides of a civil war. Totally stripped of sentimentality, the film offers a bleak view of the modern world, and I believe it is particularly recognizable by many Europeans. With bold and intense performances by Liv Ullmann (never better) and Max von Sydow (in the same way). For my money, the most indelible film Bergman ever made.
