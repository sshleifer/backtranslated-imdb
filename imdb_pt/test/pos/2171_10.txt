Most of the other reactions from subscribers to this service were very appropriate, although some felt that this was slow or ambiguous intrigued me. Instead of ambiguous, it was complex and multifaceted in its meanings. One can see this as anti-war, because of the opening and closing scenes, and the foolishness of feigned grandeur, how marvelous the men of chivalry looked as they prepared for the great burden on Eylau, contrasting with its horrible conclusion and disturbing. when we see the bloody uniforms, the dead boys, etc. - but mostly, I see the film as a moral man in an immoral society. In the end, Chabert chooses the retreat from the corrupt post-Napoleonic French world and opts for the simple pleasures provided by Derville (who is saved by his recognition of Chabert's basic decency and the morality of his choice of renunciation) - white bread, cheese, little wine and tobacco - on the riches he leaves for his wife, and dishonor her and society. In her case, we can see the film as feminist, in the position of the women of the time, in which the only weapons that Mme Chabert has are her charm, beauty, tricks and, ultimately, money.
