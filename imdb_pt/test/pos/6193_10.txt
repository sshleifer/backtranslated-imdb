a terrifyingly real drama, there's no other drama out there that scared the crap out of me like that, the characters are not the typical Islamic terrorist, you have a blue-eyed blond guy who's as dumb as he looks, he's a converted Muslim. A very respected business man, who pretends to be Jewish and a Frenchman who converted to Islam, but clearly took the word of the Koran to a whole new level. The plot hero is Darwyn, who is an undercover FBI agent who has infiltrated the terrorist cell, and has to do all sorts of horrible things to avoid being detected. The first episode is a small sample of what must be followed. Although it is about Islamic terrorists, the drama has a unique way of showing that not all Muslims are extremists, which is comforting to those concerned with racism, considering that half the terrorist cell is converted to Islam, makes you think that maybe they are to be afraid of. The most chilling drama I've ever seen. The reason is so creepy that you never know who your friends, your husband or your neighbors are. Terrorists can be anyone, anywhere, anytime.
