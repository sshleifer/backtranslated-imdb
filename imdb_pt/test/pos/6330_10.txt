Bergman is a director and writer of sublime comedy. This fact becomes apparent in "En lektion I kärlek", where the comic elements range from pure slapstick to deep but very emotional scenes. This film is the way to the later Bergman comedies "Sommarnattens leende" and "Kvinnodröm", all with Gunnar Björnstrand and Eva Dahlbeck. This is an excellent film to start your Bergman experience, sharply portraying the emotional problems of both young and old. Martin Bodin's cinematography is surprising, for example, at the picnic scene. In short, the film is a perfect example of a comedy of success, with a clarity of depth, even overcoming some of Bergman's own comedies.
