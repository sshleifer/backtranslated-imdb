Films of success on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good example. You can describe the great subject for the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an incredibly good job. The purpose of the film is to show humans, and even the world, from a non-human point of view. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into three parts: Creation, Paradise and the Golden Age. The images of each are in counterpoint to the narration. Although the text of "The Creation" (of the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial desert, the scene does not continue illustrating the myth. He lives in the waste and in various specimens of destruction (fire, smoke, wrecked vehicles). The images of 'Paradise' are anything but, and 'The Golden Age' is darkly comic? the highest culture is the strange musical act on the road. The Popol Vuh suggests that humanity is the central object of creation, but the film does everything to undo this notion. Its mythological framework has no reference in human historical time. There are no human characters to speak of. When a boy gets a dog in an extended shot, the initial suggestion is from the boy's point of view; in the end, it is much more of the dog. Likewise, the lizard is a stronger character than the human who introduces it, and the turtle's partner hardly seems human with its large fins. <br /> <br /> Animal stories and documentaries about nature always anthropomorphize, but Fata Morgana has none of that. Certainly the dunes look like a female body, but the simile cuts both sides. Presumably, only humans can easily distinguish between their creation and nature, and here planes and factories are presented alongside mountains, lakes and waterfalls. People and civilization are part of a wider natural landscape. <br /> <br /> In 1979, Herzog gave a new twist to the idea when he remade Nosferatu from the vampire's point of view.
