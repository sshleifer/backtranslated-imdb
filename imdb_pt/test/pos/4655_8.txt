A pretty little silly movie that you can love. <br /> <br /> Although it's kind of tacky and clich√©d at times, it still works and contributes to good fun. Five teams are involved in a hunt and fight with each other and their intelligence to win the all-night contest - just for the joy of "knowing yours is the best team". David Naughton's first film role, following Dr. Pepper's "Be a Pepper" commercials and before his great 1981 hit "American Werewolf in London." Also features Paul Ruebens in what I believe to be his first Pee Wee Herman-Esquire roll a year before he became known for it. And last but not least, Mr. Spin City himself and Alex Keaton himself, Michael J. Fox, get their first movie role here. Fans will remember Stephen Furst as Flounder at Animal House. Other than that, no names, but all the funny characters. <br /> <br /> Doubt has already arrived on DVD, but there are still some copies of VHS out there and you might even catch a late, late show. sometimes. If you do, it's worth your watch. You may hate it, but it can also become a quirky little movie that you come to love.
