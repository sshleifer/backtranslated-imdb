This movie was so warm. A true testament to the everyday highs and lows of real life actors. It was really a wonderful experience sharing the passion of the actor in the movie and respecting what must have been taken off the screen. This movie is a reminder for all to go there to dream! Never give up! Hurray for the Stand-in !!!
