I went through the highs. I went through the lows ... I cried, I laughed, I vomited my ever-loving guts. But through it all, I was healed. I have become a better person because I have passed through this experience of self-imposed degradation. It is not every day that we can say that we live the worst and come out on the other side with something resembling our whole and intact sanity. Friends ... neighbors, unite and be one now. Get out and find this movie and define your extravagances. Put it on top of the fireplace and kiss your Styrofoam box. Take it to bed. Take it with you when shopping or having blind meetings with strangers. They will appreciate you better for your sublime and singularly schizophrenic inclination in the movies. And then they will throw your drink of choice on your face (but you will have the last laugh). I ran to the governor with this little beauty in my belt (and so can you!). It is a pleasure that is worth having again and again.
