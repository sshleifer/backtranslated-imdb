Oz, is one of the most amazing and addictive TV experiences of all time. <br /> <br /> Having picked up parts of it on SBS, I was initially skeptical, however, having now finished Season 4, I unfortunately know that this brilliant show is coming to an end, (6 seasons), and yet I can not get enough of OZ. <br /> <br /> Want something that takes your senses and your stomach to the limit ... Oz fits the bill, hands down. <br /> <br /> This is not childish thing, people, it is violent, brutal and not beautiful. Well, it's an experimental unit inside a maximum security prison. Tom Fontana's jaguar is brilliant in all the right departments, the actors, the writing and direction. <br /> <br /> Oz from HBO The site is also highly recommended, for beginners, for information on this series. This was the first one hour show, produced by HBO, and proves what a masterpiece is and what others would follow. <br /> <br /> Thank you HBO
