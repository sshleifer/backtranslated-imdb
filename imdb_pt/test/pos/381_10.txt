Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock, it never ceases to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition of how revolutionary he was to the film industry. It is likely to be a sign of how Hitchcock was ahead of his time, always trying to push the envelope, and never following a movie made simply for the purpose of being entertaining but always with a deeper and more poignant motive in his mind. Strangers on a Train, one of Hitchcock's most underrated early hits, is a perfect example of these features - a fun and suspenseful story, even when seen more than 50 years later, yes, but so carefully and cleverly constructed that today it is a masterpiece in the film technique. Arguably one of the pioneering thrillers, Strangers on a Train may seem a bit dated in certain respects, but it holds back all the superbly worked tension as in 1951 (if perhaps slightly less shocking). The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting, as well as quick and careful editing, are what really make the film stand out, taking every ounce of tension possible and keeping the focus of the audience even in slower scenes. If there was any doubt about what a simply masterful Hitchcock filmmaker was, simply observing five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to deny such feelings; each shot is so carefully chosen and built, all serving to drive the plot ahead in a particularly innovative way. Unfortunately, there are certain moments in history that are abruptly out of place enough to take away our focus from the excellent cinematography and editing - Bruno being able to reach the bottom of a sewage grid is simply unbelievable, and the figure of an old stereotypical crawling under a wildly uncontrolled carousel provides unintended comic relief in what must be the most tense and engaging scene in the movie. These are only brief moments, but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film. <br /> <br /> But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the premise of the story. Since last-minute Hollywood movies run the risk of falling inescapably more and more into the clutter of the turgid cliché after the cliché, it's wonderfully refreshing to see a 50-year-old movie with a premise that really looks clever and original. Of course it is quite simple, but the concept of "swapping murders" is simply one that would not fly into movies of this day and age, which makes it even more fun to watch; The brilliant script of the movie keeps the action flowing at a fast pace, while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the time. One can not fail to note the deeper themes in which Hitchcock alludes, especially to the concept of "darkness in the heart of mankind", demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and excited by the prospect of murder, as well as Bruno's chivalrous attitude. toward death. Hitch also works in many moments of black humor (Bruno pops the balloon of a child with his cigarette is invaluable), and irony, making thrilling scenes in lively and relaxed environments, such as the iconic carnival scenes, to create an even stranger atmosphere . . This may be a thriller of suspense, yes, but ignoring the hidden brain below would simply be inexcusable. Bruno's antagonistic figure (interpreted as perverse by perfection by Robert Walker, unfortunately in his last film role, but easily stealing the film from his admittedly very talented castmates) is undoubtedly what makes Strangers on a train as memorable as the character is a marvel to see. Here we have a villain figure simply superbly crafted, all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming he looks. Instead of madly cackling and frustrating the hero at every possible moment, Bruno is a calm, controlled psychotic mess. He talks about murder in such an improvised tone, still retains a passionate glow in his eyes when discussing different fashions of killing people. Bruno seemed to represent the "Id", as Freud would say, the inner, darkest and most uninhibited aspects of humanity. He makes an interesting contrast to the figure of the hero, Guy Haines, and how he seems insipid and uninteresting, almost as if he wanted to show the prospect of evil being so much more interesting and attractive than constantly striving to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> However, despite this implied message, Hitch still twists our emotions enough that we twist for Guy every turn, and applaud every new obstacle he is forced to overcome. It is a testament to the talent of actor Farley Granger who, despite Robert Walker's villain easily steal the show, Granger's hero still seems friendly, still commanding our support even when he becomes a much less attractive character. Superb support is provided by Ruth Roman, who is able to overcome the cliché and be a more innovative and complex romantic figure of interest, Kasey Rogers giving an impressive performance as Guy's horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic wife, and Patricia Hitchcock, proving that she is much more talented than simply being "the director's daughter" would imply. The superb cast (headed by a simply wonderful Walker) really brings the film to life, adding far more merit to the film than simply the breathtaking stylistic of Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> In all, Strangers on a Train may still seem a bit old-fashioned to certain viewers, but it's still a shock to look modern and appealing to the contemporary audience, considering it was released half a century ago. Once again, Hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of tension and cinematic technique, and the film's surprisingly original and pleasing premise is worth seeing. Highly recommended for anyone wishing to have a brilliantly made but superbly fun cinematic experience! <br /> <br /> -9/10
