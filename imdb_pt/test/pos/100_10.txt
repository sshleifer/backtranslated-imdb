The best short I've ever seen. Some commentators suggest that it may have been expanded because of the density of insights it offers. There is irony in this commentary and little merit. The acting is all for Noonan and he carries his ungrateful character perfectly. I might have preferred the narrator to be less "recognizable", but gravitas lent is perfect. This is an abbreviation for those who read, for those whose "bar" is tall and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge opposing and bitter beauty advocates. A beautiful short film. FWIW: I was pleased with the reference to Picasso, since I once believed that Picasso was just another art prostitute with little talent; like, I suppose, most people-until the day I saw some drawings he did when he was twelve. Picasso was a more refined draftsman and a brilliant artist at this age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime. I immediately understood why he had to do the art by which he became known.
