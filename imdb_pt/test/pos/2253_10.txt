"Everything is Illuminated" is like seeing a beautiful piece of museum quality art. Absolutely floods the emotions across a very broad spectrum. Jonathan Safran Foer is played candidly by Elijah Wood. He is in search of his father's inheritance in Ukraine. His travels put him in touch with Alex, played very well and with extreme humor by Eugene Hutz. His grandfather is the most emotional link with this film and he is appropriately portrayed by Boris Leskin. If someone finds little humor in the human characters of this movie, then just turn to Mikke, a real dog named Sammy Davis Jr. by Alex and his grandfather. They also call it an "eye-catcher." The cinematography is spectacular. Colors are a very important part of the patchwork of the film. It's a film that is worth the time and the emotional investment.
