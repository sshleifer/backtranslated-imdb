The piece is cleverly constructed - start with the doorman, Rainbow - and let the audience see the background unfold through their eyes. The film follows the play with great fidelity, working, no doubt, on the simple premise that it could not be surpassed. Now play in a series of actors of superb character - and the result is a resounding triumph. Definitely a must see.
