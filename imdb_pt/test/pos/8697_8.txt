Absolute grabber of a movie, and given his age, years ahead of his time. I saw this for the first time in the week when my dad came home with a neighbor's TV that the guy threw in the trash. A tinker with all the electrical things, Dad had to work within two days. This was in July 1955 ... and then probably only the third house on the street to have television! Pretty much the first thing we saw on that grainy, shaky 12-inch screen was THIS movie. "It's very old, my dear," I remember my mother telling me! <br /> <br /> Almost 50 years later, and does not seem older - like the First World War in that respect! Terrible little fantasy about a London bus carrying thirteen passengers, who falls, killing one of them. So in flashback, we took these people's lives and what made them to be on that bus that day. Returning to the accident at the end of the film, the identity of the victim is revealed. , perhaps the inspiration behind the 1960 movie THE LIST OF ADRIAN MESSENGER. <br /> <br /> If you ever come across this little gem, I suggest you watch it!
