I watched this movie just because I did not want to leave my 9 yo and her friend in the theater alone. Honestly, I expected a good nap - but I was fascinated by the film. I recommend it to anyone who asks! Roy's mother was on one of my favorite TV shows of all time years ago, playing a siren (Maximum Bob). She was very cute in this movie. The three main characters were all excellent young actors. I also enjoyed seeing and listening to Jimmy Buffet. The movie itself was quite beautiful - showing a little of what makes Florida so wonderful. I'm glad I ended up going to this movie. And to think, I was disappointed that I could not get them to see "Stick It" - I think this was so much better!
