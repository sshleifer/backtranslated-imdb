I get really fed up with sitcoms; You feel like you always know what's coming, so stop being funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what's to come and it's funny out loud. I just bought the second set of the series (series 3 -4) and I'm amazed how much I like it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many invisible members of the crew) because the entertainment they provide is worth the wait. The gems that came from this series and the respect that the actors have achieved through it speak for themselves. Croft and Perry have created some pure gold, something that shines through Hi De Hi.
