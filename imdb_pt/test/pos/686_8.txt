This is a hilarious diamond in the rough. The acting and the plot are not so impressive, but the lines keep coming. That takes a lot of attention because it seems at first glance a bad movie, but it's so crazy that you can not help but have fun. The quick dialogue and quirky characters continue ... I especially liked Sharon, the Canuck in Shrooms, huh? However, what really stolen the show was Richard's younger brother, Andrew (Ira Heiden), his sharp crying was somehow captivating. The whole movie rocked.
