17/02/09 "More" (1969) Dir: Barbet Schroeder <br /> <br /> For a film that most viewers agreed on is fairly average, I'm amazed at how many different interpretations have been offered to it. I've just scoured the web quickly and I've been told that "More" is: a 19th century novel, an allusion to the story of Icarus, a simple movie full of boring people and only interested in Pink Floyd Completers. It is fair to say, then, that the critical reception is mixed. I would say that these wildly disparate readings of Barbet Schroeder's directorial debut in 1969 are sufficient proof that "More" is anything but a very average movie. <br /> <br /> Nor is it a masterpiece, of course. I tackled "More" as I did Antonioni's "Easy Rider" and "Blowup" - as a "time-capsule" film, a snapshot of an era - despite the differences in rhythm, style and content between these films. They all have similar flaws - vague or downright nasty characters, acting that seem a bit drifting from reality, relaxed editing and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant. These movies never try to be persuasive or find the audience in the middle of the road - they are what they are, man. This in itself is not a problem as long as we have a memory of experience. Fortunately, "More" offers several truly memorable images, sounds and suggestions to the viewer, and that's what saves you. <br /> <br /> Stefan is a young man who arrives in Paris after his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him as he falls in love with a group of French hipsters, accompanying them to devastating parties and bars before they meet Estelle. The two characters engage sexually and romantically and he promises to follow her to Ibiza, against the advice of his friend Charlie. This is where the Icarus thing comes into play - it is the Sun, it pursues it. You may now be able to guess how all this ends. <br /> <br /> Ibiza is such an idyll away from the bustling urgency of overpopulated Paris that the naive Stefan knows he must be on a good thing. . Estelle remains elusive and erratic, and the island has a less desirable womb. By now I had cared little for any of these characters and their search unfocused from somewhere to be really free but once the action is reduced to just these two the movie suddenly becomes poignant. During a single melancholy exchange of dialogue in the remote home they inhabit, the place where their volatile love crystallizes, I failed to observe with a weakened optimism to be completely snatched away. I can not think of many other movies that did this. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and human to the extent that we can see it go from the intimacy that sets life to disillusionment and cruelty cruel. They take lots of drugs and swarm nudes on the terraces, on the rocks and on the beaches. Their lives revolve around nothing but the other and the beautiful surroundings of the Mediterranean. For a time, your situation is the very essence of freedom, emotional openness, and experience itself. But Stefan is not in control, and this is the downfall of more than just his future in Ibiza. <br /> <br /> Pink Floyd's score is perfect for exoticism, intimacy, and the feeling of "More." It's one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito netting around Estelle's bed and her hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill (which appears on the cover of the soundtrack album). A scene in which they take acid to escape the withdrawal of heroin is illustrative of the couple's fundamental faults - they can not "land" without an accident. Maybe they got too close to what they wanted. <br /> <br /> Stefan never makes contact with any family or friends before his arrival in Paris. We assume they have no idea where he is. While other 1960s counterculture films talk about debauchery, excess, media, and voyeurism, Schroeder has presented us with a story focused on a man, leaning on a corner somewhere in the world and disappearing silently.
