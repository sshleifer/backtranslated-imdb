A German freshman, Stefan picks up Paris during the summer break, where he falls in love with a mysterious young woman he meets on the crazy Paris scene. He then follows her on the famous island of Ibiza, where the hippie meets Wolf, a man who plays Hitler-Jugend knives, has bars and hotels and keeps Estelle under the thumb with drugs. The couple tries to escape from Wolf, Stefan gets addicted to drugs and jealous by Estelle, who is a spirit of groovy and free. Great photography and music, the plot is quite usual for the period, but it is not a kind of cold and dramatic exploration film. The moral is very strong (he was looking for the sun ...), but I would not say it is a drug film, even this gives rise to the use of drugs.
