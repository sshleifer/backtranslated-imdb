It must be very difficult to tell a story where not much happens, but still hold the attention of the viewers. I think this short film achieves this with effortless quality. Rutger has an incredible voice that is very comforting, wise and fatherly, (I'm not gay), it resembles the qualities that Robert Redford has in recounting. The ending is very sad but beautiful. One wonders how long Harry has left, he will be alone and he will say goodbye? He also gets annoyed with Mr. Hauer for not getting involved in more jobs of that caliber. Let's hope he continues to do a good job in Holland and stay away from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Worth watching
