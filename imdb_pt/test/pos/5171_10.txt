It was good to see John Denver again, although it happened several years ago. I found this movie very exciting and a great movie to sit by the fire on a cold winter night reminiscing about what Christmas is all about. The scenes in Georgetown, Colorado, were magnificent and make someone want to move there immediately. While sitting here on my mountain, seen in California, I loved the story and the plot. I hope everyone who sees this movie a little older will appreciate it as much as I and my mother. Merry Christmas! A great movie for the whole family too see. Enoy and tell others about it. Thank you for the memories. We need more movies like this to come out of Hollywood.
