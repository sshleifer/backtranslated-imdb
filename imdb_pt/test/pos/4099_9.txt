Actually, this movie should be released on DVD. I just got a pirate copy of what I think was a studio movie and I was totally satisfied !!! It was on my list of movies to own simply because of the cast. Three of my people, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo and Juliet, and also in John Gielghud. sorry for the bad spelling, it was there, so just in that I thought for the small amount that I was spending, it would be nice. I was right. I will not give any of this, you may already know the story anyway, but I'll tell you if you can get a copy in ANY format ... Do it! @ You will not regret . JPC
