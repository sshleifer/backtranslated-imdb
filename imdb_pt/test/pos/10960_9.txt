"Shadows" is often acclaimed as the film that was the breakthrough for American independent filmmaking. Whether this is true or not is an undeniably important film, one whose influence can be traced back to today's Sundance fodder. Here is a film that tackles controversial topics of the day (notably racism), and refuses to give easy answers and show them in a manipulative way. In addition, sex deals in a frank way that Hollywood did not even discuss until "The Graduate". <br /> <br /> Still, the question remains is as powerful today as when it was originally released? The answer is yes. While many major movies are hard to watch and dated these days, "Shadows" retains every drop of emotional resonance when viewed now. It deals with racism as a personal rather than political issue, so it is still relevant. It also acts as a great time capsule, capturing the 1950s beat generation and New York art scene in a way no other movie has done. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, it is admittedly uneven. Cassavetes has not yet gained full confidence as a director and the unstable edition reflects the film's low budget. Still, the story of the film remains powerful. In addition, the acting, considering the inexperience of the cast and the improvised nature, is phenomenal. Everywhere, actors create realistic characters, those who remain sympathetic despite their often less than admirable actions. "Shadows" is absolutely mandatory for movie buffs. (9/10)
