I remembered watching this show as a young kid in Australia in the 60's and tweeting it on DVD again as a parent of 50-year-old kids. Although the bad guys are mostly superficial characters and there is a component of violence, I am very happy to see my 6 and 8 year old children watch this because the central characters are deep, kind and honest, Japanese culture shines, violence is not bloody, no one is glorious, and the show is beautiful to watch. It does not promote nightmares, but shows much of the culture that must have influenced primarily the design of the Jedi Knights in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The quality of DVDs leaves something to be desired. Perfectionists will not like this video. It's reminiscent of something stashed in the 16mm film and projected on the wall in some basement ... what can it be. The soundtrack is also lacking in the quality we expect from home theater. However, my kids just noticed that it was not colored, and I suspect they just noticed this because we were talking recently about how old things tend to be like that. The beauty of Mount Fuji is evident even in black and white. Something about the seventeenth-century setting plays the quality part of the atmosphere, as if you peered into the past through a window of time. <br /> <br /> Overall, this program is better than most things in the air, and a better distance advertisement for Japanese TV than Pokemon, but you can consider it marginal value if you do not have the experience seeing him back in the 60's. My score of 8/10 takes into account his age.
