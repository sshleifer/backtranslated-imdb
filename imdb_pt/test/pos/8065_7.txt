While the concept of a 32-year-old woman portraying a 12-year-old girl might be a stretch to today's sophisticated audience, in the 1920s this was what Mary Pickford fans wanted and expected from their favorite star. . The opening scene shows Annie's sloppy character as the apparent leader of a multi-ethnic street gang in comic "battle" with a rival group. The sight of a girl being kicked in the jaw and kicked can be a bit coarse, but the scene is played in such a way "Our Gang" that it would be difficult to take this seriously. Anyway, Annie can serve and take it. After Annie returns to her tenement and replaces her street failures with more feminine clothes, it becomes harder (especially in close-ups) to imagine this beautiful young woman as a street kid. However, for those who can muster the necessary suspension of disbelief, the rest of the film has its rewards. Wavering between the comedy (Annie's gang makes a show) to the feeling (Annie plans a birthday surprise for her Irish police father) to tragedy (her father is dead on her birthday), the film gives Mary a broad opportunity to show a variety of emotions would please your fans of any era. <br /> <br /> Of course, the "happy end" requirement is finally achieved; the evildoers are apprehended with the help of Annie's friends and rivals and she is last seen in the company of her friends walking down a busy avenue on a sunny day. That's a good way for anyone to get a Mary Pickford movie to finish. <br /> <br />
