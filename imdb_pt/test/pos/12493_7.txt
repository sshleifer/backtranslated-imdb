Quai des Orfevres takes a long time to go, with Clouzot so enamored of his stage environment that he almost runs the risk of forgetting the story. However, when this happens, Clouzot is at his best. Bertrand Blier (father of Bertrand Blier and co-star of his Buffet Froid) is the pianist who married and plans to kill the studio mogul with drawings on his wife only to find out that someone beat him. Not only that, but his carefully planned but awkward alibi falls to pieces, not least when a thief steals his car at the scene of the crime. <br /> <br /> The film really kicks in with the arrival of Luis Jouvet. police inspector, a wonderful little creation, Alistair Yes in Green for Danger and Maigret half weary of the world with better dialogue. In a well-groomed joke, his investigation is constantly conducted at the top of his voice against chaos and noise, whether the noisy typewriters of the police station or a loud rehearsal. The police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation, a wealth of chaotic and revealing little details that makes Steve Bocchco's 80's American cops, by comparison, somewhat like antiquated museum pieces. <br /> <br /> If Suzy Delair is a little convincing femme fatale, the support cast more than make up for, with the beautiful Simone Renant a prominent as the lesbian photographer in love with her from afar and constantly confused with Blier's lover by Delair and other interested parties (only Jouvet, equally unfortunate with women, understands and genuinely sympathizes). With a great black and white photograph of Armand Thirard, this is a great thriller with an interesting ending and a beautiful scene with a taxi driver reluctantly identifying Renant at a police station. (Trivia note: Pierre Larquey, who played the philosophical and playful Dr. Vorzet in Le Corbeau, appears in smaller roles as a taxi driver in Quai and Les Espions.) Criterion's DVD is excellent - excellent image quality and an extract from a French TV show featuring interviews with Clouzot, Blier and Renant.
