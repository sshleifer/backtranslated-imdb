A huge cast got together for this remake which, unfortunately, was a box office failure, despite a great soundtrack. I can not say it was fascinating entertainment, nor a cure for insomnia. However, I enjoyed the movie - it provided the escape I was after an afternoon. A good look for those of us who seek the ideal life, albeit a fantasy. Expect some sudden moments, few emotions and an occasional laugh.
