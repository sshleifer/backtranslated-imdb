The revelation here is Lana Turner's ability to dance. Although she was known in particular for being an excellent nightclub dancer and ballroom, Turner rarely had the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film. <br /> <br /> So the spectators notice! Here, MGM was still clearly trying to determine in what direction they would develop the young star yet, and were therefore consigning it to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire. In "Two Girls on Broadway" "However, she has an excellent opportunity to showcase her native rhythm and the ability to change the pace on the prodigious production number" My Wonderful One, Let's Dance. " This number is conceived and filmed as a kind of hybrid between a Busby Berkely-style extravaganza and the kind of routines that Hermes Pan was projecting for Astaire and Rogers on the RKO. So the number begins with George Murphy and Miss Turner are portrayed as bar patrons (with a full refrain) in front of a black-haired curtain where Mr. Murphy sings the number for Ms. Turner.Then the camera (on a spear) pulls back on a remarkable crane shot to reveal a huge stage and a rotating set equipped with steps, columns, enclosures and sliding walls. From this point forward, Murphy and Turner perform a rapid variety of modes and attitudes , including withdrawals, turns, sneakers, and termination with an electrifying series of conjoined pirouettes that concludes with Murphy picking up and spinning Turner with an exciting speed for a racing orchestra. <BR> <BR> <BR> Everything tells a dizzying feat that proves that Ms. Turner was fully capable of holding on as a dancer, though I daresay that most of her admirers would refuse to abandon her from her throne as the queen of melodrama.
