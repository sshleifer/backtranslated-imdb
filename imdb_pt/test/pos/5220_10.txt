Father Hood <br /> <br /> I can understand why many people hate this tale of a father who kidnapped his two sons and carried them across America, but I saw much worse, and - when I saw this year ago - I did not I thought it was particularly horrible. Patrick Swayze is the worried father who takes his kids to run away with him for personal reasons, and Halle Berry is the cop behind them. <br /> <br /> Overall, a decent way to spend a few hours of your life. You could certainly do worse - have you heard of the movie "Pod People"? <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of PG <br /> <br /> Rated PG-13 for some traumatic scenes, adult content, violence and language.
