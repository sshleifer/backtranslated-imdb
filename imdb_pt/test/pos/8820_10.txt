Michael Sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant portrait of a comic genius. If you're familiar with Kenneth Williams' mannerisms and diaries, this drama captures the essence of them perfectly. When I read about Kenneth hoovering in his bathing trunks I laughed and then was brought to life on the screen but this time I did not laugh as was put into perspective as the actions of a repressed and tortured man. It must have been such a lonely existence in Kenneth's skin, desiring attention, but avoiding when it really mattered! The last 20 minutes are heart-breaking, as you see Kenneth gradually sink into the depths of despair and consider suicide as the only alternative. I've seen it a dozen times and still cry uncontrollably at the point where he says good night to LOUIE. I can not recommend this drama enough. Sexually explicit, but this shows that Kenneth could not let anyone invade his world and that is where the sadness of man resides. For a genius who has brought happiness to many, it is a pity that his personal life has been so full of despair and sadness. Pauly.
