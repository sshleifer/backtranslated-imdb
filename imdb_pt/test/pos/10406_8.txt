NOROI follows a documentary filmmaker, Masafumi Kobayashi, as he slowly discovers something mysterious and evil that is leaving a trail of corpses in his wake. After interviewing a woman who claims to hear the baby's screams coming from the house next door (where there is no baby), Kobayashi heads to talk to the neighbor. He is met with hostility by the unbalanced and disheveled woman (Maria Takagi), who answers the door (and promptly knocks him in the face) and peers at the 6-year-old son through a window. Strangely, both the wife and the child disappear a few days after their visit (leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on the back porch), and the woman who first complained about the noise, as well as her daughter, is killed in a mysterious accident not long after that. This arouses Kobayashi's interest and he sets out on a mission to find out what's going on. He soon discovers that those with psychic abilities and extra-sensory perception seem to be tuning into something sinister, inexplicable, and possibly even apocalyptic. Well-known clairvoyant 10-year-old TV celebrity, Kana (Kanno River) seems to think that we may all be doomed, but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help. Another psychic / actress woman (Marika Matsumoto) gets involved, as does Nori, a mental / mentally unstable man wearing a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he calls "ectoplasmic worms." The clues eventually lead to the site of a small village that is now covered by a lake, and to the legend of an ancient demon known as Kagutaba ... <br /> <br /> Unlike many other hand-made horror films , it depends on both the plot and the reactionary first-person reaction. Fortunately there is something of a plot here, very interesting and intricate, so do not depend on glimpses of horrible things through the Spartan camera work from time to time to keep your interest. The way Masafumi travels in pursuit of truth - with well-placed clashes along the way - reminded me a little of THE OMEN in its rhythm. The film also does not consist entirely of footage filmed by the documentary filmmaker, but appears in feature films and television shows as if what we're seeing was a completed documentary. This helps break some of the monotony usually associated with movies filmed in that particular style. The performances are good enough not to undermine the realism of 'real' filming as well. Overall, it's a well-done horror film, with many plot turns, some suspense and some genuinely scary moments, worth checking out. My only real complaint is that I could have used a little cut here and there and it seems to go a little too long. Otherwise, very good things.
