This typical teen movie is one of the best, next to the story is good, the music goes well with the movie all the time. <br /> <br /> Although I do not like classic movies, unless it's a classic script and better written, this one is exceptional. Maybe the style of hair and language should change a bit, in the 80's I believe that offensive language is still rarely heard. <br /> <br />
