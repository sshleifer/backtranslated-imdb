Here is a movie of adventure, determination, heroism and bravery. In addition, it is back in the late 1800's, which makes it even more interesting. It's a wonderful plot and full of adventures, and Alyssa Milano is wonderful at playing the healthy, confident and sensible Fizzy ... a great model. This is one of my favorite movies. It is a film to be seen again and again and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt. Not only is the plot excellent, but the film also has fabulous scenery and music and is wonderfully driven. This movie is as good as gold!
