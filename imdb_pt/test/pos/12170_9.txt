These three directors are going to Good Beginnings. The three stories are remarkably well made for independent productions and capture those traumatic feelings of "hanging out" when you're not really sure it's a good idea. I laughed at those veiled looks around the dressing room in "Pool Days"; I smiled at the notion that Bette Midler fans, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand are supposed to be gay in "A Friend of Dorothy" (ie browsing through the shelves of CDs); and I cringed over the "athlete" in "The Disco Years," whose sweet-sex memory was now "blurred" by alcohol. Everything seemed so real. I look forward to more offers from this trio of directors.
