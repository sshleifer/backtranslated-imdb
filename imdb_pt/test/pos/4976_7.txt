It is always interesting to capture a line in a movie that ends up being something prophetic for the future of an actor. In this case, I was intrigued by Edward G. Robinson's statement to Barbara Stanwyck - "I promised you the Valley," while he discusses the solitary attempts to control the entire land in Logasa. Ten years later, Stanwyck would star as the matriarch of the Barkley Family in "The Big Valley." Somehow, I thought she might look older in the previous photo; I think all those bright dresses and extravagant riding clothes have a way of showing the young side. <br /> <br /> As for my summary line above, this is John Parrish's assessment of Lee Wilkison (Glenn Ford), one of those holding the aforementioned exits shortly after Parrish used his knowledge of military tactics to draw a series of Wilkison's hands after they invaded his ranch and set fire to his house. I liked the way the film explored his character, beginning with the way he dealt with foreman Wade Matlock (Richard Jaeckel) in a calculated confrontation. The preparation for the ambush was also an intelligent maneuver, diametrically opposed to the strategy of rushing the bandits head-on with both sides fighting the last man standing. Parrish also had something to say - "Never face the enemy on your terms." "The Violent Men" is a good title for this movie, and probably was ahead of its class. in the mid-1950s, though by today's standards, do not get close to the blood that can be found on a "Gravestone" or "Open Line," where bullets require unpleasant savagery. But it is shaped by great performances by the directors, with a subgroup exploring the infidelity that seemed almost ironic considering that it was the character of Stanwyck who was cheating.
