This is a wonderful film as a movie - it gets an 8 out of 10. As a filmed piece of history needs ... one wishes to be more loving, but it's a 5 out of 10. And I think I'm actually being very charitable. <br /> <br /> As he was - that horse man and saber who was the youngest general "boy" of the Army of the Union of American Civil War, and ended up dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the tribes American Indians? Opinions, militants, arrogant, bloodthirsty, ambitious, intelligent, too clever, enemies Indians, Indian friends (?) And national heroes. His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him to a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson and Grant / Lee, and Sherman / Jackson. It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the excessively ambitious excess of ambition, which his reputation has declined. However, to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the most remembered figure in the military annals of our history to lose his last battle (I can not really think of a similar - perhaps General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men in the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and World War II). <br /> <br /> Custer appeared in more movies than the best generals due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn. Too bad that the details of the real career have never been treated as lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn dealt with them in this film. But even in 1941 the legend was still potent. Olivia De Haviland played Libby Custer, who was recently featured in another film review on this topic that survived George until 1933, so her effective treatment of the story was still in effect eight years later. Custer was seen as our disobedient knight, but brave, wandering, and with the shadow of World War II approaching, we had to keep the myth and bury the truth. John Ford would have understood this completely and approved. <br /> <br /> So we got the view that he was an enthusiast, but he was a patriot. Although he was nearly removed from West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been too stupid to be picky about that type of fighter that year. You see, most of the military talent called West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was the South, and joined the Confederacy. The Union needed all the men in the northern "Point" they could find. <br /> <br /> Custer's Civil War career was to receive a more detailed study - he was connected to General George B. McClellan's staff, and distinguished. himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other wars on the eastern front. But he was a knight-and he stood under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's friend, Phil Sheridan, in the latter parts of the war. In particular, he served with distinction and trait in the battle of Cedar Creek, that ended the threat of the Confederation in the Valley of the Shenandoah. He also hit Custer on a personal level (his close friend of West Point, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position as Custer - Custer sat with Ramseur all last night). <br /> <br /> After the war, things collapsed. He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it was not, as it was a promotion on the battlefield). They had only one Lieutenant Colonel to hand him over to the shrunken army along the border. He tried to make politics, making the mistake of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and found that most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot. He supposedly admired the Indians (he was certainly eloquent in writing about them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court-martial. Later, during the 1870s, he would support Indian claims against a circle of politicians (who went up to the secretary of war, William Belknap), who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit. Ruined Belknap and left a black eye on grant administration. He put him in the dog house with Grant and Sherman (who was the former commander of Belknap), and Sheridan could barely save his career. Then he was sent in the Big Horn Campaign final. And immortality has come. <br /> <br /> This career is worth a real movie, but would it be too critical? Should we have a man from the 1850s - 1876 by the 2007 standards? Would we like this to be done in a hundred years? Surely that could happen, but I'm not sure we would like that. <br /> <br /> Custer (1941 style) fits Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a "dance" performance in any of his major films. His last film with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the character of the hero. In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn performed very well as friends, enemies or even treacherous fires (Kennedy). As a fun piece of myth making it remain high - but as a study of a complex military hero is not what it should be.
