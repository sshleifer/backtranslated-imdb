MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a great movie that is predictable and unpredictable at the same time. You know the characters after discovering that the so-called "God's Gift" was actually a loan, would return the money and that everyone would be happy in the end, but how they get there is not so obvious. The scenes are often funny and occasionally play as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going. The cast of veteran actors is more than just a trip of nostalgia. Frank Gorshin, Shirley Jones and Cloris Leachman prove they are capable of more than playing Riddler, Mother Partridge or Mary's friend Phyllis, while Jill Eikenberry and Wendie Malick play characters different from what we've seen in their TV series. Ursula Burton's portrait of the nun is at once touching and funny, without making fun of the nuns or the church. If you are looking for a movie with a fantastic cast, good music (including a version of Shirley Jones' "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an invigorating ending, try this. I do not think you will be disappointed.
