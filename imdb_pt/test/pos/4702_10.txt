Oh so beautiful, oh so tearful and so distressing. <br /> <br /> It makes everything look so shallow, so pale, so meaningless in comparison. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen is not a true saint. <br /> <br /> She is a true human - false, crude and rude, but passionate and with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> What I found most interesting is that this bunch of unhappy, miserable people have found meaning and laughter. <br /> <br /> What I loved the most is how the documentary portrays the polarity of human nature.
