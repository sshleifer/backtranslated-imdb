Great story, wonderful acting, amazing production values ​​and a short and action packed with a perfect twist in the end. What a great short film! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in Vail or Aspen at a film festival and I was impressed by it. So I saw it again at another festival (where it won again) and I was even more impressed because subtle touches became apparent the second time - for a short film, that packs a lot of clever layers in no time. AWOL is not for the faint of heart, but it's very well done and quite impressive for a short film - for any movie, actually. It's an interesting story told very well, and each scene moves the story, which reveals the good instincts of making movies to make this movie. The film is gorgeous and David Morse is also impressive with a dynamic performance in every scene. Watching your character try to defeat the balls that life is throwing makes a great viewing experience. It should also be noted that when the tortures of war are in the headlines every day, the lines between reality, good and evil, can get very gray as the rhetoric gets high and tries to make the things in black and white. AWOL intelligently allows the audience to decide for themselves what they think the message is, what is real and what is not, which adds to the mystery. <br /> <br /> The two times I saw him, the audience was more in this movie than the others who play with him, which is saying a lot. There are many short ones out there now, but few offer the kind of excellence and a complex subject that AWOL does. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the previous critic is out of his rocker. , or have some personal agenda, because this is really a great example of independent short film. I see a lot of short films, and I must say that if ALL the short films that made the festival rounds were so good, THEN the short film business would have some serious problems.
