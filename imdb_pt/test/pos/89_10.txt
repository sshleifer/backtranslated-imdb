This is a piece of cinematic beauty, and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other work that comes from the province of La Belle. It takes everyone into a first-person experience of culture, to the point that you want to stick your hair in place and live, breathe and eat everything that happened to Maurice Richard. The book does just like the short, and I'm glad that in all the time I spent studying French in high school, it was necessary to read in both languages. <br /> <br /> I found it brilliant to have Roch Carrier tell this story. His molasses accent brought realism to the story. The animation was good, too, very surrealistic, which draws attention to the idea that this is a capricious daydream, imagining better days gone by. <br /> <br /> Once again, as a symbol of the Quebecoise culture, this is unsurpassed. You can almost smell the tourtiere being cooked slowly over a wood stove. This entire film deserves endless praise to make people proud of being Canadian, and to encourage all of us to appreciate the good things about our family and our roots. I'm from Ontario and this movie made me fall in love with Quebec. Maurice Richard goes toujours vivre dans nos coeurs.
