Easily one of the best shows of all time, and only improves with age. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the main reasons for this was the adaptation in English made by David Weir. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine Japanese told me once that the show in its original language was more capricious and less hilarious than the version we all know. The fact that the show resonates so strongly to its non-Japanese fans are, in my opinion, largely because of Mr. Weir's inspired efforts and some winning storytelling works. <br /> <br /> Well done, sir!
