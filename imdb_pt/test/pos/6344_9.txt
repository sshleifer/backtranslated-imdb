This is a wonderful sequel to the award-winning Lonesome Dove miniseries in the '80s. This sequel is perhaps better than the original. It's definitely more familiar. Language is more submissive. There is a lot of violence and one particular scene with Cherokee Jack is particularly gruesome. However, overall a great movie. The acting is superb. William Peterson is fantastic. A great dramatic actor with a quick sense of humor and comedic humor. Jon Voight appropriately fills Tommy Lee Jones' shoes as Captain Call. Ricky Shroder gives a great performance as the boy who grew up without family to claim it. Highly recommended.
