According to me, a movie can be better judged by the number of "best scenes" that exist. There are probably at least 80-90 scenes throughout the movie that are probably rated 'best' by one or the other. <br /> <br /> This film is a masterpiece. Period. I know many who called him ahead of time, probably because he bombed the box office. However, I think any generation can relate to this movie and have a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I am personally happy that Mahmood is also part of the movie. His role is not 'fleshy,' but it's good to see that he's in the cast of the funniest movie ever.
