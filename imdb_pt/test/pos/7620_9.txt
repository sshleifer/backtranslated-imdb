I loved this movie. Not as good as "50 First Dates," but it's definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of girlfriends. Yes, the plot was "cute" and maybe even unbelievable, but what's so bad about a movie is good. Drew as Josie and his romance with the teacher is so sweet and baseball wannabee brother enhances the movie's good feel. With all the crap out there, what's so bad about a good movie that the whole family can enjoy? Do not be embarrassed while watching with your children! Drew is an incredible actress who seems to be under-appreciated most of the time. This is definitely one of your best roles!
