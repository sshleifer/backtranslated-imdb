I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival, where it ended up being a favorite of the public. This is a parody on the French OSS 117 film industry of the 1950s and 1960s. The first OSS 117 film based on Jean Bruce's novel was brought to the screen in 1956, long before the first James Bond film with Ivan Desny as Hubert Bonisseur De La Bath and six subsequent action adventure espionage films until 1970 with Luc Merenda, Frederick Stafford, Kerwin Matthews and John Gaven, all taking turns as Oss 117. Jean Dujardin is in the title role in this comic version of the series . As the film begins in 1945, he has a French mustache and resembles Desny, but when the film begins, in 1955 he looks like Sean Connery. Jean Fran√ßois Halim wrote this hilarious script of a spy sent to Egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. It builds on the nonsense of the Naked Gun, the Get Smart and the Pink Panther, and uses cool humor in the current events in a delicious combination that the international audience will enjoy and I'm sure this will be the first of a revived OSS 117 reworked for adventures of comedy. Michel Hazanavicius directs. I would give it a 7.5 and would recommend it.
