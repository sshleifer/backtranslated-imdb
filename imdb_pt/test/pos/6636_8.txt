Ingmar Bergman's meditation on the war concerns a couple living an idyllic existence on a small island off the coast (from which country is not specified). Fury in the distance is a war they know only from news. As they advance, war comes to them and soon becomes a struggle for survival, as both sides do not seem to care about them. Gloomy look at the human cost of war and those who are not readily involved in the battle, but trapped in the crossfire, however. It is a film ahead of its time, about 40 years since the notion of armies at war was made, where the majority of victims are the civilians reached the age of majority. This is a dark and disturbing movie that is told from the point of view of the average person with the complete sense of hopelessness and confusion best expressed in the thought that kept running through my head, "what do I do now?" As an intellectual exercise, the film is top notch, this is a movie that will make you think. Like an emotional film, it's touching, but it never moves completely. I was never moved emotionally even when the horror of the situation made my brain do flip-flops. (I must say that I admire Bergman intellectually for the ideas he brings to the table, however I've never been moved by his films.I'm not a "fan." I've always been on Fellini's side in the old argument who has been better since he had more excitement for his films). Side bookings this is require viewing especially since we live in a world where war, for most of us, is just a thing on the TV screen.
