I watched this movie at the Magnolia Theater in Dallas a few days ago. Punk! Everyone involved in the film increased his punkiness. The music, of course. But the film itself captured the entire punk genre. Even a grandmother and teacher (myself) can appreciate artists who are able to turn their ideas into reality (well, reality, film-wise). This film takes a handful of young filmmakers and clearly and cleverly shows the "why" of their anguish at not having received the green light at the end of Waldo's film. The (relatively) happy girl gave a good comic relief, a nice break from the continuous (but understandable) ragging in the face that left them in trouble. I have to love Stu, though. And do not forget to watch / read the credits - they are the icing on the cake!
