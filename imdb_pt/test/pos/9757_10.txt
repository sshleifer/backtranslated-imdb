I do not know where this movie was filmed, but because it was filmed locally, it has the authenticity that this story deserves. It is the story of an English girl who is held by the Japanese in South Asia at the outbreak of World War II with a group of other English women. There is no concentration camp for women, so they are forced to march for months from one place to another because the Japanese do not know what to do with them. The bravery and resilience of English women and the bravery of the Australian soldier who tries to help them are the core of the film. This movie is very long, maybe 10 hours, so you can watch it as it was shown on PBS, as a series, which really adds to the feeling of the endless journey that this woman makes of England, across this remote island and finally Australia . The story, the cinematography, the location and the actors combine to make this a movie not to be missed. My only question is why this was not released on DVD!
