This comedy of 1931 gets better with each performance because of the comedic talents of Marion Davies and a fantastic performance by C. Aubrey Smith. Smith plays a grumpy old man who gathers his grown children (from his younger days as a rake) in his declining years. One is American (Davies), an Englishman (Ray Milland who appears to be about 18 years old) and an Italian (Nina Quartero). There are some surprises as the plot moves along with Ralph Forbes (has no appeal) by Davies. <br /> <br /> Davies and Smith are wonderful together and very touching. Davies also does some dances and makes some "big" tickets. And of course Davies is just beautiful. <br /> <br /> Halliwell Hobbes, Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray, Guinn Williams, Edgar Norton and David Torrence co-star. If they had supported the Oscar in 1931, Smith could have been nominated. He is simply excellent at this gem.
