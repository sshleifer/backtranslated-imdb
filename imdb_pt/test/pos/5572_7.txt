Having watched the program for about four weeks, which is enough to get an idea of ​​the program, I think it shows potential. While much is borrowed from other shows (which science fiction does not currently do), and the characters are stereotyped, I like what they are doing with the stories. There is some continuity in the development of plot and character interaction / relationship building, despite the essentially modular nature of each episode. There were some topics related to the science explored as well as revelations of the character's secret / weakness. These also added some comedy to the show, something I would be happy to see more in "serious" sci-fi. In all, this contributes to a good balance, in such a way that it can attract large groups of people, unlike the Star Trek vs. Babylon 5 debates, in which I participated and witnessed numerous. The visual aspects of the program are more than adequate and well budgeted for a first season. The acting is acceptable, and I'm curious to see how the actors can develop their characters from their scripted stereotypes. I see enough positives and potential to continue interested in seeing where the show wants to go ...
