Plunkett and Macleane is a fun, fast and refreshing movie. It's refreshing because, unlike most other period films, it does not strive to give the audience a history lesson or pompous preaching - in fact, historical accuracy is largely ignored. This film does not take itself very seriously, and seeks to entertain rather than enlighten. Plunkett and Macleane are in the eighteenth century, but director Jake Scott offers a full version of the '90s. There is action, sex and profanity in abundance, and in the inevitable dance scene the aristocracy dances with disco beats. Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are brilliant as ever, and the rest of the cast, especially Alan Cumming as a flop, is also a lot of fun. The film is visually spectacular in some places, and is a mixture of comedy, action and drama, with a love interest provided by Liv Tyler with a shaky English accent. In short, if you're looking for a fun couple of hours, this is the movie for you. It will not make you think, but you can put a smile on your face.
