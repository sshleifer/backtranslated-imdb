Aah, the training show was great. Not only did many women get in shape, but many teenagers also had a great workout. I'm not saying that the show was somehow not suitable for family viewing, but if you check out the other shows producer jobs, you'll find more adult themes in their works, which are also great. Many viewers eagerly awaited the program, and both men and women gained good information and a good release from training. The girls were perfect, and Beautiful, the show is a classic and should do well in syndication. The show must still be on, since there are never enough options to see when it comes to health and beauty.
