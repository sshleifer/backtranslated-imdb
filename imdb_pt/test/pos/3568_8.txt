"When I die, someone will bury me, and if they do not die, what's the difference?" "Who cares?" Thus, the philosophy of life (or lack thereof) is summed up once and for all in this classic, but fun spinoff of Sergio Leone's "Trilogy of Dollars." In the opening scene, three obviously evil gunslingers enter a western town and, with menacing looks, intimidate all the pathetic normal people who hide in their homes. The observer will note that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to the characters in Leone's For A Few Dollars More. There is a guy in the Eastwood poncho, one in the black suit of Lee Van Cleef, and one seeming to act like Gian Marie Volonte's Indio. But this movie is not about these guys. They barely make it to town when they are slaughtered by someone even cooler than them, a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the Stranger. <br /> <br /> No. This is a totally different story. <br /> <br /> In an obvious copy of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly by Leone, three gunmen are once again touting a hidden treasure. Once again, there is the bounty hunter and the Mexican bandit. The Stranger (George Hilton) is a super cool bounty hunter with a penchant for photographing people while dressing like a priest. He is behind the bounty by the villain Monetero (Gilbert Roland). But when Monetero's gang robs three hundred thousand gold coins, the Stranger dodges his normal line of work. <br /> <br /> To end the trio, there is the corrupt executive of Edd Byrne's bank, Clayton. He also wants the money for himself. But after the money is hidden, the only man who knows where he is is shot. Now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest. The game also finds the treasure before someone else does. And any weapon can play. With many shootouts, fist fights and double crosses, the action takes those three to the final final showdown, a triple draw to the hidden treasure wing of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - but with a twist. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good as Leone's movies, of course, but in the end who cares, right? This movie is fun - nihilism from the 60's, western style of spaghetti. There are no rules, no lasting loyalty, no right or wrong - just the treasure and what it takes to get it. And although the film is not classic, the ending certainly is. Hey, maybe we can all get along, after all, for a hundred thousand a piece. <br /> <br /> If you like spaghetti westerns, take a look at it. It's fast, furious and worth it.
