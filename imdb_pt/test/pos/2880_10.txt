The problem with other actors in the role of Dorian Gray is that either they seemed too old for the role (Hurd Hatfield, Helmut Berger, Josh Duhamel, David Gallagher and Ben Barnes) or that they could not get the aristocratic English way. without being blistered. Dorian is the perpetual 19-year-old (or so), all milky skin and hair with honey as described by Wilde, so the challenge is to find an actor who has maturity and reach for the play (ie who can portray naivety , insensitivity, and manipulation), but at the same time it looks like someone in their late teens. And Peter Firth pulls all this in this great adaptation of British TV. Gielgud as Henry Wotton, though considerably older than Wilde had in mind, works wonders with his scenes - Wilde's aphorisms never sounded so good. natural and not forced. Especially George Sanders in the 1945 version was very weak in comparison (and his costume did not fit). <br /> <br /> Finally, Jeremy Bratt plays Basil as the most masculine and at the same time the gayest in the United States. trio, again an appropriate interpretation. In general, the film includes a lot of gay subtext without transforming Dorian himself into gay - he is everything to all people and supposedly there is no drug or sexual perversion he has not tried in the 18 years covered by the story, but that makes him narcissist than homosexual. It also seems to wreak havoc on both sexes here, as it should, according to the novel. <br /> Of course the budget for this production was not too great, so everything seems a bit confusing. In particular, Dorian's encounter with Sybil's brother suffers from the obvious visual studio. Plus, Dorian's final dose (a doll, I suppose) in his white frog makeup is more hilarious than convincing and the death scene for Basil is inadvertently funny. (Also, as far as I remember, Basil should have been killed sitting at the table.) <br /> <br /> But on the whole, this is a very decent fit. I'm sure Wilde would have liked it. The only thing missing is the sensual side. Not so much sex scenes, but Wilde's decadent world of perfumed flowers, luxury cloths and gems is not really explored here, meaning aestheticism is completely absent. But as "I, Claudius," the excellent performance makes one easily forget these shortcomings of production values.
