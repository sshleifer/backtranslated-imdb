Ray is interesting in parts, and technically is very well done, but Ray is often slow, and forgets some important details about Ray's life. Everything the movie shows us are parties in which he is in the prime, which is good, it's just that I wanted to see a few pieces of his life as well. Jamie Fox imitates Ray Charles, sometimes it's absolutely weird. I have to say, Jamie is the reason I went through this movie. The first half is much better than the second. It's more interesting, there's more Oomph and it does not even come close to the second. I was not a big fan of Ray Charles to start being honest so I really had no expectations for the movie. Ray's biggest problem had to be the excessive length. This could have been cut very easily, with more relevant scenes than the ones they used. I found the early part of Ray's life when he was just beginning to succeed, the most interesting. He was humble at the time and a little gentleman. And while the movie may have overstated its actions, it got a little full of itself for me to care. <br /> <br /> Performance. Jamie Fox gives a performance for ages like Ray. He looks like Ray, speaks like Ray, acts like Ray. This is so much more than an impression, I really believed he was Ray Charles. He was the heart of the movie, and without his presence, this movie would have been a complete and total annoying. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line. Ray is interesting at times, terribly annoying to others. When all was said and done, I was disappointed with the routine that seemed at times. Just because it's a bibliographic film does not mean it's automatically worthy of the Oscars. Jamie Fox earned her Oscar, but the film is above average at best. Worth watching, but if I were you, I would keep my expectations to a very comfortable level. <br /> <br /> 7/10
