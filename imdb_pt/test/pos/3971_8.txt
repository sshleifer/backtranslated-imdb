On the face of it, any teen comedy runs the risk of being sophomoric and obvious, and fairly fair, most of them are. There are some who have risen above the usual banality of source material (Bring It On, Eurotrip), and they give me hope that others can join in that depressive and rare crowd of teenage comedies that are really funny and not just an excuse for flash some starlet breasts or be a vehicle for some ever-been like Tom Green. <br /> <br /> Enter Accepted, directed by John Cusack to Steve Pink and led by the lovable Justin Long (the clever nerd boy in Galaxy Quest and most recently in computer ads from Apple), about a bunch of kids who did not are accepted into college and decide, as revealed in the trailer, to fake a fake to get the parents off their backs. When they go too far with the site and the other kids end up enrolling, kids have some problems to solve. <br /> <br /> Ok, the preparation is obviously absurd, but most comedies live or die. in execution, and here, Accepted does very well. Bartleby Gaines de Long (mostly shortened to 'B') is accompanied by well-meaning comically acceptable friends to help him split the charge, but probably the best supporting character is 'Dean' Lewis (undoubtedly named as a tribute to Rodney Dangerfield's Dean Martin), also known as Uncle Ben, Lewis Black, who is wisely restricted to small outbreaks where he can quickly fire his unique mark of cranky observational humor. Black is fantastic here, frankly telling kids how life really is (their end line full of swearing is hysterical) and providing the adult face to the fake university for parents. <br /> <br /> But Long has to carry most of the movie, and he does it in spades; Bartleby easily identifies with and takes it almost immediately. A good turnaround was given by the character Hands of Columbus Short, an athlete who loses his scholarship due to an injury and ends up becoming the faculty of art in fact in the false college. Also noteworthy how Bartleby's hyper-intelligent and sarcastic sister is Hannah Marks. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film seems familiar in some spots; There is a debt owed here, from all places, to the revenge of the nerds. Those who are rejected by all others find a home with Bartleby and his companions, and it is clear that villains are types of dominant Race conformists and steroids who administer a brotherhood (well, okay, the fraternities are bad) and seek to humiliate and bury the eccentrics. to ?? Sigh ?? crime of being different. But that aside, I am accepted has fun with the material, and still asks some decent questions about the expectations in college kids and the college course. Not that it's a jigsaw, but Accepted is not just another teenage nonsense comedy (or Owen Wilson's vehicle). It's 90 fun and clever minutes that, while not a great starting point for your genre, are smart and creative enough to be very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> There is at least one moment of unshakeable brilliance in the film when Bartleby checks a nearby college in an attempt to gather ideas for his own school curriculum. When he sees that the children are stressed at the other school (several refuse to talk to him during class for fear of losing something), he shakes his head, thinking there must be a better way. As he moves out, he is greeted by a stream of children going to the other side, a person moving against a human tide, while in the background, Eleanor Rigby's opening lines ring. Perhaps an unplanned moment of brilliance, but brilliance, however.
