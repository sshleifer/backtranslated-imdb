After a rather slow start, I thought that this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II caught on and became a pretty nice watch for a few hours, basically from two points of view. <br /> <br /> The love triangle is interesting and seems credible to me because I know it happened in several places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek bride to marry Mandras (Christian Bale). I had doubts about the depth of his love from the beginning, but his future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras left to fight. After the German intervention, Greece is conquered and Pelagia Island lives under Italian occupation, during which Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage.) This, of course, was a dilemma that reached many young women women. on occupied land. Meeting their occupants, they began to see them not as enemies, but as real people, and sometimes fell in love - often to the disapproval of their neighbors. I have just read an interesting book on the German occupation of the Channel Islands of Great Britain, where this was an important question. Once Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is divided between them. <br /> <br /> The second fundamental question is the Italian occupation itself, which I think has been portrayed quite realistically. First was the contempt with which the island treated its Italian occupants. Greece defeated Italy (quite true from a historical perspective) and was actually conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the city to surrender to the Italians and insist on surrendering to a German officer seemed to me something that could have happened (and, indeed, was very funny.) I loved the line, "we preferred to surrender to the German dog than for you Italians. ") The portrait of the Italian troops also seemed to me believable. The Italian army never fell in love with its German ally and never was enthusiastic in fighting with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, his soldiers tended to be treated with contempt. Here the Italians are more interested in singing than in fighting (which the German troops on the island simply can not understand) and are in a trance when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war - until they find out that this can make the prisoners of war. the Germans. It was all very well done, I thought. <br /> <br /> It fails a bit in the end with a predictable end too, but still deserves praise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
