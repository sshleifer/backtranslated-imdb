As stated earlier in one of my great reviews, FLASH GORDON's Universal Pictures Trilogy should not be ranked with other series. For indeed, all three have created a kind of celluloid-electronic mythology for a mid-twentieth-century world filled with phobias and war. They are alone in the minds of many people as the example of what was a cliff. <br /> <br /> We may remember seeing Buster Crabbhe as a guest on NBC's Tomorrow night talk show hosted by Tom Snyder. That was around 1979-80. During the interview, Mr. Crabbe was asked about his personal fitness habits. He credited training with weights and swimming, along with some healthy eating habits, which included vitamin and protein supplements. (And you would believe, he smoked several cigarettes!) When asked about his career, Mr. Snyder of course came up with the subject of his portrait (and strong identification with) the Flash character. Buster said he read and liked the feature in its original medium, which is a comic strip owned by Hearst's King Features Syndicate. He stated that he thought it would not work once transferred to the screen! Luckily he was wrong. <br /> <br /> As for the first series, it was a very good adaptation of the original continuity of Sunday Color Comics. The world is about to end because of the impending collision with Planet Mongo. It is up to Dr. Zarkov to work independently to travel to the wild planet to change course. He has the help of Flash and Miss Dale Arden, new aircraft parachutists, landing on the property of Zarkov. <br /> <br /> The Serial has excitement and manages to make someone feel that there is always some other danger lurking around. on the outside of the film frame. The costumes and decoration are varied, from Romanesque to oriental to art deco. It would be easy to assume that this was due to Universal's frugality, but again this was being true to the creator, visual concepts of cartoonist Alex Raymond (just look at the old tracks as reprinted in many collections). used before in just IMAGINE! (Fox 1930), a science fiction comedy.The other scientific laboratory equipment was provided by Universal's support department, being the leading Hollywood company doing Horror and SciFi. <br /> <br /> The cast has Jean Rogers (Dale Arden) and Priscilla Lawson (Princess Aura), who enter into a good girl Vs. Bad girl battle in Flash. Charles Middleton portrays Emperor Ming in a sort of overly melodramatic villain, but it does work. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) is tempered by the madness he suffered in his appearance on the newsprint. (By the way, have you ever wondered how Zar-KOV has an accent?) Richard Alexander does a well, powerfully built Prince Barin, always useful and so noble. <br /> <br /> Actor Jack "Tiny" Lipson is the Surprise Cast, stealing scene after scene as a lascivious, Henry VIII as a knave turned ally, King Vultan, ruler of the Hawkmen. Among others, the most notable is Jim Pierce as Prince Thun of the Lion Men. Pierce, as well as Crabbe, also played Tarzan in a film - but he married Tarzan Creator, the daughter of Edgar Rice Bourroughs, Joan. FLASH GORDON and the two sequels, FLIP GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS (1938) and FLASH GORDON CONQUEST THE UNIVERSE (1940), have been a basic juvenile food for generations, first in movie houses and then on television. Like good wine, they have seen it improve with age. <br /> <br /> We are all so happy that Mr. RababÃª was wrong.
