Notice of uniformity. As many IMDb users already know, I'm not a kitschy and tacky person. If you do not want to read this type of review then go. <br /> <br /> To tell you the truth, you're hearing this from a man who laughed through the Titanic and almost broke his parents' tape. Continually rewinding the propeller scene. <br /> <br /> --- Spoilers --- <br /> <br /> One day, I went to the theaters with two friends to see Dickie Roberts: Former child star last year in August . The boring trailers continued until one of them began so calmly. He went to the radio. By the time I saw the trailer, I just had to watch this movie on the opening weekend. When this weekend rolled along, the scary movie 3 was out too many teenagers were there waiting in line that Friday night. It turns out that the movie sold out and the teens were so desperate to see a movie, they went and also sold Good Boy and Radio. I did not get a ticket and in the following weeks, I was busy with more important things. About 5 months later, my friend rented Radio. He lent me and I watched in my room. I'll tell you this now, this is the ONLY movie I've ever seen that made me cry EVER. When Radio's mother died, it just came out automatically. The next day, I went to Blockbuster and bought the DVD. Well enough of my stupid personal story, let me tell you about the movie. <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a mentally challenged man dubbed Radio. Ed Harris co-stars and this film is directed by Mike Tollin. Based on a true story, Radio is a teenager who has a life spending most of the day alone. He walks around with a shopping cart getting all he can and is always carrying a radio. It has its own collection. At the end of each day, he goes home to his mother. He never went to school until later in the movie. One day, the Radio goes through the local school while the football team is practicing. A soccer ball flies over the fence and the radio picks it up and continues. Ed Harris plays Mr. Jones, the football coach. They meet and this is the life of Radio. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, Radio and Coach Jones spend quality time together, both teaching each other things. It's lovely to see how the movie goes to the greatest joys, the lowest and just watching the radio live your life. You'll laugh, cry and live Radio's life with him. This movie has a special place in my heart, along with Toy Story and others. This is a must visit for the whole family, for yourself, or if you are someone who just wants a great drama. Radio is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Radio will never be forgotten by me. Never. <br /> <br /> As the character of Ed Harris said very close to the end of the movie: "We are not teaching Radio, Radio is teaching us." <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
