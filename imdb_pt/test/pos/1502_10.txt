this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of blood in it. who cares about the plot or acting. this is an italian horror movie people, so you know you can not expect much from acting or plot. fulci took footage of other movies and added it to that movie. Since I've never seen any of the movies he took, it did not matter to me. The Italian godfather of Gore Out made himself with this movie. The craziest Italian movies you'll ever see. You do not need to have this movie in your horror movie collection. Buy this movie, no matter what a horehound's dream come true.
