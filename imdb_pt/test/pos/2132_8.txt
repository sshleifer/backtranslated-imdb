I really enjoyed this movie, although this movie seems to be so hated and I think it's even better then, The Deer Hunter, which was overrated. Both this film and the Year of the Dragon are greatly underestimated, although I could see why someone would not like this movie. At three and a half hours the film goes on for a long time and the second half of the film is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken are fighting over Isabelle Huppert, but she can not decide which one she will be. Sam Waterston is the villain who has a list of 125 people to be killed who claim to be anarchists and thieves. There's a great cast that also has Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif and a young Mickey Rourke.
