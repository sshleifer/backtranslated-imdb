"Do not torture a duckling" by Lucio Fulci paints an exceptionally unpleasant portrait of the small town of Sicily plagued by a series of brutal murders of young people. This surprisingly well-directed film (especially in comparison to the later Fulci gorefests) is distinguished by the general atmosphere of perversity, evil and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence. The children about to die are portrayed as casually cruel and sprouting, Bruno's quasi-seduction by the naked Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) really has to be seen. It is highly recommended, especially on par with my other favorite cult "House with the Windows That Laugh "(1976).
