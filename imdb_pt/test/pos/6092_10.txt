I've seen a few movies in my time, but this one is exceptional. You will have to watch it more than once to truly enjoy it, it is emotionally very complex, it explores love and passion in its most extreme form and it's cinematography is just breathtaking. The Count's character is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice or even get out of his bed, the film is perfectly cast and perfectly represented. The film has a kind of mathematical precision and perfection, which is rare these days. It combines action, love, tragedy, drama and politics all in one. This movie is a must-have, all the hype around it and all the prizes can not start to do any justice. We took the hat to Michael Ondaatje for writing the incredible book he is based on.
