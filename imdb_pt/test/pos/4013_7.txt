Oh, I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my first days. It was not a pleasant experience, because I remember watching it when I did my homework. <br /> <br /> Even so, the show caught my attention when Alex demonstrated his special powers and dealt with the typical problems of high school. But the show was not about adventures and special powers; was yet another educational endeavor for a younger audience in order to become more interested in school and biology in general. <br /> <br /> The lead actress (can not remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste the main details) performed a fantastic performance. She made the show watchable. <br /> <br /> They just do not do shows like this anymore ...
