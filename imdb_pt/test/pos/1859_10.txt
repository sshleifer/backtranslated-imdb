I read comments from this movie that I found 'disappointing' and 'confusing'. I'm at a loss to understand why this should be so. From the beginning I found a remarkable experience and a complete joy of watching. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The opening titles overlap a beautiful visual of the evolutionary process, and this introduces the story with a serene and sweeping style. The film is not about the process itself, however, it concerns Charles Darwin's struggle with his conscience, his love for his wife, his deceased daughter and his quest for the truth. <br /> <br /> The apparitions of his daughter are the manifestations of a tormented mind that knows that it "killed God". The daughter is an adult, making adult comments about her work and torturing Darwin with personal doubts. Was he in any way responsible for his death? Husband and wife in real life Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly give truly wonderful performances like Charles and Emma Darwin, as well as Martha West as Annie. The size of Bettany and the awkward gait give Darwin's character a genuine sense of reality, while Connelly seems very comfortable with his English accent and occasionally a somewhat severe personality. <br /> <br /> It is easy to misunderstand the times in which this movie resides. The dominion that religion had over society and the internal struggles that a man like Darwin must have endured to seek the truth in what he witnessed. Science and religion have always been awkward, and though it did not cost her life, as so many previous men and women have, science has put a barrier between husband and wife, fact and faith. This film portrays this barrier extremely well. <br /> <br /> I give the Creation ten stars, because I consider it beautiful, deep, superbly well represented and a genuine look, without any extravagances and requirements, in one of the countries of the world. true geniuses. <br /> <br /> What seems obvious to everyone today (well, almost everyone ... see Bill Maher's wonderful "Religulous") has been hidden for millennia. The truth, once discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation examines this pain and the realization that we are all we possess. <br /> <br /> A wonderful cinematic experience.
