A touching story told with tenderness: clumsy Jewish youth in World War II America befriends a runaway German prisoner of war who is hiding in his club. They discuss their lives and beliefs (he is anti-Hitler), he flees from his food, he becomes his only friend and ally. All of this reminded me of the much better theatrical movie "Whistle Down The Wind" where Hayley Mills befriends Alan Bates, but you certainly can not fault the direction here, which is smooth, or the performances, which are excellent. Mature in her pre-teen years, Kristy McNichol carries most of the image and never hits a fake note. Suddenly, when the prisoner is discovered (and Kristy is also discovered), the film gets very difficult. His father, shocked and embarrassed by his son's relationship with "that Nazi," lays on her with a silent fury I've rarely seen before (he tells her "You're dead to me," which must be devastating for a little girl to hear ). The final scenes do not disappear; there are no large meetings, no hand-held climax. The girl has to face the world and in doing so learns a bitter lesson about neighbors, friends and family. An amazing movie.
