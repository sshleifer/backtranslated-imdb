This is one of those games where you love it in tiny pieces or hate it in pieces. Even being a hardcore Mario fan may make you dislike this game. You can hate it because it's short and mean boring and easy. Or you can love it because it's a mix of amazing graphics (not a big fan of Nintendo) music or game. I know many people who say it's incredible, and others who think it's the worst Mario that ever existed. It really depends on the type of Nintendo fan you are. I personally love this game and think it's the best wii game, but you should determine this for yourself. So I guess you should absolutely understand if you are the right fan of Nintendo.But if you love too many classics, you may not like it. So try it yourself.
