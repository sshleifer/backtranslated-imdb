I found this movie quite brilliant. Initially I wanted a movie "when animals attack" along the lines of "frankenfish" or even "rogue", but was delivered a truly horrible ordeal that was not devoid of humanity. Having been to the areas this was done (including the croc farm at the beginning of the movie, even sharing the same guide!) Added to the fear factor. These crocodiles are everywhere up there, although I do not think they have the "attitude" of that animal. Yes, there were some melodramatic moments, but they contributed to distract the whole atmosphere. I genuinely cared about the characters and shivered contemplating "what would I do?" on their boat. Not knowing where his enemy lurked or the sound of the crocodile at night was genuinely scary. I would say this movie is one of the best horrors I have seen in years (coming close to the descent). I give you four alligator bags.
