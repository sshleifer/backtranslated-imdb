I'm not a filmmaker, but I know it's hard to tell a story and attract people to it in just seven minutes. I think a good movie is one that you do not want to end. Eric did a great job at developing the character of the microbe and making it look "human." I loved the music and the voice used for the microbe. I look forward to seeing what Eric has in store for us in future films. This is a movie that I did not want to see end. Good job.
