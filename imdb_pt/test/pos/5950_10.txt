This is the last entry in the long series of films with the French agent, O.S.S. 117 (the French response to James Bond). The series was released in the early 1950s and spawned at least eight films (none of which were released in the US). 'O.S.S.117: Cairo, Nest Of Spies' is a joyful little comedy that should not ... repeat NO, be taken very seriously. Our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a spy chase in Egypt (with Morroco standing in Egypt) to discover a friend long lost. The following is the standard James Bond / Cloussou type of antics. Although our man is a xenophobic, sexist, homophobic, he is treated as a farce (as I said, do not take it too seriously). Although there is a bit of rough language and cartoon violence, it is basically ok for older children (ages 12 and up). As stated earlier in the subject line, just sit back, spend the popcorn and just enjoy.
