I'm a big fan of M Lillard and that's why I ended up watching this movie. I honestly doubt if he was not in the movie I would have liked it or even watched it, but once I watched, I realized the story was pretty decent. A bad ending I must say, but I've seen it coming. It's a low budget movie and some of the actors were not very good, but after all, I rated this movie 7/10. <br /> <br /> The suspense of imagining what Lillard was really doing was what really helped me. interested in this film. <br /> <br /> It's a good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
