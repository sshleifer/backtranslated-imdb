I really like the Wind and the Lion. It was a good movie. I thought since I was young and this was done a long time ago I did not like it very much, but after I saw it, I was amazed at how good it was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone I showed liked it. I liked it because it showed how Arabs and people in Morocco were treated during the early 1900s by the Germans, French and even Americans. If I were a high school history teacher, I would definitely show this to my high school student's point of view. I give this movie a good 10 out of 10. My grandparents liked it so much they bought it for themselves. My little cousins ​​of 3 years old even sat and watched. <br /> <br /> Systemoffell
