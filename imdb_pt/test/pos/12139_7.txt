I agree with all the forces mentioned in the other reviews, but here are a few beats that keep you firmly within the genre of criminal drama or film noir and limit you from being a great drama beyond the boundaries of the "elements" that make up film noir - for not say that the big movies noirs are not / may not also be great dramas, but this is not. <br /> <br /> Another note is music in the movies. the film is used sparingly but I would say it is used to accentuate the action more often than the wife's elements. <br /> <br /> A great scenario for this movie, with an abrupt end type that does not end right or discouraged depends. <br /> <br /> Spoilers follow some specificities. <br /> <br /> The great turn in history involves the children watching their mother die, or should be the great moment. But children are never shown to react in one way or another. She does not even cry, she does not ask her father what happened, the children are good actors, and her father's reactions are, I suppose, but that's a big misstep. This is the heart of the story and the children are mostly kept blank in their reaction. They really do not have any, in the next scene they look as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> In the same way, there is a bond that forms between the characters of Belmondo and Ventura. Belmondo says he knew the partner who was killed - but this is never explained and has no dramatic impact on Belmondo or anyone else. Belmondo's romantic subplot also enhances credibility, although it is convincingly acted upon. The character of Ventura lets Belmondo involve a total stranger in his plan of escape without reason. He does not even comment or seem to notice. Another gap. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie, and I will not ruin, the end happens off-screen with a shallow voice to tell what happened. I think this tries to make you feel more faithful to life, but again, like those other mistakes, you leave the drama off the screen. <br /> <br /> What's the point of not dealing with these issues? I do not know, other than that perhaps the film's goals were limited to giving the audience what it wants from a criminal melodrama - to suggest some deeper elements, then to ignore them. <br /> <br /> Bad there is a lot to recommend this movie, Ventura is very very good but very bad, it could have been a great drama as well as a crime story - as with the favorite movie of the IMDb of all times THE GODFATHER. This movie had potential. It would make a good remake, if done in the US, more problems would probably sink the film, but in the hands of the right director this would be a good remake, although it is doubtful that Ventura's performance can be overcome. <br /> /> Worth seeing, but frustrating as a whole
