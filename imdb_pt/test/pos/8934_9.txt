I have always loved Brenda Blethyn and "Undertaking Betty" was not a disappointment. I saw it on the Satellite on the sad Sunday morning. Life has been stressful and this movie made me laugh and see things we generally consider terrible in a fun way. I wish she would do more movies like this and "Saving Grace". Brenda Blethyn is a great girl to get close to 60 to see in action. She is beautiful, beautiful and full of life without seeming plastic and false. There are not many actresses out there to relate realistically, but comically and / or seriously. Brenda - if you see this - continue with stones like that. We need more Mrs. Bennetts, Bettys, and Graces.
