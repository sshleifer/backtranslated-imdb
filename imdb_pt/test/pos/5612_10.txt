Hal Hartley's entry into a number of European films is one of his two or three best efforts to date and fortunately one of the few available on DVD. At only 63 minutes in length, my only complaint would be with Hartley. I always stop wanting more, but never so much as this time. Martin Donovan is amazing as Jesus. PJ Harvey is beautiful and interesting as Magdelena, but the high point for me was Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry Fool) as Satan. Hartley gives him excellent dialogue and a chance to use his resonant voice for the full effect. Look for three scenes in which a microphone awaits you, as if a beat poetry was about to be vanquished by the devil. I read other reviews about this movie and had to add mine because there are not enough compliments out there. If you like Henry Fool, Martin Donovan in anything (Opposite of Sex) and / or very clever comedies based on biblical ideas, get this as fast as possible.
