This film has the courage to suggest that perhaps it is better to just accept your life as it is and keep smiling anyway. As someone who is more excited about the idea of ​​taking care of one's life and moving on, I felt slapped, but okay: I do not have to agree on a movie to love and respect that. Great performance by Streep and Hurt, and all the rest, and some wonderfully quirky scenes. A serious movie. And get a handkerchief.
