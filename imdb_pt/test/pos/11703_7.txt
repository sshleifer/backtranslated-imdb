I was reticent to see this movie before reading the external reviews and user comments posted here. Because? First of all, because Mick Malloy's humor may (in my humble opinion) be quite coarse and exaggerated, evidenced by his fatigue on a television show a few years ago. And secondly, because good Australian comedy films are, unfortunately, as rare as the Tassie Tiger. <br /> <br /> Sensibly, Mick restricted his natural comedic exuberance in this surprisingly watchable movie. Who would have thought a bowl club would set the stage for one of the funniest Australian movies in years. The cast is excellent with the former local veterans, all featuring credible performances. <br /> <br /> Interesting to see John Clarke playing the villain in this play. It's a one-dimensional part, but the JC still adds a touch of class, as always. It's good to see Judith Lucy also gaining a Guernsey or should see even bowls on the big screen. She is a true talent, pity that several of her answers were swearing. Your own material is much sharper. Interesting character though. Boliches reporter in a local cloth. How low in the journalist's food chain can be obtained !! <br /> <br /> Crackerjack may not be the funniest movie I've seen this year, but it's certainly enjoyable fun, which is worth taking a look at. Many other people obviously agree with me as it's going to be the highest grossing Australian film this year. It's good to see someone finally make a subtle and delicate comedy without trying to scratch their laughter like so many other Australian "comedies" before. <br /> <br /> Finally, a bit of trivia. If you're wondering which team Aussie Rules Mick supports, check the flag on your workstation. Also look for your former partner in crime, Tony Martin making the announcement in the final scene of the cups. <br /> <br /> <br />
