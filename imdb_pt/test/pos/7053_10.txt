Imagine spending the summer without your family or friends from school and meeting new people. Or, it's the first time you're a nobody and the only person you can count on is someone from the camp. "Meatballs" packs a lot of comedy in this movie. At the camp, there's an eccentric advisor (Bill Murray) who knows how boys and girls can have fun. Enter a boy named Rudy (Chris Makepeace), who has no one to admire. He does not fit with anyone, only Tripper can make him have fun. The rest of the can is as crazy as Tripper. Camp Northstar is an average campground with an above average crew. On the other hand, the Mohawk Camp is an elite camp that drives them to run for their money. At the basketball game, the Mohawks were out of their pants! And at the Olympiad, the teal Northstar got the revenge they needed when one of the members killed the saboteur. And Morty (Harvey Atkin), this poor soul can never get engaged if he tries. A comedy very, very funny, and a great guardian I will say. This movie shows that camping can be fun if you wanted to be! 5 stars!
