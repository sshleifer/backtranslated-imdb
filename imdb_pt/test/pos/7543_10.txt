There are other films about boarding schools and the antics of the students and staff, but "The Belles of St. Trinian's" tower above all! The plot has been fully summarized by other posters, so I will not cover the same terrain. I just want to say that it's a shame that it's finally on DVD, but in a format that can not be used in the USA! :-( <br /> <br /> Have fun, follow the fans in New Zealand and Australia! And if anyone who reads this has any influence on these issues, PLEASE help cast it on DVD with Region 1 coding. Also, is it possible to be notified via email when (I will not say "if") is released on DVD in the United States? Thanks!
