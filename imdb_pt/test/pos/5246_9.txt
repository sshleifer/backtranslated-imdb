John Wayne's first leading role surprised me. Mailbox style televised on AMC, I had to check and make sure I had the right date. Sure enough, this 1930 movie was made using a 55mm wide screen process. Also, it features some of the most glaring and lifelike walking scenes I've seen in the west. Wagons, men and animals are actually lowered by a cliff by a rope. The trees are cut by corpulent men - and corpulent women - so that the train can move another 10 feet. The Indians are not the smart ones of the city of "handsome boys" who portrayed them later; they are the real deal. The river crossing in a rainstorm is so realistic, it has to be real (in fact, I understand that director Raoul Walsh almost lost the entire cast during that sequence). I could smell the wet screen. Every day is an agony. The various subplots are forgettable, but the film as a whole is not. I can not think of another title that can hit the Big Trail in conjuring up a sense of vivid history on the trail to the Oregon. Angry.
