Three American boys are walking the path of Europe, daring each other to accumulate as many audacious stunts as Hot babe, but Andy seeks true love. He finds this during his bungee-jump attempt at the Eiffel Tower when he comes across and, incredibly, saves a suicidal and incredibly beautiful Julie Delpy. His attempts to find this girl and the secret he discovers take him and his friends to a quick adventure filled with action, romance, gore and inspired humor, never taking it seriously, or striving to be anything other than wildly fun. 90 minute ride. I've seen this movie several times and found it a far more rewarding experience than the original 'London', although both films are so different that it's not fair to compare the two or even consider it a sequel.
