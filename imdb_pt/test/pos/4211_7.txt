They made me a criminal is a remake of a previous Warner Brothers movie, The Life of Jimmy Dolan, which starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the boxer on the lam. <br /> <br /> Even with the restrictions now on the production of Hays Office, this remake turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is terribly miscast as a boxer. John Garfield, with his background and style, entered a role for which he was born. <br /> <br /> They made me a criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley, who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy among the musicals. In fact, Berkeley would soon leave Warner Brothers for MGM. <br /> <br /> Berkeley does a great job here, keeping the action flowing at a good pace. I particularly like the scene in which four of Dead End Kids and Garfield are swimming in a water tank and get stuck there when the water level drops. They take it out in a very narrow way and with good ingenuity. Other presentations, in addition to Garfield and the children, are May Robson, who runs the summer camp for the kids, and Claude Rains as an obsessive detective. The Garfield Trail.
