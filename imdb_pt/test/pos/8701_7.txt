King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm) of Romania is a vampire, but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with humanity. But his son, Radu (Anders Hove), is a cruel creature in his heart (which is pretty obvious as soon as you see him). Three students have come to study local folklore, but they are attracted to the vampire legends at the wrong time: Vladislav was killed. <br /> <br /> Who can say something bad about a movie with a special participation of Angus? Scrimm? I can not. I mean, I had some low expectations after seeing other photos of the Full Moon ("Puppet Master" in particular, and "Demonic Toys"). But despite the very bad animated effects of the demons, this movie was really well done and very fun to watch. So much blood, a good plot and background story (Bloodstone's story was surprisingly refreshing) and even some new angles in vampire myths, which you would think would be dead now. (Maybe I'm wrong, but this is probably the first movie to feature rosary beads being fired from a gun.) In addition to vampires and blood, you have a share of nudity (free but welcome) and I had to notice the excellent score of the composers (I'm not sure who deserves credit, but those involved include Stuart Brotman, Richard Kosinski, William Levine, Michael Portis and John Zeretzka). This is Horror 101 all the way. Heck, you still have two sequences, which is the sign of a true horror movie. (Of course, some bad films also get sequences - did I mention "Puppet Master"?) The Romanian theme was well done, and the film seems to have been made by Romanians, if I guess the origins of the names correctly. And the score - the music - really stood out to me as a good change of pace, very good mood. I like Richard Band, but I'm glad that another songwriter got shot because he hit the head. If you like vampire movies and want a slight variation (one of the varieties from Eastern Europe), it is worth seeing this.
