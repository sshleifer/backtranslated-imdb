When I watched this movie as a kid, I did not understand the premise of the Hitchcock movies and the dark comedy. Now that I'm in my twenties, it makes a lot more sense. <br /> <br /> I think the reason I like this movie so much is that the comedy duo Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito make an interesting comedy. , both slapstick (the frying pan and car scenes) and verbal (the arguments / conversations about murder and writing). The story revolves around Larry Donner (Crystal), a struggling writer who has his masterpiece stolen from him by his wife Margaret (played by a surprisingly radiant Kate Mulgrew, also known as Captain Janeway of Star Trek: Voyager). <br /> <br /> As he alternates between writer's block and creative writing teaching, he meets student Owen Lifts (DeVito), an aspiring writer and grown-up mother's son who, unfortunately, still acts like a child. He has toy train rails, need I say more? Think of Failure to Launch, only Matt McConaughey is short, fat and bald. <br /> <br /> Owen is trapped in his own life with a demanding mother of evil (Anne Ramsey) who he can not stand. He looks for Larry's advice on how to get out of it, and when he tells him to go see a Hitchcock movie, Owen gets the wrong idea that if he kills Larry's wife, he will return the favor and kill his mother for him . Joy comes as the two try to deal with each other's problems. Owen goes to extremes to kill Margaret, while Larry, who refuses to agree to make his "part of the plan", is driven to madness by Owen's mother. Throughout the film, Larry and Owen, slowly but surely, form a bond of friendship that is rare in the dark comedy nowadays. One part of the movie that I really loved was where Owen shows Larry's coin collection, and let's just say it's more of a sentimental collection than anything. <br /> <br /> The two leading stars aside, the late Anne Ramsey is hilarious as Mom, and deadly with that cane hers. She is much more comical verbally and physically in this, as opposed to her role as Mama Fratelli of The Goonies. So she curses like a sailor and despises her son with every step, but that's what makes her character so vivid. She makes your character the kind of person you love to hate. <br /> <br /> Another delight in this film is the music of the great Brandford Marsalis, who plays Larry's neighbor and friend, Lester. There is a big moment in the movie where he plays jazz for Larry, who is depressed and needs some good melodies to ease the pain. Jazz can do that. <br /> <br /> Finally, I wish Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito would do another good movie together, but they're getting too old for the game that I'm sad to say. This is one of those rare films in which both stars shine in their own subtle ways. DeVito's children's comedy and Crystal's sharp wit made this movie for me. Comedy of 5 stars.
