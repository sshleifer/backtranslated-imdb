This movie is very sick and funny. I made my friends shrink describing this to them. I saw about 8 months ago, and I still have the song 'Let's get together on the river' echoing in my head. <br /> <br /> So, basically, it's a Romeo and Juliet trot, but it goes beyond what you'd expect. Let's just say incest, references to child sexual abuse, gore (of course), but unfortunately, it has a sort of happy ending ... more or less ... it's stranger than happy. Cappy Cappy was brilliant! He has that kind of intellectual snob tone, he is abusive, but civilized. He quotes more Shakespeare than anyone else in the movie ... as he engages in his sadistic role as husband and father. <br /> <br /> The meat guy was pretty cool, too. He was Juliet's fianc√©, deeply in love with her, and soon would be heartbroken over Tromeo. And Tromeo, a true romantic. He is a handsome guy, very sweet, desperate to find true love. 'She makes torches to burn brightly!' Unfortunately Troma had only to resort to horrible vicious green fake and other mischief. They really get carried away with these things sometimes. But, hey, this movie made a great impression on me. How many times do I mean it in real life situations ... wow, that's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enjoy!
