This is my fourth review of a Charlie Chan movie in chronological serial order on these consecutive days. This is also my first review of one I've seen previously, but it's been around for 24 years since then, so I do not really remember that much. In this, the Honolulu detective is investigating an espionage ring that was initially tracked by an ex-known Scotland Yard who appeared missing in the Big Apple ... This is the best of the Chan entries I have seen so far in the current memory with each track being connected (although, of course, if I look at them on a more detailed examination, there may still be some holes, although I can not think of any right now). And "No. 2 Son" Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) is of some help when he identifies the poison that results in some murders at the beginning, although, of course, he made a mistake later. Among the return cast of Chan's latest film, Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum, are Joan Valerie's blonde like June Preston and Stanley Blystone, whose brother John G. commanded a Chan Chan named Charlie Chan's Chance as a fingerprint specialist. Nice intrigue especially with an exciting climax aboard a plane-bomber. Oh, and watch out for a certain Stooge on a police line ...
