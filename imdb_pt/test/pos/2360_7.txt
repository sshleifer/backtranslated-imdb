Black Day Blue Night was actually a good modern noir. Three young nomads fleeing their own lives unite in a kind of desert journey in the middle of nowhere (as most modern noir do). A woman discovers that her husband is cheating on her, and after finding him in a hotel room, decides to back off and start over. Strangely, she travels with her husband's lover, who is forgivable, since the sleazebag never told her that he was married. And together, as they drive in the rain, they find a third very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets. While they are dumb and free and all suspicious of each other, police officers back to the city identify them as suspects in the death of a police officer. <br /> <br /> The Black Night of Blue Night begins with an immediate confrontation, and launches a very good story with all its twists to deceive its suspicions of one character after another, leading to a very unusual end. That is, the movie starts with an immediate action showdown, and once you think the story is resolved, you are immediately pushed to another turn, revealing a bit more than expected before the movie ends. <br /> <br /> But, as some viewers have written, the ending is a bit confusing and a bit disappointing. The killer is not who you would expect immediately and, once revealed, becomes a bit confusing due to a well-explained flashback that reveals all the reason needed to solve the mystery. But in fact, there is a final addition that I think is the most interesting in the movie. Because the modern noir always involves a circle of suspected criminals, almost always all guilty of something, it is also a genre that always involves money. And so the question in these films always becomes - how far are the characters willing to go for money? <br /> <br /> If you like this version of the modern noir movie, I suggest watching Red Rock West (it's also got JT Walsh and some indo-ons in the damn desert)!
