This is one of those cartoons of Tweety and Sylvester that have made this legendary pair so close to Bugs Bunny in terms of popularity of Looney Tunes. <br /> <br /> In addition to having all the stock situations for this duo (Sylvester feeding off junk cans, the "I tawt I taw a putty tat" line, etc.), Tweety's SOS also stars Granny, which is one of those types of supporting characters that these classic Warner Bros had in abundance to enrich the color and flavor of them. This time the cat and the bird are aboard a transatlantic and the jokes that are drawn from this situation are creative and animated. <br /> <br /> What a day that was in cartoon history when Friz Freleng decided to pair his Sylvester. with the yellow bird of Robert Clampett.
