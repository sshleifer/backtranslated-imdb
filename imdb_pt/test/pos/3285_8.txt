This was a good episode. Although there was no "Trapped in the Closet" or "Cartoon Wars," there were many things for that. Al Gore's character and that bizarre "super cereal thing" was pretty funny. But the scene that made me love this episode was one that I'm sure everyone will agree upon was one of Cartman / Kyle's greatest moments of all time. When Cartman is Kyle's superstitious, he will be stealing his gold (which, of course, is fake!), And he appears within inches of his face. Suddenly, Kyle wakes up, and they have that crazy conversation where Cartman tries to act as if everything is completely alright. Cartman hiding the treasure in the end, though predictable, was quite funny.
