Somehow, this movie penetrated into the weak point of my heart. Do not ask me how that happened, but I suppose having the film will feature Ed "I'll Sponsor Anything," McMahon, as a crack-crawler looking tail has a little bit to do with it. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was disappointed with Slaughter's first outing in 1972. Nothing more than a quick launch to follow Shaft-mania. How does the sequel move away from that? Big Jim Brown looks stronger as Slaughter here than at first. Maybe this was due to the fact that a year later he had something to work on instead of his simple "Be as Axis" motivation before. <br /> <br /> The most striking part of the film is the soundtrack provided by number one pimp-daddy, James Brown. Almost every scene is graced with a touch of funk by the godfather. An excellent vintage film, for music, wardrobe, vehicles, jargon and hair. I should also point out that this film is also an excellent period film to represent a time in film history when Jim Brown and Ed McMahon could actually GROW hair. <br /> <br /> Bend the cubs, double the blow, triple the count of bodies and factor in Ed McMahon and James Brown. You'll be in a hell of a 1970s action movie, and one that beats its predecessor no less. For my money, Slaughter's Big Rip-Off can play ball with any Blaxploitation movie ever made. Even shaft. You probably disagree, but Slaughter's Big Rip-Off has its own distinct feel. Something the original was missing.
