The TEP is like a long drink of water after crawling through the Sahara for fans of classic movies that have long lacked such cinematic magic! Not only is it beautifully photographed, but the characters are perfectly portrayed. If you are looking for the movie to be a mirror of the book, you will be seriously disappointed. Instead, he's an excellent "companion" to the book, and I think that's what Anthony Minghella intended. Ralph Fiennes is probably the most handsome man in the world; not to mention a brilliant actor. Juliette Binoche is an example of child vulnerability and enthusiasm. And of course, I'm going to watch any movie that Kristin Scott Thomas is introduced to. She simply must be the best actress since the likes of Deborah Kerr. So much was promised with this movie, and both are delivered!
