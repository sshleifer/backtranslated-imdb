This is my favorite horror movie, a second close to 'Poltergeist'. I saw 'One Dark Night' when it first appeared in theaters in 1983 at the theater where I worked. <br /> <br /> I was born in 1963, so I have a certain love for the horror films of the 80's, even though they are a bit dated and the dialogue is not well written. What I found so original was that the phenomenon of 'psychic vampirism' was not addressed (at least to my knowledge at the time) and is a very real phenomenon. <br /> <br /> I did not. It did not matter if Adam West was in it (nothing against him, but his supporting role was not memorable), but he thought Meg Tilly was good at the cast. The little-known Donald Hutton (from 'Brainstorm' and 'Invaders From Mars') as an ambitious scientist who oversaw studies on Ramar's abilities was sadly neglected. As a gay guy, I was paying more attention to David Mason Daniels, Meg Tilly's unhappy but cute boyfriend. He's selling real estate in Texas now. <br /> <br /> I felt the film "realistic" in two ways: Raymar, who was found to have murdered 6 girls in his surreal apartment, had a funeral that was meager in attendance, reflecting the fact that not only was he mysterious, a hermit, but a murderer. As you know, these guys are buried without fanfare. Second, if the corpses were telekinetically mobile, they would hover, dragging their feet. The filmmakers could have gone to the sllock walking, moaning, zombies with outstretched arms, but opted for what would be believable. Congratulations! The electric flutter buzzing from Ramar's eyes in his "throne coffin" (as if he were overseeing his dead kingdom) cast a mysterious magenta light into the mausoleum that will stay with you for years! If you've ever been to a mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you'll notice that they have their own rosetta lighting caused by stained glass. Do not make me begin the cavernous silence. Even Ramar himself looked like someone who could pass like an eccentric, perverted old man. The score was unique and memorable, and I keep kicking myself for not putting it on the tape when it first came out. The recording of the trail was done where it should have been. I especially liked the carefully planned features of each corpse: the bride, the severely decomposed child still holding her teddy bear, her grandmother, the tall, thin black man, the World War II veteran, and the slender eye. an elderly gent who was the first to greet the initiators of the "Sisters" clique. Even corpses can be good actors, I suppose. The only thing I had to moan about was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and suffocating Julie's boyfriend could not be done unless a corpse was placed on the stomach and feet first, but why? It looked a bit too cool too. <br /> <br /> The movie starts out weird, with we never seeing Ramar's face (up to the last quarter of the movie, which is like unwrapping a birthday present) while he's catching the teenager. girl fugitives in her daughter 's psychic flash. Then we see medical forensics pulling his body away in his one-bedroom apartment, where we see that he experienced his telekinetic craft by placing dishes on his wall. The rest drag on when the group of "Sisters", like heather, impels Julie to a final initiation, spending the night inside the mausoleum, but it is a well-placed accumulation for the subsequent triggering horror. The film is not bloody in any sense of the word. The craziest part is when Ramar's daughter uses a compact mirror to feed her power back to him, and it bubbles and melts. I always felt that a power like Ramar's could never die and a sequel could be worth investigating. I can see now: One Dark Night II: Turning into the grave. But let's face it: the movie is alone. I heard that the movie had other titles but the original fits. <br /> <br /> A remake would be useless. But if there was one, I would write a better dialogue and prolong some scenes, such as showcase studies of Ramar's abilities made in the laboratory instead of hearing about it on a tape recorder. In this information age, something like that would be well documented on DVD. And more corpses! Why only raise them in the mausoleum when the power of Ramar could spread to the graveyard as well? Let's just say that I would hate to be one of the people who had to clear the mess at the end of the climax; something that can also be shown. I think having one of the Initiating Sisters recognizing one of the corpses as a relative would have added some good, albeit troubling, character. With CG effects, some stunning scenes with Ramar animating cremated remains would be out of reach! <br /> <br /> Say what you like, 'One Dark Night', but it has everything. So, see at least once in your life ... or death!
