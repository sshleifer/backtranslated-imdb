The best years of our lives are often compared to a wonderful life. They should never be. Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that has led millions of lives. It is difficult to know what value individual life can have. (How many people know that 1 out of 22 people have been violently lost in the last century? What statistics do we have to live with?) Also our feelings about the war have changed in 60 years. We progressively stop thinking that war is fair if the enemy is right to believe that no war is totally fair, especially those that were fought recently. <br /> <br /> I've been a pacifist life. I oppose every war. Not long ago I had this position tested. It occurred while I was at the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship required a crew of 3 or 4 times the community in which I live. It's a powerful experience, moving on your decks. She had seen a lot of action. Someone gave me the right to be a pacifist and was not bought cheap. <br /> <br /> I can not watch the best years of our lives without thinking of things like Lexington. <br /> <br /> The three veterans paid their debts. And they paid mine too. <br /> <br /> None of them came out easier than any other. The Navy, the Air Force and the Army paid equally, albeit in different ways. Each of them had problems directly related to the war. And each had to work very hard to overcome those difficulties. It took more courage to face the civilian environment than to deal with the war, because each had to do it on its own. Each could understand and sympathize with the problem of others: in the end, no one could help. <br /> <br /> The moving part of the movie (this may be the initial part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male tracks found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told the Herald to marry the girl. Do not hesitate, do it tomorrow. It's hard for Harold to believe that anyone could love him when he was a football hero and a pre-war athletic star. But to his credit, Harold hears. <br /> <br /> The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Mend your relationship with your wife? standard for 30/40 films. Derry did not discuss the point: he felt he was not fit for Al's daughter. Then he nodded. The truth of the film comes out when we consider that the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real emotions of real people. I think our time has deep problems with feelings and feelings and honor. Sometimes I think we believe that these values ​​do not exist. That's why the people who look at this movie have problems. <br /> <br /> Al is not free from advice he does not want totally. Every time his boss talks to him, Al gets tied up in us. And rightly so. There are some things that can not be judged by occupational patterns: they must be judged by huge general intangibles, and only someone tested by the severity of life would understand what these intangible goods are. <br /> <br /> All this leads to a near-end scene where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, discarded, and soon recycled: their function, value, and pride as translucent as their own Derry. He can overcome this translucency that he does, making him fit, in his mind, to the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> I gave the best years of our lives to 10 and there are few movies that I feel so over. This is not a movie for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are privileged to see something as private as the lives of these wonderful people. We must be careful not to abuse this privilege.
