For the record, the 1949 version of "The Blue Lagoon" is not the original movie, as many have claimed. <br /> <br /> This story was filmed in Britain in 1923, shortly after the novel was written. As much as I enjoyed watching the 1949 version, I would love an opportunity to see the true original release of this story on film. <br /> <br /> Granted, the 1980 movie with Christopher Atkins, Brooke Shields and the two young men were filmed with beautiful cinematography. The acting does not look so good when I first saw this movie, but having seen it a few times ... it becomes obvious that two kids growing up on an island without adult guidance, in fact, would have a simplistic do that. approaching life ... whether in their language, appearance or daily activities. <br /> <br /> Although some have been lucky enough to see the 1949 Blue Lagoon, I can not help wondering if there is anyone alive who remembers the 1923 launch of this story to film.
