There are, as many comments have noted, a strong shadowy trait for this film. The director who most reminds me is John Landis (yes, go ahead and howl about what a peasant I am). Arcand has the gift of exploring frivolous things in a half-dark and somber way, then turning around and exploring the horrors of life with a light touch. <br /> <br /> The cast is, without exception, above average. Thomas Gibson, like David, is remarkable as the grumpy, self-deceptive center around which the rest of the characters revolve. He speaks a good nihilist, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to acknowledge. Gibson was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993. It was hard to look at him and see Greg Montgomery, let alone Hotchner agent of Criminal Minds. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's not the best scene, but the one I like best, my "backstage scene" is the section where Candy is waiting for a visitor, and one uninvited person after another shows up at the door . As Candy's interpersonal environment shifts further from control, David becomes more and more excited, enthusiastic and enthusiastic, like a thin "Tigger" from Gen-X.
