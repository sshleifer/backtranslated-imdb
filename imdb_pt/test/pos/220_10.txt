After reading all of these comments I am very surprised to see that no one even noticed since this show was based on the 1957 to 1960 NBC "M Squad" police officer, starring Lee Marvin, I read comments comparing him with "Dragnet" and some Quinn Martin cops show, but if you watch M Squad, you'll see it was based on that. At the end of 1958 M Squad episodes onwards, you will see Lee Marvin who plays Lieutenant Detective Frank Ballinger get out of his car and then he is shot, and he shoots back, the beginning of the police squad is basically the (including Detective Lieutenant Frank Ballinger, M Squad, a special department of the Chicago police) and in the Police Leslie Neilsen does the same (Im Detective Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Squadron of Police, a special division of the Police Department) and so on, in one of the M Squad episodes there is even the Johnny the shoe shin character and in an M Squad episode titled "More Mortal" there is an episode of the police squad entitled "A Substantial Gift (The Broken Promise) "which is the same story!
