I did not know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew I had a group of followers, but I also saw many of the director's later works which, while deliciously bloody, were also quite incoherent. DO NOT TORTURE DUCKLING actually had a linear plot and a mystery that kept me guessing almost to the end. And after all said and done, it was a genuinely disturbing and chilling experience. A big caveat: I'd rather hear the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
