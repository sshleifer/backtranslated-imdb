NORTHFORK is above all a widescreen cinematography masterpiece. That's why the film is worth your time. The vast plains and arid lands of eastern Montana are captured in the soft and spare tones of autumn or early spring. The gigantic gray cement Fort Peck Dam is the protagonist of the film. The film comments subtly and not so subtly on a dozen issues of Western Landscape. The dialogue may be trying at times, but the images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the movie. The period of 1950 works so well here and it runs so well. I think the years will be nice with this movie.
