An excellent thriller of all time. Vijay Anand excels as a director and editor. Performances by Dev Anand, Vyjayantimala, Tanuja and Ashok Kumar prove to be a trump card for the film that has its script worked in the smallest details. Cinematography increases the mystery, glamor, and other requirements of the story as it evolves. And to top it off, Sachin Dev Burman's song is unforgettable. "Yeh dil na hota bechara" by Kishore Kumar, "Raat akeli hai" by Asha Bhosle, "Rula ke gaya sapna mera" by Lata, "Aasman ke niche" by Lata and Rafi and "Hothon pe aisi baat main" by Lata, reaffirm again the unique stature of Burman Given as a first-rate composer with his own style.
