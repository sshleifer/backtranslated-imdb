The film Classe tous risques, directed by Claude Sautet, was not a film, to be honest, I had heard of the Film Forum in New York saying they would have a two-week screening of the film, with new English subtitles. When I also read that it was in the vein of the classic French crime films to Jean Pierre Melville, I grabbed the chance to take a look (at best he would classify himself with his great works, and at worst I would get something good popcorn in a large theater). It was well worth the admission, as Classe tous risques is one of those French films that is just waiting to be rediscovered (or discovered for the first time). With tense and formidable diligence, Sautet keeps the suspense in a stiff tone for the first forty minutes of the film, maintaining a good (if not great) middle section and then ending with what is always expected with these films, but with fascinating motivations through the characters. With a movie in that vein, you know how it's going to end, but it's the cool, observational journey that counts. The film presents a performance with some truth and honesty, amid the "old school" criminal code, by Lino Ventura as Aldo, who at the beginning of the film (one of the best beginnings of a film in this genre and country) steals a good amount of money with your partner in crime). When there is a sudden and ugly twist of fate on a late-night beach, Aldo is again running away with two small children. He gets the help of Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo, a role in tune with Le Doulos with just a little more humanity and charisma), who is also a thief and takes him to Paris. But there are some problems with some of Aldo's former business partners, and an old result may be the right ticket. A couple of times the plot may seem to be slow, but it is not. Like Melville, Sautet does not allow any fat to his story, and it's a very well structured film with some good humor here and there (sometimes I was smiling at the audacity of the criminals following the persecution at the beginning, and also with a woman in particular who had a pampered thing with her cat and a fish). <br /> <br /> Along with an excellent trail of the great George Delerue, exceptional cinematography and a humor rarely found, much less now adays, Classe tous risques is a reminder of that bridge between the true film-noir of the old school and the police films of the last days. Gangsters in this new type of "life-bandit" movie has a thousandth of the class and honor of the thieves in this film, and it's a second banana for the works of Melville and Jules Dassin (a compliment I assure you). Having a good moral and realistic edge helps as well.
