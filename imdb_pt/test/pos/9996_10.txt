This film gives the golf a high note, was well represented and well directed. Giving you a glimpse into the story that some non-sporting fans will enjoy. The historical factor only gives it a high rating, the Brookline golf course was really well done. I'm in the northeast and I've seen Brookline as a fan, and as someone who loves the game. The film was well done on all levels. A must see 5 stars. The acting was superb, Disney has another winner in their bag of great movies. If for no other reason, watch the movie to give hope and encouragement to young people who may not see hope in their lives. I would tell you that setting while in the late 1800's and early 1900's is very realistic. The costumes and the dialect were also well on the mark. Above and beyond the call of duty for a golf movie. Must do for fans and not fans.
