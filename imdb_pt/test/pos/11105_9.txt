For the 1980s, this is a very dark film. At this point, filmmakers were beginning to believe that all films require comic relief (which, of course, is taken to the extreme today), flashy action scenes (even more exaggerated nowadays) or hot sex scenes. Hutton and Penn are stupendous in their roles as childhood friends who have become Soviet spies. Penn, in particular, is brilliant as the hapless drug dealer Daulton Lee. <br /> <br /> What you have here is a real thriller / drama. There is nothing special to talk about, but the story is so compelling and the performance so superb that (hopefully) most people would not miss it. There are some fun scenes, especially one in which Penn tries to get his Soviet benefactors involved in a major DruMar agreement. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
