I know that to include everything in the book, the movie would have to last for several hours, so I think they did their best to include things that were crucial and essential to the story. I thought the cast was great, the children who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the guy who played Amir as an adult was great! The scenes between him and Baba were especially touching. I thought the places they used were interesting ... scenes set in Afghanistan were filmed in China, and a scene that happened in Fremont, CA (the graduation scene) was filmed on Treasure Island in San Francisco. I worked one day as an extra on "Kite Runner" and it was that day, the day they filmed the graduation scene. We reported to Treasure Island in the morning as they checked everyone's wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late 80s, so we took our seats in the audience. They filmed the scene over and over again until they were happy about it. It was cool to see the actors up close and also see the author of the book, which was available as a story consultant. I thought this book was great and I recommend both the book and the movie to anyone. This is a poignant story about friendship, love, guilt, and eventual redemption. "There's a way to be good again."
