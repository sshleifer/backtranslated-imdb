This movie can make you cooooo. The movie was worth the dark trip to the city. Betty (Ren√©e Zellweger) is the only "acceptable" soap groupie out there. Your character is so charming and so convincing that you forgive her for being such an idiot. I may even allow myself to lose myself in Betty's lovely fantasy if it were not for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George ... And talking about the devil; "looker" Greg Kinnear fills his role very well. While Charlie (Morgan Freeman) makes you wish your wish come true, Wesley (Chris Rock) makes you want to tie him to a chair. And Rosa (Aunt Texada) takes you back to those bright school friendships. The sheriff encourages you to feed him with donuts and drop his name. The rest of the cast fits well. Never one to do the same movie twice, Nurse Betty is the exception. One of those long, cold ones, needing to smile about something on the winter days.
