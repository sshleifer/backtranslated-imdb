This hilarious and brilliant comedy about the school antics is a neglected gem. The important question is where is the audience? The film is rated 10 by the majority of voters, but how many voters are they? They do not do comedies like that because the films are not distributed or seen. I would never miss a chance to see this old art classic again. But where are the art houses?
