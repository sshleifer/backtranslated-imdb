This is possibly the most perfect movie I have ever seen - in acting, adaptation and direction. It's self-contained and one of a kind, so there's no point in saying it's better or worse than other great movies, only that it can hold itself as a perfect work of art. <br /> <br /> And it was fun to see confused horror fans getting up and leaving!
