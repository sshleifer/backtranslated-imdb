If you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes, this cartoon is not for you. But if you are strongly interested in seeing a rare piece of wartime animation, come on in! <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, Popeye is patrolling the seas and discovers what appears to be a Japanese fishing boat. The two Japanese fishermen make Popeye think that they want a signed peace treaty. But appearances can deceive; the fishing boat turns out to be a Japanese navy ship! What follows is considered today as an advertising that drives morale. <br /> <br /> Be warned, the representations of the Japanese in the movie are made in a mean way. Keep in mind, however, that there was a war going on at the time. But I strongly recommend this cartoon to those who are interested in the era of World War II.
