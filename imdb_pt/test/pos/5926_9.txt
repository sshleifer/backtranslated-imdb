The impossible word has led many to select a particular view on any incredible task. In 1927, it was believed that no man could fly the breath of the Atlantic Ocean. Many tried, but failed and some even gave their lives for the effort. However, it had to be done, because every challenge must be faced with equal determination. Such then is the heart of this movie called "The Spirit of St. Louis". The actor chosen for this historical film is none other than James Stewart himself, who plays Charles Lindbergh convincingly. Although there are many facets of Lindbergh's life, the segment presented here is his efforts to be the first man to fly across the Atlantic. The story is interesting and for fans of Stewards, to say the least. Seeking sufficient funds to build a special aircraft, for the fateful decision to start the journey on a bleak day in May 1927, "Luck Lindy" as he was baptized, endured huge risks, which are presented in this superb film. Other notables who have helped make this film believable are Murray Hamilton, who plays Bud Gurney, Bartlett Robinson as Ben Mahoney, Arthur Space and Charles Watts as O.W. Schultz. The sum total of this now famous movie is that, despite the poor endorsement in its debut, it has become a classic in its own right. Well done! ****
