This was essentially a remake of "Diagnosis Murder" minus Victoria Rowell, Scott Baio & Charlie Schlatter. Dick is playing a university professor who teaches Criminology 101 and can not even find his own classroom. Barry is now a private detective, not related to Dick. This allows Barry to shoot at guys running away from him, which a cop can not do. Barry still has the girl at the end. Tracey Needham portrays the girl. She is the main suspect and Dick and Barry believe she is innocent and proves it. That's all the spoiler you get. The ending is unexpected enough and you do not know it in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not take it seriously. Do not criticize that. Just sit back and enjoy Dick and Barry Van Dyke.
