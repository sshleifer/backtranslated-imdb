George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unknown hero of his generation. No one mentions Cukor at the same time as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder, and yet looks at his filmography. "A Double Life" a big semi-western "Heller in Pink Tights" not to mention "My Fair Lady" or "Travel with my" Aunt "He was in the service of his actors, he never stood in front of the camera. I feel a certain tenderness watching the flashes of the old master's "Rich and Famous" still very much in evidence. Candice Bergen gives us for the first time in her career glimpses of the wonderful comedian she was about to become. Jacqueline Bisset is a setback to the days of Greer Garson and Loretta Young and Hart Bochner comes in, teasing us, promising something spectacular that will eventually materialize in 1989 with "Apartment Zero" Meg Ryan, since Bergen's daughter is already Meg Ryan. Curious as the formula is, it's still a Cukor movie and, from what I see, one of Almod√≥var's favorite films.
