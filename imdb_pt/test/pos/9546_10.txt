I'm salivating by the strings. I needed something to keep me from going crazy with tension, anxiety (and if it is not so good?!) And lack of constant information. I needed something to calm me down, something to pass the time, plus, of course, Matrix. This was just the thing. <br /> <br /> I found it informative (like the part about Keanu's neck ...) and a bit was funny. I felt sorry for Carrie-Anne soooo when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys. I found only one problem with that. Since 95% of the people were actually male, they just let their mouths go wildly, and there was language in them. It's not as bad as the cursing of The Shawshank Redemption runs, but that one scene was Keanu's describing a bad day, turn your ears on if you're small. It was fun and it was exactly what I needed. That's what all the Matrix fans who are going crazy need to keep them quiet. They mention a little bit about the sequences, and someone almost gives something, but he catches himself in time (shoot!). It gives almost no spoilers, but it's great to have if you're a Matrix Head like me. <br /> <br /> There is no spoon.
