Bonny Hunt gets a blow with her debut in the direction. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have that nondescript chemistry thing. Of course the plot is unlikely, but that does not stop anyone enjoying this movie. Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather. Other great actors play their card friends. Jim Belushi is hilarious as Megan's down-to-earth husband, part of the extended family. <br /> <br /> Faith, family and marriage are respected. Some sexual references and salty words are used, but in context and with mild humor. <br /> <br /> And deep down, that wonderful Dean Martin tunes - "Return to Me". <br /> <br /> Recommended.
