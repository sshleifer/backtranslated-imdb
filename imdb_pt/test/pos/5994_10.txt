I'm slowly opening as many Hong Kong action movies as I could get my hands on and I came across this jewel - mainly due to Ching Wan Lau, who is one of my favorite actors. <br /> <br /> It's a great action movie, although not as OTT as the title might suggest. It moves at great speed and is really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise of this movie was the soundtrack. It seems Rob Dougan - the guy who made the song 'Clubbed To Death', which was popular in 'The Matrix', lifted the soundtrack of Big Bullet and compiled it in one of the tracks of his album 'Furious Angels'; The song in question is called "I'm not driving anymore" and it's also the opening song from the TV series "Law and Order" and the opening track on the "DVD Matrix Reloaded" menu! This really surprised me, due to the absolute coincidence!
