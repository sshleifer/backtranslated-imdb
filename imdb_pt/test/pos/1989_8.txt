eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, in which the characters run from kingdom to kingdom, from landscape to landscape, trying to win a game that does not know the goal or exactly where they are taking them. Within this virtual reality game there are more layers of virtual reality games, questioning the reality of which they come is the "real". <br /> <br /> Of course it is not spectacular to hide the fact that it will not respond reasonably to a real reality, instead, playing the idea of ​​whether it is real or a video game in question, to the end. I'm not even sure if Cronenberg pretends the twist will not be there, it's so incredibly obvious that, in a way, it's kind of disconcerting. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film, though, is its basic nature, in a sense. . Cronenberg is questioning reality and criticizing the game. However, the same things he uses to criticize the game delight him: violence, discontinuity, lack of focus and, in a sense, pixelation, even if there is no such pixelation in the film. I once heard someone claim that Cronenberg's violence is actually a critique of media hyper-violence, but he hides well with having such incredible pleasure in tearing out new holes in humans, animals, and amorphous cells of biological mud. <br /> <br /> What is brilliantly written and made about this movie is the use of videogame concepts (not being able to say exactly what you mean during the scenes, relative lack of environment or surroundings that do not make sense, only a few people around where one feels there must be many and vice versa, all these things) along with the reason for penetration. It definitely deconstructs the reality of the video game in a way that is nauseating and absurd, but it enhances it even more by replacing video game electronics with literal "pods" of biological matter that twist and turn and are, frankly, disgusting to the most gruesome grades. For what it's worth, this movie provokes a reaction on you. <br /> <br /> But for what? Criticizes the virtual reality, but it is a film: it is its own virtual reality. It seems to criticize the banality of the plot lines of the videogame and the design of personages, but maintains this banality. It definitely seems to worry if killing a video game character is more certain than killing a real human being and how video games can be confused with reality and make people not think about the consequences of their actions in real life. once again, the greatest pleasure of tearing people, objects, beasts, things and organisms in pieces of blood. <br /> <br /> So while he has a major focus of anguish, he really does not do anything about it. , Not really. All he does is present this anguish in such an original way that it can not really be denied its own moment of splendor. <br /> <br /> In a sense, it would be so much easier simply to hate this movie. for being bloody and violent, because there is no good reason why I can see it by loving it, and yet I can not dismiss it as mediocre or bad. It would be easier simply to not be able to accept, but as long as I can, there is nothing I can really do with it. I believe it's a bit excessive, it really does not have to go as far as it was, but Cronenberg's intentions are so confusing and confusing that I do not know if that was Cronenberg's fault or Cronenberg's point, and I do not know. I think there's really some way to find out, except maybe ask him directly. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
