What a show! Lorenzo Lamas once again proves his talent as a cop who has committed the worst crime a good cop can commit, being a good cop. Then again, it shows how sensitive a cop can be, exhibiting a range of emotions like no other actor can, except perhaps, himself in the justice of the Terminal. <br /> <br /> HUGE HUGE!
