Like the five-year-old protagonists of his latest work, Hayao Miyazaki's "Ponyo" delights with his rampant innocence as if the anime-meister became a child in weaving a narrative that delights in its simplicity and emits a contagious charm in the process. . Miyazaki, reminiscent of his earlier works, paints a brightly colored world, obviously aimed at younger audiences, and the raw effervescence cheerfully removes the shadowy thematic elements that distinguish his immediate predecessors. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (kindly dubbed by Yuria) Nara), a fish with the face of a young girl (making her look like a cute little child in a rose-colored Halloween costume), runs away from her submerged house and his sibling school to explore the surface. Stranded on land, she is rescued by Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), a five-year-old boy who, along with his mother Risa (Tomoko Yamaguchi), lives in a house on the nearby cliff. This initial encounter, and eventually friendship, has a profound effect on Ponyo, who now wishes to become human, but by falling inadvertently, inclines the balance of nature and unleashes a whirlwind on earth. With the help of Sosuke, Ponyo must pass a test to end this curse and become completely human. <br /> <br /> Despite the plot without the philosophical sophistication of, say, his latest "Spirited Away", "Ponyo" is nothing less than a surprising accompaniment, characterized by extremely diligent attention to detail and masterful balance the real and the fantastic, and the simple joys and great fears. It is a direct tale that, although sometimes stopped by its tendency to ramble as a child, keeps in tune with its juvenile pedigree to magically enchant. "I'll protect you," Sosuke tells Ponyo naturally, a childlike statement not unlike the way Miyazaki endows his story with an artistic spirit.
