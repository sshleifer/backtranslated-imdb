Director's film Mikhail Kalatozov, The Cranes are Flying (Letyat zhuravli), is a glorious piece of cinema. From the script of Viktor Rozov, based on his own play, Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering of those who stayed at home. Flooded with countless war movies showing us the front lines and carnage, the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable. However, this Russian yolk shows how the story of difficulties can be told in a different way; telling us directly from the mouth of a soldier how the war is hated by all, that they hope that those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of the struggle, we see a new vision of World War II. We have volunteer lads to make the war for peace, to keep their families and their loved ones at home instead of recruits who fight in a battle in which they do not believe. With so much hatred for our current situation in the Middle East, and as people are dying for no reason against their will, it is good to see a film that shows how selfless and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those awaiting their return. <br /> <br /> Communist Russia shows how everyone was involved. in war. While Boris may have volunteered to go to the front lines, his father is the chief physician of a hospital helping in the repair of wounded soldiers and his sister is helping there, as well as his girlfriend Veronika, doing everything he can to keep his mind away from the fact that no letter came from his love. A whole city goes out to send the boys in celebration. Even the factory to which Boris and his friend Stepan work send representatives with gifts of gratitude. Whether that's all a glorified look at Russia at the beginning of World War II or not, I do not know. There are no protests or insults from these boys risking their lives for a country, it's all praise and thanks. Some in America could learn a lesson from this, because whether you agree to war at hand or not, protesting and wreaking havoc on your behalf only tarnish what these men and women are sacrificing every day. <br /> <br /> The performance is top notch, but some deserve to stand out. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris's grandmother. She is the only family member he can trust and his sadness on leaving is very evident on his face and his body language. Vasili Merkuryev, like the patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich, brings what is perhaps the best performance. As spoken in the end, about parents needing to contain the hidden tears, Merkuryev synthesizes these feelings. He puts on a tough exterior, especially telling jokes and riding his hard son when he finds out about his volunteering just a few hours before he leaves. But when Boris leaves for the police station, we see the man's real pain, sitting sadly at the table. He loves his son very much and although he may not be able to show it to him, his actions throughout the film express him to the audience. Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris, a carefree and idealistic young man, doing what he believes to be right, and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the villain Mark, staying at home because of his talented piano skills, or maybe just to steal love of your cousin. This love, played by Tatyana Samojlova, really attracts the public to their sadness, discouragement and hopefulness. The true star of the film, she must go through many emotions on a journey in which she loses herself, needing to return on the course, hoping she has done so soon for Boris' return. <br /> <br /> In addition to the realism of the story, in addition to not being afraid to use the tragedy to convey the theme, I also loved the visual style of the film. The cinematography of Sergei Urusevsky is incredible, especially when one considers that the film was filmed in full screen. It's one thing to create impressive compositions in a widescreen panorama; It is completely different to do it in a square frame. From the beginning, we have a beautiful static image of a winding walkway along the water, a bridge at the bottom at the top, while our two lovers jump to the screen and into the distance. There are multiple instances of the camera behind the barriers, but still allowing the action to be seen, creating unique depth and interest at all times. Sharp angles are used, as well as careful locks to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters on the board together. <br /> <br /> The actual deeds, however, are those cases of the long shot. Used right at the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers, she is magnificent at first, as she traverses those who bid farewell to their loved ones as she searches for Boris, her own farewell needing to be said. Planning for this scene must have been extensive because, although it comes in and out of people, the camera focuses on kissing couples, people yelling at each other and more, all purposely on the scene at specific times as the camera moves. Everyone needed to hit their mark accurately and that leads to a brilliant piece of cinema. It is only part of a general masterpiece of tone and style; The cranes are flying shows how successful positioning and mise en sc√®ne can be in showing the public what it needs in the simplest possible way. The composition and professionalism of the actors and the team can do wonders by adding something that giant pieces and special effects can never do.
