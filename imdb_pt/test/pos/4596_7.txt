Many things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically funny than really funny (although it has a few moments of laughter), but a lot of it is because it seems to have been cut by the studio to better attract exactly idiots is mocking. Many situations are not allowed to develop, there is obvious overdubbing of expository material, and worst of all, a narrator explains everything (most of which does not need explanation), probably because some pre-audience did not understand what was happening. In other words, a movie about idiocy was ... you guessed it. <br /> <br /> We hope a better and longer version of this comedy ends up appearing on DVD, and it will become the culture's favorite. deserves to be, but even in that mutilated and somewhat comed-for-diminished form is one of the most memorable movies of the year - a cry of disgust against our culture and all the ways in which it became trash, stupid and ugly in the name of appeal to yahoos. I watched right after Land of the Dead, the latest version of George Romero's only idea that consumer = zombies, which is basically the same point the judge is making; yet where the view of Romero's counterculture (now zombies = subclass that must revolt against the rich) seems desperately outdated, Judge's opinion is new, dead, and much more disturbing. Just listen to the yahoos in your movie audience shouting at President Camacho's State of the Union, just like your counterparts on the screen, and you'll know we're all doomed.
