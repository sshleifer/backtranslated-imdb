THE MAR NO INTERIOR (2004) **** Javier Bardem, Belen Rueda, Lola Duenas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Joan Dalmau, Alberto Jiménez, Tamar Novas, Francesc Garrido, José Maria Pou, Alberto Amarilla, Nicolas Fernández Luna. : Alejandro Amenabar) <br /> <br /> An inspiring tale of a living death; Bardem is superb. <br /> <br /> The real-life account of the Spanish quadriplegic Ramon Sampedro and his petition to satisfy his desire for euthanasia for the right to die may not be considered a likely source of inspiration, but this film is just that . Sampedro (superbly interpreted by Bardem) was a virile and energetic young man when he lost his limbs after a tragic diving accident (recounted horribly in flashback with a visceral jerk in the senses) and for almost thirty years they were paralyzed in bed while his loving family took care of all his needs. Although his ability to move was nil, his mind was very active and tried as an inventor, poet, author, and artist who kept his mind occupied until he could no longer bear the idea of ​​living longer in his atrophied condition. <br /> <br /> It comes in beautiful, but also afflicted by a debilitating lawyer, Julia (the ethereal Rueda who blends beautifully with Bardem as if they were, in fact, soul mates) is contracted to see the last desire of Sampedro to finish with your life and become a helper. camping when it starts to open up for her like never before. Not much time passed and Julia begins to investigate the past of her accusation, discovering many letters hidden by her family. When Julia confronts Ramon with this, he is initially reluctant to discuss anything with her, but does he eventually agree with her that this may help in his case and the project becomes a book in the making? a memoir / biography through poetry and freestyle prose. <br /> <br /> The film is a touching tale of the human spirit and how love ends up triumphing over the heart in many ways, including for Ramon the unlikely love he shares with a stranger named Rosa (Duenas), a mother single woman who sees him on TV one day inspiring her to bike to his remote farm in Spain to meet him and possibly change his mind about the end of his life. The filmmaker Amenabar, co-author of Mateo Gil, fascinating script, allows some fantasy in the mix when Ramon magically imagines leaving his bed and flying through bucolic landscapes to the eventual sea where he suffered so many years ago the cruel twist of fate that imprisoned him for three decades. The film is not a complete disappointment with an astute intelligence and occasionally humorous tone throughout which does not dilute the impact of the final act of the story. Congratulations also to the remarkable makeup work James and Jo Allen do a tremendous job in aging the vibrant Bardem for a man aged in full force who should get them to an Acadamy Award. <br /> <br /> Bardem and Rueda deserve Oscar nominations as two people with so much in common and although Julia de Rueda is married to a loving and passionate husband, a pair of people so made to one another is impossible they were never together to begin. This is just one of the cruelties that sounds true, but it is not by definition the movie as a whole; is a must see and one of the best of the year.
