Sweeping and still stunning early Western Talkie of pioneer days; Other contemporary films in the same vein include THE COVERED WAGON (1923), THE IRON CAVALO (1924) AND CIMARRON (1931) ?? none of which I watched, although I have the latter on VHS. It was filmed simultaneously in the full-screen "Standard" proportion and in an experimental Widescreen process called "Grandeur", but only the first was released on the Fox DVD; one can only assume how it would be in a larger proportion, but the careful framing? not to mention the splendid cinematography? It is evident enough, even in the "Standard" version. <br /> <br /> Young John Wayne is a surprisingly commanding leader (a role that nevertheless did not lead to expected stardom in 'B' Westerns for most of the next decade before John Ford came in his help with STAGECOACH [1939]!); anyway, does he and Marguerite Churchill (from DRACULA'S DAUGHTER [1936]) make a nice couple? despite its somewhat tedious character. Supporting characters include a variety of types of actions: Western veteran, comic book helper (with a propensity to make noises with his mouth!), Corpulent and rude villain (played by Tyrone Power Sr.!), His two viscous and limp limbs a southerner, the latter also as Wayne's rival to Churchill's hand), etc. Also among the members of the class is a shy Swede (full of optimism for the promised land, but continually repressed by his irascible mother). (in law) and later Wayne Ward Bond regular. <br /> <br /> The episodic narrative solves itself in a number of alternately cornball, lyrical and action-packed vignettes. as we see the future settlers fighting the elements, the Indians and themselves; the film, however, has a completely authentic feel that softens its essentially dated and static quality. Also, is the edition a bit unstable (particularly during the second half)? No wonder, since the DVD edition of the film is only 108 minutes long versus the full 158 minute version of "Grandeur"!
