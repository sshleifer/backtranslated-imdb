As I watched "Wirey Spindell" I could not laugh at what was happening on the screen. Wirey had a lot of game from both boys and women, but I was confused about why the actor who played Wirey in H.S. was 10 years old. So the actor changed in age to like 20 years to play Wirey when he was a veteran of HS ... but whatever, I thought it was funny.
