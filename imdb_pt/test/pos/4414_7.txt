In many ways, this film defines the essence of everything I love in film, in terms of capturing those strange, indescribable moments of unprotected truth. In other ways, it is undeniably an amateur, unfocused result of junkies who amuse themselves with a camera. Ultimately, it comes out somewhere between pure sheen and unwatchability (fortunately much more than the latter). Part of me wants to reward him only for his absolute innovation and moments of pure sublimity, but at the same time I can not completely ignore the values ​​of production that are occasionally terribly "acting" and overtly bad. At first, the issue seems irresistibly sloppy and distracted unnecessarily (or perhaps mistakenly "innovative"), but after a while I got used to it, which is, in the end, the true sign that a movie is successful on its own terms or not. I think this answer basically sums up my overall feelings for the movie. That is, despite its ignorable flaws, it generally works very well. And, if nothing else, a film like this really shows how the fake documentary, the shaky-cam style can sometimes be so obviously only applied for purposes (as in films like the admirable Roger Dodger). Here aesthetics is clearly derived from the needs of the filming situation, and is not used only arbitrarily to appear "legal."
