I really loved this movie. I'm a big fan of Amanda Bynes's recently completed show. I admire her (beyond her body) for her ability to perform. She's a good actress. <br /> <br /> The movie was great. It's about a girl named Viola who wants to play soccer, but when her school cuts off the women's soccer team she gets upset. His brother is about to go to a prestigious school and he decides to leave for England. So Viola wants to impress by playing on the college football team. She goes to school and tries the football team. She enters. Meanwhile, she meets Duke, who is a sensitive guy who plays for the football team. He really likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Sebastian - who is really viola. Sebastian is dating Monique and suspects Sebastian is not being himself. <br /> <br /> This is not a girl's movie and I liked it a lot. He's so funny and kind. I do not think I've seen Amanda act any better.
