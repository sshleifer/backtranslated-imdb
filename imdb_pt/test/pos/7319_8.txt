Although not a big fan, I'm a purist of the Three Stooges. I believe his best work, by far, was with Curly as the third Stooge and his early films are usually the best. That's because after a while, they started redoing their movies and the jokes started to become obsolete. Here in 1934, they were still quite cool (in more ways than one) and funny. <br /> <br /> Here the boys play very unlikely roles - respected doctors in a hospital! The three run wildly acting silly, hitting each other and scaring the pants of those hoping to improve. The energy and uninterrupted freshness make this a must-see for fans. <br /> <br /> By the way, although I have liked this movie, I strongly recommend that you try to find a much lesser known short of the small educational photos. NIFTY NURSES is very much like MEN IN BLACK, but it succeeds in being funnier and it's about the best hospital comedy of the day - even better than the COUNTY HOSPITAL of Laurel and Hardy.
