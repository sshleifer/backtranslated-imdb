This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African citizens who decide to temporarily abandon their families by guarding on an outbound ship. They think that if they can make the trip successfully, they can improve their lives by earning enough money in New York to send to their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship they select is a decayed Russian freighter that has already been fined in a previous port for harboring clandestine passengers. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their work is on the line. The group of blacks begins their harrowing journey in the cargo hold and ends up being discovered, forced out of hiding and murdered by their relentless companion (an excellent performance by Sean Pertwee). Some (convincing leader terrified Omar Epps among them) manage to escape temporarily and are ruthlessly pursued by the ship with their lives lost if caught. Overall, a fascinating movie that will have audiences biting their nails and gritting their teeth, wondering how those terrible events could happen in modern civilization.
