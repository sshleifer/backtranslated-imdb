What is often overlooked about Harold Lloyd is that he was an actor. Unlike Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd did not have the Vaudeville / Music Hall background and was not a natural comedian. He came to Hollywood to perform; and he found he had a way of acting funny - first in shorts, then in features. He made a name for himself as "Lonesome Luke," a Chaplin knockdown; with the "eyewear character" who turned him into the American boy instead of grotesque, Lloyd found his way and his films became some of the best produced during the age of silence. <br /> <br /> He developed a reputation as a "daredevil" in some shorts, and retained this in some of his best films ("Safety Last," "Girl Shy"). It was more popular than Chaplin or Keaton during the 1920s and became very wealthy before the advent of sound. <br /> <br /> The first sound films were often disasters. To get the most out of your "sound", a lot of dialogue has been used in many movies. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's acting skills were, after two decades, turned to the silences. He did not have a bad voice; his high tone suited his "glasses" character. And his sound films were not the disqualified disasters of legend. However, silent film was elevated to a high-level art (especially that of Lloyd's, which was not limited to budget and was extremely well crafted); with the introduction of talkies, the movies had to learn to walk again and they made some mistakes. <br /> <br /> Although he tried to fiddle with the times and adopt the sound, Lloyd's best snippets of his early talkies were still visual - like the scene in "Crazy Movie" where he seems to be walking in a luxury car, but actually "caught a ride" on his bike. Trying to recapture the audacious pranks that made him famous, as he did in "Feet First", was misstep. ("Safety Last", his best film and one that, deservedly or not, pushed Lloyd into the box as an "audacious comic", he played a determined young man, rising to the top. climb his character to the side of the building. He was obviously scared, but his fear added to the mood. In "Feet First," he arrived in a precarious building scale position by accident, his frantic screams for help impaired humor His character was pathetic and shrunken, an aspiration to save his neck - possibly a precise statement from the 1930s, but not fun). Harold Lloyd was not bogged down in the past, like some Disorganized Norma Desmond. He embraced the sound and tried to take his films in different directions, growing and changing with the industry. When "Feet First" failed, he left the business bold and made a satire in the movie industry, "Movie Crazy." Just as he had to stumble across many films like "Lonesome Luke" before sculpturing his place in movie history with the goggle character, he tried several directions on sound films before reaching his rhythm in the sound, which he did with " The Catspaw ". In "The Catspaw," he plays the son of a missionary raised in China, who is inadvertently elected mayor as a front for corrupt political interests. When he discovers the truth, he sets the task of cleaning the city. Only in his early forties, Lloyd could still represent the impetuous young man. <br /> <br /> However, "The Catspaw" was another box office failure, and Lloyd made just three more films, including "The Milky Way." Of its major competitors, Chaplin still had silent films and Keaton was hopelessly mismanaged. "The Catspaw" and "The Milky Way" suggest that Lloyd could have mastered sound comedy if he were a little younger, or if the audience had given him the benefit of the doubt after his first sound fiascos. <br /> <br /> Although the film has been unfairly defamed about the way the character of Lloyd cleaned the city, it suits him. From his days in shorts, Lloyd wanted to scare his audience, and the climax of "The Catspaw" succeeded again, in a surprising way; until the trick is revealed, looks awful, and then comes the laughs. Seen as a product of his time, "The Catspaw" is charming and funny. A very well written sound comedy, well represented by Lloyd. Directed by Sam Taylor, his curious blend of drama and malicious humor makes it look like a comedy from Frank Capra or Preston Sturges.
