I used to watch this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it very well. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I remember very well are the opening sequence and the theme song. In addition, all were ideally chosen. The writing was also very strong. The performances were also top notch. I hope some network will bring it back so I can watch each episode. Before I finish, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, even if I have not seen all the episodes. Now, in conclusion, if any net brings you back, I hope you take it one day before it's out of the air forever.
