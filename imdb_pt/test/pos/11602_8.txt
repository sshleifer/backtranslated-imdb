The Hindi version of the film is 121 minutes. Set in Bengal in the early 1900s, the film (based on Tagore's novel) draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women. An educated and beautiful woman, Binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage, but she does not accept the restrictions imposed on her as a widow by her society. The film looks beautiful, but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is out of his depth in portraying Binodini's strong character with his subtle combination of idealism and dishonesty. Binodini's idealism does not appear, and as a result the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried.
