I can not hate the show. When the old (and better) TV technology had to hit the bricks, the channel was reformatted and new shows were introduced. "Attack of the Show" is the replacement for Screen Savers, with 3 co-hosts at the beginning. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran also became co-host, but he made mostly pre-recorded pieces for the show. Kevin Rose decided to leave the show, and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host, but that did not work out for some reason. <br /> <br /> Eventually (I just learned that) <br /> <br /> Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran moved on because (hey, that's what I read) the two got married. <br /> That was a big secret for me! co-host, the not-so-hot (my opinion) Olivia Munn. She's hiding something in those tops she wears while Sarah Lane had a perfect body and she was not afraid to show it. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Show" deals with everything the young people want to know: it's music, movies, comics, the internet, and television, that's what's great about the show. you do not want to worry about scouring the network or wasting time watching MTV, you can get everything you want in AOTS.A few segments and bits they make are funny.These have regular guests and co-workers who are in the industry as well as guests ranging from insignificant Internet stars to real big names. <br /> <br /> Even though and the hosts are not as geek as I'd like them to be, I still found "Attack of the Show" to be fun even with their latest training.
