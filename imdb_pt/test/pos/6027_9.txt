I was fortunate to see The Last Stop here where I live in the Moving Pictures Film Festival (for those who do not know, the Moving Pictures Film Festival is a Canadian-made movie tour in Canada). I was told shortly before the movie began that it was the world premiere and that I was about to get an American distribution deal that added to my excitement. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of horror movies, and yes, I love the Scream trilogy as well. So when I discovered that Rose McGowan was making a kind of Ten Little Indian movie, I knew it was a surprise. Rose McGowan was the biggest actress / actress of the entire festival. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe it without revealing much of the plot is that it's not like Scream. And certainly worth seeing. It's in the middle of a blizzard (it was filmed in Vancouver, Canada) at a hilltop motel, which adds to the suspense. Rose McGowan does a great performance as the girl next door (?!) Along with the rest of the cast. And as for what happens in the end, well, the only thing I will say is that you will never guess the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, you probably will not get into major American theaters. because the only decent money maker is Rose McGowan. But if you have the chance to see, I recommend you do. And if the worst happens, there will always be video. <br /> <br /> Dei 9 out of 10.
