Both Disney and Bill Paxton did a good job of conveying a story based on facts. You do not need to like the game of golf to enjoy the story of a man's struggle to overcome difficulties. It could have been based on any sport or just any other situation involving competition, although this is only related to Golf. The only problem I have with the story is that I would have liked to see a little deeper in each of the main characters, esp. Mr. Ouimet. Mr. Francis Ouimet is a typical young man of his day, the turn of the century in America, where "class lines" are well delineated and woe to anyone who strives to overcome his "class" position. I did some historical research and my biggest question was actually answered, to my satisfaction. Although the circumstances are a little different from those portrayed in the film, I left with a sense of satisfaction. I really liked this movie, I believe you too.
