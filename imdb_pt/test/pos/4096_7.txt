This version of "The Lost Horizon" is not really a bad movie. I think the problem is that people like to play musicals, especially those made in the '70s. I saw the movie on its original release in 1973 (I was ten years old) and really enjoyed it, especially the music. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good and technically excellent. Of course, there are one or two silly dance numbers, but, hey, you can not win them all. I have this movie on video and watch it from time to time ... and I like it every time!
