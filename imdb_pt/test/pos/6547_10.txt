I saw UZUMAKI about a year ago and I was hypnotized. The only Japanese horror movie I had seen before this movie was KWAIDAN (which I proudly have on DVD), superb! The idea of ​​a city being absorbed by spirals seems exactly something of Lovecraft. Certainly, it reminds one of SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, of the inhabitants slowly turning into monstrosities (in this case, giant snails). And who can forget the sequence of the washing machine? I hope we can soon see this one available on the Region 1 DVD (I see Sundance recently showed it on US TV, I hope they do it again very soon) so we can all see it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
