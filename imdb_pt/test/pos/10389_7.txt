This is the final film that Michelangelo Antonioni directed, with the help of Wim Wenders, and adapts from his collection of short stories "That Bowling Alley on the Tiber". In addition to the clouds contain 4 familiar story tales that we have become accustomed to from their previous works, and summarizes the themes in vignettes that are woven together through directed scenes of Wenders involving the character of John Malkovich The Director. However, most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth with which we are accustomed from an Antonioni movie, while Malkovich's narration of the supposed depth shook with an unclear diction that sounded somewhat pretentious and out of place. <br /> However, all four stories seem to touch on casual encounters, and extremely quick novels that unfolded more like lust at first glance, perhaps due to lack of time (since they are tales anyway) to allow for an approach in layers to carefully define and create the characters as we know from a typical Antonioni movie. And the obsessive approach here is for the characters to undress to show a lack of deeper connection sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the flesh. Maybe this is the point to want to bring through an observation of the more modern relationship? <br /> <br /> The first story, the story of a novel that never existed, tells of the romance between Silvano (Kim Rossi Stuart) and Carmen (Ines Sastre), who meet when someone asks the other the directions to a hotel and then meet in a cafe. It's as if Fate was playing with them when they met, but if they split up and meet again much later, but like the games that people play, it's almost like an L'Aventura or a La Notte with a lack of communication and the expectations of the man. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich's character plays a central role in the next short, which featured some really lascivious looks at a girl who works in a store, played by Sophie Marceau. She is deeply disturbed and uncomfortable, but somehow she drew the courage to approach him, and in what I thought was to scare him, tells him his record that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times. But in the blink of an eye these two are for room gymnastics. The next short, Do not Look For Me, is the longest of the lot, with Peter Weller playing an unfaithful husband who has to choose between his lover (Chiara Caselli) or his wife, played by Fanny Ardant. Perhaps the most star-studded of the group, with Jean Reno also entering for a coda at the end, which expands the small universe in which this short exists. But, unfortunately, Reno's involvement was also relegated to some stifled laughter, while falling into the implausible realm with the speed of romantic marriage. There was a key element adapted from L'Eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel as well, while the introductory tale about the history of souls was quite interesting. If there is a negative theme here, this short one wants to play on top, it will be the duplicity of the man. <br /> <br /> Between this short and the next was a little scene that brought together our couple from La Notte, Marcello. Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau, where the former painted a landscape reminiscent of the red desert. Finally, we have the final scene This body of dirt, with Vincent Perez as a young man going after a girl (Irene Jacob) that he just met, and falling in love with her, only to realize that it is a love that is too late. It's a relatively talked-about play, as is the first story, with the characters chattering as they walk the streets of the town they're in, which reminds Richard Linklater's Richard Sunrise. <br /> <br /> In general, the film may have had success as individual pieces, they never compare as a combined effort, given the "excuse" to link them to the exploration of possible stories by a film director and to the inspiration of the next film.
