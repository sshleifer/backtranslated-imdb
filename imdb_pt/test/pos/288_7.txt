One thing that surprised me when watching this movie was that it was fun / exciting for the cast and crew; I could feel that they were going against the budget constraint with enthusiasm and dedication because they apparently liked the people involved. <br /> <br /> I like B movies that are original and have heart, and I think that's one of those works. The actors seem to me to be putting hearts there more than usual, perhaps because of the good direction of the lead actress / director, and they have evidently been clear enough in their parts of history to make a coherent and watchable work of art. . <br /> <br /> The critics of this film who more or less say "why not just rent a hardcore porn movie" point to the fact that they do not like the movie. Going to this movie expecting too much T & A without patience for the plot material is because it is so unpleasant for them. It could be said that the film is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie, although I understand that the star has done its share of light porn. I think she graduated. In terms of writing, dialogue is not a big part of the film, as in a Tarentino film, but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun. In particular, the ending is not a disappointment, but a pleasure, with villainy / heroine and the "leader" learning from his complex web of feelings. <br /> <br /> I understand that the producer got a movie from 3 movies about it. Taking off your hat to taste a few tens of thousands of dollars can go a long way if you have some artistic sensitivity and pride. <br /> <br /> Gabriella and the other girls with nudity scenes were nice and sexy, not just bimbos, as well as an erotic fantasy piece with some lovely art, even with the limits of the B movie land, not disappointing.
