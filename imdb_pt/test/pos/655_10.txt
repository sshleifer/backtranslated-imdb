This movie bombed the box office and the vote here, but I loved it. One measure of the value of a movie is how much you can still remember after 25 years. I will not bore you with a list, but there are dozens of deeply comedic scenes, also a good story and a great cast. Inept thieves are a hoot. See and judge if it ever happens in TCM.
