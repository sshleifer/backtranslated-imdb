Class Tous Risques (The Great Risk) is a French gangster movie that does not try for style. That's why it has style. Because the film is so underrated and so prosaic, it becomes increasingly engaging. And as Abel Davos is played by Lino Ventura, we end up investing emotionally in this taciturn and tough killer who loves his wife and children, has a meeting with customs agents on the coast near Nice at night that neither he nor we expect, and which shows as willing to shoot a policeman or a traitor with as little emotion as to shake off some fiber. We met for the first time in Davos in Italy with his wife and their two small children, one with about nine and a four. <br /> <br /> "This man was Abel Davos, sentenced to death by default," we were told. "For years, he saw his resources diminish, even with his anxiety keeping him moving." With the Italian police closing every day, France was again his best bet, maybe he'd been forgotten. <br /> <br /> Davos was a top gangster in Paris who took care of his friends. That was several years ago. An assault to give you money to return to France is very wrong. Now he's hiding with his two children. He calls his friends in Paris to help him. He and his sons need to go from Nice to Paris, but the police are hunting him and they set up roadblocks. For the two best friends of Davos, time passed and they moved on. They do not want to put themselves at risk and why? Obligation gives may for caution. Then they hire a young thief, Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo), to pick up Davos and the children in an ambulance, then to go to Paris with heavily bandaged Davos and the children in hiding. We are on a journey where Davos's options are increasingly limited where he must find ways to care for his children where he realizes that there are no more bonds of friendship where betrayal seems likely, and where possibly his only friend left It's Eric Stark. <br /> <br /> This somewhat cynical movie works so well because it does its job without worrying. There are no trench coats with collars pulled up or playing with the melodrama of the gangster code that so many French directors have loved. Class of Risques gives us Abel Davos, a man who was once someone, who is now coming down to be nobody, and who reacts with violence and resignation. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura dominates the film, but when he is paired with Jean-Paul Belmondo happens a curious chemistry. Ventura as Davos is sad and worried about taking care of his children. He is humiliated by his situation. He is a hard man who sees someone's death, if necessary, as part of the business in which he is. Belmondo as the young thief who is initially sent to be a disposable driver and ends up being a friend to tell, provides the glare that prevents the film from being just one more descent down the elevator. Belmondo was 27 years old and looks younger. His unlikely star power as a lead actor - broken nose, arched jaw - shines on the screen. He makes Erik a game for Ventura when they share a scene. And the scenes of Belmondo with Liliane (Sandra Milo), the young woman who becomes his girlfriend, radiate charm and good-natured sexual appeal. The ending is a bittersweet destination and without a stylistic stance in sight. We heard Davos say, "Abel is gone, there is nothing left." It is worth watching the Risques Class to learn what it means. <br /> <br /> There are many French gangster films. I would put this one right there with Touchez Pas au Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur. To see one of the best performances of Lino Ventura, see Army of Shadows.
