There have been many documentaries that I saw in what looked like the law was on the wrong side of the fence - The Thin Blue Line and Paradise Lost come to mind first. But this is the first movie that made me angry after I saw it. It seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened in Waco was at least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the FBI and AFI, and at worst an act of murder. Like most people, when the siege on Waco was occurring, I assumed that David Koresh was a completely evil madman leading a violent cult. After seeing this, I think Koresh was probably a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the US government through his eccentric actions. Of course, there were a lot of guns in Branch Davidian complex. But none of this was illegal. It was absolutely painful to see the video footage of the people inside the complex, all of them looking very nice and harmless. And it was annoying to see the insensitive testimony of the men in charge of the Waco local government forces, Janet Reno's baseless testimony, and the party's defense of the Waco attack, a defense led by some members of the Democratic committee. . What struck me most was NY Representative and current US Senator from NY Charles Schumer. I voted for the man when I lived in NY state - I'm a democrat, a lot of left as well. After seeing your actions on this committee, I wish I could go back in time and vote for D'Amato! For anyone remotely interested in government, this is a very crucial film, a must see. I even think this should be shown in class - it's so important.
