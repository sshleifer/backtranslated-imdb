"Cat In The Brain" is a series of extremely violent sequences, united by a plot that looks more like an overview, describing the most notorious years of director Lucio Fulci. The film can also be seen as a sort of somber comedy, effectively counterfeiting the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life. Fulci goes beyond that, he presents himself as the star, the central figure of the film, thus showing the audience who is the man behind the whole film plot. "Cat in the Brain" is not about presenting a clear story and following it. Instead, he mocks some of the cliches surrounding the horror genre for years. <br /> <br /> Lucius Fulci presents himself as a director of terror who struggles to keep his humanity intact. Years of violent filmmaking have finally begun to catch up with him. It starts slowly, steaks and meat usually start to piss him off, his colleagues assure Fulci that all he needs is some rest. But that does not help and soon the grotesque ideas of his films begin to overwhelm his daily thoughts. In an attempt to find a cure for his dangerously mad mental state, Lucio begins to go to the local psychiatrist. Unfortunately, this does more harm than good and Fulci is thrown into even greater confusion as the psychiatrist ends up being a psychopath who mimics the murders of Fulci's films in real life. <br /> <br /> The film retains everything. the trademarks of the Italian splatter cinema, good or bad, are all here. Therefore, any comments on the performance or technical aspects and budget constraints are quite irrelevant as to the quality of the film. It is a visual experience, no doubt. Fulci plays in an incredible amount of violence easily outranking just about everything he did. Amputated by chainsaw members, cannibalism, child murder, beheading, these are just a few of the many grotesque acts witnessed in "Cat In The Brain." Some of them are obviously recycled from some less profile movies than the director, but they do not stand out from the context, and really feel right at home here. As I've noted before, the film is much better as a satire of the genre, rather than a serious play. How some of the violence is presented helps to establish this idea. Such sequences soon after the climax are rejected by the reality of the film, as they are revealed as scenes from the film that the character of Fulci is directing. This kind of "movie on film" presentation slightly lessens the impact of blood. But by no means makes it easy to watch the movie. Oh, no, that's way above and beyond the blood levels found in the horror of the mainstream, and the gorehounds will no doubt be pleased with that fact. Lucius Fulci was a very polarized figure. People either hate their job or love it. "Cat in the Brain" will not convince any of Fulci's detractors, but it's an interesting part of his filmography. One that fans should really check out.
