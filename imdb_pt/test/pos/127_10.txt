The critic Claudio Carvalho did a much better recap of the plot details of the movie than I did. What I most remember is that it was so beautiful, in every way - emotionally, visually, editorially - just beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that are wonderful to see, and also have emotional content for which this beauty is relevant, I think you will be happy to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art. <br /> <br /> On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give about 8.75. The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it's a piece of humor. If you're in the mood for a very romantic, very artistic film, then it's a 10. I definitely think it's a must-see, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, so overall, 8.75.
