Drew Barrymore gets a second chance at high school, on a secret mission as a newspaper reporter. In flashbacks, we see that the first time was, to say the least, a major disaster. David Arquette is fun in modest role as Drew's brother, who also enrolls to help sis. Many subplots threaten, but never overwhelm the sheer charm of the movie. Drew continues making her niche as the leading innocent and sexy comic actress.
