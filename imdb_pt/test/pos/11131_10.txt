I really hate musicals because the music numbers just start from the sudden scenes and usually spoil, but this is completely different - it's simply brilliant. Perhaps the plot is not a challenge for the viewers, but the simplicity of people's life stories makes this film excellent. <br /> <br /> I've seen it at least a dozen times and still I'm not tired of the plot. , characters or music (I just love the soundtrack - it's the only soundtrack I really wanted to have and it's probably still the only one I should). <br /> <br /> For me, it's a must-seen type of movie, great characters compiled with fun songs and lots of things to think about after the movie's end.
