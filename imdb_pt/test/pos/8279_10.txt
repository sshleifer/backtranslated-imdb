I have been an avid fan of squirrels since the late 70's - early 80's. When this movie came out, it was a must to see it. And after seeing it, I went straight and bought it! The film is great, I love the lively action it brings, and the music is great (yes, I bought the soundtrack on CD ...) A recommended video for everyone to watch and enjoy!
