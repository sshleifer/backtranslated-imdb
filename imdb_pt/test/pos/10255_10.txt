Cooley High is considered one of my best movies ever. This certainly reminds me of days of my growing up youth in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago during the early, mid, and late 1960s. What happened to Brenda and Pooter? Someone needs to track them down. Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for her innocent wit. Both deserve recognition until 31 years after the release of the film. I think many of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them, as well as others who have performed in this fun-filled movie. I certainly think this movie should be inserted into some kind of HALL OF FAME movie. The whole cast of this movie was great. My opinion is "Cooley High" is back in the hands of time, those were the years of fun.
