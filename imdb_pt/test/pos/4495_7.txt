Two young friends grow up together in Afghanistan. The events of their lives drive them away and one of them has lived in the US for a number of years. As he gets a phone call, it's clear he has to come back because there are problems in the air. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about lasting friendships, mistakes and inventions again. But also a film about darkness, pain and resistance. From the pleasant days of growth and games to disintegration, back to the game of games. This is a slow movie, but not too slow. <br /> <br /> He plays with emotions and this is very right for a drama, but does it a bit too much for my liking. This makes it very tearful, losing some of the quality it brings. Still good, but not fantastic. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 kites ran aground
