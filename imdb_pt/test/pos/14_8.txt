I watched a preview of this movie I'm not sure what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both delivered less than memorable performances and films. While the underlying "general" plot is a bit unfamiliar, this movie was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher made powerful performances playing very well in each other. The frailties and human forces of their respective characters were unbelievably performed by both; the scene in which Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons for which Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the film's most unforgettable emotional moment. The "specific" plot was an education by itself portraying the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training that elite Coast Guard rescuers must do to prepare their only job and responsibility ... to save lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and "impressive" ... I have not seen seas so upset since "The Perfect Storm". Co-star Clancy Brown (HBO's "Carnivale" - great to see him again) played Coast Guard's Kodiak captain, Alaska's base in a strong and compelling role as a leader with the prerequisite and needed ice water in your veins. The film beautifully and finally gives long exposure and respect to the Coast Guard; had the audience cheering at the end.
