"Dope Sick Love" is a really remarkable documentary made for HBO about two pairs of heroin addicts roaming the streets of New York. I managed to catch him one night by accident and found it quite mesmerizing. There is no narration and we never see interviews with the subjects, the camera just follows them, like a third eye, completely separated. People who are being followed do not even seem to know they're being filmed! (or at least they do not seem to mind). The filming is incredibly honest. Some of the most sincere I've ever seen. This is as real as it gets. The nuts and bolts of what it feels like to be on the street and addicted to heroin. We watch them punctuate drugs, shoot, make-up, rush, and even pass by cops to steal people, and over a million other tiny details that less-attentive filmmakers will leave out. <br /> <br /> Some of the pictures are truly horrible. Like watching a guy frantically searching for repair, he lost. I found myself praying that he could find him, just so that his misery would end temporarily. And when he meets, the guy literally dances on the street. <br /> <br /> The cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very apparent as you watch. EVERYTHING is about getting the next score for these people but the next score seems to be worth the immense problem they go through. <br /> <br /> I would love to have a copy of it if anyone knows where it is available. Highly recommended if you can catch it on HBO.
