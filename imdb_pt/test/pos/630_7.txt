This is undoubtedly one of my favorite horror movies ever! I really can not believe he did not gain much more popularity when it was released, especially when the main contenders of the time were the usual aftermath of Wes Craven and the immitatory horrors, Mute Witness has all the style, suspense, and quick twists of a Hitchcock / DePalma movie along with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot. It never promises to be more than a good popcorn movie and hot dog, but it's hard not to just enjoy the movie for what it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered on Billie Hughes - dumb girl working on the set of a horror movie being made in a Russian factory. Through a series of events, she finds herself accidentally locked, and is faced with the filming of a snuff film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the movie is the lack of screams that seem to invade every horror. movie already made. Because the main character is mute, she can not make noise - something that is a blessing at some stages of the movie, and a curse on others. The director seems to have studied his Hitchcock very well. Even the opening scene is an ironic nod to Hitchcock's "Psycho," as well as scenes from quite generic horror films. <br /> <br /> Although acting may be difficult at times, the film all stands. together, not just throwing in some great scenes that put you on the edge of your seat but a few little questions about how the movie will end. All in all, an extremely subjugated, well-paced and action-packed psycho-thriller that I would recommend to any tired viewer looking for something a little different from the usual Freddy / Jason / Scream / Michael Myers regurgitation / Damien no hallowe'en.
