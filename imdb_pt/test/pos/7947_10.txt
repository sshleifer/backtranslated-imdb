I watched this movie recently for the first time in over 30 years and was very pleasantly surprised. I remembered a film that captured the mood and atmosphere of Britain in the mid-1960s without falling into the clichés of 'Swinging Britain' that so many other movies thought they should propagate, my memory proved correct. Those who think this is like a TV piece are not totally wrong, but while Andrea Newman would become famous for a TV drama, this movie is more a tradition of 'kitchen' movies like 'Saturday Night and Sunday Morning'. but with an emphasis on the middle class rather than the working class. Rod Steiger is excellent as the distressed middle-aged leader, unfortunately married to a repressed and seemingly sterile woman (Claire Bloom). The beginning of the "Technological Revolution" is the backdrop to the drama in which old values ​​and certainties are challenged. This is the stage for the central character played by Judy Geeson, a role that at the time was a shocking departure from the typical prim behavior of contemporary heroines. The inversion of roles, with the girl classifying her achievements into a small black book, was a forerunner of the feminist movement and was criticized at the time for promoting promiscuity among the young. The irony of these criticisms must be seen in both the characters of Claire Bloom and Peggy Ashcroft, who are both dissatisfied. Peter Hall has made some films and in this show is a great shame. Steiger is exemplary and totally credible, showing why he was so highly regarded
