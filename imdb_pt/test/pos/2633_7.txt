For some reason, some shows fail ... some deservedly, some not ... Buddy Faro was a smart show with interesting characters and dark humor that was nice to watch ... Maybe it was never a big hit, but it had a " whim "about what made it enjoyable ... what was said looks like I might have been the one to watch .... Dennis Farina and Frank Whaley were chosen perfectly in their respective roles ... production quality and writing were great and Vegas was the perfect backdrop ... I hope the first and only season to be released on DVD, since I believe it deserves some notoriety ... maybe at least it's on TV Land .... cheers
