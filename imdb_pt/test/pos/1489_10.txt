Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. It was not how often you watch the same thing, the show never gets monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who does not even need to talk to make people laugh. His gestures, his facial expressions and his own face are so funny to see. The situations he faces in the program are simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater. There is simply no reason why this program does not receive a 10 because it is fabulous. It is something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh. Some of my all-time favorite episodes of the show are: 1) When Mr. Bean lodges in a hotel 2) What he watches the scary movie 3) Take care of the baby (The diaper scene especially). In fact, all the episodes are so good that it's really hard to criticize the show. Mr.Bean can go at any time to prove it's funny, including getting undressed completely in one of the episodes. the way he dealt with it was simply mind-boggling. 10 out of 10.
