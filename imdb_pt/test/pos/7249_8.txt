So it may not be entirely accurate historically. And there is little or no development of real character. But for the first attempt by Jake (son of Ridley) Scott, it's worth the ticket price. Captain James MaCleane (Jonny Lee Miller is as good as ever) may be a gentleman, but he does not have the money or the clothes to prove it. Plunkett (Robert Carlyle in all his clothes) is an apothecary who has become outlaw. The circumstances of the strange encounter involve a dead body, a ruby ​​and eventually a partnership like the gentlemen of the Road. As the slogan says, "rob the rich ... and that's it". There is not much background, not even in-depth development, but the goal seems to be to relieve the aristocracy of money and jewelry enough to pay for the passage of the two Highwaymen to America. One small problem: MaCleane falls in love. With the wing of the Supreme's chairman, Rebecca (Liv Tyler). Who by chance also caught the attention of the thief general taker. <br /> <br /> The plot is original enough, the cast is excellent (especially Alan Cumming as the devil-queenish Lord Rochester, Carlyle and Miller - also together in "Trainspotting", they have not lost their momentum, the Jake Scott has an eye for light and shadow, a good sense of balance between the show and the plot, and he has no scruples in it. show off the most unpleasant side of seventeenth-century London.And fortunate for us, he likes close-ups of faces, especially eyes.Jonny Lee Miller's eyes.And Liv Tyler too, but hey, who is this movie about? Plunkett and MaCleane, but there's more to this film than just beautiful faces, at the risk of sounding clichéd, it's a fast, furious, and sometimes frustrating ride with the noblest highwaymen since Robin Hood. violent, the debut movie of Scott makes a fun night at the movies. <br /> <br /> As MaCleane says, "I was great, and it was a good laugh!"
