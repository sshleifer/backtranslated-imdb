I give 8 out of 10 because it's a cult classic. It is also directed by legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan, who also plays the role of Jarvis in the film. Listening to the recent blogtalkradio show called AARF show (Robert Morgan is a co-host), he says that by becoming a cult classic and doing well in film conventions and such, there are plans to maybe make a sequel to this film . . I think he said two of the original stars signed and he hopes to have a few more. Robert is a good man and I hope he's good. He has dedicated more than 50 years of tireless work as a Sassquatch Researcher (which is also one of my interests) and author. Check out his show on the paranormal and maybe look for Blood Stalkers II sometime in the near future.
