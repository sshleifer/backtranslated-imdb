After five years in prison, Tony le Stéphanois (Jean Servais) meets his dear friends Jo (Carl Möhner) and Italian Mario Ferrati (Robert Manuel) and invites Tony to steal some jewelry from the showcase of the famous jewelry store. Mappin & Webb Ltd, but he refuses. Tony meets his ex-girlfriend Mado (Marie Sabouret), who has become a lover of nightclub owner L'Orge d'Or or Louis Grutter (Pierre Grasset), and he humiliates her, beating her back and taking her jewelry. Then he calls Jo and Mario and proposes a robbery of the jewelry box. They invite the Italian expert on safes and elegant wolf Cesar (Perlo Vita) to join their team and plot a perfect assault. They are successful in their plan, but D. Juan Cesar makes things go wrong when he gives a valuable ring to his lover. <br /> <br /> "Du Rififi Chez les Hommes" is a magnificent film-noir, certainly among the best I have ever seen. The script has credibility, backed by an incredible direction by Jules Dassin, impressive cast performances and great cinematography. Jean Servais performs well in the role of a criminal with principles guided by the rules of the underworld. The famous long silent sequence of the assault is incredible and extremely tense and certainly among the best in film history. I'm listing this great movie on my all time favorite movie list. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rififi"
