Much has already been written about the film itself, so instead of increasing the noise, I just want to say a few words about the two female actors. <br /> <br /> It has to be a scary prospect for any actress. to star, in a sense, against the spectacular Monica Bellucci, but Romane Bohringer takes this for sensational purposes. A movie starring Monica Bellucci, where I fell in love with the other girl? This should not happen. <br /> <br /> It's been said a thousand times, but Monica Bellucci is the saddest figure in modern cinema. I have never seen such innate sadness before. She would not be out of place breaking Lon Chaney's heart.
