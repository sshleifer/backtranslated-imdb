Why did I vote 10/10 for this movie that is completely out of courage *? Quite simply because if you just let yourself find it funny, you can just laugh until you choke. Some people may find this going too far, certainly not for everyone, but whenever I'm sad and need something really stupid to laugh, kick Bottom or GHP and I can forget all my troubles and be transported in a magical world , dark and strange. <br /> <br /> * "off off guts" is an Australian expression, it has no literal translation.
