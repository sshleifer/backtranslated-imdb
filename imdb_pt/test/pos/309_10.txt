Of all the Vietnam war movies, this is probably the most scary and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular that came out. You have this strange feeling. Everything is so chaotic in the movie that it scares you. It's not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What pushes to such a high level is the following: <br /> <br /> The direction was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows his talent in his latest epic movie. Unlike other directors, it makes you feel like you're in the war. Most others just display and show the horrors of war. Coppola though makes you feel confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story. This is something I've only tried a few times while watching a movie. The writing was amazing too. This led you to write in the middle of the movie. This never made me bored and this movie is three hours long. The cinematography goes hand in hand with the direction that has greatly added to the bizarre experience of watching this movie showing all the chaos around it, even when everything seems calm. <br /> <br /> The acting was scary. Just look at Marlon Brando, also giving his last great performance playing a deluded colonel, out of tune. Whenever I think of a soldier gone mad I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. With Brando in this movie you do not want to look him in the eye. Like the movie, he was weird. For me, this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the madness that he is experiencing and still wanting him to reach his goal. It's just a blast because these two did not get Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall was able to show some of this madness with his ridiculous battle strategies, among those who play music to tell the enemy that he is coming. Also the character of Duvall asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was shocking, but believable. Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest, who summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers of the time without becoming a clich√©. Also for once the appearances were put to good use having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford whom I both love. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. He has a message and everyone involved in the production is at his best. There is nothing else I could ask for in this film with its great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and great ending. Watch and you'll see why it lives up to its title Apocalpyse Now.
