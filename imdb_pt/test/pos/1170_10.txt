This movie is well released, often silly and always funny. Lemmon and Matthau work to perfection the magic of their team. Brent Spiner is just a riot as the selfish tyrant of a cruise director. From the first "hare krishna" to the last "you must pay him fifty dollars for calling two stallions," I thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy
