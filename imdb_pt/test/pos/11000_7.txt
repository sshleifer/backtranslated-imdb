General Trelayne is a super-being who wants to play a little game with the Enterprise crew. A lot of extremely unlikely and pointless things seem to be happening, and Trelayne seems obsessed with human practices of war and murder. He seems to need to experience what he imagines to be an emotion and has created a human environment (though a few hundred years out of date) to represent his fantasies. The environment is subtly inauthentic and the team immediately begins to identify the inconsistencies. It soon becomes clear that Trelayne is not only an immature god, but a very fallible one. Regardless of how you feel about this, stay close to the end of the Twilight Zone. Worth it. <br /> <br /> As many have pointed out, Trelayne's character inspired the most developed and entertaining Q character - and you can see in the construction of that personality of John DeLancie more than just personality tones. Trelayne of Campbell. It's fun to compare how the four captains we've seen dealing with Q deal with him in such a radically different way.
