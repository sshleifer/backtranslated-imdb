If you have a box of tissues, a comfortable sofa, a large bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on a Friday night, this is definitely your movie! It's romantic, it's hot and challenging. For most of us gay people, religion is just one of those things we did when we were kids and we probably just stared at the alter-boy and how cute he was! But in the Last Days, you see the struggles of being gay when your whole world revolves around beliefs that totally contradict being gay. The two members of the main cast were totally excited, but at the same time they managed to capture his heart and even made me 'almost' cry (I've never cried in a movie!), Which I found quite impressive for a B- highly recommend this movie, you will laugh, you will cry (unless your the self) and you will definitely drool! I love it so much I even bought the DVD for my collection. It is truly the most beautiful film ever
