A girl begins to realize that people in her small town are getting fascinated by anything that has the shape of a spiral. Soon, the fascination turns into an obsession and things get dead. Although I do not say "Uzumaki" was a great movie, I'll say it was unlike anything I've seen before. Throughout my viewing, I felt like I was watching a cartoon. There are funny follow-ups between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes. Later, I discovered that the movie is an adaptation of a manga, so that makes sense. However, just when you think you are watching something that can be a children's movie, you are bombarded with nasty and bloody visuals! The story is usually late and the ending is a bit abrupt and it seemed anticlimactic at the time, but in retrospect I appreciated more for its originality. My Rating: 7/10.
