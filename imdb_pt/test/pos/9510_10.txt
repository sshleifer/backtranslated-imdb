It's the best movie I've seen this year! Excellent detail and plot (for a remake). <br /> <br /> It presents to you a "what if" situation in which the island of Japan could be totally exterminated from this land. An intriguing situation, life and death and not to mention all life on earth (well in this particular Japan). It also presents a great and brilliant solution to this enormous tragedy. <br /> <br /> Horror, action, suspense, science fiction, documentary, love story and all the human interest story you can get, you'll find it all here! But I also warn you that you are a true tearjerker! The castles, actors and all are excellent, better than any Hollywood movie! <br /> <br /> The thing is ... this can really happen anywhere in the world! Now, let me ask you this once you have seen ... "what would you do if you were confronted in this situation of life and death"?
