I've never been so surprised with such an old movie. Only "The Treasury of the Sierra Madre" remains well in terms of performance. As someone who saw the heroin addiction first hand, I was shocked at how realistic this movie was. Frank Sinatra's performance is completely uncompromising, realistic and painful. The direction of Otto Preminger is perfect for the film, with long shots and a very mobile camera. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's performance is good, as is Eleanor Parker's. In fact, the entire support cast works great, with discrete performances, as consistent with the style of the movie. The documentary style is part of what keeps this movie up to date. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8.0 out of 10
