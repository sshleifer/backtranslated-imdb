Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One) gives us an exciting film where the accolades go to supporting actor John Malkovich. His criminal trying to assassinate the president was first and credible. <br /> <br /> This is not to lessen the efforts of Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo, or even Fred Dalton Thompson, who plays a real white idiot. Chief of Staff of the House. Eastwood was great, and I love any movie that Russo is in. <br /> <br /> The film features original five-time Oscar-winning music (Mal√®na, Bugsy, The Untouchables, The Mission, Days of Paradise) Ennio Morricone. That alone is worth your time.
