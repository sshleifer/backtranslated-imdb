Uncle Frank is everyone's uncle. This documentary covered all aspects of aging in America, loneliness, humor, irony. Uncle Frank and Aunt Tillie were extremely generous in sharing their life experiences with the public. The director did an unbelievable job of capturing the small and large pieces that made up his life. Thanks to everyone who helped make this movie!
