This documentary focuses on events in Gothenburg, 2001. In Swedish media, demonstrators were depicted as criminals who represented anarchy and violence. This movie shows that they do not exist, in fact they are intelligent, they articulate people who have something to say - And say it by the force of the bricks. They believe in a better world, a world in which people can think and say what they want - without aiming. But are your beliefs about having the possibility to change realistic society? I think not. <br /> <br /> This documentary gives us insight into the issues of greed, capitalism and the future that it can bring. It's a great documentary that is not propaganda because it is not shown as what they say is right. All that shows is what some individuals think and it is up to the viewer to decide whether what they do and represent is right or wrong. <br /> <br /> I've heard many people who label this advertisement and therefore choose not to see it, I think they are making a bad decision because even if you sympathize with the police or with the protesters, all you have is more facts, for example, the boy who shot says he thinks it's good to throw a brick through a McDonalds window because it's the step between thinking and acting as you think. <br /> <br /> Overall this movie scared me because you can not really ignore the facts that the few police officers who fought violence with violence were not convicted or even held in custody but the evidence of them throwing bricks at the march of manifestation (and in some cases beating people with batons, although they are in the street without resistance) where as good as it gets. Rating: 8/10 - Very good, but not the best!
