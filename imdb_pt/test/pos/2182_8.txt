I saw this last night at Turner Classic Movies (TCM). I had never heard of it before, and I was rather surprised to find it so captivating. <br /> <br /> Bogart makes a star as a cynical publisher of the city who reluctantly accompanies his greedy radio network boss on this incisive programmer "B". About 12 years before he played the city cynics to perfection in films like Deadline USA, Knock On Any Door, The Barefoot Contessa and The Harder They Fall, the Bogie already had the star qualities down. To raise audience ratings and raise the level of programming a bit more popular, WUBC, "the Voice of America," launches a radio miniseries about a woman who was acquitted 20 years ago by a request for self-defense to kill her husband. Not wanting to be discreet to save the wife's and husband's reputation, the broadcaster uses covert methods to reveal everything to all listeners, and in the most loyal way possible. <br /> <br /> As a time capsule, I also found very enlightening male and female manners in the workplace in the mid-1930s. Although in addition to Henry O'Neill, I'm not familiar with the cast of support, the players were uniformly excellent, and the direction was tense. <br /> <br /> If you like this type of movie (ex: The Face in The Crowd, An Inspector Calls, etc.), do not miss the opportunity to see this. <br /> <br />
