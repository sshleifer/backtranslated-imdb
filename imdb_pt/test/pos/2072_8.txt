Part of the BBC's footage of all of Shakespeare's classic plays, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my private impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most beloved pieces and that Hamlet is not a particularly touching and tragic character. I do not feel sympathy for him, and I did not do it after seeing this. <br /> <br /> Even when you have great actors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of the Dane, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, can not disguise the lack of passion in the plot. And when a good actor like Jacobi injects passion into it, he makes the whole role incomprehensible. I just could not connect his character physicalization to what he was saying, and it killed me. That said, he gets the "Be or Not to Be" speech correct, since his actions with a dagger make clear the suicidal intentions of the character at that moment of the play. <br /> <br /> The supporting roles, to me better written and hence better played, are pleasing, notably the well-detailed interpretation of Cl√°udio de Loopy Ophelia and Stewart of Lalla Ward. <br /> <br /> At four and a half hours, it is very long and best seen in bite sized pieces. Check it out if you're interested, but be prepared for a long clock.
