Look, we rate this as a value of 10 in entertainment. It's a comedy for sure, not an epic like the Lord of the Rings, or Gone with the Wind. Yet for comedy, particularly nowadays, it's a 10. <br /> <br /> It's not a long movie, it moves quickly and easily. Kelsey Grammar at home is the role of a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel submarine placed against the US Navy in a war game planned to see if the terrorists would get a nuclear bomb through our defenses . (half ironic this plot ... pre 911) Do not take this topic seriously because it is mostly laughs from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is the second in command (as "Frank Burns") and pulls many laughs. All others are perfect for your parties as well. Rip Torn and Bruce Dern. <br /> <br /> Look clear and simple, you have 90 minutes and you need a laugh or catch me and you're not a prude (their language is insinuating) and then rent it, or buy it we did) and enjoy! I wish they would do a part 2!
