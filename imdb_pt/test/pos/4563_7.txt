Sharpe's Honor for the Uninitiated, is the fifth entry in a series of TV movies focusing on an English Army Marine during the Napoleonic wars and based on the books of Bernard Cornwell (which I strongly recommend reading). If you start to notice this one in particular, you'd get the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the very centrifugal force that the rest of the army turns around. If that is the case, I recommend starting with earlier chapters such as Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but this is a good choice for a second exhibit. <br /> <br /> The story this time is about the espionage side. of things. With the French army retreating in disorder from Spain, Major Ducos, the master spy envisions an opportunity to reverse the situation. Assuming the murder of a Spanish Marquis over Richard Sharpe, British army hero, the fragile alliance between the British and Spanish will begin to crumble and things will change again. When the Spanish nobles arrive in Wellington crying for Sharpe's blood, the English general is less than willing to hang his best soldier and feigns his death, and soon he is on a secret mission behind the enemy lines to find out who plotted the plot. Surprisingly enough for a Sharpe movie too, there is a beautiful woman being rescued along the way, who fancy. <br /> <br /> What this turns out, of course, is a more adventurous approach. Concentration is less on the British military, with Sharpe as the leading figure, concentrating more on their escapades in the countryside, dodging French patrols, exploiting Spanish guerrillas, and engaging in daring escapes from fortified military positions. Sergeant Harper, his faithful right-hand man, follows him naturally, but the rest of the Marines remain in the field without knowing that their leader is still alive. Strangely though, they do receive more attention than usual, as they end up in their own subplot involving the delivery of Harper's baby. <br /> <br /> This slightly different approach makes for an intriguing episode, but it's just a good thing in the long run. And someone should be worried that there will not be the standard battle at the climax, because once again the poor French get a kick right. In addition, Ducos makes a fantastic successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as the evil guy you love to hate. He is a dubious, malicious and utterly evil son of a female canine and also strangely remembers that black guy from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out prominently as he gets the chance for more time on the screen and looks like the kind of man you'd like to give to your eldest, even though he looks like an Iron Maiden member who was catapulted back in time by accident. <br /> <br /> In short, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as ever, but considerably more bitter and angry this time, given the events of the previous film. Not the best introduction if you have not seen any of the other chapters, but show a side to Sharpe that we usually can not witness: the action hero instead of the professional soldier. And if that is not enough for you to be tempted, it is also worth watching just for the rather surreal view of an enraged Sean Bean swinging a live hen in a bunch of nuns.
