When I went to the video store, on days when the DVD was still almost unknown to me, I had seen all the movies in the store I was interested in. Or so I thought! The man behind the counter told me that he had something for me that I definitely like. He gave me "Plunkett and MacLeane". At first, I doubted it was good, but I relied on his advice and ... man, I'm sure I'm glad I took this jewel! This is one of the best adventure movies in years, if you ask me! Of course, with Robert Carlyle as an important part, how bad can a movie get? Certainly, Liv Tyler does once again what she is good for and nothing more: to be beautiful. But still, you can clearly feel that the cast apparently had a great time making this movie.
