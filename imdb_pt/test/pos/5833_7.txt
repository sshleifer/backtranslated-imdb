Hi To read the whole plot around "OZ" just look at the IMDb here to find it. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING SPOILERS INSIDE THIS REVIEW! ** Oz is the series that not only moved me, but also shows a little. From the American prison system, but I have to say (judging the channel program of discovery on the chain) is not really realistic. <br /> <br /> Although I have to say, there is no shyness, rapes, shanking happens allot. Still, it's television, so to you, you think that's a real mistake. <br /> <br /> There is a good degree of violence, and some scenes here and there are exaggerated (plot over plot and plot). This can get pretty annoying. But remember that the series is almost old now. So times change so well, I believe I should judge this in the timeline as it came out. <br /> <br /> As the season went on up to the 5th season was very good!. Until one of the cons wins a $ 2 million lottery ticket, because he spoke to God that it seemed to me "okay, this is getting to the point where I do not want to see this series anymore" Still I continued! And now I just saw episode 3 of Season 6. This is where the cereal takes its brain to the zapped and then its "mother" holds it back while it is drooling. So you see Reilly cry so well seeing his brother like that (RL BROTHERS too) Now this is by far the best scene in the entire "OZ" series, that was real for me! I still do not read that mistake I'm trying to catch and burn it. It's a very good series! And even now 2010 is worth watching! I give a 7 because of the plot that fades with the season. But it's still a glove of gold.
