I caught it on television one day when I was young and loved it. In the 1970s, there were a lot of thigh-high comedies that tried very hard to be funny, so that was a good surprise. It is one of the best comedies of the 70's and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to the excellent comedy performance of Murrary, who still stands out as one of his greatest. This is the movie that really has Ivan Reitman noticed as director. Reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. While this movie is hilarious and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad that it's fun, MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely terrible. Recommended for those who liked STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.
