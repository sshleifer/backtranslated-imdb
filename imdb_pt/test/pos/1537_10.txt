This movie gave me recurring nightmares, with Alan Rickman's voice representing an omnipotent, insidious, and fascist rule. The scariest movie I have ever seen - psychological terror more powerful than any "horror" movie ever achieved. Alan Rickman's voice will always represent to me the power and terror of a totalitarian state, reminiscent of Orwell's in 1984. This film depicts those who do not care for the reality of much of today's world governments. This movie is disturbing, but in a way that everyone should watch it - it is a description of a reality that no one should experience, but many do.
