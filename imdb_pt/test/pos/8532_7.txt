Filming is tacky. Some of the actors surpass. Some of the actions are inexplicable and inexplicable. But ... <br /> <br /> This movie is in the mood of the psychological dramas of the 50's. <br /> <br /> It's a morality game. Similar to the movie in which a "method" actor becomes the evil character he portrays on stage, Ed is forced to watch horror movies because he is the movie editor. It gives you a nervous breakdown that leads to a complete psychotic breakup. <br /> <br />
