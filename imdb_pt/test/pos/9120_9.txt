I just saw the closing movie of the Austin Film Festival. Coming in, I had seen a few excerpts from her performance at the Alamo Drafthouse, and I thought the trailer was fun, but I was not expecting such an epic theme song and the use of tarot cards is genius in the title sequence. Beware of the cameos of Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins, and the Dark Lord himself (who has a fetish for KG). Great fun and the songs are so catchy. The car chase was by far my favorite scene. I know this will gain cult status immediately and win some new Tenacious D fans, just like me. I hope this is well in theaters. "Follow me, we are the shadows"
