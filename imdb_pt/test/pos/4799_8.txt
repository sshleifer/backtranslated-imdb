"Nazarin", directed by Luis Bunuel, presents an extraordinary vision of the religion in Mexico. As written by the director and Julio Alejandro, his notable collaborator, this was a film that put Mexican cinema on the international map after receiving the Grand Prix at Cannes that year. It's a disturbing movie because Mr. Bunuel deepens what's wrong with the church. <br /> <br /> Nazarin, by all accounts, is a saint. This young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a decaying pension of a city. He does not have enough for himself, but he does not mind separating himself with a coin when a beggar comes to his window for help. At the same time, he takes to his small room a prostitute who was injured in a quarrel with another woman. Andara, the woman pays her kindness by burning the room and the whole building! Nazarin is seen going into the field begging for food. Andara and Beatriz, two prostitutes from his old city follow him. The life of Nazareth is similar to that of Jesus. In fact, this holy figure stands for humility. <br /> <br /> Of course Mr. Bunuel had no religion in mind when he and Mr. Alejandro were in charge of creating this film. It's ironic how Spain welcomed him after this movie was released because they saw him as showing Christian qualities, when in reality this is a bitter satire on the Catholic Church and its ministers. <br /> <br /> Francisco Rabal, the Spanish actor, makes a wonderful Nazarin. This was one of your best roles. Mr. Rabal worked extensively in his native country, but also in Mexico and Argentina. Rita Macedo, like Andara, is also excellent. Marga Lopez also makes a valuable contribution to her interpretation of Beatrice. <br /> <br /> A great film by one of the filmmakers: Luis Bunuel.
