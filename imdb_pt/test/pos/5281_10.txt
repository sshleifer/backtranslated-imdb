Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a beautifully animated film and a relief from the many heartless CGI films being made. The pastel and crayon backgrounds were a surprise after Sen for Chihiro in Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) and Hauru in Ugoku Shiro (Howl's Animated Castle) to be so similar stylistically. The style worked well for the film and was done exceptionally well. The time and effort to animate this is greatly appreciated as it gives the characters much more life, the details and the care that takes the film becomes much better. There are several great scenes throughout the film that have a lot of movement and action. The best for me to be a scene where Ponyo's sisters turn into huge waves like fish as she runs over them. The story is simple, but pretty well written and played. The plot has remained focused around character relations and while it has not been played out as in Tonari in Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro) it is still great. I felt that each character had an adequate amount of screen time different from Spirited Away, which was so full of distinctive characters that it could have been extended into a whole series (The Radish Spirit. real with the movie was the end. The way his writing in the English version at least makes it appear that there will be some great test given to S≈çsuke, who ends up being promising to Ponyos's mother that he will love Ponyo. Although I think about it more, I may think that the translation may not be as accurate as the real meaning of the test being the promise and that it really wants it. The movie seemed to end abruptly though. Other than that the movie was great and I highly recommend it.
