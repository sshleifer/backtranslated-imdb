This is another of those rare films that feels grateful to be presented instead of the usual Hollywood tripe. It's really a roller coaster as we follow the effects of a forged bill of 500 euros on a multitude of people. Someone asks "what if" all the time, but it sure is a butterfly effect captured in the movie. It will have you laughing, crying and biting your lip. Loved every minute! And thanks to SBS Australia for showing movies that are really fun, it's worth the effort to read the subtitles. The only downside in my mind is that I will not be booking a holiday for the Frozen Land - they all seem to be very depressed - it must be all that cold weather. Anyway, watch out - it's worth every second.
