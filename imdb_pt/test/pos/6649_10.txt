How can you like and dislike the same movie? <br /> <br /> The plot is very much like the Jody Foster thing, Sommersby, which is not so good. Nicole was great ... Jude was adequate. They did not give you many lines ... is there a reason for that? Generally, he is a good actor. She is so elegant, her character is such a hick. It makes us wonder what they see in each other. <br /> <br /> The romance between two of them only succeeded in Lady Chatterly's lover. <br /> <br /> I think dislike happens because the movie is too long. They could have told the story in two hours. <br /> <br /> The story is good. Good locations, good footage. The actors of the character were great.
