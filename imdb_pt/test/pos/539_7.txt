is a movie to watch on TV and only once .. I mean, it's fine, but it's a little too long and the plot is so well known, it's not very original, but it's not boring. the best thing about the movie are the performances, natalie portman and susan sarandon are great actresses and in this movie they did a great job. I give a 7.
