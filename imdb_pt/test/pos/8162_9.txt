I was impressed by the story. He had the "typical" male predatory gay and the "typical" Mormon missionary. But each of them also had friends and family who balanced their lives well. There are a number of characters, some good and some not so good, each with its own personality nuances. And, most reminded me of people in my own life. <br /> <br /> The story begins with several humorous moments and slowly evolves into a comforting relationship film. The story advances without obvious plots and never speaks to you. This makes you think a bit while you wait to see what happens. Even when I thought I could predict something coming, I was amazed at how it actually happened. <br /> <br /> There are not many movies that make me laugh consciously at real gay dialogue and then bring a tear to my eyes when I feel the pain of the characters. I watched the movie on DVD, and could not stop watching until it was over. (Normally, I watch a movie in a few days). It's good to see a gay characters movie that is edifying, but it's not a preaching. I highly recommend this movie! And not just gay people. Relations transcend sexuality.
