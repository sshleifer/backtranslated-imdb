I think the problem with this show not having the respect it really deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld, after ELR and after Friends. These three series were the star of his time. <br /> <br /> KOQs came at the end of this special time on TV. <br /> <br /> But do not let it dissuade you. <br /> <br /> The King of Queens is as good, if not better, than two of the three mentioned. <br /> <br /> Seinfeld started it all and it was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed as much as I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs come quite close. <br /> <br /> When it comes to laughing, I have to rank the KOQs just second to Seinfeld. ELR has to be the second, since the creation and interaction of the character is more captivating. <br /> <br /> Anyway, KOQs is the top ten of the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The only other series worth mentioning is Two and a Half Men, which does not really hold the other four, but that's all we have left.
