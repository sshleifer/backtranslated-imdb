The fact that this movie was shown at the Barbican in London suggests that the print must have been acceptable enough for such a display. Now, the question is: why has this long lost and important film not been available on DVD (or even on VHS)? A large number of people in Europe and the United States have been waiting for many years to see this film, if not for another reason, the wonderful song written by Sergei Prokofiev. What has to be done to produce such a wonderful production that is available to a wider audience, not just to the Barbican of London? Having been a listener dedicated to Prokofiev's music for many years and aware of this film, PLEASE someone 'out there' do the right thing and show it as a DVD.
