The short film that took Gaspar Noe to the movie map, introducing us to his horrifying but completely interesting character, The Butcher, was brilliantly played by Phillipe Nahon. Noe's direction here has all the characteristics of his later films, showing that he was sculpting his own voice and style from the beginning. His sudden cut along with harsh and loud noise, ignoring flashbacks and many other techniques are used to disconcert the viewer. And this certainly works. In addition, he is not afraid to show violence, as the viewers of the irreversible will know. Here the violence is equally powerful, and in the sequence Seoul Contre Tous, is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a horse being killed. He is shot in the head and we watch him squirm on the ground, the pool of blood flowing out. We then see a human birth in all its bloody glory, the Butcher's daughter. He was orphaned in World War II and grew up hating the world, and everyone and everything in him. He serves his clients, but his inner monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts, he wants them all dead. His daughter Blandine Lenoir, who would also reprise her role six years later, is the only thing he cares about, and we see them grow old together. She is however mute and subject to intimidation and play. The Butcher's relationship with her is almost incestuous, bathing her when she's old enough to do it alone, but that's more explored in the next movie. When she is attacked by a man, the Butcher explodes with rage, stabbing an innocent man in the mouth. He goes to prison, taken from the only things he wants - his store and daughter. In the short 40 minutes, we see all this and more, his time in prison and return to his world. Because of the state of his daughter, autistic also think, she is bland, does little except look, and is under the total control of her father. The film continues in the exceptionally somber Seoul Contre Tous. If you can, watch these two movies, this first one. It has a truly excellent performance, but it is very difficult to watch due to the ruthless tone. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
