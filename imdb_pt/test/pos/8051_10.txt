The movie is the beginning of what really happened in Phenix City. I'm a grandson of the people who really lived the story. The truth never came to my notice. I tried to figure out the whole story, but the people who lived are still afraid to tell. Phenix City is still run by dishonest people. Albert Patterson was not exactly the saint that history wants you to believe. The story was filmed in Phenix City. There are still some of the famous sites you see in the movie. Colonal Funeral Home still looks exactly the same. But if you are wanting the true story of Sin City, you have to visit us and find people willing to tell you about Ma's beaches and their kindness. She did not get the name ma for nothing.
