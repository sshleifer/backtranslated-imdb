Watching this movie always reminds me of what I remember the summer being like, God! a long time ago. The entire scene that surrounds the "overnight," from the canoe procession to the end of the trip, is precious, and Tripper's story about the homicidal maniac is an urban legend from my youth. A very entertaining film, often better by the terrible aftermath that followed.
