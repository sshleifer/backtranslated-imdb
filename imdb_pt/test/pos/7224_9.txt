Tromeo and Juliet is perhaps the best Shakespeare modernization I've ever seen, not that there's a lot of competition, but anyway ... <br /> <br /> Altogether, Tromeo and Juliet is definitely one of the best films of Troma , one of the small pearls hidden in a huge pile of manure. It's a fun, action-packed and bloody story about the world's greatest love story, but it still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as possible except in this kind of movie. Well, except at the end, where Tromeo and Juliet kill Juliet's abusive father, and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their horribly mutant children. <br /> <br /> THIS is the high movie school literature classes should show, instead of making poor students read hundreds and hundreds of pages of Shakespeare's scripts. Affirmative!
