There is only one racist joke in this short Daffy Duck, which is basically when Daffy mounts Black Beauty, is a black woman. I can partly understand why this joke was included, since at the time few people did not know how ruthless it was to be racist and it was not illegal to discriminate against blacks yet. <br /> In addition, point, "A Coy Decoy" is basically a fun, interesting, where Daffy attends characters in books and does things in books. I liked this short enough (despite the other reviewers here). The way Daffy is so in love with the mechanical duck is vaguely disturbing but at the same time very amusing. Porky is a good edition for the episode, although it was not vital for him to be there. The wolf is an example of how people remembered wolves in those days too, terrible animals and bloodthirsty, which of course they never really were (unless they are very hungry). I also liked the style of animation used - and the theme of the episode. <br /> <br /> For people who are totally into the Daffy Duck and for people who do not care for the occasional racist jokes in cartoons, take advantage of "A Coy Decoy"! <br /> <br /> Available on YouTube.
