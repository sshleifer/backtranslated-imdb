This is the standard fare for a director who has long been among my favorites. <br /> <br /> Even though it is very flat compared to many of his other works but his Argento and this may be biased but I'll be giving a good rating anyway. <br /> <br /> It contains many good ideas. The voyeuristic sudden element. The needles under the eyes. Bloody and disturbing deaths. And the flashback clich√© of Argento. Disadvantages include the heavy metal soundtrack, acting and the ending. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is made worthwhile for the birds in the aftermath of the theater near the end. <br /> <br /> A good Argento movie, but it did better. Much better!
