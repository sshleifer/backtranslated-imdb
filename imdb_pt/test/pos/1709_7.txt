I've been a fan of Larry King's show for some time, I think he does a great job overall and I do not think he "falls in love" as many people seem to believe. He is a subtle Scorpio when he needs it, as he managed to do last night with Paris Hilton during his first post-prison TV interview. <br /> <br /> The thing about this case all that really impressed me is that Hilton still does not know why Judge Sauer gave her what she believes to be a very harsh sentence (and moreover, in fact MADE served it). All the time she was in prison, supposedly alone for twenty-three hours a day in her cell, she never once in her mind rewound the events that led to the sentence that Judge Sauer found fit to impose on her. She never realized that this could have triggered a big red flag when she (1) appeared late in court for the original hearing and (2) started informing him when he asked her if she did not know that her license had been suspended , she did not get the papers in the mail, that "I have people who read this sort of thing to me." <br /> <br /> Throughout the time she was in her cell, she never came to the conclusion that this action (appearing late) and this statement - and more important, the attitude - the complete disrespect of the knight for court system and the law in general and her driving privileges in particular, which she displayed - could only have made Judge Sauer (pardon the pun) go sour with her. <br /> <br /> Last night at King's show, after saying that she changed forever with her traumatic experience, how she "learned" the lesson, she answered his question: "Do you think you have a raw deal? "with a resounding yes. And during the course of the conversation (if you can say that), she said more than once that she did not think she deserved what had happened to her. King asked, gently, more than once, if she does not feel that she creates the situations in her life where she "lies," to which she practically stared at him blankly. She basically, therefore, maintains the conscious belief that she has been victimized in this situation; she does not understand how she herself did that day in court for her arrogant attitude toward the judge. I feel this is very sad - even tragic, considering what a huge "Hilton" model is for some people, and that makes everything she said last night about her rehabilitated state in the realms of total and complete lack of notion , contradiction and hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> During the interview, Hilton alluded to spending a lot of time in her cell reading the Bible. At the end of the interview, King scored key points asking him what his favorite Bible passage was. She replied, puzzled by her pathetic notes (utterly shallow non-insights, which she read in the air like Nelson Mandella or something) and finally grunted, "I do not have a favorite passage." <br /> <br /> Judge Sauer in my book is a hero, and after last night, so does Larry King, by subtly exposing Hilton for what she really is.
