"The Dead" is truly a work of art. Clearly, John Huston intended to show that he was still "in the full glory of some passion" in doing so, even when his body was failing. This movie is affecting powerfully and remains in the mind long after it has been made. Reading Joyce's tale surely adds more depth to the characters, especially to Gabriel's inner turmoil, but the essence is all there in this film. As an artist's statement of his love of life and his craft, "The Dead" stands alone.
