Growing up as the son of cinema, one of the trilogies I will not soon forget is the Karate Kid. You can put down Ralph / Daniel as much as you want, but it is the message behind the movies that are important, that it is important to be respectful to all creatures large and small, but to defend yourself when time demands. Coming back to the film in hand, it's kind of funny because I've seen Boys Do not Cry and I was really impressed by Hillary Swank's performance, and flipping through the sea of ​​channels the other night, I came across the showing of that movie. movie and I had not realized at the time of my first viewing of this movie that she was in it. The story revolves around Julie, just like Daniel, not knowing where to fit or if she wants to fit in and the master teacher is brought in to help straighten her and guide her. I really enjoyed this addition to the series, because it gave a good feminine side to the story and yes, even some clothes that Hillary was keeping me, say, stimulated. <br /> <br /> General 3.5 of 5
