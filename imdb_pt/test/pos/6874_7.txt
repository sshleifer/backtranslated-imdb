An almost marvelous blend of comedy, romance and medical chaos has a solitary 50-year-old doctor, tired of going to rock shows with nubile airheads, dating a patient the same age he met in his rounds. Julius Epstein's screenplay shows a good amount of sophistication, although he does not have enough material to fill the last third of the picture, and you can almost feel the film falling. The subframe about the hospital being investigated for its poor business affairs does not work satisfactorily, and it seems highly invented anyway. Still, Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson are a fantastic team, Richard Benjamin and Art Carney very funny in support. Director Howard Zieff keeps everything appearing, and even when Epstein's one-liners feel rejected by Neil Simon, Zieff moves on happily. The results are extremely engaging and occasionally quite sweet. Followed by a series of bankrupt TV. *** in ****
