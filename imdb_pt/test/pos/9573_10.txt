Working as a sort of mid-point between "Waiting for Guffman" and "A Mighty Wind," "Best in Show" portrays a show of dogs and the various people who bring their canine friends to participate. Some are strangers, some crazy and others, but they all make the movie good. Director Christopher Guest is particularly funny as the gay Harlan Pepper, trying to promote his dog. Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara and Bob Balaban also do great work (I can not imagine them not doing good work, at least not in a Christopher Guest movie). As someone who has never attended a dog show, this movie is my primary exposure to them. They sure look good.
