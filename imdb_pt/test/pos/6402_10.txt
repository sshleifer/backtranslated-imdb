I agree that this was one of the best episodes of this show. I remember well the series as it was in the Florida Keys when the show got its premiere. I was looking for old VCR tapes that were "keeper" and found two that had about eight episodes. I ended up spending part of Christmas Eve (and the next) watching these shows. The singer was Bankie Banx - saw his name appear on the credits. He is from Anguilla and owns a bar called The Dune Preserve. He is a long time friend of Jimmy Buffett and Bankie's classic song "Still In Paradise" is featured on Buffett's latest CD called "Live In Anguilla" - it's track 12 on CD 1 and 8 on CD. I would also like to see someday this short series be released on DVD. Have faith!
