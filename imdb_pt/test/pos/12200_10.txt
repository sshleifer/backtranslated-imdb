Surface was one of the few truly unique shows on TV last season. I can honestly say that I have modified my schedule so that I can be at home to watch every episode. Tons of action, suspense, science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> Story was of a boy who found an egg that broke out in a sea creature. The same sea creature that killed the main character's brother and the female character (oceanographer) had seen it. Most people think it's a deadly killing machine, but the one that was lifted from the egg was very friendly. <br /> <br /> The only problem is NBC canceled, so now we will never know what happens ... I hope that science fiction or some other channel will get it.
