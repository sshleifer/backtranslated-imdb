The movie started, the wheels turned, your car went into a race against the Fox ... You are behind you can not get ahead, you imagine, "if I leave, I'm taking you with me ..." You beat us cars parked on the roadside, turns to attack Fox, but his goal is bad ... Bang, you climbed into the back of a VW and hit the ground. in a reservoir. Your car lights up. You could leave if you wanted, but the shame of losing took you ... BANG! His car explodes, everyone looks in despair, some crying ... The sound of a siren tells him that the cops are coming. Everyone gets into their cars and bolts, letting you burn. The charred remains of the structure of the cars are there, haunting the spectators ... You are dead. <br /> <br /> This is one of the scenes; it's actually the first scene in the movie. There are many more like this. When you enter the Fox cockpit on your speedy V8 ford, Terry Serio on his crazy GTHO, and many others on this blast from the past ... JOHN CLARKS masterpiece, "RUNNING ON EMPTY" "-He's Gonna Win At Any Cost-"
