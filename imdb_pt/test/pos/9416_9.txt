This movie takes the voice of terror and makes it better. Holmes is protecting an inventor in Switzerland and is in the wake of the teacher's misery, who has become a Nazi. This is a better version of holmes in a World War II world. Rathbone does a great job with Holmes as a spy and detective. See this if you like the voice of terror.
