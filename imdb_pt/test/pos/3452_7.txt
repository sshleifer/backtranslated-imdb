This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and their influence on them is obvious: in dialogue, location, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photograph is remarkably confident. The steering is elegant and mostly well made. If you liked the first Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller, then you will love "Oz". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. This similarity suggests that "Oz" was way ahead of its time. The critics of 1967 hated it and the audience was left out - Australia in the 1960s, as in the 1940s in the United States, was somehow the kind of place where compliance was important, while this film is very different from what the viewers expected , promotional posters. This film is likely to appeal more to contemporary audiences: it is still oddly clumsy and self-conscious, but in a contemporary European way rather than an Australian style from the 1960s. Joy Dunstan (who later appeared on the Australian TV series "Prisoner" ) plays her role with less passion than her current Jacki Weaver could have done, instead the Dunstan character conveys some of the strength of the most famously depicted Australian women. by Kylie Minogue playing Charlene Mitchell on the Australian TV series Neighbors and later developed into later roles in her career. Men will also like this movie, which features several male subjects in a way different from most movies from the mid-sixties in the US or even Australia. In particular, Bruce Spence (who later went on to play Tion Medon in Star Wars III, Trainman in the Matrix movies and the helicopter pilot in the Road Warrior and Thunderdome movies) plays a central role and role supported that jointly supports the rest of the cast. This movie is worth just for Bruce Spence's performance. 7/10 for some minor problems of continuity.
