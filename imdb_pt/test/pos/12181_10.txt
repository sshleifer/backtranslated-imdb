I completely adapted this from Anne Rice's book. While most of the film is filmed here in Australia, it offers a lot of scenery and a fantastic area to film. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) recently woke up from a long period of sleep and decided to betray his vampire oath. revealing itself to a band. When he becomes a popular movie icon, his fellow vampires, rather despicably, go mad and plot their death. Meanwhile, Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), an orphaned member of the supernatural studies, who has an old family tree of vampires, became deeply obsessed with Lestat. His boss David (Paul McGann) understands his obsession and reveals his obsession with vampire Marius, (Vincent Perez) who is a former vampire and the man who made Lestat a vampire as well. Jesse receives Lestat's diary and reads his first murder and a meeting with the Queen of the Damned - Akasha (Aaliyah). When Lestat does a show in Death Valley, he gets news that not only the angry vampires will be there, but Akasha can also come. Meanwhile, Akasha has other plans. She goes to a vampire coven, a bar and kills everyone on her way. With Lestat tempted with royalty and loving care for Akasha the old vampires consisting of Marius and Jesses Aunt Maharet (Lena Olin) conspire against them. Join her or die? <br /> <br /> I found the film fantastic, with great fighting scenes, great music and great locations. Aaliyah unfortunately died in a plane crash shortly before the movie's premiere, but she looked gorgeous on set and off sets. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10/10 because it was a fantastic movie and I recommend you to see!
