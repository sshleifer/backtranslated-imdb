This BBC series is unbelievably good fun. I had only seen a few minutes before I knew I had to own it and watch it again with all my friends. I would not recommend this to anyone, but almost everyone will like it - from the snobbery of the movies to the masses hungry for entertainment. The protagonist is a lesbian, but still worth seeing if this is not what you like. <br /> <br /> Rachael Stirling is amazing in a leading role that transforms her into a dazzling array of emotions and situations, some in a bizarre way. nature. No one who has seen this series would say she can not act. It makes us laugh, cry, get excited and slap our foreheads. <br /> <br /> You can not really compare this story to anything else. It is not a repetition of style or plot. It is entirely her own beast, comedy, historical drama, erotic literature, story about maturation, music, and more. I have to praise the BBC for making this story. I can not imagine anyone in the (overly prudent and stereotyped) US doing this. So stop reading about it and go buy it.
