This is my favorite game for the Nintendo 64 platform. I've played many first-person shooter games, and I've never really liked any of them, but this game has a certain thing that I can not put on my finger, him an incredible fun. Maybe it's the extraordinary detail put into the game. Maybe it's the fluid movement of the characters. Maybe it's the gadgets and weapons. Maybe it's the soft character of James Bond. Whatever it is, this game never seems to get old, no matter how many times I've played.
