This is a great show that featured the best songs from the band's 30-year career. Lee, Lifeson and Peart were lively and entertaining on stage and did a great show. That said, I think the audio recording was failed on the mixing console and / or through the microphone process. This is not the boys fault though. They even mentioned that the show was set up at the last minute, so the band and its crew obviously did their best. They simply should not have put the show for public consumption. Neil's loop sounds distant and Geddy's bass has good harmonic content, but it has no background !! They should have resisted this concert and hoped for a better occasion. Just buy this DVD if you are a Rushian hardcore. The quality is missing in the audio department.
