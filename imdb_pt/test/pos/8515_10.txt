Background information - The Octopussy and Never Say Never Again films were both made the same year, 1983, and so naturally people compare them. Moore vs. Connery Bond against Bond. <br /> <br /> I've heard many people claiming that the "official film" Octopussy is far superior. Well, I just watched Octopussy. Bond is flying an airplane at 100 miles per hour (impossible - the wind would blow him off), using his feet to force the plane to land and then hopping about 100 km / h (again impossible - try jumping out of your car --- you'd end up with a broken body). How should this octopussy scene be "good" in any sense of the word? Suddenly Bond has superhuman strength and a titanium body. And he does all these acrobatics at the age of 56 years ??? Full crap. Unbelievable. Farse. <br /> <br /> Now let's contrast the above scene with Connery's "unofficial" Never Say Never Again: It does not have the same polish because of its independent movie status (less money), but at least you can believe that Connery is a real spy in real danger. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Bond showing his age (he is 50 after all) and being expelled for recovery. Totally believable. But of course there is no "day off" for a world-famous spy, and Bond quickly sees himself as a target even inside the hospital. From that point, the story turns into another adventure, with Bond trying to pinpoint his attempts to kill and ultimately thwart an attempt to steal nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> As usual, Sean Connery did a brilliant job and avoids top / unbelievable acrobatics. This movie looks like a natural successor to Connery's last film, "The Diamonds Are Forever," 1971 ... the old Bond style ... before the franchise became ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
