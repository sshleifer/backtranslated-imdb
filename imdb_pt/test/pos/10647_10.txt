Based on actual events in 1905, the silent film THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN concerns a Russian imperial ship in which abominable conditions lead to riot. Shocked by the condition of the ship, the citizens of the port city of Odessa gather to support the mutineers - and as a result, they are at the mercy of the imperial forces, which attack civilian defenders with savage force. <br /> <br /> POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are far less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and reaches its incredible power by showing the confrontation of groups and crowds in a series of sequences extraordinarily viewed and edited. Surprisingly, each of these sequences surpasses the previous, and the film actually develops in power as it moves from mutiny to citizen manifestation to massacre on the steps of Odessa - the latter of which is among the most famous sequences throughout Cinema's history. Filming largely where real events actually took place, director Eisenstein's vision is extraordinary as he builds - not just from sequence to sequence, but from moment to moment within each sequence - some of the most memorable images ever made at the movies. <br /> <br /> Describing POTEMKIN as a great movie is a kind of euphemism. It is an absolute absolute, an absolute necessity for anyone seriously interested in cinema as an art form, purely visual cinema at its most brilliant, often imitated, rarely equaled, never surpassed. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
