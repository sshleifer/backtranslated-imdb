A scintillating film. BB is a marvel. She's sexy. She is a feminist. She's still very much in love. <br /> <br /> The film features Paris in the 50's. It's wonderful to look at the locals, the cars (DS!) and Orly. <br /> <br /> A simple but very enjoyable romantic comedy. The music is horrendous. Almost dissonates. On the other hand, it's hilarious. But it's probably the only thing wrong, at least looking at it with the eyes of the 21st century. The film comments on the French way of treating infidelity. It is this modern sense. A movie like an elephant if trompe enormenent did it in the 80's. But the basic premise remains the same. <br /> <br /> Thank you to the manufacturers for providing BB with this opportunity.
