The Vietnam War era is certainly much earlier than my time, but it has always interested me, and I have seen many films about it. All the others I saw had dealt strictly with the front line of the battle. When I read a description of "The War at Home," I found the concept intriguing. No Vietnam War movie I ever heard of talked about what happens to a soldier once the fight is over. <br /> <br /> One evening while flipping through the canals, the movie aired on The Sundance Channel. I lowered my control and came back to watch. I did not move from the seat for the entire two hours; is one of those movies that keeps you very interested because there is no way to predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> This film made me a big fan of Emilio Estevez. I really liked him as Billy the Kid in the "Young Guns" movies, but I never saw anything he did afterwards. Emilio proved to be very talented in writing and directing, as well as acting. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the film is done extremely well. I find it difficult to think of a point where it creeps. <br /> <br /> What strikes me is that he did not get an Oscar or any real recognition when he left. It's a dramatic story about parents trying to cope with the fact that their child is not who he used to be and probably will never be how they remembered him again. Definitely worth seeing.
