The Simpsons, of course, started with the Christmas special "Bake Simpson in an open fire" which had basic designs and no laughing jokes, but this episode probably has the first joke out loud and hence the show just gets better and better. This episode revolves around Bart, who in this episode takes a test of Martin and enters a school for the highly talented, which causes Bart to mend his friendship with his father and lose all his companions. The episode is very humorous and shows what would become the greatest show of all time. Overall, fans of the show will love this episode, since the character is exactly how they turned 20 years later. So watch this episode in a first season bundle and enjoy the beginning of Simpson doing what it was to do, making people laugh. I rate this episode 73%.
