I think this is a fabulous movie ... I watched it constantly from the age of 4 until 8 ... However, watching it resulted in many nightmares. I particularly picked them up because of the guy who was always like "the other world" and his friends. I'm 12 and I still have nightmares about it to this day. I can not fall asleep now because I'm thinking about it. I love this movie, but it's so scary! I definitely love this movie, I have great memories of it. Kate is very good at acting in this movie. Surprisingly, I never realized it was her! I also think the graphics were of high quality, contrary to what other people think
