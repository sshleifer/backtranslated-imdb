This was one of the few Norwegian films I really expected to see. It began as some commercials with a heterogeneous group in soccer matches. So they made a movie out of it. The protagonists are not professionals (and you can see that), but they still do a very good job and the film, on the whole, surprised me. <br /> <br /> Norway is known for making bad movies (no offense), but I had a good feeling about it. Even you are not interested in football I wanted to see 2. The story is much better than expected and the laughter continues to pile up. there are many appearances by celebrities and Norwegian players. the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them. IF YOU WILL NEVER SEE A NORWEGIAN MOVIE. LEAVE THIS ONE !!!!
