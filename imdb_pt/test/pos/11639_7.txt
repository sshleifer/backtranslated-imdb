Although it may not be the most laughable movie, MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE is one of Charley Chase's most satisfying farewell comedies, twenty minutes of clever jokes, well choreographed comedy and entertaining jokes (presented via title card, of course) all based on a crazy and madly implausible premise. We are told that this is "a story of homely people - a woman with a face that would stop a clock - and her husband with a face that would start again." Soon we meet with Charley Moose and his wife Vivien, who has a huge nose. But it is no use discussing plausibility when our plot depends on a patently unbelievable series of interconnected coincidences: that is, first, that Charley would have his final correction on the same day that his wife would have her nose fixed, second, that each spouse would keep his nose . their secret cosmetic surgeries of the other, and third, that when they collided with one another in public afterwards, Charley and Vivien did not recognize each other. Sounds like a bit of extension, does not it? Several sections are more similar. Clearly, we're in the world of farce here and we just have to roll with the plot twists, so as long as you can relax and forget the plausibility, you're likely to enjoy this short. POWERFUL AS A MOOSE begins early as the various complications of the story are set, but things get better as soon as Charley and Vivien "know each other" and set up a date to go to a party together at the home of dentist of Charley. Each of them runs home excitedly, enters separately and at first does not notice the presence of each other. (Mr. and Mrs. Moose seem to be quite wealthy, incidentally, because they live in a mansion the size of a luxury hotel.) There follows a beautifully timed sequence that somewhat resembles THE NAVIGATOR by Buster Keaton, in which husband and wife run home without ever meeting face-to-face. And once they arrive at the party, the comedy really kicks in when Charley is forced to dance with Clumsy Wallflower Gale Henry. Henry, an exhilarating player in his own right who has performed in many short comedies dating back to 1914, is hilarious as the dance partner who brings great vigor but little grace for her to dance. There is also an elegant cinematic touch during this sequence as the camera bends down to show us only the shoes of Charley, Gale, Vivien and Vivien's dance partner, but we are able to follow precisely what happens between the principles by watching them . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Charley and Vivien the party they are taking part in is invaded, and hence the complications multiply when they manage to escape from the police network and return home. When Charley realizes that his newly-pretentious wife was trying to date another man, he solves for each one a lesson. . . while conveniently forgetting, of course, that he was trying to do the same thing. The last minutes of this movie offer some of Chase's funniest physical comedy, capped with a good gag for punchline. POWERFUL AS A RANGE leaves the viewer with a warm glow, and certainly ranks with the most entertaining comedies produced by the prolific, sadly underrated Charley Chase.
