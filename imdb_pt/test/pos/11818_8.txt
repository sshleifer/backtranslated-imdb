The issue of children being terminally ill is difficult and sad, but "The Cure" successfully portrays the idea that it does not have to be all disgrace and gloom and, if so, children need to have hope and delight in their lives, if go to find peace before the end. It is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and childhood innocence. <br /> <br /> The film sees Erik, a dysfunctional teenager with a distant mother, moving to a new area where his neighbor is neighbors. Dexter, who was 11 years old, contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion. After his initial fears and ignorance about AIDS are dispelled, Erik becomes friends with Dexter and his near-brotherly friendship makes them embark on a journey across the Mississippi to where they have heard of a New Orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for disease. The talent of the two young leaders of Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello, who play Erik and Dexter respectively, is exceptional. Brad was able to portray Erik's advantage without understanding the subtle infantile innocence inherent in the character, while Joseph portrays the sense of vulnerability to Dexter's character, but injects the right amount of childish enthusiasm and zeal to emphasize that his illness does not mean that he there is still a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven-year-old. The pair's interactions create a sense in the audience that these are two boys who are genuinely close and who carry the film well. Annabella Sciorra also makes a moving performance when Dexter's mother, Linda, who adores her son and delights to see him thrive on this new friendship with Erik and becomes a surrogate mother figure to the other boy. against an excellent soundtrack, 'The Cure' is a very bittersweet film that perfectly manages the history of childhood friendship that survives firmly in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness, without resorting to dirty things or unnecessary sweet scenes. One very interesting reflection in the film is that it is the adults who have the problem with Dexter's AIDS status, while the children, even the "bullies", come to accept it as any other. What is also very touching is how, despite Erik's rude nature, he is the most naive in his determination to heal Dexter, while the younger boy has this obsessive sense that he knows his fate, but is driven by the enthusiasm of your best friend for a cure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend 'The Cure' as it is rare to find a movie that is both sad and uplifting.
