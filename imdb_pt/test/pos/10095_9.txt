Three words: work of art. This movie is great. It's beautiful, sad, scary and thought-provoking at the same time. The score is constantly in my head, the performance is wonderful, the scenery is scary and beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br /> It was more by chance than by purpose that I saw this movie. At the time, I decided to watch this movie and got bored and read lists of Asian movies, which is maybe good. Well, I saw the title "A Tale of Two Sisters" that sounded very interesting. So I read the plot summary and decided "You do not just watch this movie, you have to buy it". Said, done. I bought this movie and got hooked from the first minute. <br /> <br /> The plot kept me interested from the beginning to the end; the twist near the end of the movie made me scream. I did not really see something like that coming. And the final scene made me cry ... it just made me cry. It was so sad. <br /> <br /> Well, I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie that combines an interesting storyline with scary scenes and atmosphere. Although you should be aware of the fact that the end is, as I mentioned before, very sad. But that just fits the mood of the movie, does not it?
