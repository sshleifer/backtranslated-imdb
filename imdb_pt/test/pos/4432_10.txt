I've never heard of the architect Louis Kahn until this documentary. In this nearly two-hour documentary, which runs very rapidly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores the life of his father from Estonia to the slums of northern Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in western Philadelphia, where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton and La Jolla, California as well as New York to explore the creative genius of his father. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families, including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him the divorce and his daughter Sue Ann. Nathaniel includes his family. Louis also has another half-sister, Alexandra Tynge, from her father's previous relationship with Anne Tyne, a fellow architect. Louis's passion was his art.
