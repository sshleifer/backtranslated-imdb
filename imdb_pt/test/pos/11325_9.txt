This lasted several years, despite the late hour. <br /> <br /> Like many police dramas of the '80s, it seemed cold. Both physically and figuratively. This is not a bad thing. And the (obviously) low budget actually worked in your favor. Courageous during a time when the slick was in. Allan Royal's engaging segments as the journalist gave him a slight edge. <br /> <br /> The only actors I remember were Scott Nylands (Earthquake) and Tony Rosato (SCTV). The cast of ill-known was a good thing because one could see the group as a whole and not as a group of people supporting a 'star'. And yes, this is a young Clark Johnson (Homicide) at a recurring moment. <br /> <br /> I hope a DVD release is in the future. Does anybody want to get into this?
