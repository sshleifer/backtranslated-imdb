I'm a film director's nightmare ... especially the mega buck, multiplex variety. Although I am not an art student, I still have a high threshold for suspension of disbelief and for the vision of the filmmaker if I can find it. That's why a gem like 'You Are Alone' is such a stimulating find. Intimacy and rhythm attracted me and they never let me go. Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage give subtly thoughtful performances and director Gorman Bechard shows a clever hand at presenting what is an understandably disturbing day in the lives of two people who are terribly disadvantaged. <br /> <br /> Spoiler below <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD version and shared it with several people. Reactions were varied, out of disbelief at Daphne's ability to complete the task for which Buddy paid her for the inability to watch the entire film because it was too real and emotionally devastating. As a compulsively skeptical spectator I have to be grabbed by the collars and pulled for the ride or sneaking around and seduced by the filmmaker. This film took the road later for me and in the end I was so involved that I felt the horror and pain of Daphne in her role in Buddy's death. My reaction to this movie reminded me of watching 'The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and His Lover' by Peter Greenaway many, many years ago. In the end, I was fascinated, repelled and totally unable to take my eyes off that movie either. I've watched this movie several times and really appreciate the eyes and ears that the director has shown. I am familiar with other works he has done, including some daring films, 'Galactic Gigolo' and 'Attack of the Killer Bimbos' and a mix of 'The Kiss' that I recently learned that was killed in the cradle by the producer and producer. really does not represent the vision of the directors. Too bad, because I loved the two previous films and even found 'The Kiss' interesting, but I wanted 'The Kiss' to be available in a clip from the director with all the original vision and music intact. I look forward to the future work by this interesting director and the leaders Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage.
