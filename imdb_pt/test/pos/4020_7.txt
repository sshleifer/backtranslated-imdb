Hey, everything you jive, you foxes, you mean guys. Beware because Slaughter is back in town! If you're looking for a bad-ass, funky movie to watch some night, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to relax and unwind after his adventures in Mexico. But if you're a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan,' you're bound to seek revenge. Because I do not know. Was 'Hoffo' the first your brother or what? Anyone. The movie begins with the old "murder of an airplane" routine. We all know that this is the most effective way to get a guy on a crowded picnic. Needless to say, Slaughter survives the ordeal, but Cmndt. Eric Lassard, sorry George Gaynes, I'm not so lucky. SMACK !! Also Slaughters' best friend, Pratt, is dead. This is the beginning of a great adventure, filled with the most modern and fun music James Brown himself has to offer. That's right 'The Godfather of Soul' has put its trademark on this bad boy. In addition to Jim Brown in the main part, this film is filled with some of the biggest names that the blaxploitation scene has to offer. What about Scatman Crothers, Dick Anthony Williams, Gloria Hendry and Brock Peters? Elsewhere, we see none other than Judith M. Brown and, last but definitely less, the fantastic Don Stroud as the evil caper.
