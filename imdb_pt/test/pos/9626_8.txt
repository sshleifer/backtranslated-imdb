I've seen Five Fingers on Drive-In in ... what, 1973, 74? It was the first Kung-Fu movie I've ever seen and I was very entertained. I recently bought on DVD and watched again. I was very entertained the second time as well. I believe this is probably what most Kung-Fu movies are modeled after. Rival schools, different styles, revenge, "white hat" good guys and "black" bandits. They even played the (VERY bad) Japanese styles of Karate and Judo. I remember having fun with the dubbing dialogue, along the lines of "Hey You! You're a really bad guy!" and "They should not run away with this! I'll take a chance on this bad crowd!" This time it was not so disturbing, I guess I'm used to it. If you have even the slightest appreciation of this genre, this is one you should see.
