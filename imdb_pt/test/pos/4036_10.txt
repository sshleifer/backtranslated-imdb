I thought the story fit very well. I really liked this movie. If you're going to a Bridget Fonda movie, you may just rot. I thought bothering movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently, someone does not think so. I really liked the movie. I'm even thinking about buying. I want it to be my first DVD for my bedroom. That's how I like it. I'd rather not start an online discussion with someone I do not know and who will be about a movie. If anyone could kindly portray what they said about the plot, I would be more than happy to portray my insult. However, if they feel that I am not worthy of a recantation, I might just feel that they are not worthy of one either. But I can not control their actions, I can only encourage them in the right direction. Hey, they do not have to do a recantation, but I'd appreciate it a lot.
