I could not help but savor the whole premise of CAT IN THE BRAIN because it explicitly explains that a director is going crazy seeing people murdered from previous films he did. Even mundane activities such as cooking a meal in the microwave or using a water tap yield a horrible butch of a movie in the past. The director Fulci interpreting himself, is directing GHOSTS OF SODOM (?) And can not deprive his mental well-being of constant murder. He seeks the help of a psychiatrist who instead uses Fulci's work as a method to execute a series of innocent people, hypnotizing the director into thinking that perhaps he is responsible. <br /> <br /> This is obviously a mocking movie with amusement. In the image of Fulci, while exploring the themes of how such a profession, which produces so much death and destruction, rarely indomitable, could shape and shape a legacy. The film presents a compelling story about uninterrupted graphic violence, with every possible means to kill a woman expressed in terrible details. This has a shower murder that Hitchcock could never drive, or probably want. The savagery of the film complements the mental state of the Fulci of Fulci (... I know) during the execution time. Reality and cinematic fiction have merged and Fulci can not escape. The ending (... explaining the old cliché: "It's just a movie") could not work better than here. Fulci's boat says Perversão (... great touch) and he flies off ... I can only wish this to be his final movie, because this is a perfect ending, if there ever was one. David L Thompson is the crazed psychiatrist who plans to kill his adulterous wife. Jeoffrey Kennedy is a cop. Fulci fears that a family has been murdered by the devil. <br /> <br /> The ultra-violence in the film features many unique ways of getting out of control, such as the door of a chest, a scythe. , a chain saw and a hatchet. The most brutal violence derives from the chainsaw's unpleasant activity when a corpse is cut into pieces (like the work of a gardener on a log fits beautifully into a nightmare hallucination sequence) .. the most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a little boy gets beheaded! The opening scene with the puppet cat plucking, feasting on Fulci's brain, is a howler monkey. The scenes that are attached inside the film, featuring a horrified look from Fulci, are obvious, but I could not help but appreciate it anyway.
