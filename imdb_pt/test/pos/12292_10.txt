I watched Pola X because Scott Walker composed the movie soundtrack and I really admire his music. Frankly, I expected a rather pretentious and possibly incoherent French film. I was wrong. The view of the movie quickly got my attention to the maximum - starting with the opening sequence, which shows black and white images of military planes launching tomb bombs at the sound of the song and the beautiful voice of Scott Walker. The film explores Pierre's crisis of identity (Guillaume Depardieu - a brilliant choice for the role) and its consequent (self) destruction. Is the story divided into two parts? the first one portrays the carefree life of Pierre in a beautiful house in the interior of France and the second follows his personal disintegration after he leaves everything and moves to Paris to live in misery with his supposed half-sister. Do both parts contain some incredibly impressive photography? the first very colorful and brilliant, the second totally bleak and almost apocalyptic - adding to a true aesthetic feast. Pola X is a fascinating and unique cinematic experience.
