I had the pleasure of watching this brilliant movie at a premiere in Sydney. Although it was a pleasure to see you. Pleasure is not the emotion left to you as the credits roll. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a film that addresses not just a stigma felt by young individuals, but all of them. Boss of that is insulation. It is not only to put the final galvanizing scene of the films on a pedestal above the others, but it is important to see it as the culmination. And from that, it's important to realize what that means to you, the viewer, and the people directly affected by it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is not a delicate image, but the way in which Mr. Thalluri deals with it is subject with a deep dignity and there is no barred approach acts as credit for his message. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that movies like 2:37 should be escalated by favorable votes. Rather, it should be recommended for those seeking a purpose in their vision. <br /> <br /> A brilliantly crafted portrait of lost innocence. And a master stroke for a talent not yet explored. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed.
