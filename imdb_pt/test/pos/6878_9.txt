"House Calls" is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as "how they used to do them". He starred Walter Matthau (in one of his best roles) as a recently widowed doctor who goes out on the dating scene again and hits paydirt as he seems to have a different woman every night. He then meets the patient at the Glenda Jackson hospital and soon develops a relationship with her. But it is one that will be severely tested as she informs he is a woman of a man and expects him to be a man of a woman. <br /> <br /> This is a sweet, very funny movie, also starring Art Carney as the administrator of the senile hospital and Richard Benjamin as a friend and medical colleague of Matthau. It's a must see for any Matthau fan or any fan of light comedy. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
