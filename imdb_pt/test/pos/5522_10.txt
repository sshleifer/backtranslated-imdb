Abe Zwick perfected the unique, beautifully. He has never made another film, but he has created a brilliant portrait of homosexual self-hatred in this film that is both caustic and affective. He commands the screen, presenting the wreckage of a man breaking under the pressure of an increasingly meaningless life. <br /> <br /> Paul (Zwick) is an elderly queen who somehow convinced Stanley (Wayne Crawford), a dull-eyed idiot with no sense of the future, to follow his star. He is a little thief who is boiling with hatred and intensified recently. He was forced to leave the city and move to a suburb in Miami. Like a disguise, he dresses up like an old, blue, dry sock with as much sexual torment as the Lady of the Church. He tells Stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his "Aunt Martha". Paul himself has no friends, spends much time alone at home and needs to deal with Stanley's dissolute lifestyle. It would be enough to make any man cross the line of homicidal transgender mania. <br /> <br /> Once again, Zwick portrays Paul as a tragic figure who has completely lost any understanding of how to relate to other people. However, there is a certain poetry in his anguish, which burns slowly throughout the film. He is tragic but also elegant. This is ultimately a very sad movie. Surely there are many hilarious moments, but there is a current of hopelessness and despair, that humor is bittersweet. This movie is worth watching the performance of Abe Zwick. He could have really built his career on Martha. She is quite a gas once you know her. Just make sure to cut your hair and stop your horsing around. She really hates it!
