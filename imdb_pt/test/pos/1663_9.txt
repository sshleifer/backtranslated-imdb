Is it a mystery to me why I did not get this 50's master movie? turned brooding noir so far, but I'm happy to report that it did not disappoint. I have not seen any American films of Jules Dassin for several years, but based on that I'll probably come back and re-watch "Brute Force" and "Night and the City" soon. Jean Servais, a name unfamiliar to me, but a face quite familiar in his worldly weariness and coldness, recently completed a long stay in prison and how is the way in those films (hey, there would not be a different story) is not coping well with normal life. An opportunity presents itself: an easy stealing of million dollar jewelry that can be done at night without fear of discovery by some men. The stretched footage of the robbery, half an hour of total silence, is what people remember most about the film, of course, and in fact it is quite remarkable; but I liked the incomplete location of the final shooting, since the assault was bitter thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves; the excellent portraits of Paris in black and white; and Servais' channeling of both Eddie Constantine and Humphrey Bogart in their spare but brutal performance. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a little too sentimental in the end, but this is one of those classics that really lives up to its reputation is pure entertainment, even if what it has to say about the human condition is not exactly deep or thought-provoking; George Auric's modernist, romantic and jazzy scores are another highlight.
