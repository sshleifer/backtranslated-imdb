This movie was awesome! It seemed high budget but felt sincere and original as an Indie. The most incredible part of this film were the amazing performances of David Beazely, Mark Hildreth and Paul Anthony, who play the leading role. He carried this film with ease, humor and charisma balanced with a huge depth. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was really beautiful, though some of the subjects were pretty ugly. It was not very realistic in that way, but it did not have to be a big point. It was great to see Alan Cumming in that too. The script was well adjusted and propelled very well with some of the best performances I have seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Go see that.
