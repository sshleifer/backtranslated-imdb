This movie is a love story set in the scene of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD as fast as possible and watch it several times. The story ends as it began I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also a phenomenal actor. Some stories have happy endings. Beyond the angle of the love story, I thought of how a beautiful, serene and peaceful island was affected by the war and this made me realize the true devastation that war can have in its people ... the government makes the decision while the people suffers. His father was a very polite man and wanted more for his daughter while she had regular dreams. I loved the scene where she complains about not receiving a dowry and also loved the scene where they both lived the earthquake. They were survivors.
