I really like the show !! As part of Greek life, I can say that some things are exaggerated, but overall it's still very funny. <br /> <br /> Rusty is a main character, her roommate is HILARIOUS and the whole cast is fun in her own right. I like it to focus on individual situations as well as interpersonal relationships with organizations. <br /> <br /> This program covers everything, and they do it without curse or anything else that bad (how else could it be in ABC Family?). My favorites are Cappie (of course), Rusty's roommate and pretty much all Kappa Tau. This show is a great launch pad for them and I'm excited to see what doors this opens. <br /> <br /> Renew this program next summer, ABC Family. Like I said, love, love, love !!
