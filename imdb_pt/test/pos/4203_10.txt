As a fan of old warner brothers gangster movies I had to check this out, it's the second best movie in the classic adventure DVD set that also had one of my favorite movies, Antarctic Scott in it. This was done in 1939 a good year for many warner brothers films, he has a great cast: John Garfield, Claude Rains, Ann Sheridan and the dead children, who would later be known as the Bowery boys in monogrammed pictures. Well, a boxer (Garfield) is framed for a murder he did not commit and is running away and being chased by a tough New York detective (Claude Rains), he ends up at a fruit picking place run by a pretty woman (Gloria Dickson) and the stunned children (Huntz Hall, Leo Gorcey, Benard Punsley, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Dell Gabreil), he later returns to boxing but tries to keep a low profile.this was directed by famous director Busby Berkley, who directed timeless classics such as 42nd street, 1933 goldiggers, and 35, parade cars and many others. I'd like to give a shout out to the platinum DVD / video to put a bunch of good reasonably priced DVDs as adventurous classics (see my Scott of the Antarctic). review) I give they made me a criminal 10 out of 10, great movie. I have to point out that I have only seen two John Garfield films, this one and body and soul. I thought he was a very good actor.
