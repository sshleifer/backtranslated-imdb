I watched this on KQED, with Frank Baxter commenting, if I remember correctly. I've never seen it since, but I'd like to find out where it's available. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how good something can be, but being in black and white, and having zero special effects. In fact, amazing how much better something like that is!
