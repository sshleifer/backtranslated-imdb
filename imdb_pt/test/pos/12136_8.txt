Very good 1970s movie about Mafia operations in New Jersey. When a "dissident" gangster does not play by the rules of the neighborhood, sooner or later, it's time for elimination. <br /> <br /> Joe Pesci was true to his character - gentle and funny. It only gets better with age. His current face and fame should not have been used on the DVD cover to sell this "B" movie since he was only the third star. <br /> <br /> Dating back to 1970, printed in large lapel shirts and lower quality background music is a distraction. Good to see the big cars of the 70's. <br /> <br /> However, the performance is good. <br /> <br /> The nudity on the part of Anne Johns was not necessary to make this mafia story work. And it does not appear in the database as if everyone was acting again in any movie other than this one. What a pity; she did a good job! <br /> <br /> Moral of the story: do not let your "Don" upset you. <br /> <br /> If you are wanting to see something different when you wake up in the middle of the night, then check out this DVD. It was part of a three-movie DVD in a $ 5.88 special at the local discount store. <br /> <br />
