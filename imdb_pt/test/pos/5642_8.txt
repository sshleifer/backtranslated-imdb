Fires in the Plain directed by Kon Ichikawa and written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada is a WWII movie that finally does not show allies fighting against the Axis powers but the Japanese fighting and fighting for their lives in the Philippines. The name of the main characters is Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi, and he is a soldier who leaves his regiment for being sick. All he has is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes. So he is trying to get to the hospital to get a doctor and a cure for his illness. But since the hospital pulled him away and was destroyed, he begins a long walk. Throughout the movie, Tamura remains a bit cowardly, but very civilized, as the other soldiers become more animal-like using their basic instincts to survive. Tamura still remains human and would not degrade. One scene that influenced me a lot to think positively and differently about this war movie is when Tamura arrives in a completely deserted Phillipino village. There he fights with a dog and finds a bunch of Japanese soldiers' corpses stacked in front of a church. This makes Tamura think and even more frightened than it already is. This shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine, but a servant of higher beings and humans, the most important. After he walks away from the corpses, two Filipinos (a couple or a brother and a sister: very close relationship) return to the village to pick up the salt stock back. The main character of the film wants to be friendly at first, although he has walked up to them with his gun, but shoots the woman when she starts screaming. Her brother / boyfriend / husband flees in fear and, after a moment, Tamura follows him and shoots violently at the fleeing Filipino. He did not hit him. After Tamura takes the sack of salt, something very precious, he throws his gun into a river. This gesture is very important to understand the profile of Tamura and the war of Kon Ichikawa / Shohei Ooka. Comparing this movie with other World War II movies, this is not typical. Of course, all films have suffered heroes, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. He expresses all that is human: he is being manipulated, he is weak, he is afraid, he has hope. This is typical of the Japanese films of World War II and Japanese society. As World War II is not a subject discussed in Japanese society, the Japanese are likely to put the Japanese in World War II as the victim. This victimization is also very visual in this film. One example is Tamura, the other stacked bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one when Japanese soldiers try to cross a street and the Americans are already waiting for them and firing on all Japanese soldiers who have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no health care equipment or something like that. In my personal conclusion, I must say that it is worth seeing this movie to finally see a film on the other side than usual. He also has no nationalistic propaganda that could have been easily constructed. Once you have watched the movie through, you will be able to see the horrors of World War II in its full extent.
