One of the myths of the early sound era is that they could not do realities because they had trouble recording sound on the spot. In fact, it was the financial constraints of depression that temporarily killed the gender, at least in the "A" budget range. However, in the period between 1929 and 1931, before the onset of the economic crisis, the Western "A" flourished, notable examples including The Virginian, Billy the Kid and Cimarron. The Big Trail was maybe the biggest of them all ?? a gigantic pioneer western filmed in an initial widescreen process appropriately titled grandeur. Thanks to a recent DVD release, we can now see the widescreen version next to the full screen that was filmed simultaneously. <br /> <br /> The director was Raoul Walsh, a man for whom the spirit of adventure was in vast external sights, and thus in many ways a perfect choice. He makes great use of the broader picture to show the western landscape in its most breathtaking. Very typical of Walsh are several shots towards the beginning, like the one in which a woman cuts firewood. Most of the screen is well filled with wagons and other messes, but in a corner we see the desert extending invitingly. As the carriage approaches, the open plain is gradually revealed to us, with the wagons moving away like stage curtains. These photos are not as effective in the full-screen version, but on the wider screen Walsh's expression in the open air has never been better. <br /> <br /> But there's a down side to that. When it comes to dialogue scenes, Walsh's tendency is to put the actors in the middle of the scene, as if they were in an imaginary full-screen box. Does the extra width become just that? extra. It may seem logical at first, because it means that in terms of height, we see both the actors and a full-screen image. However, does it make the players look small and insignificant within the frame, while the whole background business dominates the scene? and there are many bottom deals on the Big Trail. When the widescreen formats resurfaced in the 1950s, many directors made the same mistake, before realizing that in the talkie scenes it is best to frame the actors across the chest, losing some of their height, but allowing them to fill the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because The Big Trail is a particularly well balanced and finely scripted effort. The subplots of romance and revenge are simple, but well defined, and do not threaten to unbalance one another or the history of the pioneers. It could have been a great intimate epic, but it loses dramatic weight because every time the characters start talking to each other, we become distracted by herds of cattle, wagons adrift or whatever is filling every inch of the picture. Still, Walsh's sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display, and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable. There are also some good comedy touches, largely courtesy of the "Swedish comic" El Brendel. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is also notable for being John Wayne's first lead role. While Wayne is another victim of the distant setting in dialogue scenes, at least we see his strong physical presence and we hear his warm, but assertive vocal delivery. It reveals your lack of experience, but the potential is clearly there. Unfortunately, this potential was not widely perceived at the time and he spent the rest of the decade playing it in B photos before finally reaching stardom. Also featured in this photo is Wayne's friend (and later the prolific character actor) Ward Bond. He is not credited, but you can identify him in several scenes, most prominently around the 80-minute mark where he is to the left of Tyrone Power. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is a glorious epic that succeeds in defeating itself as a drama. And it was this stupendous scale that would put the Western (and widescreen) in bed for some time. And although the 1940s and 1950s are now considered to be the golden era of the West, it was then an altered genre, with stories of individual adventure and heroism in an established West ?? not better or worse, but in a different way. The initial period of the talkie was the end of an era when Westerns could be truly gigantic.
