It may not be 10 out of 10, but for me the jokes did not fail. I've seen this many times when I was younger and again on DVD, I believe, and I laughed every time. The humor is simple and fun, this movie was just one of the many little movies that Disney was releasing at the time. I found the parts where people outside the invisible loop saw invisible people. These expressions were invaluable. Great movie, if the opportunity to see it arise I recommend seeing it by a good laugh. My favorite character in the entire Dexter series would definitely have to be Dean Higgins, I love his voice and I hear him get upset, especially seeing that his expression at the end was just pure hysterical to me.
