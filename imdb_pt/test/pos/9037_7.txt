Take a look at these faces next to the prison entrance. They are not the faces of Hollywood extras. Someone in production was very clever to film in Oxford, Mississippi because you can not get that kind of authenticity from a backlot studio. Climb the narrow, dusty roads, the frozen land below, and the skeletal trees barely hanging. No wonder these faces look hard and relentless; they are just reflecting the soil from where they sprout. Old Lucas (Hernandez) is more afraid of his life, but then he springs from the same hard land. <br /> <br /> The film works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentimenta and still has some suspense. Old Lucas is not very nice. He is a victim and we sympathize, but he is also arrogant and hostile. Wisely, the script refuses to sweeten it. In this way, we are forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice, even the least sympathetic. The script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism as it tends to become boring and less effective. Instead, we are shown how prejudice can easily condemn an ​​innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death. So it is through our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed, a much more effective way. It also makes sheriff's and lawyer's actions more understandable since they are part of the Jim Crow system. <br /> <br /> Notice how the film does not attack segregation. It is doubtful that old Lucas wanted to mingle with whites anyway and there is no hint that even attorney Stevens (Brian) wants to cross the line of color except to see justice done. No, the possibility of reconciliation is in the future as symbolized by the boy (Jarman) whose head is not yet full of "notions". He is not exactly Luke's friend, but he glimpsed the common humanity of being helped after falling into the frozen creek. The last line of dialogue also shows that he is on the side of his uncle, the lawyer, instead of his more reserved parents (the dinner table scene is important and easily overlooked). The lawyer may not attend a future civil rights march, but the boy can. This is the hopeful side of the movie. There have been a lot of racially-themed films during this brief three-year period, 1949-51, (The Well, No Way Out, The House of the Brave, Lost Borders). Even famous MGM featured came into the mix with this little gem. Unfortunately, McCarthy's purges in Hollywood have put an end to "troublesome" films that may not serve the end of the Cold War. Even so, it pays to compare each of them, not only because they are good movies, but because even with the passage of 60 years and Jim Crow, they are still relevant.
