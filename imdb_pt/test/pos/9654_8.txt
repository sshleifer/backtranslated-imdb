Philippe Garrel makes us breathe the forgotten atmosphere of the Nouvelle Vague, almost lost in the vestiges of its former splendor, but ready to reemerge from its ashes, if remembered from the past. Those who are somewhat familiar with the affairs of the director, on the other hand, may know very well how he is obsessed by a lingering sense of loss regarding the inconstancy of reality. "Les amants réguliers", therefore, shows us the parallel stories of an "amour fou" and an attempted revolution that was ruined under the guidance of young French students. <br /> <br /> The first part of the story is about the dramatic events of May 1968 in France evoked in a series of sequences of amazing plans, a kind of cinema style verité, that put the student insurrection into anything, less in an enviable light against a dark backdrop. There is much that can be said about the peculiarities of black-and-white photography used to describe the battle between students and police, where the high contrasts confer an unreal atmosphere to the sequences and the darkness closes on the bodies excited about them. in the mystery. The images, completely devoid of words, show the real consistency of the myth, made of gross violence, increasingly emphasized by the exasperated reality of the shooting in the movies. The individual does not tell anything here: he tends to disappear in the mass. What really matters in these fight scenes is the meaning of mass suggestion, the blind fury of juvenile assault, sinister compliments of the power of the mob, even though they are designed as separate entities, separated from any kind of emotion, with the cold and distant gaze of an entomologist who wants to catalog his collection of insects. <br /> <br /> The second part of the story is described in a more quiet and intimate way. The distressing portrayal of an egocentric generation in search of their lost time stands out on the horizon, utterly disillusioned with the individual values ​​of men, inclined to spin in its own axis amidst the smoke of opium and to make a funeral oration in the praise of its recent defeat. "Les amants réguliers" seems to evoke from time to time the shadow of the great Robert Bresson, revised and corrected by the particular sensitivity of Garrel, without departing from the main argument, trying to expand perspectives on the subject of disillusionment human beings who, though painful, can lead us to the truth. In my opinion, trying to penetrate deeply into the substratum of history, if a man lets himself be carried and plays by ear, he will probably discover that he can reveal the dark side of himself with terrible and irretrievable consequences.
