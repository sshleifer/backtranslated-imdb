Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye is a great family movie. Salman Khan is looking beautiful and great than ever! There's even a scene where he takes off his shirt! What a surprise!!! Rani Mukherjee is great too. Pooja Batra had few lines to say, but I'm glad she was recognized for her role because she definitely has potential. <br /> <br /> It's about Prem (Salman Khan) and he's a wedding singer. He is about to marry Nisha (Raveena Tandon), but gets up. Prem goes to Nisha's house and asks why he was abandoned and it is because his brother is ill and she needs to marry an NRI, Rahul (Inder Kumar), to get the money to get him treated. Prem goes forward and comes Priya (Rani Mukherjee). Prem falls in love with Priya, but it's a shame she's about to marry an NRI! Who could this NRI be?! Priya falls in love with Prem while Rahul is there with her. Prem makes an insulting comment to Priya one day and she leaves and goes to Agra for the wedding with Rahul. Will Prem stop it? See the KPNHJ to find out! <br /> <br /> The movie was very funny! The songs were great, especially the song "O Priya O Priya" Is it a shame that the movie failed in India and I do not know why?! Every movie in India is going on the flop now !! This movie deserved to be a success. The only problem I encountered with the movie is that they had an obsession with NRI! They think all NRIs are rich! The movie deserves a 9/10!
