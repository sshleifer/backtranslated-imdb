Created by Dennis Spooner, 'Department S' was a suspense show about an unfolding Interpol, based in Geneva, created to solve bewildering mysteries that the police could not handle. If a plane landed at Heathrow with no one on board, if a man was found wandering London in a spacesuit, if the passenger of a Rolls Royce suddenly turned into a skeleton, if a train parked at a subway station with the dead passengers, you called the "Department S" to sort things out. <br /> <br /> Peter Wyngarde played "Jason King," an extravagantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped solve many of the bizarre cases. King caught the fancy of the audience and was later awarded a spin-off show. He was ably assisted by the American 'Stuart Sullivan' (Joel Fabiani) and the delightful 'Annabelle Hurst' (Rosemary Nicols). Exceptionally for a 1960s show, the department was led by a black man - 'Sir Curtis Seretse' (Dennis Alaba Peters). If the show looked and looked a lot like 'The Avengers', it was not surprising. Shared many of the same writers and directors! The colorful titles were designed by Chambers & Partners, and are worth tune to by themselves. As was the case with so many I.T.C. series, the song was composed by Edwin Astley. Its theme for 'Department S' has to be rated as one of the best television themes of all time. <br /> <br /> Predictably, the program seems a little sexist and dated now, but do not let that dissuade you. to tune. Imagine a hybrid of 'Jonathan Creek' and the 'Austin Powers' movies and you have 'Department S'! <br /> <br /> Trivia Note: The episode 'A Little War of Nerves' features a young Sir Anthony Hopkins in an important role!
