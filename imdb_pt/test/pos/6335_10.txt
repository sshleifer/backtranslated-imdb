The scary demons "The Gentlemen" capture the voice of the population of Sunnydale, to steal human hearts without shouting. Giles thinks that according to a legend, if a lady screams, the creatures will be destroyed, but Buffy and her friends, including Riley, will have to fight the monsters without words. <br /> <br /> "Silence" is certainly the best episode of Buffy's Fourth Season so far. Having lots of humor and funny situations, I really enjoyed it. Spike is hilarious, the romance between Xander and Anya is cool, but I loved the "intense" dialogue between Buffy and Riley at the end. The gothic setting of the final battle against "The Gentlemen" recalls the mood of "Dark City". My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Silence" ("Silence")
