Disturbing series about life in Oz - an experimental prison where they try to rehabilitate prisoners. There's gay sex, rape, torture, mutilation, murder, humiliation, tons of male nudity ... all in your face and with full force. <br /> <br /> It is also easily one of the best written dramas ever written. on TV and almost all the actors are great. Since this was by cable, there were no restrictions on what they could say or show. There are many racist comments flying here, but it is for all races. In fact, the white characters go very badly (especially the Aryan ones) and the black characters do better (the peace loving Muslims). Hispanics do not play a strong role and there are no Asian prisoners. All the prisoners seem to be back and willing to kill anyone at a time, but you still feel sympathetic with some of them. Even prison guards, counselors and doctors have serious problems. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this value, BUT rent it - do not buy it. I have the whole collection and, to be perfectly honest, I do not think I ever want to see her again. It's an incredible TV, but so somber and depressing. I think I have to sell everything online. <br /> <br /> I give 10.
