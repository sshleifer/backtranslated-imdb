This is the film really is one of my all time favorites. I'm not a fan of Renny Harlin because most of his films suck, but the TLKG hits his mark again and again. TLKG is about a woman named Samantha Cain (Davis), who suffers from amnesia. she is married to a child and when she asks "I am a damn member of the PTA". and then her world collapses when the pieces fit her previous identity. Samuel Jackson plays a police officer who performs PI shows, he is dragged by her to solve his identity and get paid some money for his work. Along the way, we find that Samantha is actually Charlie Baltimore, a secret spy who was left to die years earlier. the plot is great, making this story look real and Jackson does a great job as a second violin for Davis (who always does a great acting job). The explosions are endless, the action is interwoven with memorable scene after memorable scene. very impressive visually, although the kid got on my nerves at the end (watch out for the cars!) I'm tired of little kids spoiling a movie to be saved, but still, this movie is worth it when the kid adds to the movie. once again, this movie is really good, I never understood why it did not win at the box office anymore, but if it was a man starring the movie, I'm sure it would have raised one hundred million. What's good is that over the years, more people are discovering this movie and giving it good marks, as the average of this movie on this site has increased over the years. I hope this goes further, as this is a great action movie. and I love action movies
