The problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch. People have been looking for a B-Grade horror film, or a movie "So Bad It's Good." Jack Frost 2 is neither of these. <br /> <br /> It's simply a very good and well hidden movie in a very bad movie. To visualize it as something other than a crazy comedy (easily more fun than all three "meritorious Scary Movies combined") is to misinterpret the movie at a basic level. It would be like watching Shawshank Redemption and then complaining that there were no blasts. <br /> <br /> The premise is simple; the characters in the first film, haunted by memories of Jack Frost, take vacations on a tropical island. A new and improved Jack comes after them, now with essentially the powers of Spiderman's Homem-Hidro; essentially, it can change from water to snow easily and quickly, divide, multiply and, worst of all, be able to immunize its only previous weakness ... Anti-freezing. <br /> <br /> Sad about this movie is that brain-dead fans of the first Jack Frost (a film simply HORRIBLE) can not appreciate the change of tone to the sequel. Just as Alien was a horror movie and Aliens had everything to do with action, Jack Frost was a fragile attempt at terror decoy and Jack Frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the horror genre. <br /> <br /> Most of the entertainment comes from the live action actors, who serve admirably. Particularly amusing among them are Ray Tooney (playing a caricature of a retired British Colonel from the early 1900s), Christopher Allport (offering an insane and hilarious version in his first film wood performance) and David Allen Brooks (once serious role in new ways, totally bizarre heights). <br /> <br /> The lack of "memorable quotes" disturbs me. As a horror movie, Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman, rates a zero. But you have to understand, IT'S NOT A MOVIE OF TERROR.
