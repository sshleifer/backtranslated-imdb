When the new Outer Limits began, the episodes were quite upbeat and challenging. As the series began to slow down, most episodes became simply ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the best and the worst of the series. <br /> <br /> Since the Outer Limits always preach a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the funniest for the flops. <br /> <br /> 1. Afterlife: As an institution, the US military-industrial complex is both bad and paranoid, not to mention simple stupidity. However, individuals with great integrity serve our country and they will obey your conscience, even at a frightening cost! In the end, the aliens do not have to say a word. Those without conscience are fools who must be kept in utter contempt! <br /> <br /> A truly subversive episode! One that should be shown in prime time television for everyone to see! This may be a revelation to some, but people without conscience should not be able to serve in our military! Even the ends do not justify the means! <br /> <br /> 2. Theory of Relativity: A good person can be forced to make a split-second decision between good and evil in order to save the lives of intelligent, defenseless beings at great cost to themselves same. What makes that decision even more difficult is the radical choice: to be isolated from strangers, exotic aliens with whom you can not communicate except through gestures or together with a group of people that you think will keep you safe from unknown dangers, even though they are ruthless and devoid of compassion! <br /> <br /> This episode is brilliant! What feeds this depravity is good old greed. This episode is one of the most blatant accusations of capitalism, transnational corporations and rape in the environment, which I have seen in my life! Unlike real life, justice here is served - and quickly! <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable lines is when the ruthless corporate thug said something about the effect, "We did the same thing in the Amazon Forest War." Alluding to the murder of Amazonian Indians who were trying to protect their tropical forests from being mined, as justification for killing again literally in the name of "survival of the fittest." Something that Darwin never wanted to be taken literally! <br /> <br /> 3. Alien Shop: Tremendous power can be used for good, even an exotic alien. This power can be used to heal rather than destroy. Mere mortals can learn from their mistakes! Even a criminal can see the light if he has enough opportunities to do so. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it takes a strong remedy, but we can all wake up and change our self-destructive ways! <br /> <br /> 4. The Grell: An alien can be a Christ-like figure! In the distant future, slavery can be justified, again, in the name of convenience! Basically good people can be corrupted. Sometimes a person needs to feel great shame to see the evil he is committing. Children are closer to the truth than adults. Those with political power have a tremendous responsibility! Another work of genius! As a species, "do humans learn from history?" Flop Number 1: Quality of Mercy: Loose Lips, Sinks Ships! While in the war kindly keep your mouth shut about important military plans. Heck, do I really need to watch a one-hour soap opera to figure this out? !! I wonder, the creators of The Outer Limits ran out of ideas, or did the corporate pull the plug? Dark and ugly, without purpose, but despair! <br /> <br /> Flop Number 2: Beyond the Veil: So bad that there is no morals, but rather: When stuck in a psychiatric hospital, use some good sense, please! This episode is so bad that it repels. What an X file steals! Do not waste your time with this! You'll thank me later! <br /> <br /> It is a sad comment that The Outer Limits fell on the tubes until the end of their run. Subversive episodes, like the first four, could not last forever! It was a miracle that they were made! I hope someday other brave souls will follow the subversive tradition of outer limits into a new territory! <br /> <br /> If you are such a daring person, a good place to start is with a single book: "Anatomy of the Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction," edited by Neil Barron! As far as I'm concerned, the most comprehensive book ever written on the subject.
