Of course I'm a bit prejudiced, but at the time it was the most accurate picture of the Marines that have ever been shown on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I was at Camp Pendleton in infantry training when Webb reduced his crew to filming some outdoor scenes and our company was invited to attend. It took about two or three days, as best I can remember. <br /> <br /> Webb and Don Dubbins were serious and efficient. <br /> <br /> During the filming of our short scene - which seemed to take forever for an 18 year old - Webb was very conscious of making things (marine things) right and he did a good job with one exception - that scene in which a conscript wore dark glasses. Never happen for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> I have a video of the movie and I will annoy my grandchildren every time I can make them stand still for a few seconds while I show them when they were young. stallion and part of the world's largest fighting force (no boasting, just fact). <br /> <br /> What struck me was how well the real Marines played their acting roles. This was before I realized that IDPs need to have some working genes to do their job. <br /> <br /> The only movie I've seen since being equal to DI is the first half of the Full Metal Jacket and that part is superior only because of the cool language. When the DI was made, curses were not allowed on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite the lack of profanity, it is still a great movie to rent. <br /> <br /> Ooooo-rahhhhhh !!!!! <br /> <br /> Semper Fi, Do or Die
