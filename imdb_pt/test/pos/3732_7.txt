WTF !! Do any of your books / movies end in a happy ending? Notebook was good ... but enough for depressive endings. I was told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable ... but sometimes it's good to see people who have sacrificed their entire lives to reach a mediocre unhappy period in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and to be able to live it for the rest of their days. . Do not we know what really happens in real life? Can not we - for a moment (an hour and a half) live indirectly through a movie that ends on a happy note - that gives us hope for our own future? <br /> <br /> Yes - wah. I know. But, really, I think we need to get the movies that end like this with a warning. "Beware: there is no happy ending."
