The bunch of big box office stars is phenomenal in this movie !! William Baldwin, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts !! This movie was made in one of my favorite years too, 1990 !! I am a Chicagoan, and the scenery in Chicago was very identifiable and artistically accelerated too !! I liked this movie, and the excitement that motivated the climax in this photo was a powerful element to the plot which was absolutely sensational !! "Flatliners" centers around a group of disgruntled pre-medical students who want to be plans as a way to get some kind of social claim! When life does not make sense, it seems very illogical to be curious about apocalyptic nightmares! At the same time, once your disconnected curiosity has gotten the best of them, there's no turning back! The king of the hill, (so to speak) is the one who vehemently shouts: I will make TWO MINUTES !! Who else is going to do this !! ANYONE WANTS TO TRY TWO AND HALF !! In the last analysis, all these newly arrived and very undesirable recriminations now have an extremely ubiquitous disposition in the lives of these re-beats !! The consummation of their justified or unjustified pathos required a full 360-degree perspective on the issues they were dying about! Whatever the purpose that all this shocking reckless and academic serves is definitely an original approach to assert your personality! I liked this movie, 1990 was a good year for me too, things seemed to fit that year !! When I saw this movie one night in November of the year 1990, I was very happy to have it done !!
