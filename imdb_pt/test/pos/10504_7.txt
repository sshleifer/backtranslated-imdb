<----- Smaller spoilers! -----> <br /> <br /> A woman becomes pregnant, but not by her husband. She develops something inside her, or at least that's what the husband thinks. They go through many difficult times while she is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Her husband contacts a UFO teacher and, with her help, tries to figure out what's wrong with her. <br /> <br /> <----- Smaller Spoilers! The story could have been a little better, or at least be less predictable, but the film is captivating and that made me and my sister go through the whole movie without any problem. The acting is very good, and the filming is much better than normal if you compare it to your normal b-alien movie. The effects are good and something is happening every second of the movie. The characters are very friendly, and besides a stupid nurse on the scene, they are all very convincing in their roles. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie, and I can recommend it if you like aliens. / Monster sequestration movies! <br /> <br /> 7/10 - The story could have been a little less predictable.
