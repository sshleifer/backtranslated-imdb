British director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America and a reputation for making popular and critically acclaimed films; but this little movie was where it started. And he certainly showed his talent, with his impressive black-and-white cinematography and chronological narrative that prefigures his later "Moment," though in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanically, the plot reminded me of House of Games, by David Mamet, but the film still feels fresh and sharp, until the final turn of the end whose flavor was expected, but whose aim is unexpectedly delicious. The acting, on the other hand, is not exactly of the same class - the film has a stylized quality and, possibly, to a greater extent than the director intended. But it's still a good debut, both claustrophobic and captivating.
