This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not the elaborate explosions and shoot-em-ups of Renny Harlin. It is the screenplay for Shane Black and his skillful delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two directors deserved a continuation. Thank God it was never done. Very dangerous to spoil the original. <br /> <br /> 'The Long Kiss' quintessential chess scene to action scene to quintessential scene and vice versa. Never a dull moment. <br /> <br /> This has to be Jackson's funniest role, and the amazing thing is that he's playing one of the most normal characters of his career. No Tarantino man, super-cool Shaft, or frontier psychotic soldier. In TLKG, Jackson is the common man with whom we identify. The poor fellow is dragged by the odyssey of this crazy woman to discover the dangerous secret of her past. <br /> <br /> Although the story claims that the character of Davis, Samantha Caine is suffering from amnesia, the writer and director treats her condition as if it were a disturbance of multiple personalities. <br /> <br /> Samantha Caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac Charly Baltimore - she is a separate and fully developed personality. The traumas suffered by Samantha in the first half hour of the film help to emerge again the submerged personality of Charly. <br /> <br /> The materials of his past life excavated by Jackson's detective, Mitch Henessey, facilitate the resurgence of Charly. Good timing, too, considering Samantha's target of herself. <br /> <br /> But Charly has to fight to remain the dominant personality. One gathers from small dialogues that the warlike personality (Charly) developed after her father died and she was recruited by the "Chapter". <br /> <br /> In the eight years Charly was buried in the psyche, Samantha's identity developed into the dominant personality. (She's even funnier than Charly.) That was probably due to being a mom, because it's the reunion with her daughter who breaks Charly's fight to suppress Samantha, leading to their apparent integration at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's impossible to choose a "best quote" from this movie: <br /> <br /> "Now you're a sniper?" <br /> <br /> "I saved your ass. It was great!" /> <br /> "Keep dying off." <br /> <br /> "I punch them in the jaw and shout 'Pop goes to the ferret.'" <br /> <br /> And a couple more than a dozen, too cheeky to quote here. <br /> <br /> Geena Davis looks great, and leaves as an action heroine without covering up the fact that she's turning forty. (Listen to Charley's story, do the math.) <br /> <br /> Fantastic soundtrack too. Santana, Muddy Waters, Elvis, LaBelle, Marvin Gaye. <br /> <br /> I give 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' a 9, just because I do not believe in a perfect 10. I see this a dozen times, and it still stays fresh. Nice twisted holiday movie to put on your shelf next to "It's A Wonderful Life".
