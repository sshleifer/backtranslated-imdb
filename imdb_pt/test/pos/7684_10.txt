When will ART overcome racism? I believe the American people have grown since this movie was made. Porgy consists of a stellar cast and music. This film is an excellent adaptation of a great opera. meaning Miss Saigon is based on Madame Butterfly, Les Miz is based on a classic book. Recently, an opera was performed here in Los Angeles, based on the movie The Fly. AN OPERA !! So be it!! <br /> <br /> Disney is hesitant to release Song of the South. The NAACP did not express any race dispute, and let's not forget Amos N Andy was a huge hit in the 50's as a TV series. Ethnicity is our heritage in the US and we must embrace all forms of ethnic artistic diversity. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, FREE 'PORGY' ON DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! j hartz
