Can not stay much longer than Flatliners. This deep dark film made my heart race all over. The lighting is dark and will leave you wanting a death-defying experience, literally. Keifer is in his best shape as he is today at 24. He is a great actor and he plays a very compelling and shocking role that you will not forget in years to come. And what can you say to the rest of the cast? An All-Star line-up, Julia is hotter than ever, Will, Oliver and Kevin light up the stage in this thriller that will keep him holding his seats. It's refreshing to see a true thriller with top-notch professional actors. You will not regret seeing this 2 hour folder. -JL
