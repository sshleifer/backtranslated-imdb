This is a real gem of a TV movie. Based on a completely false story, he follows the course of the football league club down and out through his course in the England Cup where chaos follows and players all sports styles of the seventies. The ending is unexpected, the performances are great, and Nick Hancock shows that he can do something other than sports shows. My only regret is that I did not record it.
