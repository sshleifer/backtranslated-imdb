The stranger should be able to stumble into "Class Tous Risques" just by chance; should be on any "best of film-noir" list, including that of IMDb. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is as good as before; The knowledge of his terrible and delicate family situation gives extra weight to his almost expressionless face and brief dialogues. Belmondo's restrained performance under the firm leadership of Sautet only shows what a wonderful actor he could - and should - have been. "Tous Risques" is absolutely miniscule, dry and cold, without the artistic scenery of Melville, beautiful faces and extravagant cars. It is almost film-noir to know neo-realism. The few words of Davos for his children, describing his life of secrecy from there, hold his throat until the end of the film. The closing phrase of the film - a narration of the end of Davos in no more than ten dry and somber words - leaves you with a strong punch in the stomach. <br /> <br /> A real jewel in the great crown of the French film-noir.
