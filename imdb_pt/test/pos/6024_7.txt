I own this movie and I love Canadian movies, but hiring an actress like Rose I do not understand. She's completely useless in this movie just a name that's all. The rest of the cast is good, good enough to make this little thriller work. I was surprised by the plot that is not the first time it was used. But these unknown actors did very well, even Jergen, I'm not a big fan of him, but I liked him in this film. If you have the chance to see this.
