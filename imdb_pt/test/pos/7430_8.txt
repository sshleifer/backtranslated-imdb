Errol Flynn was very present for the comedy that, unfortunately, was rarely explored. Given the right material, this movie demonstrates that he could have been happy at home in the style of Cary Grant, soft comedies. Of its various incursions into the genre, this is certainly the best. Patti Brady does a great performance on the children's part and Eleanor Parker looks simply stunning throughout the film. An added bonus is the wonderful Hattie McDaniel, which is unfortunately underused in this film - a welcome presence, though. Flynn carries his comedy duties with the same easy style he brought to his buck roles. The fact that it seems easy does not mean it is. A super small family comedy, great for the Christmas period or any other occasion when you feel excited.
