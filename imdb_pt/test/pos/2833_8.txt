... I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine years old and today I still remember every black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary those stealthy attacks through that dark passage on the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other for their captors, the last battle with the discovery of the wagon with Gatling firing, the last fight between Peck and the boss, and Happy End, which allows me to catch my breath. I have not seen it since, and I do not know if it would be a good idea to see him again today, it was such a fabulous time for the boy that I was.
