solid documentary about children who first surf and then skate in the face of the American dream. Unfortunately, some of the younger and more talented succumb to the lure of drugs, while others become slaves to the gross marketing of their failed instincts. few come out on top. but the data is released and the result is the new national pastime, skateboarding (the New York Times notes that "it was once considered a scorn for authority.") Now, however, skateboarding has its own summer camps, video games, magazines "in fact, always had these] and corporate sponsors.") mercantilism co-opts another cultural node created by children.
