Sit down and let the director Bharatbala lead us on a visual and sensual journey of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say that you really liked a movie? This movie has rhythm and keeps us moving in directions that can only exist in India. If you did not want to visit India before this movie, it will surely make you want to visit it now. This movie has girls dancing, a chase scene and the mobster involved. But there is more. Thank you, Bharatbala, for taking us in such a lively and wonderful tale. I loved the ending. We women do not want illusions in life, we want reality. P.S. I was friends with Carolyn at the Sonoma Film Festival and I met you briefly. Good luck with your distribution efforts and I'm talking about the movie like a storm.
