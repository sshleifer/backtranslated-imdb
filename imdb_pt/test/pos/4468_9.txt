As far as I know, I've seen most of Lucius Fulci's films, with the exception of a few later ones that are appearing on DVD now, and I would have to say that this was his best pre-zombie offer. In fact, he overcomes his latest films with his hands down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town in the middle of nowhere, where boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman the people of the city have always considered a witch? Is she a young woman who lives in a modern house on the outskirts of town, who used to do lots of drugs? Is he the idiot of the village, who is prematurely arrested for being in the wrong place at the wrong time? You will only know if you watch, and you should watch as this is a top-level mystery thriller, or should I say, a "giallo". I've seen this before, but it's been a long time, and after a second display, it was still as powerful as it was the first time. For those of you who only know Lucius Fulci for his zombie movies, well, open your minds to it, because it's worth seeing and while the "monsters" in it are human, they're just as nasty as anything dredged in their movies. . 9 out of 10 stars, see! Please....
