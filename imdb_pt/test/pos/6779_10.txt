The game was made in 1996, but still good today. the graphics are not so hot and the actors are not worthy of oscar, but the plot is distorted, devilish and very pleasant. The dark story is compelling from the first film and continues throughout the play. We play several people together for several reasons: 1) to use all our minds together. 2) not to be so afraid. <br /> <br /> Play this game and you will not regret it, just do not try to find an earthquake engine inside.
