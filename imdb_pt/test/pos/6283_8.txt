I was cast as the surfer guy in the beach scenes. It was almost scaled like the muscle guy, since the real muscle face was actually very late that day. Pauly had my brother and I (the skateboarder in front of the tattoo site) do some vj things between live leads from Venice since he was still doing his MTV thing. This movie is very good too. Would I have made my top 100 if I had not been in it ...?
