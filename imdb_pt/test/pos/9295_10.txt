No matter what country your In you have to buy this show, Of course it's Australian and if you've ever seen any attempt at our comedy they are very bad, but with the hunter they are not boring forty year old men making bad puns they are a team of people who talk about current affairs (pretty much in Australia) joke about our shit ads, make fun of our politicians, and so on. <br /> <br /> The guys also did a show in 2002 called Cnnnn, which was not as successful as the War that just started this year, so all they talk about is current news, which is really good , considering that no matter how boring or tragic they are, they try to illuminate things with humor.
