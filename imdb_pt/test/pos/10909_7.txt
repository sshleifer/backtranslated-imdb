I remember seeing this a long time ago, and I knew most of the concept, but no detail, so I'm glad to have seen it again, from director Frank Oz (The Muppets take Manhattan, Bowfinger). Basically, new star Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) has just won the Oscar, where he plays a gay soldier, and he does the usual "thank you", he mentions his former English teacher Howard Brackett (Golden Globe nominated) Kevin Kline), and he goes out as gay! Howard is determined to clear his name and get out of the media spotlight as a gay denier, especially since his marriage to Emily Montgomery (Oscar nominee and Golden Globe nominee Joan Cusack) is on its way. Then it comes to the wedding day, and when it comes to Howard saying yes or no, that's when he leaves, and admits to himself and everyone else that he's gay. This, of course, causes him to be dismissed as a teacher, but everyone is on graduation day, and Cameron even appears to clear things up, so everyone, especially the school principal Tom Halliwell (Elf's Bob Newhart) knows It's okay to be gay. Also starring Tom Selleck as Peter Malloy, Debbie Reynolds as Berniece Brackett, Wilford Brimley as Frank Brackett, Gregory Jbara as Walter Brackett, Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg and Jay Leno. The highlight of the film has to be when Kline can not help dancing Diana Ross's version of "I Will Survive," which must have been what convinced him of his sexuality. Kline is always good, Cusack is a surprise Oscar nominee, and all supporting cast members make their own in this very funny comedy. Very good!
