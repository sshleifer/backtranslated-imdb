I'm so happy to have recorded this movie when you came to the BBC last month! It blew my mind, so distressing and real. David Tennant is absolutely fabulous at this, even if his character is not always so easy to like or identify with. The final scene where he plays the song has just broken my heart, those eyes .... <br /> <br /> I think he made this movie between the Dr. Who series, and that makes it even more an achievement for me. I simply love Dr. Who and yet I have seen absolutely nothing of him in Mr. Tennants' portrait of this man who knows he has changed and strives to create some kind of new identity and life. <br /> <br /> Intense drama!
