With the Nazi rise to power in Eastern Europe in the late 1930s, Charles Chaplin turned his attention to create a reaction to it. The catalyst may well have been an advertisement publication referring to Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin created a parody of Hitler that is as funny as it is scary at times. The film traces Hitler's experiences in the German army from the First World War to the present day. Simultaneously, Chaplin plays a Jewish barber who dresses up as a homeless man who leaves a hospital after a long time, only to find out how different the world is under Nazi rule. <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard, wife of Chaplin in At the time, plays a young Jewish woman whose family is oppressed in a Jewish ghetto. Jack Oakie has a major supporting role, nominated for an Academy Award as a Mussolini look-alike (Benzini Napaloni), which gives Chaplin's Hitler character Adenoid Hynkel many attacks. Henry Daniell is his usual serious man as Garbitsch, Adenoid Hynkel's chief advisor. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and received Oscar nominations for his screenplay and acting. The film was also nominated for Best Picture. Chaplin made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known. He financed the entire film at his peril because of the subject, and there were no other major films made about Nazi Germany until that time. The film spent about twenty-one months in production, with Chaplin even rebuilding a set and re-filming a scene to get things right. By the time of the film's launch in October 1940, the war in Europe was underway, with Hitler conquering one country after another, so the film became much more current in its launching than when production began. <br /> <br /> There is not much plot in looking at the movie in retrospect; the film looks more like a series of sketches of comedy and / or setbacks to arrive at a purpose independent of the film itself. Several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between Hynkel and Napaloni. The scene is very funny, but it does not get anywhere in terms of the plot. Likewise, the escape of the barber and Schultz simply leads to the mistaken identity of the barber to Hynkel, in order to give Chaplin (through the barber character) an opportunity to pontificate to the public at the end of the film. On the other hand, what better way to assert the misplaced narcissism of Aryan superiority than to have a Jewish barber confused with Hynkel? <br /> <br /> Still, the film contains many comedic moments, such as rally speech, new developments in war (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the dancing globe scene, the currency in the scene of the pudding, and the whole scene between Hynkel and Napaloni (including the barber chair scene) to highly recommend the movie. Also we can not forget the risks that Chaplin had when making his first spoken film, an anti-Nazi film and financing the film. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
