This covers virtually every area of ​​the creative process and goes through the three steps in chronological order, with the main focus directly on production. There are documentaries that go into more detail and better cover the other two groups. This consists of works of art, backstage scenes, movie clips and many interviews. With a run time that comes in just over two hours, the public is entitled to a lot of information, since that's about the same size as the movie itself. It can be argued that much of the time is spent on people, with the craft and the result of their collaborative efforts coming in second place. This is well done, with tight editing. It goes into technology and reveals how certain effects have been achieved. This spends a lot of time on physical training, in preparation for the fight and such. You get good spontaneous photos of people, staff and actors. The Ultimate Matrix 10-Disc Set also features nearly three hours of music, in a simple system with individual track selection and a Play All function, with about 38 minutes of BTS material, plus the title itself, in various features. The original release, however, has several very brief extras, including clips from the making of sequences, a preview of The Animatrix and Blocking Tapes by Yuen Wo Ping (a full version of some of the biggest martial arts sequences, stunt artists and almost exact cinematography, with the same shots and angles of these bits in the finished silver screen effort). The language is quite strong, but infrequent, almost non-existent. I recommend any version of this for anyone who likes the concept, and / or wants to know about how they put the first together. 7/10
