Charles Chaplin's "Shoulder Arms", 1918, was his longest movie to date, but a little over 45 minutes long, was not a feature film. With World War I coming to an end, many popular artists of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovely Tramp went to war! The film starts with Tramp training, and the character is hilarious, even in the simplest military exercises, including marches and shootings, much to the dismay of his sergeant. The Tramp then finds himself in the trenches before a more formidable foe, though the Germans end up becoming infinitely more incompetent than himself. The noisy moment when the Tramp states that he alone captured thirteen German soldiers "surrounding them" left me in stitches. <br /> <br /> There are many other great moments in this movie. Chaplin, waking up to find his barracks sleeping underwater and not being able to find his own feet, is hilarious, as is his ingenious use of a tube from a turntable to sleep beneath the surface. <br /> <br /> However, the most memorable scenes in the film involve Chaplin undoubtedly hiding behind enemy lines disguised as a tree. The reactions of the awkward German soldiers unconsciously within a few yards of a sworn enemy as they are individually disabled one by one are very amusing, especially when a soldier handles an ax with the intention of knocking down a tree for firewood. <br /> <br /> This is a very nice film, and one of the best of Chaplin's pre-1920 efforts. Highly recommended.
