It's a shame that this movie is rated PG 13 - it's really very suitable for anyone - although the youngsters do not follow it very well. Belongs to that wonderful genre of serious-comic ghost / stories of angels that should include everything from "It's a Wonderful Life" by Capra to Wenders' "Wings of Desire." <br /> <br /> Photography is impressive, the first presentation and - wonder of wonders - the tone is edifying. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film. The two intertwined stories seem intriguingly mysterious at first; but they work out a bit too much for my taste. As the director points out in his commentary on the DVD, all the ingredients in Irwin's story are on his bedside table. The symbolism is just a little too much for me. <br /> <br /> But what a joke! My favorite scene has to be when the change team tries to eat breakfast in a cafeteria. This is practically theatrical in his magic - a spirited acting force tour - subtle, playful and positively rhythmic - along with stunning cinematography and a keen eye for the grotesque. "Northfork" is funny, touching, beautiful to look at, magical (with reservations above) and does not have a single car chase. <br /> <br /> An easy nine stars.
