The first time I saw this movie was when I was four years old. I remember loving and all about it. 13 years later, I'm now 17, and I decided to attend about a month ago because I'm taking a 1960 class at school. I really did not know what to expect, since it's been 13 years since I last saw it, but I was completely delighted with that. The actors were incredible, the music was so much fun, and now I see myself singing with each song. Treating Williams is great as Berger, the "leader" of the hippie group, who always gets what he wants, one way or another (except in the end, of course). John Savage is actually very convincing as Claude, the owner of Oklahoma who falls in love with Sheila (Beverly D'Angelo). D'Angelo is adorable as the primitive and fit rich girl who eventually rebels against her upbringing and joins the hippies. The other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is simply adorable as Jeannie, the girl who is pregnant but still as cute and innocent as a child. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are good as Woof and Hud, the other two members of the group, and Cheryl Barnes, who plays Hud's fiancee, has an incredible voice. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this film, however, is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They are almost never shown together, and when they are, they fight (remember the scene of skinny dipping?). It seems that their relationship is very weak and, at the end of the film, we must believe that they are madly in love, just based on the few encounters they had. I also see that many people writing reviews here are upset about the PG rating that this movie has. I would personally increase the rating to a PG-13, just because there is some use of drugs ... but remember in 1979, PG-13 did not exist. I do not think nudity is bad, it's not at all sexual (in fact, there's really no sex in this movie), and it's just to show the childish innocence that the group holds. In most European countries, nudity is not considered a bad thing, and I do not see why it's here in the US. Anyway, I give this movie a high note, and I'm glad that was done at the time, because in today's insanely "politically correct" world, they would not even think of doing it, and even if they did , would be a very "diluted" version, and I'm sure you would not get the full effect. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is a very underrated movie that is worth checking out.
