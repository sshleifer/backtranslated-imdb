I saw this documentary at the 2005 independent film festival Slamdance. This documentary is filmed, directed and edited by a son (Craig) of his mother's long battle with cancer. Filmed over a year "The Closer It Gets" is a documentary in the truest form and gives you an inner insight into the struggle of a family with cancer, the viewer has an internal point of view of the effects of cancer in a family as well as the individual throughout the process. I've never seen such an honest movie, this is a powerful and raw movie, and since it was not filmed by someone outside you have the true emotions of everyone involved. Many documentaries are filmed by someone from the outside, but having this story told by the child adds another emotional level to the film, unlike anything I've seen about it or anything else. This is a moving story that everyone should see and relate to. I highly recommend it.
