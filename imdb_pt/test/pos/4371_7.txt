George Carlin is probably my favorite comedian. I saw many of his specials and even had the opportunity to see him play live. He had a certain cynicism that always appealed to me. His last two specials (life worth losing especially and complaints and complaints) lacked a certain spirit and content. George looked overweight, old and tired (not to mention coming out of rehab). "I said not to mention it!" Anyway. Life worth losing was especially tragic as he was overweight, disgruntled, coming out of rehab (here we go again ...) and extremely bland. If there was a way to feel sorry for a comedian, without teasing him off the stage, George did it with the Worthless Life to Lose. It's as if the New Millennium and post-9/11 America were trampling on George's spirit. The bs have become too big to be managed. <br /> <br /> Return is partially successful with It's Bad for Ya! This special is transmutation completed. George is no longer trying to rekindle his glory days. He is in full acceptance of his age, being old and dealing with the prospects of death. He accepted being an old idiot and is enjoying it. This is better than their previous promotions, still far from Jammin 'in New York. It's a bit tragic. His remarks are no longer avant-garde and look more like Andy Rooney than Lenny Bruce. George is not George anymore. He is no longer criticizing us, but it is the man in the high castle pointing out how things were and how modern life is different. <br /> <br /> This is an improvement over the previous two specials, but George has not yet regained his former glory (if ever). It has been reduced from critical social and political criticism to mostly personal comments. When he goes political, he still has something to say. It's heavily derivative (especially if you've seen some of your previous work), but it still works in some way, unlike your random speeches that have no certain relevance outside the baby boom generation. The last 25 minutes are the best this special has to offer. <br /> <br /> For now, I will worship the sun and pray to Joe Pesci so that George can recreate himself as a cutting-edge septuagenarian. It's a 50/50 chance. Life seems to have become more tedious for George and his "art" is now his life. This is a step in the right direction of your two previous specials, but it is far from old. Where does he go from here? He may never recover, but maybe he can further metamorphose / refine this new routine of the old man. Here is the hope for another 7 words that you can not say on TV or at least a windmill that it can handle.
