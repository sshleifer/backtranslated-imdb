A humorous trip to the usually sombre funeral business. It's easy to watch, and even offers Blethyn & Molina stealing a scene from an old Fred & Ginger movie. Walken is at the top as a zealous competitor of Molina in the venture business, trying to bring a new style to an old Welsh town. We see some very funny "new style" examples. The plot thickens with Pugh having an affair with Watts, and she suggesting that they do Blethyn. Meanwhile, Molina has revived her long romantic feeling for Blethyn, and convinces her to fake her death so they can flee to the southern seas, and dance the days together. During the "fake" funeral, Blethyn discovers the infidelities of his husbands and plot their revenge. Watch to see what funerals should probably be - a celebration of life!
