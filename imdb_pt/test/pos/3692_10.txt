My husband and I loved this movie. At first, my husband was skeptical and asked how many stitches he got by sitting on this one. But after a few key scenes, he was totally sucked in and, in the end, was convinced it would be one of the best movies. Kathleen Bates has never been so wonderfully adorable and the rest of the cast is simply fantastic. Thanks for this beautiful movie.
