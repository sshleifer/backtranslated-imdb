When I saw the trailer for this movie, I said out loud to no one in particular "this movie is going to bomb." I also said that about MATRIX and see what happened there. Now I'm not a box office guru, but I usually have a good feeling about what's going to be good and what's really bad. In this case, I was blinded by my complete and utter apathy towards David Duchovney. Let me put it to you in a different way: I do not like him as a person (from what I read of him in interviews, he's unbelievably pre-madonna and he's full of himself considering all he's done is X-Files ) or as an actor. PLAYING GOD was a very bad movie, but he left thinking that for some reason he deserved a lot of money on the big screen. But I'm happy to say that while these things may still be true about man, Return To Me is delicious and has your heart in the right place. Bonnie Hunt directed a beautiful story and it was classy and graceful. This is one of the most romantic movies I have ever seen and even though it seems a bit sad and corny on its premise, give it a try and you will be hooked. <br /> <br /> It has to be said (and it hurts me to do this) that the reason this movie works so well is because of the story and the cast. Duchovney and Driver are so wonderful and believable that I sincerely wanted to cry along with them. There is a particularly powerful scene when Duchovney comes home after his wife has died and he falls on the floor of his house. As always happens, the family dog ​​looks at the door and waits for the wife to enter. She does not show up and, with the collar of her shirt still stained with blood, Rob (Duchovney) says she will not come home. . He then calls the dog to him and they seem to share a crying together. The dog lets out a small moan and then Rob cries. And this is one of the most realistic moments of pain I have ever seen in any character in any movie. You can feel his pain, and at that moment I forgot that I was watching an actor I do not usually like, and I felt that I was watching someone who knew the loss of his beloved. This is something powerful. <br /> <br /> Another force in the film is the supporting cast. Bonnie Hunt combined an ethnic cauldron of Irish and Italian characters who share a common bond. They share a pub called O'Reilley's Italian Pub. This is a delicious name by itself. And leading the diametric scale of conflicting cultures is Carol O'Connor and Robert Loggia. These are two proud old men who love their homeland but love their granddaughter and niece (I think they are) respectively. And this is the character played by Minnie Driver. This scenario is ripe for comedy and Hunt does not miss anything here. Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi also share some funny moments together as a middle-aged couple and Belushi gets the best points when she humbly graciously accepts and shows off her wide barrel of stomach to laugh at. With his family consisting of three or four children, there is very little time for him and his wife to have quality time. And once again, Hunt handles this with perfect elegance. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful story of finding true love, knowing how lucky you are to have true love and the power of friendship and family. Return To Me is a wonderful novel and even though I still do not have a great admiration for David Duchovney, I have to admit that he was perfect in that role and I could not imagine anyone playing his character. He was sensitive and believable and the movie was good because of him not only because of him but he certainly added to the taste. <br /> <br /> If you are a sucker for a good romance and you want a good chore then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10 I'll see anything Bonnie Hunt puts with her in the director's chair.
