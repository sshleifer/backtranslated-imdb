This is the best job I've ever seen on television. The story is compelling - especially since it's true. The writers did their homework - the accuracy of the events is well documented. The acting is great. This has to be the best role Sam Waterston ever had. And black-and-white cinematography was exceptional. My only regret is that it is not available to buy. A few years ago, I got in touch with someone involved with the production (either with PBS or in England) and they told me that they had no plans to release it on VHS (at the time). This was a BBC production and ran in the US at American Playhouse. There is a great deal of interest in seeing this - it's hard to believe anyone can make it available.
