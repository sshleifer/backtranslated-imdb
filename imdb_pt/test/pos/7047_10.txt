I saw this movie for the first time in the mid 80's and thought it was a funny movie. As I got older, I watch this movie for different reasons. I like to see when I feel sad / nostalgic for my "lost youth". I was a teenager (14) at the time of the release of this movie, so that I could identify with many of the same problems / dilemmas that campers / CITs have in this movie. I like to see the clothes that were worn at the moment and hear the same old urban legends, as was said on the canoe trip. The movie is also full of funny pamphlets. I highly recommend this movie to someone who was a teenager in the late 70's to early 80's.
