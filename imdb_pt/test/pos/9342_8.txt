Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983) has to be the biggest video ever made. Dude you have zombies, gore and a captivating tune, what more can you ask for. John Landis mixed elements of Night of the Living Dead and American Werewolf in London and left this video. What starts as a good night for a young couple turns into a meeting of hell, literally. You have dancing zombies, a werewolf in a funky jacket and Vincent Price "rap". A cool video for a song that everyone in the neighborhood has scored. <br /> <br /> I have to give this a high recommendation because it has to be the best music video of all time. There was no other like him. <br /> <br /> Check out the "making of Thriller". The documentary has some "interesting" things.
