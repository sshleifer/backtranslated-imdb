A group of cats tries to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butler. <br /> <br /> The Aristocats are considered one of the best 2D animations of Walt Disney with its charming script and cool characters, but it does not. I do not have the magic that created Snow White or the Jungle Book. <br /> <br /> The slow opening will have younger viewers raising their eyebrows, but once cats settle down in history, fun and entertainment begins. Young cats create the greatest pleasure with a charming young rivalry, the special kind of bonding that any brother or sister of any age can associate with. <br /> <br /> It's not the funniest picture of Disney there, but there are some great comedic moments, especially involving cats and dogs. The depiction of gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing. <br /> <br /> The story, after the boring start, is consistently fun and exactly what a family movie should be. There are almost no lapses or boring moments. The journey to find home is interesting and you have the feeling of exploring, not to mention two very strange British swans. <br /> <br /> With Disney, you always get a strong and meaningful message. With the Book of the Jungle is where you belong, with Beauty and the Beast you explore the importance of inner beauty. However, with this 1970 photo there seems to be something missing. The film has the importance and relevance of the home, but it is not cemented enough; It seems very unlikely and irrelevant. <br /> <br /> My sister and I find it very strange to see this, as some of the central characters were dubbed by the Jungle Book cast. <br /> <br /> Despite the bad start and confusion of his preaching message, this is a consistently fun family movie with a good soundtrack and some crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to.
