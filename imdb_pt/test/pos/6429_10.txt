When, oh, when someone like Anchor Bay or Blue Underground will release this on widescreen DVD ??? Le Orme, which I only know because of my habit of collecting old and rare videos, is a movie from my collection that I did not just watch but really enjoyed watching. The fact that Klaus Kinski is top billed, but it's only in small parts of the movie, means little to me. (Although several comments have expressed disappointment in their rather limited screen time.) I can not say this is a good horror movie, a good mystery, a science fiction epic or anything of that nature. It is simply unclassifiable in the sense of "gender" of things. It's more like a confusing, scary (though not particularly violent or bloody) dream, full of great visuals and mystery. It depends on visual and emotional, much like "Lisa and the Devil" by Bava. Both films are beautiful in almost every way, but almost impossible to describe in a logical way; both occur in a dreamlike atmosphere. Do not be intimidated by the Force Video synopsis on the back cover. It is infinitely more complex and intriguing than that. Although the 1986 Force Video release (the only one in the US I know of) is cut to full screen, even in that format, it's still great. Releasing it remastered and / or letterbox would make it magnificent (hint, tip ... DVD companies).
