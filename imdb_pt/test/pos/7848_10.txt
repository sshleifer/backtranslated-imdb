Let's assume for a moment that you have not tried the psychotropic mushroom and you're wondering about the so-called bad experience and just how can something like that solve itself? Well, go ahead and put a new copy of The Beguiled. See, with the movie you have your travels cleaned (Solaris and anything else directed by Andrei Tarkovsky), idiots, that is, the experience that you never recover (Sweet Movie and El Topo), and you're lousy organic thrips, a category specifically reserved for a film such as The Beguiled, which is the kind of content that the Times' concerned writers, who made all the right decisions with their lives and graduated from the Harvard Department of English, call it "hallucinogenic tone ". In the third act of this film directed by Don Siegel, you may not exactly observe that your two hands full of lead have been shrunk and assume all the characteristics of an insectivorous mammal, nor will they exactly fall into the suspicion that their spine has reached the same sinuous shape and texture gnarled tree of pompous fruits incalculable in age, but you will feel something. <br /> <br /> In 1970, when this movie was filmed, most Americans were looking for an anodyne for their collective. pain, a movie like The Graduate, maybe, a lot of world endism was happening and of course you had the nightmare of war in Vietnam. What you get with the Beguiled, banal drug metaphors aside, is a script adapted from a novel by a guy who at least for now wanted to be known as Grimes Grice, and directing the director who helped bring the work and career of Sam Peckinpah. In Beguiled, Donny Siegel, born 12, Chicago, Ill., Less than 45 years after The Great Fire is showing his attempt to deal with all that contemporary cultural madness of the early 1970s in the form of a classic movie artifact. The Beguiled is an incredible film and an excellent contribution to the cinematographic arts in almost every aspect: shooting, editing, direction and story are fantastic, and you probably will not see anything like it. Without a doubt, a sinister film, its effects, as I said, both vertiginous and adulterating; frankly, it's hard to believe that Universal has already attached your name to this picture, but you'll see some of the sweet, sweeping movements of the camera, and director of photography Bruce Surtees exploring every bit of the dark myth you have in mind about American . Plantation South, confusing beauty with evil in all locations photographed. Clint Eastwood, needless to say, has never been like this. Old Clint, he moves instantly from timid to livid, his eyes like two spirals of Archimedes in the middle. The rest of the cast is equally demanding and mysterious. <br /> <br /> This Beguiled will never do the AFI 100 in my life, but that does not stop me from postulating that it is one of the best American sync movies. always done. While most people refer to it as a western, to include The Western Channel staff, The Beguiled is a problem because you really do not know what it is: a kind of war film? A drama? Psychological thrillers? Perhaps the answer to all those emotionally starring Noir films starring Kirk Douglas? I actually call this a horror movie because when my dad, who likes to relax with cheap, free-projected violence on shows like The Wire, saw that middle angle of Geraldine Page involving a tourniquet around Clint's bloody leg, Pa was very quick to suggest that we see something like the Outback Bowl just before he escapes to another room. My advice: watch this, and make sure that it is on a very large screen, preferably run on the home theater DPL projector you are contemplating. I would put The Beguile in the right order along with that important consumer purchase, turn off the overhead, throw some cinematic light on the big blank wall, and try not to lose control because like Norman Bates, "We all go a little crazy sometimes, "even the deceived.
