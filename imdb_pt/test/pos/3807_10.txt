I loved this movie, I saw it when I was about 8 years old and almost seven years later, tonight I could see it again. I really thought I had an interesting idea, the only thing that bothered me was the end I felt like being a cop. 'It's hard to find this movie around here and I was lucky to have seen it on BRAVO. I also hoped to see more Drew Barrymore here too!
