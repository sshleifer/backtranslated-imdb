I've seen this movie five times and I never get tired of it. This characterizes traits of the "giallo" genre but also with a vivid Italian countryside scene where ignorance and superstition are more deadly than any serial killer. With an excellent location (sometimes reminiscent of Fellini, sometimes of the Taviani brothers), good characterization and some of the best actors of the genre (including the great Tomas Milian and Ida Lupino in an unforgettable role), this is not euro-trash, just one a masterpiece that must be discovered generation after generation (recently received great acclaim at the Paris Cinematheque in honor of Lucius Fulci)
