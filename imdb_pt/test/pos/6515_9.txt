Sally and Saint Anne is a very funny movie. The first time my mother told me about it I was 7 and Santa Ana had just been the saint I had for my holy communion. My mother knew that, so she told me to watch it with her. I did, and I've seen it many times since because it's so funny. Aunt Bea's Andy Griffith Show was there and Sally's grandfather was the guy playing Santa Claus on Miracle On 34th Street. So there were a lot of actors we saw on TV shows as well. There's a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house, and Sally keeps trying things with St. Anne to help raise money so they can keep the house. This includes a boxing match with Hugh O'Brian, who plays his big brother. This is a good and funny movie that I still love.
