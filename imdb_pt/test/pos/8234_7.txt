Notice the large release date of August 8, 1945 - about a week before Japan's surrender in World War II, so there will probably be a message for us in "Over 21." Irene Dunne (One night, the 1939 version of the love affair) is Paula Wharton, who will live on an army base while her husband newspaper editor is in a training school. Alexander Knox (the longest day) is her husband Max. Look for Charles Coburn (Monkey Business, Lords Prefer Blondes) as the boss of newspaper stuffy and authoritarian. See also Cora Witherspoon as Mrs. Gates, The Women, Bank Dick, and Libeled Lady. War history written for the wives' point of view, which was not very common in those days. fun commentary on the poor condition of "married housing"; Irene's wardrobe in this movie certainly was not bad ... since they never had to leave their little house, it seems that the entire budget of the film was spent on their always exquisite dresses and hats.
