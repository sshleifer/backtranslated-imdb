In my opinion, the film is an excellent example of the realities of war and a tribute to the soldiers of all nations who fought and bled in the soil of Gallipoli. The lack of violence did nothing to detract from the magnitude of the tale in his hand. He is honest, true and courageous, as are the men who fought and died in the Hellespont. The lack of brutal depictions of violence is just and appropriate. These men have suffered enough for freedom, freedom, and the right to self-determination in a free and better world. They never wanted to see such a scene again. This is the legacy of the Gallipoli event. To suffer scenes of gratuitous pyrotechnics and blood and blood is no longer indicated for the maintenance of the due respect for the fighters of this crucible of the nationality. <br /> <br /> This film glorifies the magnificence of men struggling for their own lives. lives with honor, courage, dignity, and irrepressible spirit and humor in the face of frightening adversities. This movie is not interested in making a show for the fools to cheer up. The brutal results that have arisen from these men's personal battles are not something that those who survived have always wished to see on a screen for entertainment. They'd seen enough of it at the time, and they'd rather have never seen it at first, and never wanted to revise such scenes again on a screen in the name of "entertainment." The brutal horrors of the realities of fierce combat fought at Gallipoli were scenes that haunted his waking hours and sleep for the rest of his natural days. It was the painful inner scars that they, the men of all those nations who fought, carried into their graves. All of them fought, and many died before it, and somehow they, those mighty-hearted men, could laugh with the teeth of constant death, for they would not insult their comrades if they were not prepared to die by their side. This is Australasian for the brave, the game is, but applied to all fighters to a greater or lesser degree, but the word of the boy who fought was that Johhny Turk was like gaming, who is as brave as you would like a soldier ANZAC and the Turks were struggling to establish their place on the world stage and, as of 04/25/15, their respective claims to equality in the Nation were made known and undeniable to that world. The director made a masterpiece that truly honors the spirit and memory of those soldiers and serves as a reminder for future generations of all ages, for children can be taken without fear of frightening them in the name of visual "horror" and it is morbid and useless appeal. And children should watch this movie to learn what happened on that sacred shore before they were born. So they can remember. For it is the nature of men that they soon forget.
