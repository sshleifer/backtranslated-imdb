As much as the film is for comics, it does not matter. This film radically departs from the boredom of "Interview with the Vampire" (although it is a good performance) and slips in the wonderful action scenes. Very convincing and interesting tale, with surprisingly good acting from all. Disadvantage - poor graphics. This matters? Do not.
