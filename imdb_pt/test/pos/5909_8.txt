Billy Wilder created a relatively conventional biographical film about Charles Lindberg's flight. He structures the film using flashbacks extensively to tell the story of Lindberg that led to the famous flight across the Atlantic, which happens at the present time in the film. Piloting an airplane for hours on end is not a matter of excitement, and Wilder will not stray from the Lindberg theme as the common man's hero, so things are predictable. However, James Stewart is well-launched and quite believable as Lindberg, and the many obstacles he has to overcome just to put his plane in the air keep the remark. <br /> <br /> The film is presented with more success, while Wilder interweaves the parts of the story in a way that creates tension, then relief and then tension again. The cinematography is very good, Franz Waxman's score improves the scenes, and Stewart really seems to make Lindberg come alive, making someone believe he could be Lindberg. There is a bit of 1950s religious schmaltz at the end, but overall the direction, acting and high production values ​​outweigh the predictability of the story (would anyone REALLY see this picture and DID NOT know Lindberg crossed the Atlantic?) To make a nice film that aged better than most movies of that era. Billy Wilder has made films of a wide variety of types, and this is a representative of his best craftsman.
