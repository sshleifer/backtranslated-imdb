Comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them very well; they will hate you. But this time, I watched alone and found that it affected me a lot. Although the film was long, I was connected to the story and was impressed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as it just disappeared, but on some level, it makes perfect sense. <br /> <br /> But as comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality. Instead, it challenges you and the viewer to think hard about what the word "normal" means. It also gives you the insight to think personally about what the ending means, I can say that I loved the result and I'm happy for Mithi.
