"Two Hands" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalog. <br /> <br /> It's this curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love that the Australians have developed on their own. <Br> Heath Ledger is basically a good guy if naive. Wanting to get in, he falls with a "big" local man, Pando (Bryan Brown). But just as he puts his first finger down the dark path of crime, he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the mistake to change your life in unexpected ways. After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get really bad very quickly and, were it not for some supernatural help, it would have been a short and sad movie. Yes, Jimmy learns some lessons in life and no one escapes unharmed one way or another, but in the end he has a sense of well-being. While there is a lawless theme throughout history, it is not glorified and helps to show how crime can be destructive in normal lives. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and intelligent at the same time, Rose is hypnotic, since Alex and Bryan are wonderful as ever. This is a small set of characters that are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and not liking the bad guys. <br /> <br /> This DVD is usually in cheap running, so I would recommend that you also add your DVD collection, it would be well spent money. <br /> 8 out of 10
