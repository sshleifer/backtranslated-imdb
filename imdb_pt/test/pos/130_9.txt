The thing that makes "Fire" even more appealing to watch, besides her magical art, is her touch of feminism and rebellion. In my opinion, the very character played by Shabana Azmi is a symbol of Indian female protest against Indian society. The name of the film and the scene in which Radha walks by the flames in her kitchen are symbolic of Lord Rama's wife of Hindu Mythology, Sita, walking through the fire to prove her immaculate, according to the same narrative that appears in the film as well. The film could be a great inspiration for women, particularly those in the subcontinent, to seek their freedoms and gain control of their lives.
