Cuba Gooding Jr. is back on top! Jesus, he did a great job in this movie! I loved this movie. He's one of those who make good movies that make you want to run and volunteer on a mission or something. Anyway, I would recommend watching this movie in no time! Well worth the price of admission. What about Cuba Gooding Jr., just give him your next Oscar now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
