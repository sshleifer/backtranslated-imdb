I must say I did not expect much about this movie, but it turned out not to be bad at all. Most impressive, of course, was the performance of Aidan Quinn. I would never expect to see this great actor as an action hero. Best of all, he really builds his character (Annibal). I mean, it was not like Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis did that, he was sensitive and modest. For example, he gets very upset when he kills someone. I also noticed that some clich√©s were avoided. When Annibal is trained, you would easily expect him to be a rebel and act like any ordinary American would do in such a situation, ask what is happening and refuse to cooperate. But Annibal is a professional marine officer, he does not give up and tries not to lose his courage, which he does well, except for a brief dismemberment on Christmas Eve, which I find very realistic. I'm glad Aidan Quinn has had the opportunity to show him another side (actually, two, because he also plays the villain), even though the film has not been so successful.
