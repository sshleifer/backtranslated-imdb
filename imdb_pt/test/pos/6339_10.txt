Excellent episode, showed Dean not only has good taste, choosing Cassie for his girlfriend, but also shows that he has a heart and can only love a woman, and he is not only a guy who loves and lets in! Aweso and episode. Embrace them in this. I just hope they somehow get back into Cassie's relationship next season (if there's a next season ??), I'd like to see her get back into their "supernatural" lives, especially Dean. I also like the fact that I chose an African-American woman to be the special lady in her life who escaped in some way. I hope they do not ruin everything and end when it's over. The girl who played Cassie was really a spectator and it was good to see the WB branching out into what we all see in everyday life - the interacial coupling that has become commonplace and acceptable (anyway!)
