Our family (and all the exhausted preview audience) enjoyed "The Guardian". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave compelling performances as Helicopter Rescue Helicopter character Ben and Jake. After watching this movie, you can not help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimming school and one day to take part in actual rescues. <br /> <br /> Although this is a fictional movie, it featured quite convincing virtues of team spirit, dedication and bravery exhibited by all members of the US Coast Guard. <br /> <br /> The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible. You really felt like you were participating in a real ransom. <br /> <br /> I feel like the movie could have been made without the "Hollywood" bar scene (when you see the movie, you may agree) since the true Coast Guard does not tolerate such behavior. Very entertaining, very action packed, definitely worth seeing. Thank you, US Coast Guard and REAL Helicopter Rescue Swimmers, "So Others May Live". I recommend this movie to everyone.
