A couple of years before SCREAM imitated the slasher / horror genre with smart and conscientious youngsters knowing every trick of the book about what to do and not do in a precarious situation, a small Russian-made movie hit theaters without any grandiose pretensions. <br /> <br /> This movie was MUTE WITNESS. Starring a cast of unknowns (except for a brief engagement of Sir Alec Guiness, whose scenes were filmed supposedly eight years before the actual filming of the film), he told the story of a makeup artist, Billie, who is working on a film on location in Russia produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend, Andy. She does not know the set was closed when she picks up her belongings and inadvertently stumbles on a porn shoot that becomes extremely bloody. Filled with horror, she alerts the killers to her presence, a chase ensues, and finally she is rescued by Andy, who takes her home while they alert the police. The problem is ... there is no body, there is no evidence that something like this has occurred. Even so, a mysterious inspector seems to be on the side of Billie's story ... <br /> <br /> And to say more would be criminal. MUTE WITNESS is the type of movie that requires a viewing scrutiny similar to the more intricate and clever thriller because, no matter how complicated a thriller is, it pays its debts to films like WAIT UNTIL DARK and the best of Hitchcock in its movies. choice of camera cuts, deadpan humor, reacting Americans in foreign countries where they are impotent and scathing suspense until it seems that something must pop. Even if the story becomes somewhat implausible due to the fact that the story suddenly becomes the focus of an even bigger conspiracy, the film manages not to deceive the public with cheap shots (for example, the sudden appearance of a person ahead of the camera accompanied by a violin violin), but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away. Very clever.
