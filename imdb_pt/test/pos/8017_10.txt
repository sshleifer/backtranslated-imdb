Okay, so I love Aidan Quinn's acting, even with a bad script. This is not the case in The Assignment. As other viewers said, this was a movie that I tripped on the cable and went into it and did not want it to end. Get an Ofc from the Cuban American Navy (Quinn) who is an honest, tense soldier and a family man. Add a crazed agent (Donald Sutherland) who is looking for the most notorious terrorist in the world and add a Ben Kingsley and you have "The Assignment." Sutherland is a witness to the most notable terrorist actions of Carlos at a coffee shop on a beautiful day where he is so deeply shaken by this man's evil that his only reason to live is to catch this man while he breathes. <br /> <br /> Take a soldier on a pass in Israel who is a dead man to this man and be beaten and held by Kingsley until they realize that they have a plan. By taking on Carlos for being him, or always being responsible for never helping to rid the world of him, he contributes to a very heavy journey of attribution and guilt. By not helping his country, he is obliged, as a man and his military duty, to choose wisely. Then the training begins. Let's say Carlos is training with the arts and holocaust academy. When I say that this intense and wonderfully released movie, scripted and executed ranks best, I'm not understanding this. All three actors were able to save almost all scripts. Taken together, this is a movie that can be seen from the one frame for the credits. I'm not into terrorism or movies about it, but I got hooked! Bravo again to Aidan Quinn, who for once plays a heavy role that could stand up to any actor including Gary Oldman. Is this a praise. Rent it and drink lots of popcorn. Oh did I mention sex? Works better than "Last Tango!" And it's educational.
