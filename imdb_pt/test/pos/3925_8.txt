My college theater only had a special screening last night of this movie. I have to say that I think everyone was impressed by how good this movie was. However, my roommate did not care about this, but he does not like horror movies and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about it, do not be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say that she was very good and that she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actors were very good. I will not go into detail for the plot since I'm sure you know about it. Incredibly, the characters are quite attractive and you really care about them, especially the characters of Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray. We find them as rival brothers and we end up with them having to work together. Another advantage is that he does not have the elegant look of Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and feels almost like a documentary instead of a music video (do not get me wrong, I loved Texas Chainsaw and enjoyed Amityville). <br /> Now for the death scenes. In most horror movies, whenever a character is stabbed or killed, the scene immediately cuts to another scene, but not this one. When a character is about to die, he dies horribly. But filmmakers do not stop there and add something extra each time to each victim. I will not say anything about the death scenes and I will let you see them for yourself. <br /> <br /> Although this is a great horror movie, it has the flaws of almost every horror movie (exploring a scary house) when you should not be, hitchhiking with a suspicious character, breaking up and screaming so the killer can hear you). In addition, there is a stupid twist that was unnecessary and did not contribute to the film. You could say that it was added at the last moment and if you took it would not have affected the movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, if you're a fan of horror movies, check out this movie. . You will not be disappointed. He has everything needed to make it a great horror film, possibly the best of the year, although it's a bit early. Suspense is felt and sometimes it's a funny movie. If you hate horror movies, you're likely to enjoy it, and if it's split, I recommend you take a chance.
