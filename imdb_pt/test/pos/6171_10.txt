This is a beautifully made film, finely balancing the fragile human stories (before and after 1945) and the indiscriminate combat of war. The use of outtakes of the Battle of Britain (a film that does not portray the 1940s so well!) Increases, rather than diminishes, the whole. A deeply impressive work, this has lived in my memory for the 2 years since I've seen it, and I've just bought it to explore the extras extras. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie (film). Like "Aces High," he alternates between viscerally exciting (or scary) air combat sequences where the viewer can experience the real loss of characters they care about, but also unpredictable interactions on the ground, where writers and life events inform some engaging and moving events. This also underscores the fact that, for many people, 1945 marked not only the end of one conflict, but the beginning of another, and even today we do not recognize the loss, bravery and sacrifice of so many unnamed heroes, or worse still venera- without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that this entails - making their sacrifices even more valuable. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is an experience that will take you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy and back to the love that lasts even beyond death. If all the war movies were like that, we would never have to fight again. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that it's worth watching? ;-) <br /> <br /> 10/10
