The Merchant of Venice 8/10 <br /> <br /> (This analysis presupposes a basic knowledge of the story and thus can be thought of as containing spoilers for someone unfamiliar with the plot). As a film version of Shakespeare's famous play, Merchant of Venice does what few adaptations have done since Macbeth, a bit arduous of Polanski: he takes the spirit of the play and brings it not only as well as, but better than the piece alone could readily achieve. The director of The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson, argued that in adapting a book or a play, there are three options: try to replicate the original as perfectly as possible, use the original idea as inspiration , but complete license for the cinematographic change, or (to which he preferred) to keep the original as far as cinematic is feasible, but make the necessary changes to the film and remain faithful to the intent or spirit of the original. In Macbeth, Polanski used rain-soaked beaches and royalist rapes and murders to convey the bloody and horrible period in which the play was set, thus bringing to mind the horrific context in which the characters make such ill- understood advised decisions. It differs from Branagh's (say) Hamlet, who reached new heights of faithful surrender, but otherwise offered little new. Macbeth, on the other hand, might have enabled the new audience for Shakespeare to appreciate some of the fullness of drama without extensive study; In the same way, more familiar audiences can find a greater depth than the stage performance without help could realize. This interpretation plays a vital role in engaging the audience fully, not only intellectually but also emotionally, with the points that Shakespeare wanted to make. <br /> <br /> Radford's adaptation to the Merchant of Venice does just that. Crucial moral dilemmas involving religious fanaticism or the keeping of promises are necessary, and with the least confusion with the holy tome of the bard, convey them faithfully to the spirit of the original story. <br /> <br /> The first of them, religious fanaticism, gives meaning to Shylock's strange behavior. We see the Jews of the period relegated to a walled ghetto, only allowed to wear a red identifying cap. Not being allowed to own property, one of the few ways to earn a living is by borrowing money. This makes them useful to their Christian oppressors and, at the same time, the object of their defamation. The idea behind both the old and the new testaments of biblical prohibitions against usury probably results from not profiting by helping friends. This is extended by intolerant Christians to curse those in whom they spit (we see Shylock not only spit, but also Jews thrown into the waters for sport - in an atmosphere that can only be described as threatening). The timeliness of the film is curious, since the fanaticism of right-wing Christianity (personified by American Bush followers) has come full circle, as they are now the main supporters of Zionism, and Jewish political leaders bite their Palestinians. neighbors much as Shylock tries to bite Antonio (since he thinks the law gives him the power to do so). Psychology is self-evident - kicking a dog over and over and it will become vicious. The circle continues with ease, for the very victims of oppression easily lose their sense of moral values ​​and become oppressive. <br /> <br /> The strict trick that Portia disguised uses to save Antonio has some merit, both as a clever interpretation of the unsophisticated law that the Venetians play as well and as a moral pointer. Shylock may "have his pound of flesh" according to his contract, but may not have blood. An easy analogy could be made to the extent that war and terrorism happen - it is much easier to justify fighting between combatants or attacking evildoers if soldiers or malefactors are the only victims - when there are huge collateral damage, such as when innocent citizens, including women and children, are killed by the hundreds, the arguments of the war's provocateurs (whether these warmongers are Israeli, Palestinian or American) have much less popular support. <br /> <br /> It has long been argued that Shakespeare was being anti-Semitic in this story. One can imagine whether he had to adapt the ending to a largely Christian audience who had little contact with the Jewish people. Far from teaching him a greater good, the end imposes Christianity and humiliation on Shylock - a course that probably simply perpetuates repressed resentment. Both fields look so bad - one simply holds more power than the other. The slight improvement of the judgment simply gives the Christian judges a better public image, or as Bassanio so sharply (note when choosing the coffins and solving the puzzles to win Portia's hand): In religion, which damn bug, but some sober eyebrow Will bless it and approve it with a text, Hiding rudeness with fair ornament? There is no such simple addiction, but it takes some mark of virtue on its outer parts. <br /> <br /> Of course fanaticism applies to organized religion (rather than spirituality), especially when organized for political purposes, but it easily encourages ordinary God-fearing people who are not in the habit of dividing hair . Kindness, mercy ("Chesed" in Judaism), which is so fundamental to true Christianity, is also practiced to a wonderful degree in Judaism, as in most creeds. The Jewish faith distinguishes between goodness and charity, ways of practicing both effectively, and ways to make it part of one's being rather than just an outward show. Both Shylock and Antonio are intolerant and use their respective beliefs to abuse people of another faith. While Shakespeare perhaps pointed to the abyss between the goodness prescribed by different beliefs and their absence in practice, the film version greatly reduces the window to interpretations of anti-Semitism and brings a greater degree of realism to psychological causes. <br /> <br /> The keeping of promises (men to wives) is less well treated, as are the comic elements inherent in cross-subplots. Bassanio, however strong his love for Antonio (are there homosexual elements there?) Can not make moral judgments when he shows his gratitude to the "judge", and thus breaks his promise (for which Portia forgives him, exhibiting a triumphant character for women, not only as extremely intelligent and witty, but also as more truly merciful and attentive to others than their intolerant male counterparts, including her husband.) <br /> <br /> Some of the performances are a bit flamboyant, and there are many regional accents, but in general Merchant of Venice offers a new and rewarding rework of Shakespeare. I enjoyed the performance, and also the very beautiful soundtrack of Hayley Westenra and others, singing ballads written by both Shakespeare and Edgar Allen Poe. All in all, Merchant of Venice is an undeniable achievement of the British film tradition (as much as it can be said that a film is of a particular nationality).
