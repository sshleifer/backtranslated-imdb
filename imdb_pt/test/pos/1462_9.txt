A spin-off of comedy talk show by Garth Marenghi's 'Darkplace' creators The new series, Man to Man with Dean Learner, focuses on Garth's manager, publisher and advertising agent, played by Richard Ayoade. night club owner, restaurant owner, publisher, international playboy - Dean Learner is a one-man brand. <br /> <br /> After his co-funded television channel, Channelplace, Garth Marenghi, Darkplace, he now invites you to his luxury penthouse for an all-new, fun and immensely stylish talk show. <br /> <br /> Man to Man with Dean Learner will feature all of Dean's remaining celebrity friends as well as lots of live music and good fish cooking in a show that smells like class - but not fish! <br /> <br /> I participated in two of the live recordings and it left me in stitches. There are distinct comparisons with Alan Partridge's "Knowing Me" in the layout, but the unique writing style of Richard Ayoade and Matt Holness takes him to another level. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Darkplace, miss it. Pick it up when it's shown later this summer
