In 1982, a short film called MAKING LOVE surprised audiences with its frank and open depiction of a romantic love story that happened to be two men. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting for years for an old, old-fashioned romance between two men; THE LAST DAYS are all this and more. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is with soap, melodramatic, full of clich√©s and quite tacky. That's what makes it so wonderful. There's nothing like a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word. <br /> <br /> As for the religion issue, sorry guys, but these things happen and are happening to gays. people right now. It is not just the Mormon church that rejects its gay members. Homosexuals of all religions face harsh criticism and rejection. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It has a perfect blend of a fantasy novel based on the day-to-day reality of the characters. If I could give more than ten stars I would. Good love stories never go out of style; great love stories like LAST DAYS are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It's time!
