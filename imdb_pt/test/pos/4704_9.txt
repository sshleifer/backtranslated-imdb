This is truly a love documentary about a fascinating character, his vision of life and his extended family. The filmmakers spent three years taping Sister Helen at her recovery home and managed to capture so much wonderful material that you can not help feeling that you know Sister Helen and her "boys." The house is home to 21 recovering addicts, each with a story almost as engrossing as Sister Helen's. The final scenes are particularly engaging and emotional. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen's wedding, addiction, and loss story reveals a very complex character, who is a tough, always funny, touching, and catchy love. The film is incredible in the way it tells its story in a wonderful slice of life sequences that unfold in a story that is almost as clear as if each scene were scripted and represented by the best. The honesty (and obvious dishonesty) of "clients" is very engaging as you learn about your fears and watch your attempts to grow. <br /> <br /> Will you ever forget Sister Helen, Robert, Moe or poor Ashish (spelling?).
