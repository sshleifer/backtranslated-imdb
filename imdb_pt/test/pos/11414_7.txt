I do not watch a lot of 'horror' movies, but one night I sat down and watched it with my cousins. Now, we're teenagers, so we tend to make fun of a lot of things, but honestly, the acting here really was not very good, especially in the beginning. One line that stood out was when Scarlett tells Jill and Tiffany, "That's so ... college!" while the next scene shows Jill going through a sign with the name of high school ... Many parts at the beginning reminded me of an episode of Lizzie McGuire, moody, poorly written and misinterpreted. However, as the story progressed, and the cast passed to just Jill most of the time, I was able to enjoy the movie more. Camilla Belle did very well in this film, and I think the other actors and actresses ruined the film for her. And I must admit this was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Well, no, there were not big monsters and white faces popping up in dark corners and possessed dolls, but the thing that made this movie scarier than the ones that contain those things is that it could actually happen. And this movie really reminded me of what's really scary ... We all know that we're probably not going to come across the undead at any point in our lives, but the idea of ​​having a killer inside the house where you're taking care could really happens. The only flaw with this movie is that it's one of the most clichéd movies I've ever seen. It has everything in it that any horror movie ever had - turn the keys and the car starts, shadows in the corner, turning the corners of the stairs with suspense, turning and seeing a corpse, ending a fatal scene quickly with the awakening In the scenes of suspense, was very predictable, but overall I would give it a 7/10. Definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is my first review, so I do not know if any of these things were spoilers .. But just to be sure ...
