Adam Sandler's movies are my favorite comedies. The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie. The Matrix is ​​my favorite science fiction movie. Anywhere But Here is my favorite drama. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only most valuable feature of this film is its performance. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon is absolutely incredible. At the end of this movie, I felt like I knew her character better than I did. She did a simply amazing job. Natalie Portman also did a great job. I recently rented her first movie, Leon (1994), in which she played a 12-year-old girl. I believe it is a contradiction in terms; she was a good child actress. Well, 5 years later, she's still such a good actress. In fact, she is much better. <br /> <br /> Sarandon and Portman not only interpreted their characters well, but they also worked perfectly together. I mean, even now I can hardly believe they are not really mother and daughter in real life, just like in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a 14-year-old girl (Portman) and her restless mother (Sarandon) who leaves her hometown in Wisconsin for Beverly Hills. <br /> <br /> First, Portman hates his mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends, and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that rises. and over a couple of years (usually below, I might add). <br /> <br /> Although this explanation is somewhat vague, the plot can only be summarized vaguely. But when you see this movie, you will see that the plot really is not as vague or weak as it actually is very deep. What I'm saying is that the plot is outlined weakly, but then they focus on it to make it strong. <br /> <br /> And it's very strong, but plot sequencing is great, too. And there are some brilliant scenes that I hope one day will be seen as "classic". <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. I laughed. I cried. And although, admittedly, there are some gaps, it's still a stellar movie and it really joins in the end.
