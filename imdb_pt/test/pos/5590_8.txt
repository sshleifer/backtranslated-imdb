Who won the Oscar for best actress in 1933? She should have been Laura Hope Crewes for her magnificent portrait of the most monstrous mother of all time. She really is one of the great character actresses of all time. She played the frivolous Prudence Duvernoy in "Camille" (1936) and her most remembered role is Aunt Pittypat in "Gone With the Wind." <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne was the "official" star of the film, but she scenes with Laura Hope Crewes were dynamite. <br /> <br /> David (Joel McCrea) is in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York. His wife, Christine (Irene Dunne) can continue his studies at the Rockafellar Center. His first stop in America is a visit to David's mother, Mrs. Phelps. To say that Laura Hope Crewes dominates every scene is an understatement. From his first entrance - in a frantic burst of effort to greet his "big boy" - all the attention is focused on her. Even sitting around the tea table, when she forgets Hester's existence, even forgetting how she drinks her tea, you know something is not right (Hester has lived there for a while). <br /> Frances Dee is completely sweet and as sure in her role as the lovely Hester. Her performance in this film, especially the scene in which she has hysteria and the consequences, proves how underrated she was. <br /> <br /> The whole young cast is excellent. Eric Linden is superb as Robert, the youngest son who comes to the conclusion that his mother is awful, but can not do anything to escape his mother's spell. Joel McCrea, at one point, says "painting roses in bathtubs - it's more your style." There is a very subtle suggestion in Robert's film about sexuality. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne is excellent in any film or genre she has experienced.
