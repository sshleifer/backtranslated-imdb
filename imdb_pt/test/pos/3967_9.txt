Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But in fact, all the characters are incredibly fun to watch. <br /> <br /> (MINIMUM SPOILERS) As usual, the main character, B, is the sensible of the group. B has this crazy idea of ​​creating his own college when he is rejected in all the colleges he applies. He is known to make false identities. so a letter of acceptance is no problem. <br /> <br /> As B's father is tough and suspicious of this university he has never heard of, B takes his friend Sherman to create a website for the university. Sherman has been accepted into a major college and is afraid of being arrested for fraud. He is very fast with spirited lines, but his failure is that he wants to be socially accepted too. <br /> <br /> Glen, Hands and Rory are the three clowns that follow B together. Glen has a zero in his SATs and has no thought process. He is constantly proposing the royalty of the battle, but he is very good at making smoothies, which makes him a lot of hot girls in some way. Hands was a great football player who did not receive the scholarship he was counting on, and uses crafts to cover his lack of athletics. Rory was getting ready to go to Yale since grade 1 and was not accepted. She spends her time meditating. <br /> <br /> Uncle Ben was my favorite character. Imagine Lewis Black playing alone. If you have no reason to see this movie, then check out Lewis Black and Jonah Hill. They are amazing. <br /> <br /> Monica is the love interest of a B. Like most of these stories, she is more popular than him and does not even realize it until the middle of the movie. Unlike many other stories, however, B really receives it and keeps it to the end. Monica is a really good character by herself, but of course she's there to love B. <br /> <br /> There are more college support students who are fun to watch. A.D.D.'s name is self-explanatory and funny enough that he ends up in meditation class. Kiki is a hot stripper who falls madly in love with a chance to go to school and eventually fall in love with Glen. Maurice is a former military idiot who got his G.I. Bill and wants to study rock n 'roll in college. The final guy is known only as Strange Student, who thinks he can blow things up with his mind. You who have little faith in him wait until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course the villains are the dean of an opposing university, the president of his university's student body, the president's girlfriend, and his circle of friends. Each character is kind. I believe this movie has a good plot and it is well done, despite what many people say. Even though the overall story is predictable, the characters make you guess and make the movie great. Go see this movie. I give 9 out of 10.
