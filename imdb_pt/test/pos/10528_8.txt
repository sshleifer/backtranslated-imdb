I saw this television version of a mystery story from Christie when it was shown on Channel 5 in New York in 1980. At the time, I was surprised that it was not shown on Channel 13, the public television station that showed most of the Masterpiece Theater. programs, but (with the exception of a few Dorothy Sayers stores "Lord Peter Wimsey" and THE MOONSTONE), BBC productions rarely dealt with British detective stories. Another series, THE RIVALS SHERLOCK HOLMES, had dealt with stories set in the Victorian and Edwardian period, so a period charm was involved in bringing those stories to Channel 13. <br /> <br /> The plot of WHY DO NOT THEY ASK EVANS? dealt with a young couple stumbling on a dying man who is just the last words are the title issue of the story (the novel was originally called why they did not ask for EVANS ?, but was later renamed THE BOOMERANG CLUE). The young couple begins investigating the murder and tracing the crime to a group of people surrounding a questionable doctor (Eric Porter). Despite the warnings of the hero's father (John Gielgud), the hero (James Warwick) and heroine (Francesca Annis) continue their investigation - even if it becomes darker and more dangerous. The death of another suspect by suicide increases the apparent dangers as the killer begins investigating the silencing of the two amateur detectives. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, although I agree it was a bit too long for a single night. entertainment (if it had been done later as episodes of Miss Marple with Joan Hickson, or episodes of Hercule Poirot in two parts would have been better). But it has its strengths. One of them is Porter's proper use as a prime suspect, and a clever scene at the end of the movie where he seems to be spying on the young couple who are investigating the mystery. If you stick with the movie, you will have a good surprise later. <br /> <br /> But there is a flaw. In dealing with a Christie novel, the figures in the story need to be on a rigid schedule of movements, so the reader can find out what the plot's secret is. I'll just add that if you hear the dialogue at one point, and as a little boy was almost killed (but it was not), then you'll find all parts of the story coming together, and what the villain's motivations were. Except for this and the long time that the telefilm takes to tell its story, it's a good movie, and worthy of being one of the best programs based on a Christie story in the period when they were suddenly reborn in films based on their novels.
