This movie has the appearance of being reunited in a matter of days like Plan 9 From Outer Space. Despite this, it's still a classic ranking among my favorite creature features. ***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD ******* Count Dracula and Larry Talbot; also known as Wolfman, arrives in Dr. Edelman's lab seeking a cure for his nocturnal anti-social behavior, such as killing people. Meanwhile, Dr. Edelman gently discovers the body of the Frankenstein monster. Becoming obsessed with bringing him back to life (a character trait common among scientists, crazy or not), he goes against his better judgment, resulting in monstrous chaos and madness. One of Universal's final classics of his time (Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein, 3 years later), he ranks 10 with this reviewer. Onslow Steven steals the show as a good doctor who got sick after being infected by Dracula's blood and becoming a half werewolf / vampire creature, coming to a tragic end. 1 hour and 7 min. Pack a good punch. A worthy addition to my collection of videos. <br /> <br /> Rating: ***** out of *****
