We just watched this movie in Austin Texas at the Alamo South Lamar yesterday afternoon. It made me laugh out loud many times! The scene about Albert Einstein's thoughts about humanity hit me several times and I could not stop laughing. Too bad I'm not in more theaters, I know many friends who are dying to see this movie! "Welcome to Costco, I love you." ... great job for everyone involved! Also, if you see it, make sure you stay by the end of the credits too! I'm going to take my family to see it again this weekend for sure! If you are a fan of OFFICE SPACE and BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, then you have to go see this movie. It's a classic and nobody knows you're out! So, if you're in the mood to see something funny this weekend, check it out.
