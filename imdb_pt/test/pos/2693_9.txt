This is one of the funniest TV shows today. It reaches the mark 99% of the time. Usually, after watching a comedy after a few years, the actors become caricaturists, as if they were trying to become the beloved characters they play. In my opinion, these actors have remained faithful to their roles. The chemistry is still there, the writing has not subsided and I'm still looking forward to it. The family dynamics still seem real and the situations after all this time are not so improbable to make it seem like the writers are coming in an empty bag trying to keep the show going for another season. It's one of the few shows I watch without the remote control in my hand for quick change.
