At first, I sincerely thought it would be a cheesy movie. But after seeing this, I was quite surprised. Amanda Bynes was convincingly funny along with the support cast (especially that character played by Snatch's "Bullet tooth Tony." What a contrasting role between these two films!). Now, I can not tell if an actor is good or not, but her act, in particular, was completely enjoyable. Even though the plot has turned into a (though very funny) love triangle midway through the movie, I feel like this should not discount, what I think, the movie really is: just fun. So if you come across this, whether by DVD or theater, I'm confident you'll like it.
