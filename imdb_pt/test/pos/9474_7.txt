Five years after joining James Cagney in "The Public Enemy," Mae Clarke makes another appearance, this time as his bride with Cagney's character on the other side of the law. It seems she was calling more pictures in her relationship as well, trying to make Johnny Cave a little more practical with her money and her career. You had to find out that they would come back after she gave him the boot for challenging his crooked boss; these things have a way of exercising in photos. <br /> <br /> I got kicked off watching Cagney on this one. I usually do, and here it seemed that he could have done the characteristic shoulder motion test he used for a good effect on "Angels With Dirty Faces," playing Rocky Sullivan. It was soon after that he drove Cavanaugh (Robert Gleckler) out of his office during the first attempt to bribe the new Weights and Measures chief. He turns to the camera and crouches as if he's completely satisfied with his response to the cheater - pretty cool. <br /> <br /> I understand that this was not one of Cagney's Warner movies, but it may well have been. Warner often took the cause of the common man, and the exposure of dishonest merchants and the politicians who protected them would be on the right track. You also have those great New York street scenes, depicting cars and stores of the time, with homemade signs, pricing the flour at eighteen cents a pound. Hey, how about the furniture store selling the living room for eighty-nine dollars, you can get a single chair for that price today. <br /> <br /> The best part of the photo may be that meat counter. scene when Cagney, James Burke (Aloysius) and the butchers play with a chicken underweight. One of the lightest moments in the movie, but you have an idea of ​​how tense people are when they are caught. The same goes for the truck driver who is pressured by Johnny to sign an accurate delivery; he just was not used to it. <br /> <br /> All in all, good fun at the more typical Cagney gangster presence, even if it does not conform to the standard of your films. It's fairly easy to get as one of the few public domain Cagney images out there, and often found on relatively inexpensive compilations.
