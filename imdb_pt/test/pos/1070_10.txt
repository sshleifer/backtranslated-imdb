This Christmas present arrived courtesy of TCM. We've never seen the movie, despite having seen most of Barbara Stanwyck's films. This comedy made us laugh so much that sometimes we had to hold back to hear the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that must be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, Christmas. It would certainly raise your spirits by simply letting go. The film would be a perfect gift in the form of a DVD or a VHS tape. <br /> <br /> "Christmas in Connecticut" was directed with great panache by Peter Godfrey, based on a story by Aileen Hamilton. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the movie is the happy pairing of two of the most popular stars of the time: Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan. Barbara Stanwyck has always played women with strong intentions, obviously this was a change of pace for her. In this film, as well as "Lady Eve", Stanwyck shows a way of comedy. She and Mr. Morgan, who have participated in several musical comedies, make a winning combination. <br /> <br /> There are no weak performances in the movie. Sydney Greenstreet, a notorious actor for playing 'heavy', is a delight to watch as the rich and fat Alexander Yardley, the man who possessed a media empire and who knew him well when he saw him. Reginald Gardiner, a talented English actor, adds brilliance to the stellar cast behind the two directors. <br /> <br /> S. Z. Sakall, is another source of continuous joy; he plays the Hungarian chef Felix, who has difficulty with his own version of the English language. In addition, Una O'Connor makes a perfect Norah, the housekeeper at the perfect Sloan farm in Connecticut. <br /> <br /> When reading other comments in this forum, it is sad to know that glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated. by some people. After all, color was not much used in the 1940s, and most classic films have to be seen in their original format because what would be done to "color them"? <br /> <br /> This movie should be a requirement for anyone who wants to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun at Christmas time because total joy is guaranteed. Watch with an open mind and heart and maybe you'd like to see "Christmas in Connecticut" every year.
