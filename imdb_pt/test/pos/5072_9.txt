Some movies are designed just to entertain you, others to make you laugh, or cry, or uplift, others like this, claim to provoke, make you think and make you angry. I was angry during this movie, not in the movie, but in the fact that it was true, that America, the free, makes torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good. The torture scenes in this movie were distressing, the indifference of the people was shattering, the film was convincing in its argument, and showed how wrong it is to torture people. Of course, that now makes me a "bloody liberal" stamp thrust on people by others who close their minds to the facts that this happens and should not. People who do not realize that, as the movie said, for every tortured person, you have ten or a hundred people getting up to perform acts of revenge. You have a growing cycle of violence. This movie did not make me hate America, although I can see how that could be done, but it made me hate the way America reacted in its post-September 11 world. There is a significant quote in the film, shortly after we learn that 19 people have died and seventy-five have been injured in the bomb scene, the quote is "an American is dead" - that makes a difference. You can not kill an American, America can kill thousands, but you can not kill a single American, or they will do whatever it takes, including torture to enact justice. This is the American way apparently. Call me liberal, call me naive (although I think people who think torture is good, naive) call me a delusion, call me whatever you want, but this movie is a shining example of what's wrong in the States United and in the West today. I would like this film to be screened for every student in the school, at the very least. This movie will stay with me for a long time, part of me would like to be able to forget because I wanted this kind of thing never to happen, but I know that yes, the other part of me wishes I never forget because we need to remember, make sure of these shameful events to prevent them from happening again. Whatever happens to me, this movie will be with me for a long time, and I'll be telling everyone I know to watch it, not to be entertained, but to be provoked, because sometimes we all need to be provoked.
