In addition to the low budget, there never seems to be more than 50 Germans in one scene at a time, plus the same two tracks, this movie is first class. Everything is right. That is the point, I think, of the uniforms for horror and disillusionment. All are as gray as the gray field uniforms. Gray men with life drained from them. Forget us made trash like Blackhawk and Ryan. This is one of the best war films of all time. Only Cross of Iron beats this out of tension and history. Please could we have a good non-dubbed German language with the english subtitles version in the UK? Without having to pay ridiculous import fees from Europe. Most other DVDs are multilingual. Why not this one?
