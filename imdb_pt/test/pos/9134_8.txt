Although it is not the masterpiece that "Le Samourai" was (I have already accepted that Jean-Pierre Melville has never been able to overcome this classic), I think "Le Cercle Rouge" is much better than "Bob le flambeur". I felt that "Bob le flambeur" was an above average and influential b movie, but still a movie b. "Le Cercle Rouge" proves that, as a filmmaker, Melville improved as he continued. John Woo is a big fan of Melville, although his cinematic style is different. While Woo uses fast-motion for shootings and an operatic feel of violence, Melville has a minimalist style that fits in well with him. He was not interested in creating fast-paced action movies, but more thrillers of meditative crime. In that department, he was one of the best. <br /> <br /> "Le Samourai" is still his best work, mainly because he has more character development than that, but on a technical level they are probably the same. In addition, while "Le Samourai" had a great leadership performance, this has four. Alain Delon is once again an ultra-legal gangster on the prowl - the silence of this man is fascinating. Bourvil is superb as the police inspector in the case of the assault and escaped with. He steals all the scenes in which he is, and proves that he was a talented dramatic actor (in France he is best known as a slapstick comedian in Buster Keaton mode). Yves Montand is also great as the unstable and paranoid weapons specialist. Gian Maria Volont√® (a westerner) is overshadowed by her three colleagues, but still does a proper job. <br /> <br /> Once again, Melville's direction is superb. Taking the same influence as the American crime thrillers and the new French wave, man always seems to know the best planes and angles to choose from. This is slower than most tricks, but really worth it until the end. "Le Cercle Rouge" is a bit less than an absolute classic, but it's still one of the best assault films ever made. Tarantino must have seen this before making Reservoir Dogs. (8/10)
