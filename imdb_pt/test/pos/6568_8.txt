It is quite true that this film defies convention by not revealing the plot to the viewer. While some may have a problem in having to find out for themselves, I hug "Uzumaki" for their irreverence. There is a PLOT, it's just that it may not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer. This is a film that invites to numerous interpretations, as all great art does - however, this film is also a lot of fun, making it a rare cinematic experience. It is both provocative and fun.
