Jamie Foxx did an incredible job playing Ray Charles. I loved this movie because every once in a while there would be a flashback scene and then the current movie. When Ray Charles was small, he was blind and his mother did not love him. She was a strong woman who did not treat him differently because he was blind. She made him do things on his own and this really drove him to become a great musician later in life. His mother also sent him to school, too. Then, when Ray Charles became a man, he could stand up and take care of himself, but there was a drop in narcotics, sex, and betrayal. When I'm down with something I can think of in this movie and it will inspire me.
