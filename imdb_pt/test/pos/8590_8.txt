The story of how the (communist) leader who liberated the Congo from Belgian imperialism was wiped out by the Western powers at the hands of Mobutu. A story of struggle and injustice, of hope and search for freedom. The story may be that of any African country. A very moving film, with images full of symbolism and beauty. If you only have to see a foreign movie this year, check this out.
