When I was younger, this movie always aired Friday night in the summer on Channel 40 (this was in the years before Fox was a network and took over programming). I always waited for this. I would go shopping with my parents, then sit down with my dinner on Swanson TV and a Lady Lee Cola (the only time in a week when I was allowed to drink glue and enjoy.) Of course, the script is predictably in the late 1970s Little Darlings), but it's a fun movie, and I loved Rudy and Tripper, Bill Murray lives with little effort in the movie, but he's charming, you have to love Spaz and the Pre-Revenge of the Nerds. pretty much the same character he played in "My Bodyguard," but he does it so well.
