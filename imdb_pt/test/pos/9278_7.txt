I was really looking forward to watching this documentary on what I consider some of the most fun movies ever made. Growing up in Los Angeles during the 1960s, many of these old black and white films were shown at local stations. I even remember a Friday night show called "Strange Tales of Science Fiction," which featured a different Sci Fi movie every week. This documentary, however, has spent far too much time with the opinions of the four famous filmmakers and how they felt about the classic films of that genre and how they used them as inspiration in their filming. <br /> <br /> That's not what I was hoping for in this documentary. It really could have been a comprehensive review of the decade, rather than a brief highlight of the best-known films of the time. Anyone who has studied or been interested in these films is quite familiar with the highlights like War of the Worlds, Forbidden Planet, The Thing, The Day the Earth Stood Still, etc. I'd like to see a few snippets of lesser-known movies and maybe some interviews with people involved in the production of these films. I would have to agree that the documentary was very focused on Spielberg's views and was a commercial type for his new release of War of the Worlds.
