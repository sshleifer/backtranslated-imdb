Biodoc about the enigmatic singer / songwriter who, according to reports of friends, has spent the last 15 years of his life relatively short, apparently on a mission of self-destruction. He died at age 52, being overweight and dissipated from heart disease, after prolonged violence from alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and cocaine, a raucous party and blatant misuse of his vocal instrument (he confided to a friend that he shouted his lyrics in a performance with such force that the spattered blood was left in the microphone). <br /> <br /> All this despite the fact that he was: (1) widely regarded as having perhaps the most talented pop song talent of his generation; (2) success after years of effort in terms of industry acclaim - a Grammy, an Oscar, a decent recording contract with a top label and at least two stellar albums - 'Nilsson Schmilsson' (original) and 'A Little Bit' Schmilsson's touch at night '(standards); and (3) very happily married (for the third time) with a lovely young family that he seemed to love. <br /> <br /> The film's strengths begin with the completeness of its narrative about Nilsson's life, including the good use of Nilsson's still-filmed footage and stills; editors do a particularly good job of bringing movement to the stills. We learned about his close ties to John Lennon and later to Ringo Starr (Lennon often said that Nilsson was his favorite American musician). Even more impressive are the talking heads, often the weaker aspect of a documentary. Here we have people like Perry Botkin Jr., Ray Cooper, Mickey Dolenz, Terry Gilliam, Mark Hudson, Eric Idle, Rick Jarrard, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks, Jimmy Webb and Robin Williams, all telling incredible stories about Nilsson ?? many extremely funny, others deeply pathetic - and all conveying their deep affection for him. Equally informative and on the move are interview segments with Nilsson wives? Annie and Una, their son Zach and their cousin Doug Hoefer. Best set of heads I remember in a biodoc. <br /> <br /> The most blatant deficiency of the film is to drive away the music of Nilsson. Even the performance of his biggest hit, "Without You," is stopped after about 8 bars. Arrrrgh !! There is no excuse for this, not considering that the movie has two full hours as it is. We missed a few shots in the head and we could have heard at least this song, and maybe another one or two, like "One," or the Oscar for "Everybody's Talking." The filmmakers are simply too focused on Nilsson's psychological plumbing. mystical and not attentive enough for his music.
