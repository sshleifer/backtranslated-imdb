This is yet another gem of Daniele Thompson's pen - in fact, that same year (1999) she wrote and directed La Buche, the first of three writer / director credits so far. Belle Maman is first of all "French," whatever that means, of course, different things to different people. The premise is simple: on the altar where he marries Mathilde Seigner, the fiance Vincent Lindon first sees his mother, Catherine Deneuve, and suffers what the French call a stroke of mercy that we know as love at first sight. . In theory, the story is either 1) more to the right and then assuming he called the marriage or else 2) just the beginning as he goes through the marriage and therefore lives a lie until it is solved in a way or another. Thompson turns toward # 2, but not without reaching us the odd subplot along the way like, for example, the lesbian lineage of Deneuve, Renaud (in real life, if anyone cares, Renaud maintains a long-lasting relationship with Stephane Audran , who co-star here) and plays in a brilliant set-piece in a luxurious Men's Room at the wedding reception, which takes the form of hilarious music and dance. The consummate writer that she is Thompson also cultivates drama comedy as the brilliant climactic scene in which Vincent finally quotes his feelings for Deneuve at a family reunion while simultaneously destroying the base. This is one to savor. Again and again.
