I connected to imdb to tell you what a lovely Love Love movie is and I am totally confused. It seems to me that someone is confusing their titles. "Baby demon plastic" what? This was not the life of love. A bit luvy dovey for my taste, but a great, funny and original movie. I particularly liked the ending that did not fall into the usual clich√© that all Hollywood romantic movies spoil and burn. Nine in ten.
