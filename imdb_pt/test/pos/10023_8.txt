Felix is ​​watching an actor rehearse his lines: "A ham, a ham! My kingdom for a ham sandwich !!!" The dramatic face that tells Felix that he "will have to sacrifice my art and go to the movies". He is in tears. Felix just looks at him like he's crazy, and shrugs. The old man tells Felix to "go ahead" and find money to finance a trip to Hollywood.

Felix comes up with a plan to rescue him and the man promises the cat $ 500 if it works. <br /> <br /> Well, but the man wants to go alone and leave Felix at home. In a scandalous scene, Felix turns into a folder and that's how he gets to Hollywood, turning back to the cat when they get there. <br /> <br /> We then witnessed Felix's attempts to get into show business. Your hearing scenes are very funny, especially with your imitation of Charlie Chaplin. In addition, there are caricatures of some famous stars and silent film executives. All in all, a little bit of material is in this 9.5 minute cartoon. It's amazing how much more you get in an extra 2.5 minutes, assuming most of the animated short films are seven minutes long. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there was a lot of laughter here and more funny things you could see just in a cartoon, as Felix has a sword duel with giant mosquitoes! Crazy things.
