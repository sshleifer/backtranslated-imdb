I was surfing on IMDb one day when I stumbled on "The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird". Realizing how obscure I was, I decided to look for him. Thanks to Digiview, it did not take long, so I bought it for a dollar, and when I got home, I watched, although I must say, I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> The paintings in a king's apartment, a shepherdess, a chimney sweeper, and a self-portrait of the king (who is as selfish and sadistic as the king himself) come to life one night while the king sleeps . The shepherdess and the chimney escape, while the painting of the king calls the police to capture the couple. Fortunately for the couple, Mr. Wonderbird comes to help them, often mocking the police and the king. <br /> <br /> The back side of the DVD describes this film as "a surreal visual delight and an underrated entry into the history of classic animation." I could not agree more with this, considering that many of the funds seem quite bizarre, and many of the characters are strange, which include the depressed citizens of an underground city and hungry lions who are calmed by the music of a blind man (who looks like Andy Warhol ), not to mention that Mr. Wonderbird himself is somewhat eccentric. The film is very creative and fun to watch, and its only flaw is that it can be slow. But overall, this movie was really good, and it comes recommended by you truly. <br /> <br /> Note: B + (Awesome)
