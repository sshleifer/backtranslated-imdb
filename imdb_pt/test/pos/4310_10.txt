A unique blend of musical, film-noir and comedy - with some sex scenes thrown in for good measure. The only other film I can think of with a rather wild and crazy mix of themes and clichés is the French film Billy Ze Kick - but this has a more surreal and quirky approach. <br /> <br /> Not that this movie would not be surreal or quirky. Humor is sometimes quite subtle, sometimes blatantly in your face - and often crossing the border to offensiveness. To give an example: In post-coitus chat with a prostitute, our hero Max Müller encourages her to reveal who was responsible for a recent murder, using the words "Schiess!". Literally, this phrase means "Shoot!" in German, and that's exactly what a hidden killer does in response. In other words - this beautiful lady was sacrificed by a pun. <br /> <br /> Müllers Büro is also one of the rare examples of movies with funny sex scenes. Larry's novel is accompanied by the song "Ich will mehr" - while the music sustains perfectly the action, the meaning of his words changes sometimes, insinuating at the end Larry's inability to provide any additional service. The main love scene of the film between Max Müller and Bettina Kant lacks so much subtlety - this is a jaw-dropping thing, especially when Bettina's singing slowly transgresses in groans, of course, all in the rhythm of the song. <br /> <br /> Must do, unless you are one of easily offended.
