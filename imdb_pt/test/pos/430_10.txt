To keep it as simple as possible. This is a really good show. This is well written and has a fantastic cast. It is not loaded with blood and courage. And it revolves around a dishonored police officer and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his ex-partner (Andre Braugher), his childhood friend, now a priest (George Dzunzda), and finally the person who happens to enter on your hack this episode. Will you probably find something like this happening in your city? Is this still a good story? And it's good to see a man portrayed as a good father, despite his faults. Watch more than one (2-3) and you'll see why so many of us are involved in this program. And thanks David Morse for making this character so interesting. Another good job!
