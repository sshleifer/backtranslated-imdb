People who compare this movie with big blockbusters like The Lord of the Rings or Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with how the movie ended. Although there is no major special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful combination of two old folktales here. The acting talent, although not a list, is still great, and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with a first-rate cast. My favorite of this film is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen was quite exciting, assisted enormously by a terrific wardrobe and makeup. It injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season corrupted by the evil magic of the devil. Fonda aside, the performance was not what we expected from Hollywood, which I think is a good thing, since Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to train his talent to play roles and thus they have become obsolete and confident. CGI and other special effects to get us away from the actors who use the same tricks on us. Instead, it shows new ideas and real thoughts on the part of the actors about how they can find new variations on the old themes of love and danger.
