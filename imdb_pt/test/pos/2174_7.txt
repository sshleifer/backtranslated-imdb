First, let me confess that I have not read this particular novel by Balzac, so perhaps I am directing my concerts unfairly to the director and editor. Yet my experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist, not an obscurantist. This is certainly a worthwhile movie, but it gets very messy in the end. It was the colonel a fraud, used by the lawyer for his own purposes (or for those other than himself); or the colonel was not a fraud, but used as said by the lawyer; Or did the lawyer really try to serve the honest colonel? The director and / or editor seem to me to have deliberately obscured these issues, which does not seem to be Balzac, the realist. At the same time, the film does an excellent job of outlining the characters, if not their motives, and the cast and production are excellent. This opening battlefield scene is doomed to haunt someone's dreams. Still, it is a marvelous tendency among contemporary filmmakers to favor ambiguity above all else. The problems and motives of all these characters were not complicated enough for Yves Angelo?
