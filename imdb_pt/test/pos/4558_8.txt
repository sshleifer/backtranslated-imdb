I saw this movie knowing absolutely nothing about him and his stars, Chris Farley and David Spade, and I have to say that this movie is a classic comic. It's so stupid sometimes that can only be hilarious. Farley is brilliant as the clumsy idiot who picks up the road with his father's right arm (the equally excellent Spade) to find funds to save the families auto parts business. Relax, put your brain on autopilot and enjoy the fun. A great supporting cast features such favorite films as Brian Dennehy (Cocoon), Rob Lowe (World of Wayne) and Bo Derek ("10"). Highly recommended for a good laugh.
