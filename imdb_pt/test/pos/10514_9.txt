I've never been so impressed with the Night Gallery, but this episode stands out. A TV network executive does a test with a strange act - a young, geeky boy who makes prognoses. The executive rejects the whole thing as a waste of time until both forecasts become true the next morning. <br /> <br /> What first appeared to be a hall act becomes a success when the boy's predictions are consistently accurate. So one day he refuses to do the show. Facing the imminent time of the show, everyone is at an end, threatening him with legal action if he does not fulfill his contract and make his daily predictions. The young boy yields and predicts an apparently utopian tomorrow. After the show, the confused executive asks for an explanation, only to find out why the whole truth is too terrifying to be revealed.
