I remember seeing this in the early 90's on UK TV and I was hooked. The international scope of production is breathtaking and watching the characters unfold in the five hours is magnificent. The scenes set in Pakistan and Afghanistan are of particular interest, and as a spectator you have a real sense of an overview of the culture and vibrancy of these countries during the later stages of the Cold War. The characters of Fazal and Helen develop very well throughout the series and rival modern shows like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in this area. In the UK, VHS comes out for about £ 6 and the DVD costs about £ 10 - a quality bargain. I thought Soderbergh's version was great too - but it clearly owes this masterpiece a huge debt.
