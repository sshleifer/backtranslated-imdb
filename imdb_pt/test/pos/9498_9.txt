This is apparently the first film with Gloria Swanson - the movie that made her a breakout star. While she was good in the movie, I can not see how that particular performance was so remarkable at the time - but still, it was a very good movie. <br /> Gloria plays the wife of a movie. A rich idiot who continually takes it for granted. He cares little about his appearance, eats onions and forgets his birthday! And at the same time, a Lothario enters their lives and begins to pay close attention to Gloria and her malicious husband neither realizes nor gives him any reason not to betray him. Ultimately, she divorces her husband and marries the soft-spoken Romeo. However, while the film might have been just an exaggerated melodrama (they were very common at the time), it takes some interesting twists and turns and it's an imaginative and entertaining film. Although not the biggest silent film I've ever seen, it's a highlight and deserves to be remembered. <br /> <br /> By the way, the DVD release of Image Entertainment is surprisingly good - with a good impression and music. This has not always been true in other Image releases (especially as they dealt with Chaplin's releases).
