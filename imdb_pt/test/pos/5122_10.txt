Logan Lerman and Dean Collins III of Jack & Bobby Fame give a touch of familiarity as friends, though not as close as Jack and Bobby may be, but the expressions of young students who take a stand for a good cause are very Logan Lerman may be seemingly typed in roles to be "different," as seen from here, as seen in this, as well as in Jack and Bobby. The movie also opens with a very nice melody coined as a lost 45 "And I'm wondering where the lions are?" A song that I always listened to in the speaker @ my old job at ChristmasTreeShops and I played it on my local radio program Lost45s presented by Barry Scott, but the last time I suggested this with this film as dedication, but the dedication was left out. Environmentalist demonstration is well expressed in this film also for the protection of terrestrial owls as seen in this film as well. What a pio this movie too is. Hoot, Sogive a joke in the tradition of the Wo odsey Owl Commercials of the 70s as well. In fact, Stephen "Steve" G.Baer a.k.a. "Ste".
