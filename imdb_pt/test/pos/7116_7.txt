House of Dracula works from the same basic premise of the House of Frankenstein of the previous year; that is, the three most famous monsters of Universal; Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and The Wolf Man are appearing together in the film. Of course, the film is pretty confusing, but the fact that the three monsters are there is usually enough to make sure the sixty-seven minutes of the movie do not get boring. It is obvious that the idea of ​​making another mash of monsters came to the mind of the writer before a real plot, since the thread that is given to us is not exactly without holes. The plot sees Count Dracula arriving at Dr. Edelman's house asking for a cure for his vampirism. So, what can only be described as a coincidence, sees Lawrence Talbot, also known as The Wolf Man, asking for the cure for his affliction! It turns out that Dracula is on the lookout for Edelman's daughter, but Talbot is really serious. When it turns out that he can not be stopped from turning into a wolf, The Wolf Man is thrown into the sea ... where he ends up finding Frankenstein's monster. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is not as good as the previous Frankenstein House. The 1944 film joined his plot better than this entry in the series, since the plot here does not give equal time to each Universal monster. Dracula's plot is the biggest in the beginning, but soon fails only to resurface in the end. The Wolf Man is the star of the show, but his story never develops, and is essentially just another version of the storyline he always meets. The Frankenstein monster is given the coldest hand, as it appears in the film only as a belated reflection. and an obvious excuse to make sure all three monsters appear in the movie. The doctor's story that connects all three together is the most interesting, but that's a little disappointing since it's not the reason people will see this movie. The acting is good enough, with John Carradine showing his sinister side and Lon Chaney Jr, again, making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy. Glenn Strange has nothing to do, and Onslow Stevens proves the true highlight as Dr. Edelman. Overall, this movie will not do much for anyone who is not a fan of Universal Terror; but as the silly monsters go, House of Dracula is worth being seen.
