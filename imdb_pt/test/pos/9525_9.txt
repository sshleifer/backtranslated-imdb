The Railway Children, at least this 1970 film version, written and directed by that longtime British actor, Lionel Jeffries, is an absolute classic. It tells a childhood story with great simplicity and charm; sentimentality is silenced; the evocation of childhood adventures is enveloping; and Jeffries brings cleverness and style to his production. <br /> <br /> The Waterbury family is leading an idyllic life in Edwardian London. The father is prosperous, the mother is beautiful and loving, the children are well-educated and affectionate, their home is warm and welcoming. Then one night, during the Christmas holidays, two men appear at the door, talk in a low voice with their father and then take him away. At one point the lives of Mrs. Waterbury (Dinah Sheridan) and Bobbie, 14 (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis, 12 (Sally Thomsett) and young Peter (Gary Warren), were changed. Only your strength and good spirits will cross you. Now walking into poverty, Mrs. Waterbury takes her children to live in an old brick house in the countryside, near a railway line, not far from a small village with a train station. Children discover the trail and regularly sit on a small hill to wave to the passengers as the train passes by. One day, an old gentleman, going to his business in the city, looks up from the newspaper and finds himself beckoning back. It does not take long for him to play an important role in history. <br /> <br /> Over time, Mrs. Waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to her children. She starts writing stories to make money. It teaches them the lessons and provides a home of warmth and safety for them. The story, however, is about these three children, especially Bobbie. At age 14, she is old enough to want to share her mother's concerns, but young enough to enjoy the adventures she has with her sister and brother. They find a poor man at the police station who does not speak English. They discover that he is a Russian refugee who does not know where his wife and son are. They insist that he should go home with them, and his mother receives him. In a short time, the children wrote a large poster for the old gentlemen on the train asking for their help. They help a young man participate in an obstacle course that breaks his leg in a train tunnel. Soon, he is at home recovering. They decide to have a birthday party for the stationmaster, a man with few friends and several children who is a defender of his dignity. It does not take long for children to help you realize the difference between friendship and charity. In other words, the three children find all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures, and they can be instrumental in seeing that all problems have happy endings. <br /> <br /> But what about your own problems? Bobbie finally learns from his mother that his father was taken because he was accused of treason, of giving state secrets to the Russians. Will Bobbie be able to find a way to help? Will the old gentleman be more than just an old gentleman on a passing train? Your father's case will be reopened? Will there be a happy ending? <br /> <br /> Jenny Agutter was nearly 18 when she filmed her part; she plays 14-year-old Bobbie with great naturalness and charm. As important as the other players, especially Dinah Sheridan as the mother, Agutter is the heart of the story. For me, it's the talent of Jenny Agutter and the style and restraint of Lionel Jeffries that make this movie so memorable. The problems of history bring no serious doubt, but they will be solved. And Jeffries does not just give us a film that is skillfully adapted and directed, it adds touches that are barely noticed, but that enchant us. This may include only a fraction of a second of a frozen frame when two people talk; or a slow close-up of a small yellow wildflower on the grass outside Bobbie's house, then a slow retreat from a yellow-oil lamp turned inward; or the perception of a delightful indoor shot or a view of the verdant landscape or a view of the train station from a hill ... all suddenly resemble those lovely drawings of Edward of the color of a perfect past time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this gentle story can not compete for the time children need today to perfect their abilities to scare off the Nintendo monsters. I'm pretty sure this would never catch the attention of most of their parents, especially those who were raised with Batman and Leone. Still, it's a perfectly organized movie and should not be overlooked. As an aside, 19 years later, the story was retold as a television show. This time, Jenny Agutter played her mother.
