To my eternal shame, I've never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire films, "Nosferatu." However, if they show half the creativity and sheer joy of this Buster Keaton effort, then I'll probably try to watch a few more. This is really funny as well as being an awesome introduction to the world of silent comedies. The premise, as it is, centers around a pitiful case of misidentified identity, as Keaton is mistaken for the renowned villain Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair). This leads to a series of chases and fugues, as authorities increasingly approach desperate Keaton. <br /> <br /> You are amazed and entertained in equal measures. Keaton is a natural comedian, but also a talented stuntman, judging by the way he jumps and leaps like Jackie Chan in speed. And the comedy is also of an exceptionally high standard - my Better Half had to interrupt a phone call to her parents because she was laughing too much! If you've never experienced a silent film like this, then it's nothing short of a revelation to watch - it certainly wiped out any ideas I may have about silent films. Of course, it's not as polished as the movies of today - the acting is horrible, truth be told, but that does not matter, because you're enjoying the movie anyway. Anyone with a passing interest in movies in general should make the effort to watch this because they will not be disappointed. Bright!
