I really liked this movie. He introduces John Wayne in his first performance. Even so, you may say that Wayne has a real presence, although he did not really mature in the icon by which he is known to Stagecoach, nine years later, in 1939. It is about settlers from all over the country going to the New West to colonize it. The character of Wayne Breck Coleman joins, but for his own personal reasons. Most of the main actors were stage actors and had never done a movie before, which makes the film even more incredible. They have managed to create compelling and distinctive characters, and there is a rather eccentric mix here. Cimarron would come out a year later and would have a very similar story, though I did not like it as much as this movie. For me, The Big Trail is a strong 8/10.
