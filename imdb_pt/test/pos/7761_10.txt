Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a very well-liked anime on almost every page of reviews you'll find on the web. So, I really wanted to know why, and I was nothing but disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you can go through the first very bizarre (but rather funny) episode, you will find yourself in a very fun and very entertaining way. strange world. A very well designed world, perfectly animated, that is. <br /> <br /> I can not tell much of the story without spoiling it, so I'll just say it's a high school comedy ... and yet it is not. I can not really say what it is, really. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'm a big fan of anime, and I have about 50 complete series, and I'm not joking when I say that. , although I have not finished watching Haruhi Suzumiya, is actually in a very high position in my personal collection. I fell in love at first sight with this, and I assure you that at least you will not be indifferent to its irresistible charm. Trust me, I do not turn around giving 10 for every single thing I watch.
