Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this war comedy about a guest sailor spending Christmas with a family of popular magazine writers at her farm in Connecticut. The problem is that she has no husband, baby or farm, as she writes in her column, and she does not even know how to cook; her wonderful recipes were provided to her by her good friend "Uncle" Felix, owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York. <br /> <br /> Things get even more complicated when your strict publisher invites you over for Christmas. A scheme is planned hastily, with its stuffy boyfriend providing a real farm in Connecticut, neighbors providing a borrowed baby and a planned quick wedding when the publisher is not looking. But when the handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve, romantic complications happen, as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for the cool guy in the Navy and vice versa. <br /> <br /> This is a charming, hot movie that cleverly balances mood with feeling and is a wonderful showcase for Barbara Stanwyck to show off her handsome comedic talent, aided by such wonderful character actors as Sydney Greenstreet, Una O'Connor , SZSakall and many others. A Christmas night dancing in the town hall is a delight to see, and Stanwyck's unexpectedly sweet and feminine side is a wonderful surprise to viewers who have seen her mainly as harsh and malicious women in femme fatale roles. Truly a wonderful movie that stood the test of time.
