At first, with the remote and careful location of the metal sound, I thought of the opening scene of "Once upon a Time in the West." When he arrives in town, he begins to look like "Kitchen Stories," or "Waterproof Clouds," even "Grimm." <br /> <br /> So it turns out that this is more like "Joe Versus the Volcano" in the theme (not style). And the movie runs from the beginning to the end of the same low-key style. Letting it watch, absorb the greyish-blue steel tone of the suites, dresses, wall color, furniture, sheets, mirrors, cars, music, background sounds and even the expression of people. Then, near the end, there is a scene of a completely different tone - warm orange-yellow with soft music and splashes, children and laughter. <br /> <br /> But maybe the remark is too long for me, I'd much rather see the alternate side or what happens to the character after the final shot. Still well done.
