Sherlock Holmes films from the classic classical era tend to have quality. This range goes from very good to above average, with none of its results being abysmal, or incredibly bright. Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon fit perfectly into the quality of the middle ground, and as always, it's a nice ride that fans of the show, like me, are going to enjoy a lot. This film sees Holmes in the middle of a WWII conspiracy by the evil Nazis to steal the invention of a Swiss scientist who can become a key player on the battlefield. Sherlock Holmes films of World War II do not tend to be as good as those of The Scarlet Claw, where Holmes is conducting private investigations, as they are often haunted by a lot of propaganda or a plot that has more to do with the film. war than the mystery. This, however, practically gets away from both and by putting focus on Holmes and his investigation, the film works much better. Maybe Universal saw what knocked out the previous Voice of Terror and shifted focus because of it. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone once again puts on an excellent performance as the detective and while Nigel Bruce does not appear as very normal, it is good to see him when he does. The two do not spend much time together, which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things about Holmes films; but this allows more time for Holmes to show off various costumes, which is always a lot of fun. Dennis Hoey's Lestrade is definitely my favorite of the minor characters, and while he's not as funny as usual; his facial expressions are great, and his presence helps to emphasize how great Holmes is. His scene with Watson in a car after drops of paint on the road is my favorite moment of the movie. It is good to see the nemesis of Holmes, Professor Moriarty return, even though it appears that he has just been thrown into his hell. Lionel Atwill's performance is not as good as George Zucco's in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, since he never really convinces that he is indeed a brilliant mind; but seeing him have fun with the protagonist is fun and it's good to see him in the movie to make up for the WWII themes that are never as interesting as Holmes himself. The film begins as more of a thriller than a mystery movie; but once that happens, it is difficult to overthrow and this is a more than solid entry into Universal's work.
