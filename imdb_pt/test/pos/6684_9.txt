I was really surprised when I first saw this film directed by Iain Softley; differs in many ways from Hollywood mass production. The plot itself is simple - Kevin Spacey plays a mental patient Prot who claims to be from the planet K-pax who came to Earth by a ray of light, while Dr. Powell played by Jeff Bridges tries to help him solve his delusions. First of all, I must admit that the cast is perfectly chosen: Kevin Spacey is really brilliant at portraying the intriguing character of Prot, always walking the thin line of convincing us that it is real and then making us wonder if he is delusional or not ... Some of the gem scenes include one in which Prot innocently eats the whole banana (even the peal) while in session with Dr. Powell; or the observatory scene where he reliably shows his knowledge of the K-Pax system to astonished astronomers ... Jeff Bridges, on the other hand, is the subtle and rational side of this film, and he delivers it perfectly. There's an entirely different cast of excellent actors (such as Saul Williams's compelling performance as Ernie) that make this movie really work. <br /> <br /> K-pax has everything, elements of comedy; Sci-Fi, even psychological thriller (about Prot's identity), but more importantly, can be categorized as a comforting drama. The main premise of the film is quite intricate, but the director never lets loose, it always keeps him compelling and yet in two ways interpretable. Camera and photography have an almost crucial part here, continuing the main idea of ​​light travel, there is a lot of focus on the game of shadows, lighting - one of the memorable scenes is where Dr. Powell holds a crystal figure in his office. refracts light in a beautiful way, while all the while he suspects that the idea may be true? <br /> <br /> Subtle and slow, intriguing and pleasurable, K-pax is a real gem to watch, one of the best movies that may not be for everyone, but those who see it can fall in love with it.
