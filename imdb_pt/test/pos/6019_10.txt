This is easily one of my favorite musicals of all time. Bette Midler comes as close to the real magic on the screen as anyone else has Gypsy Lee's tempestuous, corpulent, courageous and very scary mother. She evokes a sense of despair that is sometimes comical and tragic but always genuine it's beautiful. Such charm and courage she is indeed a pioneer woman without a border. This border is discovered for children. Who, in turn, must forge his own in a world governed by his domineering mother. <br /> <br /> This particular version is, as I understand it, in its entirety, including the brilliant choreography of Jerome Robbins as well as the original. directions.
