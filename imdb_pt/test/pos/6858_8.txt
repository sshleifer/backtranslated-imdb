This is a great German slasher, who is often quite suspenseful and creative, with a fun story and solid performances. All the characters are cool, and Benno Fürmann is great as the psychotic killer, in addition to Franka Potente give a fantastic performance as the main leadership. It took a while to get started, but it was never boring, and it also had good death scenes, plus the song was wonderfully creepy. I was lucky enough to get the subtitled version, instead of the dubbed version, and found that all the characters were very nice, as well as being very well made and written as well. It has some really good twists, and the effects are extremely well done, plus the end is great. The ending is especially full of suspense, and Franka Potente was the perfect choice in my opinion, plus I wish Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey (David) would not be killed so soon because he was a really cool character. Actually, there were some moments when I felt uncomfortable, but in a good way, and I must say that this film deserved all the praise, besides that although it has holes in the plot, it is not enough to make the movie difficult. This is a great German slasher, who is often quite suspenseful and creative, with a fun story and solid performances, I highly recommend this! The direction is great!. Stefan Ruzowitzky does a great job! I work here with excellent camera work, very good angles, great close-ups (see the opening scene for sex), doing a great job adding a scary atmosphere, and just keeping the movie at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> There is some blood and blood. We have corpses open, many scenes of very bloody surgery, many bloody stab wounds, people are dissected while they are still conscious, severed fingers, self-mutilation, evisceration, throat with bloody slit, many evil frozen corpses, a lot of blood and more The acting is very solid Franka Potente is fantastic as the main one, she was very friendly, remained cool under pressure, was vulnerable, easy on the eyes, and we are able to take care of her character, the only time she seemed to suffer, was when she had to gush some bad dialogues here and there, but that was not too often, she was wonderful! Benno Fürmann is excellent as the psychotic killer, he was simply relaxing, and beautifully OTT, he really gave me shivers, and was an effective killer!. Anna Loos played her role very well, like the clever whore, I dug her. Sebastian Blomberg was great here as Caspar, he was very nice, and had a mysterious character, his chemistry with Potente was also active, and there was a big twist involving him in the end. Holger Speckhahn was good as the idiot Phil and did his job well. Traugott Buhre is good as Prof. Grombek. Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey was great as David, he had a really cool character, and I wish he was not killed so soon. Rest of the cast do well. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend this great German slasher!. *** 1/2 of 5
