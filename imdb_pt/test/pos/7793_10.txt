The first time I watched it was when it was released (1994), and the last time I watched it was just before I wrote this review .. It still makes me laugh at my brain ... after all these years it does not disappoint me. Truly the smarter Bollywood comedy ever made. This is an Indian movie that deserves its place in the IMDb Top 250. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan in probably one of his best performances in comic roles. The thing that makes this a less classic time is its comical timing and wonderful editing ... The jokes are refreshing and not cheap .. This is a movie truly ahead of its time. If you have not seen it, go watch now !!!!!!!!!
