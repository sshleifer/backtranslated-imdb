This is one of the best and most grumpy Vampire Tales of all time! I really love this movie. The character is great, even the locals and the story. In fact, Picture is not a great budget production, but it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> OK, there are some flaws (especially the castle names and locations) in this movie, but such mistakes are typically and are almost all horror movies. <br /> <br /> The scenery fits perfectly in the story and is close to reality, I can say that it is honest, because I visit them once when I was in Romania during my vacations. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best part of the subspecies series.
