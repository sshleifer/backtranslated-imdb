This game is an action / adventure with combat. There are very long periods without combat, but other times, you need to get rid of various types of monsters. Monsters are not like anything you would see in real life, and they need to be eliminated to continue your mission. The whole game is a mission. You play Adam Randall whose father contacts him from beyond and asks him to come and save him. The game is from the mid 90's and has to be played in DOS. I used Dosbox and was able to play very well. The graphics are not as good as some games, even though the resolution is not high and some scenes seem pretty complicated, but others look more aggressive, but do not let that get you out of the game. The game is very imaginative, is long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear out of nowhere. Not for young people who probably would not be interested in any way, but over 13 or 14 may like this game. It's a combination of terror \ mystery \ action \ adventure \ combat. I thought it was a great game. Had to find it now. maybe Ebay. But remember a DOS game and you would not be able to play it on the fastest computers today. it would be difficult to play on fast computers unless you use Dosbox. Oh, and the acting is pretty good, too.
