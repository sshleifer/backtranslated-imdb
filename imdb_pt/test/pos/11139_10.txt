Good job! It was very exciting and had great acrobatics. A show that really rocked. It was a great job for everyone who worked on it; and especially the acting on the part of Bobbie Phillips. That would have been great on the big screen. I would like to see more of these movies of the week or maybe a weekly series. This was a great entertainment and glad we watched! By far the best of the three. Keep up the good work UPN and Bobbie Phillips. I'll be looking for the next one.
