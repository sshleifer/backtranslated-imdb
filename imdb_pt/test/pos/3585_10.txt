I think this short TV series was absolutely wonderful, and gave a deep and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries of the last decade. This definitely is worth the people's money! <br /> <br /> I also found the little bit about the abyss and deep waters the most fascinating and interesting part. It was amazing to discover that the Blue Planet team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life! <br /> <br /> In this documentary, Attemborough almost certainly has fulfilled its high reputation. <br /> <br /> This was a masterpiece and will always be considered as one of the best modern documentaries. <br /> <br /> Many congratulations to the Blue Planet team.
