Down Periscope is not a "Great Movie". But again, very few movies are. So if you're looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom, this is a "big movie" without the uppercase letters. No sharp sexism or graphic violence spoils this light comedy about a bunch of misfits who are assigned to an old submarine. They are ready to fail in their tasks, so that a general can get their extra star. They must face the entire US Navy with its nuclear submarines. But they are underdogs and this is a comedy so you can guess the outcome. But you cheer for those underdogs and this makes it a very fun movie. Watch and enjoy ******** (eight stars that is)
