This series has much to do with beautiful images of some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in training, it would be difficult to expect less than that. I had the impression that some scenes from the first episode were repeated in the latter, which of course is only a small complaint. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough is great as a narrator and the comments are informative, leaving enough space for the imagination, and well spaced, so that the viewers have plenty of time to reflect on the breathtaking images. If you have the opportunity, try not to watch a translated version of this series. <br /> <br /> A must stop for anyone interested in the complexities of our blue continents and easily the best documentary on this subject. seen.
