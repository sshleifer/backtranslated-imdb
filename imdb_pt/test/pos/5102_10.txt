I saw this movie when it first came out and did not know exactly what to expect. What followed with Overture was one of the most enjoyable shooting experiences I've ever had. An exuberant score of music and music by Briton Leslie Bricusse (by Dr. Doolittle & Wilie Wonka and the chocolate factory, as well as making his mark on the Broadway musical scene), and punctuated by the incomparable John Williams. There is not a bad song in the whole movie. In addition, some of the most exquisite cinematography, costumes and shooting locations I've seen in a movie. Not to mention the Oscar-nominated performance by Peter O'Toole, and the equally strong performance, in my opinion, by the wonderful Petula Clark. Now, since Peter is not the same caliber as a singer Petula is, he still manages to sell his music to the public, and that, after all, is about what it's all about. This is a faithful adaptation of James Hilton's excellent book, and deserves to be treasured for the next generations. I recommend this movie for the family view, although most men consider it a 'girl' movie. But if you like a great music movie then this movie is for you. But be warned that a Kleenex waiting box is as important as popcorn for your viewing pleasure.
