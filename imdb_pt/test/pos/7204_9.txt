I was fortunate enough to see this sequence before the original because I'm not sure I would have done my best to see if the opposite was true. I found "Mission Cléopâtre" better than its predecessor for different reasons, but the main one is this: it was almost word for word an adaptation of a book and not an amalgam as the first film. The physical similarity of some characters with his animated self was very funny, especially the thug (whose name is escaping me, but he is the other architect). I do not know how this movie played in English; my first language is French, so I did not have this problem ... I imagine some of the jokes were not so easy to translate. I've learned something for years, it's better to watch a movie with subtitles than with dubbing, maybe you do not understand what is said, but you will not lose the rhythm and I think it's important too. I would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves "Astérix et Obélix".
