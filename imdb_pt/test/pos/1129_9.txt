I watched two episodes so far, I really like that. Even though I'm no longer in college, I miss the wonderful college life. I'd like to spend a little more time socializing. I kind of identify myself as rusty. When I was running a fraternity, my big brother was not like Cappie, I wish I had a big brother like him. So if a show like this can really get people to identify with the characters then it's a great show. <br /> <br /> It is more realistic than an American pie with less explicit sexual jokes. Can we also call this a younger version of "desperate wives?" some of the writers must be the Greeks themselves, the story seems to reflect a little of the true fraternity and brotherhood of life. It was shot in high definition. And they actually filmed out instead of inside the studios. so the picture quality is very good. They could easily make this a good movie. Unlike a movie that can last only a few hours, I can have about 45 minutes of fun watching it for free on TV weekly. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent, the actors are of the right age, and they are new and fresh, so that makes them more real. This show is practically about everyone. There are Asian and black fraternity boys and sisterhood girls on the show as well. It's almost a bit shocking that they had a short story about two guys from the fraternity having had sex in the first episode, then trying to connect again in the second episode. I do not think I've seen anything like it on TV before. This show somehow reminded me of a teen-age TV show called "Young Americans," which was canceled early in 2001. In that show, a girl who dressed like a man kissed a guy, and this guy thought she was a male homosexual. Greek life can be fun, but at the same time, students have to study for exams, etc .; at a time when people actually have some free time in their lives, there is no fraternity fraternity for them to get together anymore. I do not know how long this show will last, sooner or later these people will have to "graduate" in college as well. Maybe they'll meet new actors for another 4 years of fun college life!
