GZSZ is Germany's longest daily soap and it's a cult! I started watching it from the first day and I was hooked from the beginning. Over the years, a lot has changed, the old characters like Heiko, Elke, Tina, Saskia etc. They left, and the new ones appeared like Marie, Kai, Cora or John. I have to say that I liked GZSZ more in the years 1995-2000 because today the show focuses a lot on the younger characters. My favorite character is Sonja Wiebe because she is the most intriguing person who has ever been in this soap and is also one of the most interesting characters on the show. Tina Bordihn was great as the first Sonja, but as Tokessa became the remake of Sonja, the character got even better.
