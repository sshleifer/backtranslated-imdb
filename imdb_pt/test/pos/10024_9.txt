Although I can not tell whether Larry Hama saw any of the old cartoons, I would think writing would say cartoons, file cards, and some of the comics would tell something. <br /> <br /> For fans of the old caricature, this is pretty much a continuation of it, except with some new characters - and a more insane Snake Commander. <br /> <br /> We still have all the old favorites as well, but in one personal note, one thing that always pissed me off was this "Duke in charge" thing, when there are tons of other * officers * around. <br /> <br /> Battle sequences are similar to the old series as well; The main trick here seems to be the CGI. It's overall pretty good, if not a bit over-the-top.
