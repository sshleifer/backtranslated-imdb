I usually suspect movies that are about 6/10 in IMDb. I would like to think that people know what they are talking about and know what they like. I think the trick with the review is to take a "Hey, if I liked movie types like these, I would give a higher score than I am about to give now since I do not like these types of movies" Then again, people judge differently, basing more value on performance, or perhaps on history or direction. Anyway, landing the plane here, I had rented this movie before and had not had time to watch it this morning I did. <br /> <br /> Wow! Watch this movie. I'm personally interested in the paranormal / read a bit about near-death experiences, so automatically I was hooked. I'm not sure about some of the reviews here saying that a quality cast here was wasted - I disagree - the acting here was superb - I think this is the only time I do not care Julia Roberts, it was good to see 24 Kiefer Sutherland (Currently at the time of this review, serving a prison sentence for DUI), and Kevin Bacon sporting an interesting hair style. <br /> <br /> General- I liked the direction, the atmosphere, the acting, and the plot, above all - particularly the idea of ​​karma, and, to quote Nelson Wright, "All That Matters" True . <br /> <br /> 10/10!
