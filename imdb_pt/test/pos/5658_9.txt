During World War II in the Philippines, Japanese soldiers are dying of hunger, dying, growing weaker and more insane. A small group of soldiers, trying to stay alive, eventually resorted to cannibalism. This film perfectly portrays the insanity that hits people in extreme conditions. There are some funny parts in this movie, but most are just a very slow and realistic film. Follow these soldiers from one painful moment to another and eventually to death. A very interesting film, showing the death and horror of what may have been the worst war the world has ever seen.
