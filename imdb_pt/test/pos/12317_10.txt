There are so many 'Top 10' lists that could easily fit into 'The Dead' - Best Drunk Screen, Best Literary Adaptation, Best Non-Specific Music Use for the Movie, Best Poetry Use, Best Screenplay, Best Ensemble Cast and finally, perhaps, the best film ever made. This was John Huston's last and greatest film, adapted by his son Tony from the tale of James Joyce and set on the night of the Epiphany Feast in Dublin in 1904. He is largely confined to a setting, the family home . Morkan sisters, and not much happens in conventional "dramatic" terms. They entertain their guests; there are chants, dances, recitations and a lot of small talk, but watching this movie you can not imagine anywhere else you would rather be than in this company. <br /> <br /> Finally, of course, it's "over" much, much more. It is about love, loss and repentance, those stable pillars of great drama. In the final scenes of the film, tenor Bartell D'Arcy (Frank Patterson) sings a song, "The Lass of Aughrim," evoked in the mind of Gretta, (Anjelica Huston), wife of Gabriel, (Donal McCann), The ghost of his first and probably greater love, a boy who died with the certainty of a broken heart at the age of seventeen, and suddenly Gabriel realizes that he has never met his wife and that he has not been the great love of his life. , after all. Emotionally, these scenes are incredibly powerful, first when Gretta recounts the circumstances of her lover's death and then when the voice in Gabriel's head sums up her own feelings. This is a great movie, the monologues superbly delivered by Huston and McCann. <br /> <br /> But all the performances are extraordinary. This is a set of games of the highest order and although it is unfair to highlight one performer above the other, the screen already gave us a drunker more pleasant, genius or convincing than Donal Donnelly or ever received poetry with such passion that Sean McClory, (the IRA man in "The Quiet Man"), brings to your reading of Lady Gregory's translation of 'Donal Og' here? Of course the poignancy is due to the knowledge that Huston himself was close to death when he made this film, which seems to me to be the culmination of his life's work. Death may very well be its central theme, but seeing this movie is a life-enhancing experience.
