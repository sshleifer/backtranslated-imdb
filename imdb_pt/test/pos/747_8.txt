Yet another on the long list of "Do not" movies of the late 70's and early 80's, but this is much more than that. This film is a low budget schlocker highly underrated with a twist. It has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of time period horror movies but it is the highly underrated performance of the amazingly talented actors / actresses who make this movie good. A young nurse arrives at the progressive psychiatric hospital of Dr. Stephens shortly after he was murdered by one of his patients and not everything is what it seems to be. It seems that Dr. Masters, an ambitious physician, took over her duties and began to implement her own ideas. Each of the patients takes on their own unique personalities and has their own personality traits and flaws that contribute to highly entertaining interactions. There is the nymphomaniac, the crazy old lady, the woman with an unhealthy obsession with babies and a man who has returned to childhood among others. There is also a strange twist in this bizarre story that later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum with patients running loose and bodies piling up. If you are a fan of cheap 70's sleaze than this is the movie for you!
