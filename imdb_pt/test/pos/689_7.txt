<br /> <br /> *************************** LIGHT SPOILERS FORWARD *********** We Dive at Dawn is an English-language film with John Mills in the title role. The second time I saw the DVD version was on a big screen TV and I must say that the movie is better than I thought the first time I saw it on the samll screen. Could it be that the big screen view helped? <br /> <br /> I still say the first segments of the movie are confusing, but as soon as the submarine leaves the quay and begins its mission, the movie takes off as well! The search for the German warship called Brandenburg and the adventures that accompanied it were absorbing and the details shown in the film are interesting! <br /> <br /> I am raising my rating to 7/10. If you like World War II movies, I think you will find this interesting when the submarine starts. Some of the men in the submarine also have a great sense of humor!
