"Shivering Shakespeare" can be considered the first classic of the talkie era "Our Gang". So far, Hal Roach studios have begun to take their first steps in producing spoken images, and "Shakespeare" is the happy result. <br /> <br /> The Gang is appearing in a version of Quo Vadis produced by police officer Kennedy's wife. Children do not find the play very entertaining and they are distracted by people in the theater and can not remember their lines. Among the funniest parts are Kennedy, the cop, like the giant, who takes off his makeup to fight an overzealous man in a bull fantasy; and the terrible dancer (played by director Bob McGowan's daughter). Several filmographies mention that "Shakespeare" made the first pie fight on a talkie. This may be true since they tried different speeds with the movie during the fight. Buster Keaton's brother, Harry, is on the receiving end of one of the pies. Very funny and a classic Gang talkie early. 9 out of 10.
