This is an epic movie about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of China in the third century BC. What makes it interesting is the king's tragic fall and all the intrigue of the palace going on around him. It reminded me a little of "King Lear" and some of Shakespeare's other plays. <br /> <br /> The king begins with noble ambitions, to unify the kingdoms under a single ruler and stop all fights so that people can thrive and lead a better life. He and his childhood girlfriend, played beautifully by Li Gong, devise a scheme by which she intends to exile herself in a rival kingdom in order to recruit a murderer to kill the king, thus giving her a pretext to go to war. But while she is far away, the king becomes sadistic in his desire for power and goes on a killing. <br /> <br /> There are numerous parcels that keep the action going. There is the marquis, who pretends to be stupid and affected, but who is really very intelligent and wants to become king. He fathered two children with the king's mother and managed to keep him a secret for years. Then there is the prime minister, a political rival of the king, who turns out to be really his father. <br /> <br /> The killer is a complex character. A swashbuckler and killer adept, he's undergoing a makeover when the king's lover comes to recruit him. He does not want anything else with the kill, but ended up being conquered by Li Gong (who would not?) When he sees how the king became cruel and cruel. <br /> <br /> Some spectacular cinematography, especially the battle. scenes that are performed on a grand scale - as they used to say, a cast of thousands, literally. The acting is good, nothing special. It is the story that is interesting, although in more than two and a half hours, it pushes the limit. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
