This movie is really very full of sex. Hot sex. I watched (of course) at Cinemax; and I liked it, of course; these virtual costumes are much more in style, and I liked the story. But you have to know that when a soft pornographic film director begins to make another pornographic film lightweight; all he wants to do is shoot good sex scenes. And I have good sex scenes, full of skin. One more reason why some people call the movie porn movies "Skinemax."
