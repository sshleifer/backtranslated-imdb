Adapting his own novel "Cabal" to the screen, author / screenwriter / director Clive Barker has created this wonderful story of another horror and fantasy. Craig Sheffer plays Boone, a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer. The police shoot him in front of Midian, on the surface of a graveyard, but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been avoided by society. When they claim Boone and turn him into one of them, this causes rebound to everyone, including Boone's sweet girlfriend (the very cute Anne Bobby) and the dubious psychiatrist (one of the nicest David Cronenberg). "Nightbreed" shows the kind of wild, twisted imagination I do not see in movies so often. On the one hand, Ralph McQuarrie, a veteran of conceptual art, having worked on films like the first three "Star Wars" movies, helps Barker create great visuals for "Nightbreed," beginning immediately with the opening credit sequence. The visual effects and makeup are elaborate, and the design of production and cinematography are impressive. Barker and team do a wonderful job at creating all that other world with compelling characters. It is a colorful and extravagant entertainment and it is a pleasure to absorb it. And, of course, there is a strong sense of social commentary about intolerance and fanaticism, not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a person's actions. <br /> <br /> Great support performances enhance the fun. Cronenberg exudes much malevolent intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor, while Charles Haid is a good antagonist of the "love to hate him," a rather unpleasant police captain. Doug "Pinhead" Bradley is once again buried under heavy makeup like the tired Lylesberg, and is solid as a rock. Hugh Ross is a lot of fun as Narcisse, as well as Catherine Chevalier as Rachel (as a bonus, she discovers her breasts in a sequel). Simon Bamford, who played the "Butterball Cenobite" in the first two pictures of "Hellraiser", also appears here. There's even legal participation between John Agar, a science fiction actor from the 50s and 60s. Danny Elfman provides yet another of his fantastic scores, and Barker leads us steadily through the intriguing story to a fantastic apocalyptic confrontation. /> <br /> "Nightbreed" is an excellent genre film that is worth checking out for anyone you have not seen. I give you a warm recommendation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
