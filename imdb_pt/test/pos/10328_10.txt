For those of you who have no idea what Bug Juice is or was, it was a children's reality show about real children living in summer camp. Bug Juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp. He was filled with romance, friendships, struggles, overcoming his fears and coping with the hardships of living away from home for two months. It was an amazing show that is no longer shown on t.v. regularly, but it's amazing not-to-less. The show was never monotonous and always attracted my attention. It is very good for children who have never been to a summer camp to see how it is before they go. In addition, Disney has done a great job of choosing camps to show why they want to see a show at a campground for only a week. The length of the campsites was perfect for this show, and the setting in which they were was fantastic. They where camping sites throughout the US, which each provided unique activities for campers. It was a truly amazing show, with no script.
