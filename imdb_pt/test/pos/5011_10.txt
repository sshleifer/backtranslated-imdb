I saw the movie at the Nashville Film Festival on May 1, 2003! It was fantastic! All the stuff I read about Stuey was incredibly well written by Tony Vidmer (writer, director, producer, editor), Michael Imperioli (amazing work as Stuey), and everyone else involved in it. I'm glad he (Vidmer) did not go through the routine of "Leaving Las Vegas" with Stuey's bad habits, but put us inside his life, family and his present. Tying the whole story of the motel room where he died was a great vehicle and showed off his writing ability. A great "thumbs up" on this one!
