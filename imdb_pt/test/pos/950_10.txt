The word Ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (a forerunner of Cricket) in India. The use of the word as a nickname for the main character is elegant because it means someone who is sharp, quick and can hurt badly when rubbed the wrong way. <br /> <br /> Ghilli is one of the best films for Vijay and he is unparalleled in his rhythm and action. The film never pants for a moment and keeps you always with some exciting action. The film is set in Madurai and Chennai and its story is simple. A wealthy landlord tries to lust after a beautiful girl in his city, and his unquestionable power and authority prevent the girl from seeking justice. The hero tries to rescue her and most of this movie portrays the week in which all this action takes place. <br /> <br /> A very exciting film and that story is nothing new, the director and actors get praise for the full action.
