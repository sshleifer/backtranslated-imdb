This is the best underrated role of Kellie Martin. Based on a true story, it tells the story of Fusia's attempt to save the members of the Diamant family and other Jews she knows from time to time. One of my favorite movie scenes of all time involves a heroic act of Fusia's little sister. All children should see that these scene models like this are very few and far between. The film is well written and acted. I am a movie lover and this movie I rate a 10 on the imbd rating system. It's in my top 25 films of all time and should be put on video. <br /> <br /> Mike Porter
