After a few years researching Humphrey Bogart's "Two Against the World," it unexpectedly appeared as an offer from TCM under the title "One Fatal Hour," a 1936 First National film. Bogey's character is Sherry Scott, the man who runs the WUBC, a radio station whose program is losing listeners. Owner Bertram Reynolds (Robert Middlemass) is a pathetic executive who gives letters at the police station but hides behind his decisions to pawn them in Scott. In an effort to increase audience base and revenue, Reynolds has the idea of ​​reviving a twenty-year-old murder case, and offering it as a fifteen-part radio piece. Scott asks for the help of Dr. Martin Leavenworth (Harry Hayden) to write the play and present it to the air. <br /> <br /> The Pembroke Murder affair involved a woman who was acquitted of murdering her husband in circumstances that are unclear. However Gloria Pembroke is married, and is now living as Martha Carstairs (Helen MacKellar), married to a successful banker (Henry O'Neill), and her daughter Edith (Linda Perry) is about to get married. less like the radio game is revealing the identity of Gloria Pembroke). Ready to face the devastating effects of this revelation, Martha and Jim Carstairs embark on a crusade to stop the show. Simultaneously, Edith's future in-laws respond by demanding that marriage not occur. <br /> <br /> Without revealing the end result, the film takes a devastating course to shake the viewer. Edith Carstairs confronts the directors of the radio station, vigorously warning Scott and the tearful Reynolds. While accepting his share of the blame for the result, Scott partially redeems himself by quitting his job, dismissing his secretary and leading her out of the office, acknowledging her for the awareness she once had. With a totally abrupt ending, the film leaves one as disoriented and unstable as any movie that does not have a happy ending. <br /> <br /> With about a dozen films, Humphrey Bogart has the chance to take center stage with intriguing results. Without any name supporting the players, Bogey takes responsibility by taking the boundaries of the radio offices and commands the program as if it were his own. In an interesting characterization, he expresses his exasperation by crossing his hands over his arched head, preceding for half a dozen years a similar effect that we will see in "Casablanca." For Bogart fans, it's a genuine treat to take an unexpected nuance like that.
