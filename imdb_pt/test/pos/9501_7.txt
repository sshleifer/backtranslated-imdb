No more canned meat and cabbage for her! <br /> <br /> This little romantic comedy goes from scene to scene with some exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a fantasy party). All this is centered around the husband's wife (s) who is looking to get out of the doldrums, played by Gloria Swanson (she's twenty here!). Both leaders have a natural air that is compelling and of course Swanson is perfect in all sorts of moods, from frivolous to worried and hopeful. <br /> <br /> Behind all games and apparent unconcern is the old, serious problem of staying in love and not getting lost in love. There is a bit of elegance, but director DeMille is on top of keeping him agile and believable at all. As with many films of this period, captions do not just say what they are saying (or think), but often give a kind of philosophical insight, as if to justify tragedy (or racism). And there is this larger purpose here, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's kind of weird. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a visual or formal surprise, you will not find it here. But as a story, well represented and filmed accurately and economically, it really is a great example. The events may not be a complete surprise, but it's a modern love story, defined almost a hundred years ago, it's a gas. And I saw Swanson was perfect?
