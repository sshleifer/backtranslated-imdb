I saw this movie purely by chance. It was shown too late, or more correctly very early one morning on television. I had woken up and was having trouble sleeping and this movie appeared. <br /> <br /> This is a subject often covered elsewhere (it certainly is not as good as Educar Rita, despite some. Despite its very obvious shortcomings I liked the film and this was thanks to the acting of some of his players rather than the story or the piece as a whole.I'm a big fan of Sam Neil and I saw him in many different films, including: Dead Calm, The Piano, Sirens, Sons of Revolution, Horizon of Events, Bicentennial Man and the ubiquitous Jurassic Park.He was very good, but he could have interpreted this part with his eyes closed. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances were, in my opinion, terrible, Byrne Rose, for example, and some of the Elusions were quite heavy (all the council woman in empty lives all dressed totally white). However, two actors (which I had not, or do not remember, seen before) me very impressed Sin√©ad Cusackn as Frances (Frank) Kenn edy and especially Matthew Newton as his son David. He, in particular, was very convincing and I would like to see a lot more of him.
