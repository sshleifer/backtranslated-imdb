The whereabouts of Al Capone Who shot JFK? are some of the great unresolved mysteries of the twentieth century. How else can I say except that I thought she was not inflexible. Mannequin maneuvers, little reactionary action (ie, that empty, stoic stare as he sings in the talking scene) and a singing voice that most voice coaches would classify as "mediocre." But she is incredibly beautiful and after all, is not that what the gypsy character is all about? Taking advantage of her appearance because she did not cut the mustard in the talent department? <br /> <br /> As for the rest ... Bette is fantastic. Whether she's playing or playing Mama Rose, this works anyway, and I think Rosalind Russell was as exciting as the drywall in the original. Peter Riegart as "Herbie" is the perfect role for Bette's exaggerated mom, and he is the medium-temperature porridge between Midler's hot plate and Gibb's cold stone potato. Riegart is totally correct. <br /> <br /> One last cry to the man responsible for the following decades of Cher jokes: Bob Mackie. Drag queens would kill for the glitz and glamor on display here. Everything is coming sequins and bugles! <br /> <br />
