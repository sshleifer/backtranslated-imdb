Although I brought this film by chance (I thought it was the original Halloween (stupid eh!)) I was surprised at how good it was, many sequels just continued the events of the previous films, this however I tried and managed to explain the events of the prequels , why does Michael Myers kill people and how does he seem to have supernatural abilities? I thought this was a top horror movie full of action, suspense and surprises, I'm so glad I brought it. I gave 9 out of 10.
