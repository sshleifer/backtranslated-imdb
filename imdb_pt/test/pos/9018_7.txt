It's very good considering all things. A must for anyone perplexed with the opposite sex (ie all of us!). The trailer does not give away anything of the plot FOR GOOD REASON. <br /> <br /> The premise is absurd, so it's good to see that you do not take it seriously. It's as if someone from the BBC's children's department decides to make an adult film. That's not a bad IMO thing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
