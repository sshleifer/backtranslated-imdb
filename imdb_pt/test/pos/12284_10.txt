Most Hollywood movies seem to follow one of the few pre-formulated and very predictable scenarios. This movie is not and is a perfect example of what I see for IFC. <br /> <br /> There's a guy, Michael, and his girlfriend left him without a word. He wants to know what happened. She is fine ? Can he say goodbye? Maybe there's some closure. He was not able to contact Grace and in an effort to find her, he made a movie asking for his help. <br /> <br /> Michael thinks we may need a reason to help him, so he tells us history, reliving his relationship with the help of a friend (Nadia) to play the part of Grace (the girlfriend who left ) <br /> <br /> The back view is 20/20 and it's no different for Michael. By telling his story and getting feedback from his friends, he realizes his mistakes and how much he values ​​what he has lost. Unfortunately, this is a lesson we all had to learn (or learn) and it is easy to identify. That's what makes you want to hear more of Michael's story and wonder if he meets Grace.
