Hi, I have to say that you have some misinformation about the series here. The main author was Richard Carpenter, he created the series. Later there were a few other authors, but they only made a few episodes. The first director who made most of the series (I think the complete series 1) was Ian Sharp, who created the distinct look of Sherwood's Robin. <br /> <br /> Clannad actually saw some of the material and read the scripts. I know that for sure because Richard Carpenter said that at a Con in England last year. <br /> <br /> I think this is a masterpiece of Television-Entertainment, because it has great characters and cast, good costumes and a great story. lines. For me still one of the best TV series of all time!
