I would love for the cast and crew members to sit down and make an audio commentary on this movie! All the different places they went to shoot this movie! Must provide some very good anecdotes! Fans of this movie would love to know: <br /> <br /> What kind of permission did they have to film in certain places? <br /> <br /> Was there any memorable loss? <br /> <br /> Was there a scene that was deleted? <br /> <br /> What challenges did the cast and crew face? Some actor had a stunt? <br /> What was it like working with other cast members? <br /> <br /> What were the scenes ad libbed? <br /> <br /> What are the cast and crew members up to now? <br /> <br /> What places still exist and which places are no longer there, or are they now a different business? <br /> <br /> It's one thing to read trivia about this movie on this site and other sites. But there is simply no comparison to get straight from the horse's mouth! <br /> <br /> Come on, folks! Join and make a comment! Never stray from a challenge! Go for the excitement!
