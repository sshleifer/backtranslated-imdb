It's that movie that many people call classic - Apocalypse Now, now a re-cut, re-up, Redux 22 years after its original release. <br /> <br /> The film is loosely based on Conrad's heart. Darkness, is the main plot (if you have one) being Captain Willard's trip on a naval boat during the Vietnam conflict on his way to wipe out a Colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he meets, and he tells the story of the Colonel along the way. <br /> <br /> My initial feelings about the film is that it's not particularly exciting at times, especially at the beginning, but at least a good deal of comedy is put in the way of surfing fan Col. Kilgore. As the film progresses, a good deal of tension is built up with Willard's reading through several accounts of Colonel Kurtz to the end, when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the movie reaches an incredible level and keeps it there until the end. <br /> <br /> The usual aspects that everyone looks for in a decent movie are all of a good level. Cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional, and I found the performances of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest for everyone to deserve a special mention. The score I found initially sounded out of place, but as the movie progressed ... I'm not sure if it really improved, or it fit better, or if it had just grown on me but at the end of the movie I was enjoying it completely. <br /> <br /> This is the second time I've seen the version of Redux, (I've seen the original around four times) I'll say now that the first time I've seen I was disappointed. I was expecting a "classic" movie with a lot of war. The fact that Willard had achieved the mission at the beginning of the film and not having it accomplished until the end made me bored because all the interaction of the character in the way the film was unnecessary. This is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined (as the focus is more on the character and the journey than on the plot), in most cases a second preview is required to fully enjoy the movie (as with all movies that are more characters than tangles), like the second time, you know where the plot is going. I had a similar experience with It's A Wonderful Life, which is now one of my favorite movies. With the four great films from Vietnam, Apocalypse Now wins the rest in the atmosphere but lacks the action and involvement of Platoon, the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter, and really can not be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my favorite of the four). Apocalypse Now is a great job, especially at the end where it becomes awesome, and should be recommended to anyone who enjoys a good character-based movie and does not mind casual casual violence.
