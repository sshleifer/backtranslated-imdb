This movie is great. Elegant, fun, good acting. I had already seen this described as "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Muskets" and "Reservoir Fops", both excellent descriptions. The plot is simple, but does not diminish the pleasure. Carlyle is a brilliant ruffian and Miller is an excellent drunken gentleman. The sets and costumes are impressive, and the music and camera work are incredibly unusual for a 'costume drama'. Sense and Sensibility is definitely not !!!!! My recommendation? Go see him, sit down with a huge tub of popcorn and have a good time.
