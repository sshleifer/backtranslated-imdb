Thank God there are movies out there that do not follow the same old Hollywood crap formula. I think the digital revolution and the DVD revolution are really enabling more interesting works to come even if you have to dig harder to find it. I love it when a movie takes its time to lure it deeper into its inner emotional reaches. It was really like taking a trip for the soul of America and that soul is disturbed and confused. What really surprised me was how they used Martin Luther King's speeches about Vietnam and references to his murder in a way that hit me hard. I found myself choking every time I heard her voice. I've heard him talk before, of course, but the way they used the speeches here made me feel as if I understood his message in a way I had never thought of. <br /> <br /> What can you say about a movie that has heavy statistics on war, oppression and a plea for compassion in the end where it would normally be a credit tracking? In fact, there are no credits in the movie. You need to access them by selecting them in the features. Somehow that made me think a lot. After all, I can not say enough about this DVD. Bright.
