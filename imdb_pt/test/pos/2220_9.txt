For those who have searched for happiness, "Half Empty" is a must. This original transcultural musical comedy has hilarious numbers, which make "The Producers" seem tediously sisudo. Writer Bob Patterson puts his soul into sharing his thoughts about life, wisdom and happiness, even scribbling inspirational comments on index cards as his girlfriend pours out his heart, ending their relationship. When his book on happiness, "North Star" finds zero success in the United States, his editors send him to Germany for an autograph tour. In explaining his decision to Bob, the boardroom explodes into an exciting song that would make Monty Python proud. Since his arrival in Hamburg, Bob's complete ignorance of the German language leaves him at a distinct disadvantage. However, he moves on, immune to his true feelings towards him, until a madly devoted fan arrives and changes everyone's reaction toward him. <br /> <br /> The original songs propel the film, often describing the subtext of the story. in lateral division accuracy. The cast, led by Robert Peters, exhibits an immaculately dry sense of humor and inhabits its characters as if they were not acting. See for: A case study of how good intentions are totally irrelevant; How merciless Americans abroad are seen; How much reason is needed to break into the music and, above all, a silly, amusing and unconventional laugh.
