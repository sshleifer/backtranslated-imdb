This is the only Christopher Guest movie that rivals Spinal Tap and Princess Bride for pure entertainment value, but somehow never comes close to recognition. The plot involves the competitors - dogs - and their owners as they venture into the competitive dog world ... OK, it's about a dog show. The owners really are characters, as someone would have to be so attached to their dogs. That's really all there is to it, but that makes it funny enough. <br /> <br /> You would never be able to convince me that a mock-u-mentary about dog shows would be funny before catching the hilarious scene where Levy and O'hara visit Larry Miller's house on TV ... but that's all it takes to convert any dubious. Spinal Tap was non-stop hilarity, joke after joke while Best in Show had some more lulls (and by that I mean 3 minutes most of the time where something funny does not happen), but the big laughs are even bigger. <br /> <br /> The cast of this movie is great and even the typical out of place in the movies in general. Parker Posey does a great job. In fact, his address to Ed Begley Jr. and an animal store owner about a lost dog is probably the most fun joke in the movie. <br /> <br /> What's incredible about this movie to me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot, simple as it was, around those big jokes, so it really looked like it had direction. I think there is a freedom in having such a minimal plot. Everyone's role is very well worked out here and the characters are rarely over-the-top. The realism of how pathetic they seem to the outsider is what makes it funnier than the Mighty Wind or the uneven Guffman. I actually find wierdos like this now and then. If you like Guest things, you should definitely own this.
