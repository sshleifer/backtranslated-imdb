Being relatively young, I did not know how bad anti-Semitism was in Brooklyn, where my family came from. This movie absolutely horrified me. I've seen a lot of films about prejudice, racism and anti-Semitism, but that seemed to hit me more than most. <br /> <br /> This was definitely one of the best indie movies I have ever seen .. I had to travel 45 minutes to see it, and it was well worth it. Almost everything about the movie was great. Sometimes it was a bit slow, but it did not bother me too much because the movie was too atmospheric. It happened in the 40's, and it really looked like it was 40 years old. The performance was great ... William H. Macy, as always, was wonderful, as was Laura Dern, and I was pleasantly surprised by Meatloaf's performance as the vicious anti-Semitic neighbor. <br /> <br /> 9/10
