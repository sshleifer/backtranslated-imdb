A demon from a tree removes himself in the form of a human man to make love to a young maiden just so she dies. The devil's eyes freeze, two drops of blood fall on a bed he created especially for his object of desire. The bed consumes blood and hunger continues ... anything that comes into contact with the bed is consumed! This is explained to us by one of the victims of the bed, a painter whose soul is trapped "in" one of his last works, the artistic representation of his final resting place (.. he was dying of consumption, coughing blood, deciding die on the deathbed). You see the painter, we are able to see as if he was stuck in a small room looking through his painting, unfortunately a bystander to the bed meals. The bed has a somber sense of humor, and we see this through the fact that it allows the painter to live, even giving her jewelry and other possessions, once pertaining to food victims. The skull of a victim produces red flowers not far from the basement that houses the bed. The film features three young women who come across the mansion containing the basement containing the deathbed. The painter (Dave Marsh) may have only one method to destroy the deathbed, but it will include a human sacrifice in order to resurrect the body of the one whose death caused his hunger in the first place. Patrick Spence-Thomas provides the soft and depressing voice of the arrested painter, narrating the film, lamenting about his current situation, telling us about the victims of the past and often reprimanding the bed of his predatory nature. <br /> <br /> Definite and genuine cult film ... I hope your status grows now that DEATH BED: THE BED THAT EATS has found its way to an audience (... like me) who appreciates the bizarre and the grotesque. The bed itself contains a liquid type of acid with a shade of apple, where we see objects and humans (struggling for nothing) consumed. Many may recognize a young William Russ (BOY MEETS WORLD, THE UNHOLY) in clusters, looking for his runaway sister, finding her in the cellar, zombie and traumatized (... of course, Julie Ritter was like this in a trance, barely speaking a word) with the two prisoners. In one of the film's most insane scenes, Russ tries to stab the bed just so his hands get stuck, the flesh acidified with only skeletal bones remaining, the cartilage deteriorating. There is a long escape attempt by a victim whose legs were caught in the bed, almost out of the basement when the sheets caught her back into her belly where she belonged. The film seems almost completely surreal as if we were watching a macabre nightmare unfold. Director George Barry often presents jokes about the victims who find themselves in the most unfortunate position by choosing the deathbed as their place of refuge. The painter gives us a reminder of all the various people who have been eaten. There is nothing like this movie anywhere, it is definitely unique.
