From 1950, a neat thriller arises about a couple smuggling diamonds from abroad and also the contagious disease of smallpox. Evelyn Keyes pulls all the stops as the essential victim of this movie-noir. Once back in the United States, she is not aware that she could be spreading the disease in everyone and everything she comes in contact with. Eventually, it is pursued and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs. Other than Keyes performing impressively, there is good support from villain Charles Korvin, William Bishop, Dorothy Malone, Lola Albright and Whit Bissell. The ending is a hit with Miss. Keyes on the edge of a building with floodlights and hundreds of spectators below. A good B flick!
