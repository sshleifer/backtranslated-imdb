Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about the nanny, a woman who gives her all to help the needy. It is told from the point of view of a boy, taken by the nanny when his own mother is not up to the task. <br /> <br /> I have respect for this movie for three main reasons: 1) It is moving, but not sappy. It is told in a very real way, without much of the aggravating baggage of Hollywood stories. And the end is very good (full of tears, but not exaggerated). <br /> <br /> 2) Although it is clearly an African-American film, it takes place in the post-segregation black community of Lackawanna, New York. , does not use his ethnicity in the sleeve. The story draws on the strength of the characters and the dramas (and comedies) that surround their lives. It is not preaching, it is simply good. <br /> <br /> 3) Has a great soundtrack (can not beat R & B old school and Chicago blues). <br /> <br /> Usually the acting is strong. , but not universally so. Some of the performances simply are not based on the characters that the actors should portray. But considering it was a made-for-TV movie, it's to be expected. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Imperfect, but nice, good movie for a rainy day.
