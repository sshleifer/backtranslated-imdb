Ice the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A virus ripped off the ice <br /> <br /> I just could not play well. <br /> <br /> If you get infected, kill <br /> <br /> Because you're sick. <br /> <br /> The cure is to be infected twice. <br /> <br /> Ice is a great episode; one of the greats of the first season who started shaping the show and if you ask me, you really could not ask for much better throughout the series. It starts with an incredible teaser which in my opinion really is one of the best teasers in the series as well. A group of scientists from Alaska extracted something from the ice core that killed them for some reason. Now Mulder and Scully are sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened. As Mulder says, this is because they are bright or expendable. I think this means they'd better be bright, or else ... The group soon discovers that the cause of chaos is a small parasite taken from the ice core. A small worm that enters the bloodstream and causes violent behavior. Since the pilot has been infected, the rest of the show turns into a kind of paranoid thriller that makes him stop, while others begin to suspect one another of being infected. This is by no means aided by an overly paranoid physician, Hodge, who is suspicious of someone we learn early on for the first thing he asks: see everyone's credentials to "make sure we are who we say we are." Events lead to discovering who is infected and learning how to cure them. <br /> <br /> There are a number of things I like about the episode and of course certain characters that I want to beat in the face of this episode as well as some loopholes but most can be attributed to a greater caution and not think clearly. I like Bear from the first date with him. It's a shame he has to die. I also like the scene shown from the other scientist's point of view as Mulder and Scully argue in the other room. It gives an interesting twist to our typical perception as a spectator, and to me it seems to say that perhaps we should not assume that just because someone is government means they know all sorts of secrets of conspiracy. As much as Hodges frustrates me in this episode, I think Mulder was to blame for some of the rash actions taken like any other. I really like Scully in this episode. First of all she may face like a frickin linebacker! Second, I really like the focus on her terror of what can happen to them out there and how she tries not to let Mulder's trust and friendship prevent her from influencing her judgment. I love the scene when she enters the bedroom to sleep and first looks like the photo of the previous group, everyone hugging and their birthday presents for who used to sleep in that room and then as she suddenly goes crazy and pushes the dresser in front of the door and in a final touch of subtlety as she sits on the floor with her knees pulled into her chest, we see the bottom of a poster on the wall that says "Bosom Buddies". This is a great writing. One way of saying without any word that Scully is worried that she may not trust her best friend. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this heightened suspicion leads the group to believe that Mulder has been infected since he discovered Murphy's. dead body, even if they have not inspected it to find out for certain. That was my main problem with the behavior of the characters is that they could easily have resolved the whole suspicion simply by giving blood. But I think I probably would have rushed that too. But then stupid, Hodges decides he has to assume that Mulder is infected, even if Mulder surrenders willingly and then is willing to be inspected and almost infects Mulder in the process. Luckily he sees that it is really the Dasilva that is infected and finally we come to a resolution. At least as much as you can expect from an X file. "Government" wastes no time in flaming the evidence as it always does in those cases and Mulder gets another frustrating "unresolved" case. At closing I give "Ice" and easy 10/10 and I leave you with a haiku. <br /> <br /> "We're not who we are.
