From the beginning of "The Edge Of Love", the viewer is transported to the stunning world of World War II in London. We followed the lives of four people who might have been brought up just for this movie, an exploration of female friendship and the tensions caused by marriage and infidelity. Except that one of the characters is called Dylan Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the twentieth century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but sometimes truly despicable. <br /> <br /> This film is based on Thomas's writings on love and romance. These were adapted with a sharp script by Sharman MacDonald (Keira Knightley's mother). The director, John Maybury, says the other three main characters were real people. <br /> <br /> All four are carried out with great force. Sienna Miller is Dylan's wife, Keira Knightley is the cabaret singer Vera Phillips. Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. The first section of the film takes place in London during the Nazi air strikes, with Vera being chased by Willaim, a soldier waiting to unfold. By chance, Dylan finds his first love, Vera. From there, Vera meets Caitlin, Dylan's wife. While the three are drinking, William successfully breaks Vera's guard. <br /> <br /> The film follows their lives as Vera and William are married and he is sent to war. Vera became pregnant and returned to Wales with Dylan and Caitlin. There they face a brave existence, with Vera supporting Dylan and Caitlin with her husband's war pay. Through these times, the friendship of Vera and Caitlin grows. So does Dylan's passion for Vera. She gives in. This creates the first test for both women. <br /> <br /> When William returns from the war, he barely recognizes his wife and has no bond with his newborn son. Things get worse as Dylan idly watches his friend struggle with battlefield fatigue (post-traumatic stress disorder). William realizes that something happened between Dylan and Vera, and in a drunken rage he goes up to Dylan's house. <br /> <br /> "Edge Of Love" begins as an elegant romance in war-torn London and ends in hard and hard life. of motherhood, infidelity and attempted homicide in Wales. The treatment of PTSD is well done and should speak to the American public. Someday (see final). <br /> <br /> Every star has a great time. Miller when she is plucking stitches in her head in response to the abortion of another man's son. Knightley and Murpy when he finally connects with his son. Oh hell, almost all their scenes are incredible. And Rhys when he goes to the bank to send Vera's husband to jail. <br /> <br /> However, the true star of the film is the cinematography of Jonathan Freeman and the direction of John Maybury. They seem to understand that no matter how good the story or the story of Thomas, this is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time. And they appreciate your scenes with stunning photos. While this is not the best picture material, it's a very good film (much more engaging than "The Dutchess"). It has a visual lyricism that accentuates the use of Thomas' poetry. In addition, this is clearly the second best performance of Knightley in his career, and perhaps the best of Miller. <br /> <br /> I've always had a weakness for the struggling Artist, whether it's Hulce's Mozart or Hoffman's Cloak. But I was shocked by how little sympathy I felt for Dylan Thomas. Their struggles with alcohol are well known. But his antagonism of William and Caitlin to gain possession of his first love, Vera, makes him a bad man. <br /> <br /> So, is this Academy Award Worthy? Clearly not. At least not this year. The state will be released in March 2009, making it ineligible for the Academies. That's 9 months after it was released in Britain. Between the Atonement, Miss Pettigrew and Brideshead Revisited, the US had its fill of pieces from the British period of World War II. What a pity. This movie is better than the others except the Atonement. But in this, Knightley's soldier returns, but like a shell of the man who left her.
