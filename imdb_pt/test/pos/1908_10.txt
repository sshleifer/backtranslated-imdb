Yes ... I read David Lee Roth's autobiography, "Crazy From the Heat" (which, by the way, is an incredible read), and DLR says this was his favorite blacksploitation movie as a kid. In fact, he says he always imagined himself as a Negro in Southern California. Mr. Roth is quoted as saying: "We have seen all Blacksploitation photos, and these films have been a great influence on me." Trouble Man, Superfly, Foxy Brown, Shaft, Cleopatra Jones, Bl√°cula , Rudy Ray Moore doing his vibration Dolemita, I saw all those ... "<br /> <br /> He keeps saying:" Dolemite - Rudy Ray Moore - was one of the originals. was a blue comic book, making blue humor, as Redd Foxx did on the first discs of the party, so he was the most perfect to play a new secret agent, his answer was not "Bonds." "Get Whitey" would appear in all the movies at least once, and we'd wait for They had the cars, they had the shoes, had the guns, the haircuts, the slang and the blows, and we all knew that all those beatifying resolutions at the end of the movie were white bull. * He is trying to feed hungry children, but in fact he is a pimp ... This was designed to make it palatable to our fathers and mothers, so they let us see the photo. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So, when I read about Dolemite in Roth's book, I immediately bought it on DVD and really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's super low budget, and yes ... I hate rap. .. but as a fan of Tarantino's films, I can see many similarities, especially some of the 70's fusion / funk ala-jaco pastorius music throughout the film. I also love the scene where the two cops "caught" by cocaine and then one of them snorts a lot of things like he did it a thousand times before, and says something like "Aww yeah ... that's the real mccoy!" ... and then he keeps talking and still has some cocaine in it. lip. CLASSIC! Some of the violence is a little over the limit, but shocking, which I consider to be a positive quality. Not as predictable as I supposed it would be. Will definitely get "The Human Tornado" very soon. 10 out of 10.
