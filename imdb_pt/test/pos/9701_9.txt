I've been a big fan of Cky, Jackass and Viva La Bam videos for a long time. They had a great race and I waited for my laughter to end eventually. But not yet. This movie kept my mouth open all the time. I'm still laughing, randomly. I went to the theater with low expectations, thinking it was not going to be better than the first. Oh, how incredibly wrong I was. <br /> <br /> There were many great moments in the movie. If you're a bit picky, you do not like raw humor randomly placed, or if you did not like the first movie, you probably will not like it. But with that being said, I almost wet my pants with so much laughter. It had all kinds of different jokes, masochistic humor, bathroom humor, vomiting, laughing, some big falls and massive damage done to the entire cast. Ryan Dunn even scored the back of Bam with an image that will be stuck for a long time. I'm sure you can only imagine how this movie is raw. <br /> <br /> No pain, no gain? Right? This movie already did well, causing theaters across America to laugh so much, that they wish it lasted longer. I know I did. This movie did not seem short, especially with the credits continuing the filming. But I still wish it could have lasted forever. Now, let's just wait and see when they drop Jackass Number 3! Overall a great movie if you can overcome male nudity and some sick pictures. Keep your kids out of this movie. They do not need to see this, at least until they are older. Support the crew and buy it when it's released on DVD! I know I will.
