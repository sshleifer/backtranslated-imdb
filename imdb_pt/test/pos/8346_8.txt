Lady and the Tramp II is animatedly colorful, and the songs, especially those of the Junkyard Dogs, are very good. However, the family seems very idyllic, and I can not help but understand that the Scamp is unhappy when everything is forbidden. However, I also feel sorry for Angel, who has never had a loving family until she meets Jim dear and dear. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is clear that the original Lady and the Tramp is better than this sequel.
