Bridgette Bardot, sexier than ever, plays a spoiled but innocent daughter of a French ambassador. She hires one of her main aides (womanizer MICHEL) to marry her and turns out to be the best thing for both of them. Michel is flirting with his old friends and, to teach her a lesson, Bridgette flirts strongly with a married Prince Charles. Michel is surprised by his jealousy. A game of cat and mouse follows between Brigdette and Michel ("I'll have an affair" ... "No, you will not" ...) And finally Michel realizes that she can and promises to give up all the other ladies in her life . Bridgette and Michel concentrate comfortably on their happily ever after, while Prince Charles returns home to England. <br /> <br /> It is an admittedly light piece, but it is incredibly charming. While some may blame you as a product of your time, I find this quite enjoyable. Worthy of a rental.
