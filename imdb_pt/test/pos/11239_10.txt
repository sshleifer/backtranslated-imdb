I think it's a brilliant show with cool heads and pretty cool action. 2 guys who pretend to be masters at seducing women demonstrate their skills at different nightclubs and 4 experts (the artists themselves) comment on them by choosing the winner. Your jokes are fun and some participants are really fun to watch. More so, this program really teaches men how to get in touch with women, many expert reviews are helpful as long as you can see how it works in the field. Actually I think this is one of the best TV shows and I totally recommend this to all men who like women. <br /> <br /> ps / pardon for my thickened party.
