Not your daily Tom and Jerry short for many reasons. First, there is a voice narration of Jerry, which is strange because Tom and Jerry rarely speak. Two, the two are friends, which was also rare and rarely works as well as the other opponents shorts. Third, and most importantly, the cartoon is rarely humorous (by design) and the jokes here are dry chuckles with a little cough and a blood bubble at the end. Think of a Tom and Jerry cartoon directed by Tim Burton. Not totally successful, but largely works. The most chilling end to a MGM short that I can remember. Not for everyone and proof that these shorts were never intended exclusively for children as the target audience. It's worth watching. Recommended with the above warnings.
