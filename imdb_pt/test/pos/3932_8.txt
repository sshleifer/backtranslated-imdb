I saw a preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing Sneak Peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed it so much more! As seen in the trailer, one hit I had was to believe that an entire city could be "forgotten", but this is a horror movie of cheese popcorn, so I accept what it is. <br /> <br /> My only major complaint I assume that Paris Hilton would play wax or dive etc. and lament "this is hot," but they did not do it (how could they resist ???). <br /> <br /> THERE IS NO NUDE OF THE 2 GIRLS, although Paris looks great in her lingerie! I'm surprised they did not put a third "hot token victim" in the movie for some unnecessary nudity that is the norm for this type of movie! I will not list any death or spoilers, but I'll say that Paris and Eliza are battered! <br /> <br /> The characters are developed decently and are a little nice (not like Cabin Fever, where you wanted them to die) and the movie has a decent rhythm, though nothing happens in the first 30 minutes as the most horror movies. I give him an 8/10 as he delivered good scares and gore and I had low expectations going for it. If you go with some friends who like horror movies, you will have fun. <br /> <br /> Noah
