I have done many international trips, both in business and as a tourist. For both types, I assure you that the best advice is also the oldest: always drink the country's wine. In this film, the archangel Miguel arrives to the Earth on business, surrounds him quickly and decides to walk a little on tour. Boy! Does he "drink the wine of the land"? <br /> <br /> Could man be drunk forever with alcohol, love and fights? <br /> <br /> He would get up in the morning and lie down lief of nights. <br /> <br /> These are things you can not do in Heaven, so he likes them while he's here! Of course he had some other work to solve and, if he is less direct about them than about the former, he has the same success. The final scene is a little weird, but it's also wonderful. Jean Stapleton starts dancing with John Travolta.
