Named for the best documentary in 2004 at the Oscars, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out more about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited job, unpaid debt and three separate families living within a few miles of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life by chronologically examining his buildings and interspersing his beauty with the story of a charismatic but selfish and emotionally immature genius. Like the son Lou never acknowledged publicly during his lifetime, Nate stood gently in history without dominating the main focus. <br /> <br /> While examining the magnificent Salk Institute in California, Nate evokes the mythical use of space and light from his father in his buildings, making it a peaceful and fascinating experience for viewers. Nate's skating shot at Salk's Smoky White Central Venue emphasizes the harmony of the building with nature. It is breathtaking. My Architect also covers the difficulty that Louis Kahn had with getting his designs accepted. Several fantastic buildings exist only on paper, discarded by more practical architects and real estate developers. It was not until Louis Kahn went to the East that his visions were enthusiastically embraced. In India, where he built the Indian Institute of Management, a former co-worker describes him as a guru. In Bhangladesh, where he built the magnificent National Assembly building, citizens consider him a father of democracy. <br /> <br /> Watching My Architect is a great way to start or continue learning about architecture and the importance of space. But it is the irony of Lou Kahn's selfishness combined with the transcendence of his work that will inspire you. 4 stars.
