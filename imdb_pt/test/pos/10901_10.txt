Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey, Addams Family Values) wrote this frothy tale of an educated school teacher (Kevin Kline) who is nominated at the Oscars for a former student who became an actor (Matt Dillon). The rest of the film deals with the absurdities that revolve around this setting - the effect on the city, his fianc√©e (Joan Cusack) himself - and culminates with an end to everyone who loves everyone. <br /> <br /> If you are an angry gay rights activist or a naive young man looking for a precise picture of a man's struggle to leave or a "true" representation of gay life, then get out of trouble and rent something else (maybe Bonus Thing) or read a book (Giovanni's Room). If you are able to understand that this film was inspired by the pity of Tom Hanks 'speech at the Oscars when he won for Philadelphia and mocks Hollywood culture and small town ignorance and you have a predilection for the comedy of the' 30s (Bringing Up Baby, Holiday, The Palm Beach Story) so enjoy! Far from being a scathing satire, the film tries the exuberance of a farce from Preston Sturges and comes very close. No, it's not "deep" or "powerful" - Romy and Michelle, 9 to 5 years, or Young Frankenstein - and do not pretend to be; keeps tongue firm in front. It gets very foldy and sentimental for its own sake until the end and sure enough some of the jokes are a little obsolete (there's also a locker room scene that could have been cut), but after watching countless comedies that fail, it's like a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck are wonderfully games, while Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley add good support. Joan Cusack's outstanding winning performance is stellar and the great Bob Newhart is, well, Bob Newhart. <br /> <br /> The fact that many have been offended by In & Out is as absurd as the mentality of the town in which he mocks; personally, I was more offended by Philadelphia. I'm going to take a harmless flu about hypocrisy at any time.
