I would consider myself a fan of Dean Koontz; Having read a number of his novels and liked all of them, but unfortunately I never got to read Watchers, so I had no choice but to rate this movie on its own merits instead of comparing it to the book I have not read. I went into it expecting something terrible, and while I did not get exactly a brilliant horror film; I'm led to believe that they are the book's fans who are rating it because as a movie itself, Watchers is a fun and somewhat original little horror movie. The plot obviously takes some influence from the Predator and starts with an explosion in a research lab. It's not long before a farmer was killed by some strange animal and the boyfriend of the deceased's daughter caught an ultra-intelligent fugitive dog. A secret government agency is soon on the case, while the murders continue. The boy remains fascinated by the dog's intelligence, but somehow it relates to the murders and the agency is right behind him too. <br /> <br /> The script for this film was originally written by Paul Haggis, who he later disowned. I do not know why ?? the writing here is by no means as ridiculous as its 2004 hit Crash! Anyway, the main reason why this film works is undoubtedly the dog, which in addition to being quite cute, is also the best actor in the film. Corey Haim, hot from The Lost Boys' success is the human protagonist and really has a good chemistry with the dog, although it's a little ridiculous to see him talk more about the movie. The plot is quite complicated and as such, the film is more than a bit confusing; but the ridiculous of everything does it during the most difficult times. Michael Ironside also appears in the film and performs well as the "bad cop" of government agents. The monster is of course one of the most interesting things about the movie and the way it goes around killing people is always fun and bloody; though unfortunately we can not see much of it, and when we finally do, it's a bit disappointing - obviously the filmmakers had seen Bigfoot and the Henderson! Still, this is the kind of movie that can be easily enjoyed despite the myriad problems and I recommend it to any viewer without eighty horror insight.
