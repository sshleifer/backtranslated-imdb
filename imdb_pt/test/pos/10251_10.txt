The film was very good when it came out, I watched Cooley High and Cooley higher center, around 1968 I was also home coming queen and I grew up and lived in the Cabrini Greens area, I knew a lot of people in the movie, It was cool to see friends in the movie they also lived in the area, and they had a chance to be a star that may have been a unique experience in their lives, I had good moments growing on the north side and hard times that I can relate to with the movie Cooley High is not more standing, but a person like myself and others still remember the fun we had growing up at Cooley High, there is so much history around this area on the north side to be told.
