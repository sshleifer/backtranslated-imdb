There are many movies now on DVD, but the producers have forgotten some important titles for many movie buffs. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other big screen era favorites, great budget epics had merit. Many people of my generation learn a lot about the history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas (The first time I heard them was a very cheap adventure film with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas) Egypt or Rome saw many "bad" epics of the time. (the color De Luxe was more Brigit and sharp than the ordinary Technicolor), maybe the cast was wrong but in any case, the film managed to give us an idea of ​​the life in the old Egyptin and was of certain way, the engine to go out and buy the novel, my Mika Waltari, one of the best if not the best historical novel ever published. Also anding anding was the excellent trail of Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann. I saw this movie many times when I was a boy, it was not the big box office success Fox wanted after the huge success of The Robe at CinemaScope and Stereo was a wonderful show. I have the Lasser Disc.m version the only way to see Ito its wdisescreen format. Soon I hope it shows up.
