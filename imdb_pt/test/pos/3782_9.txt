Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments while Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1. First he goes to the camp where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk on the line . It's a very funny scene, since the bum is not used to keeping his feet straight. <br /> <br /> The next thing you know is that he is in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include Charlie eating the cheese from a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder. <br /> <br /> When Charlie goes to sleep, he finds his entire bunker flooded and his roommate snoring. This is such a funny part! I can not describe it, just watch the movie. When Charlie wakes up, his legs go numb, so he tries to "wake them up." It made me roll on the floor when his second leg still looks numb ... while Charlie actually rubs his roommate's foot! <br /> <br /> The film becomes a bit gloomy as Charlie shoots a German couple from his trench (though it's done in a very funny way) and he's a tree to approach the enemy, saving a his friend from a death squad. <br /> <br /> The last part is that he is getting a French girl in trouble, hiding in his house. He then has to save her and in doing so, he captures the German kaiser as well. To do this, he pretends to be a German kolonel or something. I love it when Charlie is asked something in German and he is like nein nein nein. The soldier looks at him in a funny way, so Charlie changes his mind: ha ha ha! The Kaiser is captured and Charlie is the hero ... but after he wakes up again at bootcamp, it was just a sweet dream! <br /> <br /> Charlie made one of those 'dream sequences' before (The Bank comes to mind), but who cares, this movie was so funny that it made me laugh all the way. Chaplin also has something to say with this film (as his later work has become more of a social commentary to various setbacks in the world) and is best explained in the last sentence of the film: 'Peace on earth, goodwill for all mankind. '<br /> <br /> In short: a classic of Charlie, very funny, timeless. 9/10
