While I agree that this film does not have any real substance and should not be taken seriously, it is mainly aimed at fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey) once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the police chief no less) and moves into the apartment of his friends (whom you guessed) was killed by a street gang who took control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people joining Bronson have a habit of being killed. Bronson systematically kills them one by one while the people of the neighborhood are used against him. There are some dynamics between Bronson and Fraker, who leads the street gang, you can say that both like their job. At one point in the movie after they fight in the town jail, Fraker says, "I'm going to kill an old lady just for you, get on the 6:00 news." Giggler, a purse thief who laughs while he is committing his crimes, is also pleasant to watch. The film was made in 1985 and most people could probably identify with the stereotypical urban gangs that are cast in the film. It's nice to see Bronson (Paul Kersey) rid the streets of these bad guys. Notice the appearance of Wildey Magnum, a serious piece of hardware that Bronson uses. I also really liked the soundtrack of this movie.
