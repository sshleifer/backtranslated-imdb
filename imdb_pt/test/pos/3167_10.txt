At first I did not know if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I have a single movie after the taste experience or maybe a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. Lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us, he wants to get rich, laugh, travel, eat and have fun. It moves from one place to another in a giant trailer with no direction or reason just to pass the time and entertain. In the end, it's too late. Since my first visit to the United States, it has grown in me as a personalized dream, where life on earth is nothing but a strange experience. I am an artist and a Buddhist and this film communicated to my senses. It was an ideal embodiment of impermanence. This may sound strange, but somehow this movie was able to touch me in a deep way like no other. I recommend.
