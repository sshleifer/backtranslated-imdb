LE CERCLE ROUGE is a very good film, although it suffers a little, since there have been similar films. In many ways, the film is reminiscent of previous assault films such as RIFIFI and GRAND SLAM and many others. So while director Melville and the actors have done great work, it all seems like a case of Déjà vu. Because of this, I had great difficulty in giving an excellent result to this excellent film. <br /> <br /> The only unusual aspect of the movie is how bandits come together. Instead of the usual media, Vogel escapes from prison and ends up meeting with Corey, a career criminal released from prison! Both are a good game, but make them both work in parallel for much of the movie until they find a smart touch. Also, as expected much of the film concerns the meticulous details in the planning and execution of the crime. I also liked how the movie showed the bandits in such a cold and distant way - something relatively common in French crime films, but rare among American films until the last few years. <br /> <br /> Overall, extremely well crafted and well worth it. seeing ... if you do not mind that it seems a little repetitive, you'll see a good acting, direction and a lot of tension.
