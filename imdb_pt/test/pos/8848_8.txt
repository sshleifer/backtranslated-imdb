At a time when almost all of the great horror films of the '60s and' 70s are being redone for audiences based on today's horror films that are not very good, it is instructive to recall the work of John Carpenter, THE THING, which itself is a remake of a favorite childhood director, Howard Hawks 1951 sci-fi / horror classic THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film was not initially a blockbuster when it was released in mid-1982, it has already garnered many followers. <br /> <br /> In fact, the Carpenter movie is less a remake of the Hawks movie. of what is a reformulation, since it returns to the original idea proposed by the source material, the story of John W. Campbell "Who Goes There?" in which a US scientific team in Antarctica is threatened by a shape-shifting alien thawed ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who starred Carpenter in the 1979 TV movie ELVIS, and the 1981 film ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, leads a cast of great actors including Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart and Richard Masur in that tension. Full exploitation of paranoia, as the form-changing "thing," which first arrives at the camp in the form of a guide dog that a Norwegian team is trying to kill, assumes each of them one by one. It was not long before everyone in the camp began to distrust their fellow men. The ending of the film, in which Russell and David are the only remnants, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity, similar to the codas similar to both BIRDS AND STRAW DOGS. <br /> <br /> Almost universally, when it comes to THE THING, the emphasis is on the extremely bloody special effects makeup created by Rob Bottin, who worked with Carpenter on the 1980 horror classic THE FOG and the movie of 81 werewolves by Joe Dante, The Howling. These effects are really spectacular and graphics, and even today, they can also be quite upset to the stomach. But all of this would make Carpenter's film nothing more than a cutting edge splatter epic, if direction, history and acting were not good; and fortunately, every one of them is. When he is not focusing on the awful transformational sequences, Carpenter builds Hitchcock-influenced suspense that chronicled his earlier HALLOWEEN and THE FOG films with director of photography Dean Cundey's camera, particularly through the corridors of the station. Help. The performance reinforces an already well-done script of Bill Lancaster; and we also received a stretched score from Ennio Morricone, whose work on the classic Italian spaghetti westerns of director Sergio Leone in the 60's is well known to everyone, including, of course, Carpenter himself. THE THING also features additional fine visual effects from Albert Whitlock (who has worked on many Hitchcock films including THE BIRDS), and Roy Arbogast, who worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD TYPE and JAWS 2. Carpenter the film was not as successful as it might have been because Universal chose to launch this graphic shock just two weeks after releasing Steven Spielberg's ET: The Extra-Terrestrial (not surprising that critics and audiences at the time liked Spielberg ). excellent film on Carpenter equally excellent, but extremely different). In addition, most of the horror movie box office business in 1982 was going to another film produced by Spielberg, the POLTERGEIST. As a result, at a cost of $ 15 million, THE THING suffered from the lack of attention in its time. Over time, however, many have come to see the Carpenter film as it is - extremely bloody but extremely clever combination of science fiction and horror, made with a lot of talent and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the center of its history. Though still rather gruesome, THE THING should be as well remembered for the skill with which the story is set as for the bloody alien designs and makeup effects; because it is the ability to tell stories and suspense that make it so memorable in the final analysis.
