This show was so exhausting to watch and there are only two numbers Drowned World (Substitute For Love) and Paradise (Not For Me) where you can sit and just watch everything. The opening of this show will go down in history as the most visually thrilling, with Madonna entering the stage through a gigantic Swarovski crystal ball that descends from the ceiling and the huge screens behind show images of horses galloping. Horses play a part in this show due to Madonna falling from one. The infamous Madonna scene on the crucifix is ​​at this show, as a huge canvas account for 12 million, the number of how many African children are orphaned due to AIDS. In the end, a website address appears to anyone interested in donating. We then enter into the theme of the environment and again images of politics and religion are shown. There is an interlude and then the show starts again for the song of I Love New York and Ray of Light this part of the show is one of my favorites with the dancers making funny hand movements there. To the end, there is the number of the song with the song Disco Inferno mixed with the music and the dancers make the presence there more known. The finale again is full of energy as the show ends with the songs of Lucky Star and Hung Up and hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling at the end of the message "Have you confessed?" comes up. It's worth buying the DVD and when it came out, the soundtrack to the show was added as a bonus. Jonas Akerlund did a great job filming this show, keeping it consistent with the style of the tour.
