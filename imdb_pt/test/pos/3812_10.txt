Let's start from this point: this is not a movie intended for ordinary audiences. Totally bizarre, somehow incomprehensible, totally unpredictable, just keeps you stoned by watching the screen trying to figure out what will happen next. If that alone does not make you agree, it's a great movie, so go back to your "family" movies and forget about MOTORAMA. It has material to be considered a cult movie, can be put in the same category with films that win prizes at Cannes or other intellectual film festivals, but unfortunately, Hollywood has already left in the dark, simply because it is not commercial. The performance of young Jordan Christopher Michael may not be Oscar material, but he gives the right touch to the story. Even the genre is difficult to describe; it's not a comedy in the right direction, you do not know if you should laugh at the strange situations in which Gus gets involved. It's more like an impossible adventure that some kids might want to have, but do not let them watch it too ... it's not a kid's movie. So whether you like Disney movies or are looking for a "Alone" style, this is definitely not for you. But if you like to read Edgar Alan Poe or the works of Tim Burton then you will like Motorama. Then jump on your red Mustang, get a tattoo with the word "Tora" and cross Strangeland with Gus. I would like that ...
