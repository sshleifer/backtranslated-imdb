Idiocracy looked like Mike Judge took my thoughts on society and put them in the movies. In fact, the film is a social commentary. It almost looks like a documentary at times. Luke Wilson did a good job playing an annoying middle joe (as in most of his films). <br /> <br /> Of course, idiocracy was an extreme of the present state of society. But that's what makes most comedies funny, an extreme of any situation. Fiction is not very different from reality. <br /> <br /> With children praising the materialistic culture of hip-hop and priding themselves on being ignorant. When people feel worthless in life, they reproduce. Giving them a purpose in the world. And it seems that only the worst people reproduce more. I can understand how others do not like it. Not most of the jokes were bathroom humor second degree. Not unlike a Kevin Smith movie. <br /> <br /> Idiocracy throws away logic, reason, any intelligence (for good reason). <br /> <br /> Mike Judges' return was a knockout.
