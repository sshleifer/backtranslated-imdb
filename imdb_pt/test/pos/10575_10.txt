This was really an amazing adaptation. I missed the first episode, so I unfortunately lost the connection between the characters and the smooth flow of the plot. But as soon as I watched the second and then the third, I was impressed. I ordered the DVD less than a week later and unable to wait for it to come, went straight out and brought the book. From the moment I opened, I was addicted, I could not download. I decided to finish the entire book before I dare to watch the DVD. I preferred the book because it was within the minds of the characters, you could fully understand where they came from and the role that was inside the story. They missed a lot of the adaptation which was disappointing as the book is a masterpiece and I think they could have done it superbly if they had been able to stretch it for a long period of time. But considering only being able to be installed in a 3 hour slot, I think it was made excellent. He followed the main story twisted brilliantly. And the actors who were entered as main characters were amazing! The lovemaking scene was pure and beautiful. He was so tender and loving and just showed how natural homosexual love can be. I was totally delighted with the book and the TV adaptation! I loved both Sarah Waters' previous romances and also found the Tipping the Velvet adaptation quite enjoyable. But when I read and watched Fingersmith, I knew that none of his earlier romances / adaptations could ever win him. Sarah Waters really exceeded this time! I recommend you watch this adaptation! If Tipping the Velvet was not your thing then do not let it get you out of it. Fingersmith is a new ball game. It is a beautiful and obscure story of love, greed and betrayal ... <br /> <br /> THE MUST SEE!
