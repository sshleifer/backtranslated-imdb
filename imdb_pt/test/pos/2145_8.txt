I really do not know why this movie received such a hostile reception when it was first released. Of course, it's very long and a little gratuitous in its representations of sexuality and violence, but there are also many well-regarded movies. I really do not think people who hated "Heaven's Gate" really understood that. "Heaven's Gate" in its uncut form, much like "The Deer Hunter" shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life (such as immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privilege (as the " seated Americans "). "in Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue.) Living a hard life is painful, but it can also be invigorating, as opposed to the monotonous life that Averil leads in the epilogue.In addition, as Michael Cimino made a great effort to make the image historically it is fascinating as a document of the (and perhaps the accusation) of American life in Old West Wyoming.The dialogue is often genuinely intelligent and emotional.Made with good music and cinematography, the film functions as a truly poetic work of art. Granted, "Heaven's Gate", with its refusal to patronize the viewer, is not to everyone's taste. However, Hollywood produces so much commercial junk every year, which is much easier to dismiss as eye sense (even when an example of this becomes a blockbuster) that "Gate" and Cimino really deserve more respect. All people should see the uncut version at least once and then take a the decision. <br /> <br />
