A 3.50 pound DVD might be a gamble and this was a worthy type. <br /> <br /> A decent Saturday Night type movie that amuses you if you cover up the obvious flaws of the plot. Special effects are a bit few and far between with some repetition (and why does London always seem to be in the 60s?) <br /> <br /> If I had the budget of, say, Armageddon, then I'm sure it would perform better at the box office as the story is a good one. <br /> <br /> Overall, Tycus is consigned to the story of the movie B, but if you see it for Â£ 3.50, then it's worth buying.
