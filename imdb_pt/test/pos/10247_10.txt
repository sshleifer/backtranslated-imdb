Some people might call "Cooley High" the same sort of thing as "American Graffiti", but I would not. To begin with, in "AG", all were white, while in "CH" all were black. Also, this one has a Motown soundtrack. Specifically, the film focuses on several working-class African-American students in Chicago in 1964 and their mischief. The film deals mainly with home life and relationships. In their apartments, we see that there is never a father around. But these young people always know how to live life to the fullest. <br /> <br /> One thing that really sets this movie apart from most other portraits of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible, concerned about the lack of school. Two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene and the white guy from the movie. But overall, the main star is the soundtrack. It truly is one of the best soundtracks in movie history (we even have vinyl here at home). A classic in the real sense of the word.
