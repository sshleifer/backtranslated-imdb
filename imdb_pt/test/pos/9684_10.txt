I love everything about the family guy. <br /> <br /> My favorite family characters are Brian and Stewie, and I like the episodes when they characterize them mainly as "Road to Rhode Island" (second season), while they interact very well. The comments they make leave me in stitches. Peter's behavior is also very funny, since some of the things he does "are so brilliant that they are retarded." The dubbing is excellent, especially Seth MacFarlane, he provides the voices for half of the Griffin family as well as his pervert neighbor Glenn Quagmire and how he manages that interval (particularly with the singing) I just do not know. He deserves his two Emmys for providing the voice of the evil genius Stewie. Adam West also steals the show with his regular funny and completely insane character the Mayor of Quahog. What I like about Chris (voiced by Seth Green) are the things he says show that he cares for the father when it comes to intelligence and common sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing I found annoying is that UK Fox decided to change the seasons to increase DVD sales, which in no way reflects the program itself, but marketing. <br /> <br /> If you like Family Guy, I thoroughly recommend the other American design by Seth MacFarlane. Dad, who uses a different style of humor, but is still extremely hilarious.
