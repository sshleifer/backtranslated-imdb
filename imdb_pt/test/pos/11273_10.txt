I loved it, it was horrible and disgusting. I thought the tearing of human flesh was completely provocative. the way he was describing the human crucifix over Jesus Christ was really interesting. The tear of limbs and jaws was stunning brutally gruesome. Do not watch this if you have a weak heart, you would not be able to stand it.
