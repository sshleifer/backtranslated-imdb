Martin Ritt's 1957 Edge of the City starring John Cassavetes, Sidney Poitier, Jack Warden and Ruby Dee. It's the story of a troubled man, Axel, who has a mysterious past that gradually comes out during the film. He has a connection that gives him a job in a cargo dock working for Charlie (Jack Warden), a real bad guy who gets tips from his workers and rides them hard. Charlie has an intense dislike for a black man, T.T. (Poitier), who holds the same position. T.T. invites Axel to work on his team; Axel challenges Charlie and does this. Axel finds a place to live and socialize with T.T., his wife (Dee) and his son's white teacher (Kathleen McGuire). When a tragedy occurs, none of the men at the loading dock will talk to the police, and Axel has to deal with his values, what he stands for, and the meaning of friendship. <br /> <br /> An excellent black and white movie that curiously is not really about being black or white! It's really about the limits you put on yourself and knowing who you are. Charlie is a fanatic and hates that a black man has a good position in the dock. T.T. causes Charlie and does as well as he does. There is no discussion of T.T. and Axel spend time together or the T.T's son have a white teacher with whom the family also socializes. What Axel, a loner, finds it difficult to accept any friendship or trust anyone - these things he learns through TT Poitier absolutely shines in "Edge of the City" - he is warm, energetic, loving and intelligent, a man with a real enthusiasm for life, afraid of nothing. Cassavetes is excellent and plays a totally opposite character - hiding in the shadows, chronically depressed and always nervous. <br /> <br /> The film leaves open what happens to Axel. Whatever he does, he's a different man now. Strangely underrated and unfamiliar movie, possibly in the shadow of many of the angry young films that came out at that time.
