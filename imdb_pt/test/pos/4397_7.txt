The Coen brothers did it again. Three prisoners from the depression era (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) escape from a Mississippi gang and set off in search of the buried treasure that will finance their new lives. Along the way, they sing on the radio and become much sought after by stars and fugitives. Great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson / introduction to bluegrass music. <br /> <br /> Clooney is excellent as the fast talking, quick and insightful Ulysses Everett McGill. Holly Hunter plays his estranged wife. Turturro and Nelson are immaculate stumblebums. Also in the cast are John Goodman and Charles Durning. Dan Tyminksi is George Clooney's voice in "I Am A Man of Constant Truth," the song by Soggy Bottom Boys that serves as a model for the bluegrass-loaded soundtrack that also features Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, The Whites, John Hartford, The Cox Family and Gillian Welch. Toe playing, slapping the fun for the whole family. You will be amazed at how relaxed and funny this movie is.
