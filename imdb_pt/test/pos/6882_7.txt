So the Koreans are now beating American horror movies. But they are doing it in style. DOLL MASTER is an approximate copy of PUPPETMASTER and DOLLS, and even has a bit of CHILD'S PLAY for it. Several young adults are invited to attend a special event in a gallery full of dolls, only to find that they are targets of a vengeful spirit. The dolls come to life and do very unpleasant things for the children. The blood level is reasonably high, the photography and the values ​​of scenography and production are top notch, the acting is not so bad, and the scares are definitely there. DOLL MASTER may not be in the same league with A TALE OF TWO SISTERS or even DEAD FRIEND but is close. Give yourself a watch. You will not be disappointed.
