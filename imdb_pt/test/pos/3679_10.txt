What a great movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled on it so serendipitously, surf channel on a good frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her best, leading a cast of characters costing very normal and human through one of the most wonderful movies we have ever seen. Why this film did not get the attention it deserved in its launch in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why was head and shoulders above so many boring pieces of garbage released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the vision. It is obvious that we, as the general public, are being forcibly fed with what was considered "great and wonderful" by the powerful and influential, while true gems such as "Unconditional Love" can shine through all those suitors to really enjoyable cinema. Rent or buy this movie ..... you will not regret it!
