The first feature film, Muppet Movie, and except perhaps The Muppet Christmas Carol, movie handlers around the world are still looking for a guide. Disney made the Muppets a dis-service and this movie proves this over and over again. Featuring classic comedians and special guest appearances, it maintains a simple but original storyline, classic Muppet jokes, Paul Williams' genius in song composition and the madness of Electric Mayhem, and comes with an incredible movie especially when you realize that the cast main is dolls. Only Croft came close to Hensen's genius with puppets. Half of the fun today is playing is that the actor / actress is still alive ???? I can only hope that Frank Oz and Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving Muppeteers can somehow rescue and revive Kermit and Company from the deadly reach of Disney.
