Whether you're looking for a modern movie version of Buster Crabbe or Johnny Weismuller overcoming the machinations of unscrupulous white safari guides or cunning black tribes while saving the animal kingdom, this is NOT the movie for you. This is an account of the "legend" of Tarzan since its inception in intelligent and adult terms. It is beautifully filmed and true to the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Tarzan is not an action hero, but a man divided between two worlds - the natural and the civilized. In an impressive performance, Christopher Lambert portrays this anguish with absolute realism. If he slides only once the cat will be out of the bag: the audience (especially the adult target audience of the movie) will laugh, and the movie will completely lose control. It will plummet down the cheeky depths. But Lambert never lets that happen. (Forget what you might think of him in other movies, when I saw this movie in the theater at its original release, I thought he deserved a gym prize.) <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is uniformly excellent , as other commentators have noted. I disagree with most of them in that I did not find anything wrong with Andie McDowell's performance. I did not nominate her for an Academy Award - the paper is not very demanding - but she's quite ready for it, so to speak. Nor do I know why her voice was gifted. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of the African segment of the tale is absolutely beautiful. It captures the beauty of the African desert and the exotic expectation it holds in the collective imagination of those who have never been there. The scenery is lush and exotic, and the colors are vivid. <br /> <br /> But this is also a "period" film, and cinematography also magnificently shows Victorian England - the countryside, the city and the interiors. The costumes are excellent. The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or intrusive. <br /> <br /> There are some disturbing scenes - especially for animal lovers - but no more disturbing than some scenes in Dances with Wolves. This is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature, personified in the young Lord Greystoke, convincingly portrayed by Christopher Lambert.
