This is absolutely the best movie I have ever watched. At the age of 12, I was up late and ran through the movie. It was on the US channel, Up All Night, by Gilbert Godfrey. I'll never forget. At the time, my friends and I were really struggling with different problems, some sexual. You know that 12 is a very difficult and weird age. It seems like you're stuck between being a little girl and being a young girl. This movie really helped answer many questions for me. Now I have a 12 year old daughter. I've been looking for this movie for years. If I ever go out on DVD, I would be the first to buy. I would advise any parent to see this with their child when they reach that difficult and difficult age.
