I first saw Heimat 2 on BBC2 in the 90's when I was in the arts college living and moving between artists and musicians, hoping for future success. Thus, "The Second Home" - from friendships made after leaving the family home, to strive for professional excellence - strongly resonated with my living reality. I was captivated by the characters, by the narrative, by the work of the lyrical camera and, above all, by the music. In it I could guess the beginnings of the German electronic music of the 50s Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Can, Neue, Faust of the 70s, the sound experiments of John Cage, Walter Carlos and the British electronic psychedelic of The White Noise. Soundtrack composer Nikos Mamangakis studied with Carl Orff of Carmina Burana, so I found his contemporary tastes in the world of Electronic Pop / Sound Effects. <br /> I had not seen Heimat or Heimat 3, so I watched as a whole in itself without before or after. As someone commented, it is epic and lyrical - historical and artistic. Many favorite moments, including the wonderful voice of Gisela Muller (Evelyn), Bach marimba Daniel Smith (Juan), Henry Arnold's piano-playing (Hermann) and the cello by Salome Kammer (Clarissa). <br /> <br /> I could write more, but it has already been said here. Why can not British or American TV produce such raw functions? The Wire had the realism and political and epic sweep of a city, David Lynch and Dennis Potter had imaginative troops for their TV serialized work as well, but that's art-house and soap in their most cinematic and sublime narrative. It's never included in the choices of the critics of Best Films, but it should be. Still as poetic and powerful as when I first saw it more than 17 years ago. I watch the three sets of boxes every fall for their "gentle fertility." Inspirational and inspirational.
