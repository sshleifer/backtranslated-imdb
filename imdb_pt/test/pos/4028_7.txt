This movie is a fantastic remake of the original with the same title. The movie was cool, despite the fact, I hate new ones! The whole cast was incredible. It has great cast and an amazing plot !! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder, pure eh? Dennis Quaid is the man who is "DOA" (in other words, Dead On Arrival). He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect !! Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him. The film is quite fast and full of action. You can see two other big stars in Meg Ryan (City of Angels, Courage under Fire) and Daniel Stern (In House Alone, Bushwhacked) in supporting roles in this amazing and cool remake of a classic movie !!
