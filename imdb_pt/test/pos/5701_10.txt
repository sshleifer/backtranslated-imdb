An amazingly good documentary. My surprise was mainly due to the fact that I was confused by the title. I assumed it was the influence of drug culture on film production, but no, it's a much more comprehensive and intelligent film than one might expect. Demme did a great job of encapsulating the period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s. From "Easy Rider" and the collapse of studio influence through all those introspective "real life" films where young directors brilliant artists attempted to express themselves politically, sexually and artistically, right down to the beginnings of the blockbuster and the return of the reigns to the money men and their studios. As someone who has seen the "real life" movies of Britain and the rest of Europe through the 1960s and then the 1970s US revolutionary films and is sad that the sequel to the sequel is so much the order of the day, this was a most fascinating film. Interview clips are measured (thanks to DVD, full interviews are available as extras!) And movie clips are well considered. Also, as someone you've just met, 'Joe', I'm impressed by the fact that this important little movie deserves its well-deserved entry here.
