I went to see this because I have some friends in Ukraine. but the film took me further than I expected, turning into a perfect blend of belly laughs (Alex's strange use of English), situational comedy and weight that bordered depression. I loved the break. it made me want to hop in an old car and get on the road to Ukraine. Alex (Hutz) plays the role of his guide perfectly and provides a great counterpoint to Elijah Woods poker. the film shows the positive side of humanity when people of different cultures can relate and do the right thing when they feel the sincerity of the situation, even when they enter into it with preconceived notions and prejudices, and how that can open doors inside buried memories. There's a lot in this movie.
