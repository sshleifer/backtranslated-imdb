A bunch of sisterhood girls make a new promise to spend the night in a creepy mausoleum. Of course, the newly dead do not stay dead for long, and all hell breaks loose. "One Dark Night" is a nice suspense of the 80s with some horrible floating bodies that are being controlled by the spirit of a dead psychic Raymar. without gore and nudity, but the atmosphere of a mausoleum is very sinister. The acting is solid, but the script takes a long time to develop the characters until the final 20 minutes that Raymar finally ejects from his grave. The cinematography is impressive and the mausoleum is a great location for the weather events. The movie takes so long to happen and this is your big flaw7 of 10.
