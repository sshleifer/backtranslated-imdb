I admit my ignorance about the existence of this film until I saw it advertised in a cable outlet. I was very impressed by the film's novel structure. The film, which is in a language I do not understand, shone with intelligence and nuance to me. I think that speaks to the quality of the film. It was visually stunning. The acting was visually fascinating. The Chinese theatrical traditions of movement, used to enhance dialogue, are so compelling after watching the Western movie, where actors traditionally focus more on dialogue. The action in this movie comes straight to you, without too many blasts to catch your eye. It is human action that is so affectionate here. The additional advantage that the movie taught me about the history of one of the world's greatest tourist attractions, the funeral clay army of China's first Qin Emporer, was very impressive. It seemed to give the film an international relevance beyond the great ethical themes of the film. This is a movie that I can comfortably recommend to a wide variety of friends and acquaintances.
