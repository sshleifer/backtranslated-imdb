I just saw a few episodes of "Eleventh Hour," but I must say they were enough to impress me. This series is so impressive and interesting ... I'm definitely going to follow it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say that the performance is first rate. Patrick Stewart plays his character - Ian, the scientist - with credibility and coolness, and he makes the public believe in the character. Other characters, such as Rachel, are also believable, and although they are sometimes a little cold - due to the way the series is filmed - they are interesting. <br /> <br /> The stories told by this series are also interesting. For example, one of the episodes I saw was about cloning and a man who was trying to clone humans. The way the episode was developed and how Ian - Stewart - kept following clues and saving people was incredible. Also, it made you think about ethics and how good or bad this could be. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think this is a good TV show. I just hope it stays that way - interesting, thought-provoking and with good acting. Even if it's filmed in a cool way - little lightning, cold photography, lots of close-ups - it never ceases to be interesting. Highly recommended.
