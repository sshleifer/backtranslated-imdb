The only thing that can be said about running away from time is that it is an immensely intelligent film. It is interesting to note that the writers of the film are French, which may explain the "out of the norm" vibe of the film, since it does not fit with what is commonly called "Hong Kong Cinema". <br /> <br /> The movie concerns a thief who plans to take revenge on some criminal types using the help of an equally clever police officer. But first he has to convince the cop to join his personal crusade, and so begins a series of games in which the thief leads the cop in his plan. <br /> <br /> A very clever film. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed analysis of this movie or full reviews of other foreign films)
