The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like Charles Dickens and more contemporary writers like Edward Gory. As a musical, it naturally becomes more like the musical Les Miserables. Both deal with the shadowy effects of poverty in the Industrial Revolution and the collapse of organized society. But this musical is different from Les Mis in one very important aspect: Stephen Sondheim, the composer who can adapt to any style. To be sure, he has had his successes and failures, but one thing about his programs that you can always count on: they will be something unique. Who would have thought that someone would write a musical about a barber who cuts people's throats and turns them into meat pies? Sondheim yes, and he did it wonderfully. The whole show is set up in a factory to suggest the ever-present catastrophic effects of the misery of those deep down in society, and this perfectly suits the needs of the show. The walkways and railings are bustling to suggest streets, walkways and bridges. Techniques are borrowed from Kabuki and Noh, with visual stage hands and joint changes. So, on top of that, cast the great Angela Lansbury as the crazy and funny Mrs. Lovett, and George Hearn in her baritone voice, like the killer Todd, and you'll have a stellar musical vehicle. The rest of the cast moves gently through the cliches of the love story perfectly, except for Johanna and Pirelli, who sound a bit too stressed. If Johanna and Pirelli from the Broadway show were here, it would be perfect. Hearn acts as he sings more than Len Cariou on the OBC album, and the accents do not sound so stressed here. For all this, Sondheim's punctuation never fails to underline the somber seriousness of the story. Like I said, he can adapt to any style. In Follies, he imitates the style of the '30s shows, in Pacific Overtures he captures the subtle art of Asian music, Into the Woods takes the 32-bar Disney style music, and Assassins covers a history of American music. Here, however, he does wonders in making his distinctively English score, from classroom songs to duets and opera soliloquies, social waltzes and Gilbert / Sullivan style. And yet, the show continues to be very serious, despite provoking more laughter than any musical comedy. Still, it is a grim warning about the evils of revenge. This is where this movie makes a mistake, cutting the floor of the Judge in which he has flogged himself for his crimes. Without him, the Judge is just a conventional villain, and the argument of this film is that there are no bad guys. Both Todd and the judge learn, too late, the horrors of having to accept responsibility for their actions, and Todd loses everything in his obsession. This is well revealed by the chilling reprise of Sweeney Todd's dark and noisy Ballad, ending the show with Todd and Lovett rising from the grave to tell us that the end is the same: in a world full of Sweeneys, revenge only begets revenge. "Seeing the tale of Sweeney Todd, he served a dark and vengeful god. Seeking revenge can lead to Hell, but everyone does it, and rarely as well as Sweeney, like Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street."
