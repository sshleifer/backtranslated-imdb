This fun and sometimes poignant look at the Hollywood detective genre of the 1940s and 1950s, Robert Sacci as a retiring anonymous former police officer, uses his savings to pay for plastic surgeries to transform his image into that of his idol, Humphrey Bogart, then establishes shop as a private eye under the name "Sam Marlowe". Robert Sacchi, by the way, is one of Bogart's rare few imitators who made the right guess; more to the point, body and facial language are there. For a time, Sam's only client is his owner, who wants him to find his boyfriend, and his only friend is his secretary, simply called "Dutchess" (Misty Rowe), who in his own words "seemed like Marilyn Monroe and made as much sense as Gracie Allen, "and has a passion for banana splits. Then he meets Elsa (Olivia Hussey), the simple, sweet and virginal daughter of a retired master who was murdered for no discernible reason. In the process of investigating the murder, Sam soon encounters his sister-in-law with Gene Tierney (Michelle Phillips) of Anastas, a greedy, miserly and obscenely rich Greek tycoon (Victor Buono, who became an honored Sidney Greenstreet), his miserable suffering second wife (Yvonne deCarlo, who manages to play a variety of whore emotions without saying a word), his two henchmen (Herbert Lom, channeling Peter Lorre, and Jay Robinson, making a fairly accurate Lionel Atwill), and Anastas 'vicious, amoral Anastas' Potentate (Franco Nero) who comes complete with a glamorus and disconcerting loyal lover (Sybil Danning), from whom he would give anything to acquire "Alexander's eyes," two huge, perfectly matched sapphires of the star. When Elsa is murdered, Marlowe's interest in resolving the affair becomes personal, and he defines through a maze of Los Angeles sights, including the Hollywood Bowl, the esoteric and eschatological attractions of Hollywood Boulevard and Santa Catalina Island in search of of the rocks. Determined to reach out to them before either of the two rich competitors. Play cameos by Mike Mazurki and several others, the traditional idiot ally and police sympathizer, and a plethora of well-designed character curves that give dimension to virtually every player, and despite an unfortunate title song, you have my mind , a very nice cinematic experience.
