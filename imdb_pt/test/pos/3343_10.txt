I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun joke with some cool music. Kristine was on the cover of Playboy and downtown, as I remember. She is very cute and cheerful and has a lot of charm. The film made me want to see more of her and then I kept an eye on her in other things. She is in Steven Spielberg's "I Want to Hold Your Hand" and Barbara Streisand's "The Main Event" and Bill Murray's "Meatballs," plus many TV shows such as Night Court and TV movies. Me and my friends really like her. But her lead role in Alice in Wonderland places the spotlight exactly where it should be, on Kristine as the center of attention, probably the most beautiful and sexy girl I've ever seen in movies.
