Critters 4 ranks as one of the greatest films of the twentieth century. The classic word has never been so used as in the description of this hallucinating epic. I agree that the original Critters are the best in the series, but the claustrophobic voltage of the space station on which the Critters 4 is set really should be seen to be believed. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in seeing one of the major landmarks of the twentieth century movie.
