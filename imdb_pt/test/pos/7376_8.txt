I originally posted the user's first comment about this movie, and claimed it was crap and did not make sense. I did not make sense. Bonfire Tales is a thoroughly enjoying movie (now that I'm 2 years older and watched last night). The actors were famous, but not very famous. The acting itself was more than acceptable, it was quite good. I'll sort the movie by movie segment. <br /> <br /> 1) The black and white scene (AKA- "The Hook") useless, looked good, but did not have much grip, the only disappointing, I did not think it was even included as a segment. Here's the scare-o-meter. <br /> <br /> --- --- (Poor) <br /> <br /> 2) The story of RV (honeymooners stuck in woods) Possibly the most fun of all tales, the acting was good in this too, dissapointing about the typical caravan sex scenes. However, it was intruiging, you think "what was knocking on that door". He had suspense, and not very bloody. I liked that <br /> <br /> -------------- (Very Good) <br /> <br /> 3) Internet Chat Tale (The Little Girl Finds Psycho) This was a smart addition, gore left on a minimal, frights left on EXTREME. Although bland at times, the last few minutes were gone more fun, do not get me wrong it was still fun to watch.Real creepy, and could happen to anyone, so see who you're talking to. <br /> <br /> --------------------------- (Very good) <br /> 4) Ghost Tale (Man kisses the ghost) ?? It was not the best, it was not too atmospheric for a ghost story. This was strange, the aspects were quite good, playing music and screaming, but everything was too real to be ghastly, although it was good, it was quiet and bloody. could have been better with this idea. <br /> <br /> (Acceptable) <br /> <br /> 5) The End (the 4 teenagers lost) These are the two attractive and expensive gallons telling the stories throughout the film. The best thing about the movie is definitely the ending, it made a great impression, the ending was totally unexpected. See, it was so well done. , the realism was spectacular. <br /> <br /> ----------------------------------- (TOP STOCK) > <br /> 6) THE TOTAL FILM Campfire tales were more than I used to do, I really really like it now, I'm buying on video because it's a truly fun horror movie to forget the trash you see in the days of today, like many, I am disappointed that this did not really go anywhere, went straight to video, for me it was better than all the hype "ho rror" you see these days. Overall, for the Campfire Tales <br /> <br /> ----------------------------- (Very good) /> 8 of 10
