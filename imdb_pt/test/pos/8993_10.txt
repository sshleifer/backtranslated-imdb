I wonder how anyone could diss from this movie. It is based on a true story. It's not necessarily about the "Rugby" itself, so for the one who posted here that they need to make a "real" rugby movie, you missed the mark. This is not another typical sports movie in which a team sucks, they hire Emilio Estevez and give back to the team and win the championship and give to all the hot climates and fuzzies. Focus on a story. It shows how someone can change their life for the better. The movies nowadays are about sex, drugs, parties, etc. This is Hollywood. I'm a big fan of movies, but I have to say that this was an inspirational movie with a great message. If you consider yourself a "tough guy", do not watch the movie, it will not meet your standards. If you want to watch a good and inspiring movie, this is a good movie.
