Having just come home from my third show of the Werewolf Curse, I decided to jump to the IMDb and see what others thought. I noticed that many Brits loved it, while those in America simply did not understand. This is not really a shock, since the US does not understand what "English" is. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are very English. Middle-class English, in fact, with a hint of eccentricity is a good measure. The film is very much like our two heroes; Simple and unpretentious. It has a nice and gentle plot so kids do not get lost, but there's enough meat to keep the adults entertained as well. There are some slight hints (which seem to have offended the evangelical drama - oh, no!), But there is nothing more rude than a background for a brief moment. When people get offended by a plasticine anus, you know the messy world ... <br /> <br /> A quick note to those (all Americans I've watched so far) who think Chicken Run is a better movie: Chicken Run was meant to please your sense of humor, and I think you suffered because of it. The Curse of the Bone Rabbit is witty, English and intelligent. Thomas The Tank Engine movie was ruined because it was meant to please Americans and I'm glad Nick Park did not let that happen to another great British institution. <br /> <br /> In short: you can keep your Chicken Run, your Shreks, your Madagasga - this kind of coarse and crude comedy does not compare to the humor and grace that Wallace and Gromit is in Curse of the Were-Rabbit. English to the core, and for a long time Wallace and Gromit can stay that way.
