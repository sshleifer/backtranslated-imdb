I admit that I've been a fan of Harrison Ford for many, many years, so it did not surprise me that I enjoyed his performance here. But I also liked the way the plot developed and I thought the cast was well done. I do not know if I "buy" Kristin Scott Thomas as a congressman, but she is a good actress and a beautiful woman. I became aware of her in the first Mission Impossible. Although her part was small, she remained on the screen. <br /> <br /> Here she and Ford play people whose spouses are killed in a plane crash. They are sitting together and that is where the plot takes off. Apparently, Ford, a police detective in Wash D.C., discovers that his wife was having an affair. He further learns that the case was with the husband of a New England congresswoman. <br /> <br /> History takes on many subplots, while Ford and Thomas find themselves attracted by the revelations of their marriages, the revelation of deception, and the pure sorrow and anger at the loss of a loved one. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is worth it, whether it's renting or picking up the cable.
