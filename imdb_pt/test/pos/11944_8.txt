I usually have difficulty watching a TV movie, the lengthy commercial breaks break my concentration and I give up and find a good book. This, however, made me take the adds and stick with it to the end. I realize the film was based on a true story, but it was not revealed why it took so long to find Denny? They had his name and I would presume his social security number. While he moved a lot, it seemed that he would be found as soon as his number was entered for a job, etc. The actors looked a little old for the piece and a buried metal object when unearthed had no rust. These were just technical glitches and they did not take away from the file. For a Lifetime movie, it was better than most.
