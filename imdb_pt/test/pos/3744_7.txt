Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, lets his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) does not respect him and loses a patient in which he is operating. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers that her husband betrayed her. Both need to escape. She watches a beautiful seaside inn in Rodanthe at the same time as he reserves a room. They are alone together. You can find out the rest. <br /> <br /> This is known as weepie or woman movie. It is beautifully filmed with a romantic setting and many quiet scenes. There is tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an uplifting end (more or less). The great acting of Gere and Lane helps to disguise the fact that this film is not much on the subject. Each piece of the plot is predictable. I rolled my eyes at some of the events. It's also very short - I did not believe in the romance between Gere and Lane for a second. It comes out of nowhere and moves very quickly. Still, the movie works. The inn itself is absolutely beautiful and I was in tears at the end along with the majority of the audience. So it's a predictable movie, but it's beautiful, with a marvelous performance. It does not deserve all the criticism you're getting. I give a 7.
