Silent historical drama based on the story of Anne Boleyn, a newly arrived maid for the queen capturing the lascivious gaze of Henry VIII, grumpy king of England who loves to feast, drink, hunt, be entertained by his court Bobo from the court, look at the tights and chase young beauties who bounce from cakes and attract attractive women around the castle. Well, he soon nullifies his marriage, married Anne, and tells her that it is her sacred duty to produce a male heir. She fails at this point and he soon has her eye on another lady. Meanwhile, Anne spends almost the entire film looking hesitant, upset or absolutely ready to start crying. She simply does not show up as a happy camper (or is it just bad acting ?!). <br /> <br /> This movie is a solid piece of entertainment, with an engaging story that interested me for two hours. - plus I enjoyed seeing the very lavish medieval costume presented here in a beautiful sepia color print. Emil Jannings is quite striking and memorable in his well-made portrait of King Henry the Eighth - he really looked like he was Henry the eighth. I'm not so sure about the performance given by the actress who plays Anne, it seemed a bit exaggerated. The DVD of this film features a well-made and appropriate piano score that fits this story perfectly. Very good movie.
