I saw this movie for the first time in the early 90's, and instantly fell in love with it. Richard Benjamin and his wife Paula made the 1981 film "Saturday, the 14th" in 1981 before making this movie in 1983. I think they work very well together.this movie made me laugh on several occasions. It also has a young molly ringwald , who would later go in the late 80's to make movies like pink and sixteen candles.It's fun to watch her a little younger.Even though not seen by many people ... I do not even think the average movie fan ever heard Talk about this movie. But when I came across it I was glad I did. I gave this film 10 out of 10 stars as I think it's a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy. lastly I would like to say that it is not available on DVD so I picked up a VHS copy on ebay, so if your interested, you can probably find one in there.it could be in the $ 20- $ 30 range of dollars, but I have a mind for $ 12 dollars. I wish they would end up releasing it on DVD.
