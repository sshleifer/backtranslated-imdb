The elegant universe brings to light many ideas of the universe and existence. After watching this documentary, we can not fail to take a step back and rethink its view on the existence of everything. There is a large cast of scientists, mathematicians, and others on both sides of String Theory. It is continually questioned as untested, untestable, and possibly completely wrong. The closest thing one does to proselytizing is to explain that Quantum Physics, the set of mathematical ideas that give extremely good approximations of what happens to subatomic particles, has never made an incorrect prediction. Not so with String Theory; no one is willing to say, on camera, that String Theory is the truth, and in doing so, the piece maintains a respectful distance from the subject.
