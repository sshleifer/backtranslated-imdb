After the release of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937), Walt Disney Productions continued to produce quality children's feature films, many of which I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing. The AristoCats (1970), directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, was the twentieth film of the official canon of Disney, and is a romantic musical comedy that revolves around a family of aristocratic cats that lives in Paris, France, in 1910. mansion of the elderly Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (voiced by Hermione Baddeley), your lovely feline pets ?? including Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three young kittens? are the most important residents. When the troubled butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) discovers that the cats have inherited all the old lady's fortune, he begins to dispose of the pets by throwing them on the field away from the big city. Lost and confused, Duchess and her children make friends with a street cat, Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who agrees to show them their way home. <br /> <br /> In terms of animation, 'The AristoCats' is nothing particularly remarkable, with previous Disney films such as 'Snow White ??' and Fantasia (1940), demonstrating a similar or even superior visual style. However, is the story interesting and exciting? especially for the younger crowd, I'll bet? and the musical numbers (which I wished were more numerous) are great. As a matter of curiosity, I'm going to quote my two favorite songs like "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and "Ev'rybody wants to be a cat", the last of which is a psychedelic retrogression towards the late 60s with a swing jazz band and delirious colors, led by a fashionable feline named Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers). The family's journey back to Paris is full of adventure and adventure, and we find such amiable characters as Amelia and Abigail Gabble (two chattering geese), Uncle Waldo (Georges Hautecourt { energetic of Madame Bonfamille} and Napoleon and Lafayette {two dumb hunting dogs hungry for the butler's rump}.
