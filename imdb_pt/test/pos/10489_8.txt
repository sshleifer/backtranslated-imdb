"Il Prezzo Del Potere" by Tonino Valerii. "The Price Of Power" is an excellent and captivating Western Spaghetti that mirrors the assassination of Kennedy. A great performance by Giuliano Gemma and an excellent score by Luis Bacalof are just two of the many reasons to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> In 1881, Texas is divided between those who enjoy the abolition of slavery and just want to live in peace, and those who, after 16 years, still want to reinstall the confederation. Despite warnings, President James Garfield, who wants to establish a new equality policy, decides to visit Dallas, where corrupt police officers plan his assassination. Bill Willer (Giuliano Gemma) and two of his friends, a black man named Jack Donovan (Ray Shaunders), and a crippled guy named Nick (Manuel Zarzo) are determined to prevent the assassination of the president. Since James Garfield was not murdered by racists, who wanted to reinstall the confederation in Texas, but in Washington DC by mentally unstable Charles Guiteau, the plot of "Price Of Power" is, of course, historic Absurd. As the film, however, does not claim historical accuracy, but attempts to allude to Kennedy's assassination in 1963 in Dallas, the fact that the story is fictitious is legitimate. <br /> <br /> Giuliano Gemma offers excellent performance as the main character Bill Willer, Benito Stefanelli is great as the villain and corrupt Sheriff Jefferson. Some other good performances are those of Ray Shaunders as the black friend of Bill Jack, Warren Vanders as Arthur McDonald, adviser to the president, and Fernando Rey as Pinkerton, a wealthy businessman villain. Luis Enr√≠quez Bacalov's score is great, the cinematography and the venues are great and (as in Valerii's previous "Day of Rage") are very reminiscent of Sergio Leone, for whom Valerii used to work as assistant director of "A Fistful Of Dollars" and "for a few dollars more". All told, "Il Prezzo Del Potere" is, after "Day Of Anger", another excellent Spaghetti Western that shows both the great talent of Giuliano Gemma as an actor and Tonino Valerii as director. "The Price Of Power" is a must for fans of Spaghetti Western, and I also recommend it to everyone else. 8/10
