living in Romania, I was almost shocked by the very realistic setting for the scenes and the great care paid to local details by the director. Anthony Queen's performance is absolutely fantastic, and the rest of the cast does a great job of supporting it. The film takes a bit of knowledge of the Eastern European context to be enjoyed, but remains a great performance with some memorable lines. the ending may be a bit melodramatic, but in fact that's the way people are in that part of the world. I think the script is great because it presents the horrors of World War II in a very original way - no blood, no battlefields. Still, lives are destroyed, and the smiles you get from time to time throughout the movie are quickly killed by the war realities that touch the characters.
