I've seen this movie a few times, and with every performance, I still feel the excitement of embarking on a journey and the frustration of trying to break through the barriers that stand in the way. It is more than a mere desire to find a home; it is about the very basic human spirit to find the way in the world, to overcome despair, to face the weaknesses of character that hold our goals. Underlying these human endeavors is the challenge of reconsidering the origin of life. While this film is imbued with serious ideas, it has comic lines enough to make viewers hopeful. It's surprisingly funny. The execution of the story is excellent! All of this is packed with visually appealing animation. Unmissable. <br /> <br />
