All credit to writer / director Gilles Mimouni, who created this sinuous tale of torment and betrayal. By maintaining maximum control, it keeps the audience at bay, never allowing them to become fully aware of events. Even your clever denouement made you guess. <br /> <br /> The three central performances are also first class with Vincent Cassel, Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci doing their utmost to heighten the mystery. Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey complements the force in its supporting role. Revealing plot details or character specificities would not be fair. <br /> <br /> Thierry Arbogast uses the camera effectively to lead us to this puzzle, and Cardine Biggerstaff's edition keeps the story one step ahead of us. The theme of Peter Chase is sublime in his marriage to the script's ideal. <br /> <br /> Many may say that Gilles Mimouni is trying to confront several deeper issues about them from love. To me, this is simply an indescribable and indescribable puzzle that involves a fascinating web. Only the French are capable of such temptation. Hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Monday, March 2, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon <br /> <br /> Nobody makes suspense like the French. When they hit it, they really hit it. <br /> <br /> Vincent Cassell is intriguing as the deceitful Max, obsessive Romane Bohringer as the new Lisa, and Monica Bellucci is mysterious as the first Lisa. The plot of Gilles Mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and crossed wires crossed. <br /> <br /> All credit should go to your handling of the clever plot, and the performances of the three leaders. Like Lucien, Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey is strong and emotional. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 15, 1999 - Video
