The movie is not perfect by any means, but despite that it's a lot of fun and fun to watch. I am the first to agree that Victor Fox is not really that attractive and his music and style are very cheesy. I also agree that the film has some weird distractions and some scenes do not work well. And? If that makes you smile and have fun who cares? Does every movie have to make sense? Does every movie have to be perfect? No. A person could be devastated by admitting that he loves this movie. Once more, so what? It has lovely characters, is well filmed, the acting is good, it never becomes overly sentimental or dramatic, it is peculiar. See how many people I love I Dream of Jeannie. It's perfect? Not! And while this is very different, I say check it out and you will be in a good mood after seeing it.
