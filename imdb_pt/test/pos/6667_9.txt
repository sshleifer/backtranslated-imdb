I liked this movie. I had read the book ten years ago and was intrigued by how it would translate into film. <br /> <br /> The script is very faithful to the book, which I fell in love with - this is a rarity in itself. nowadays. The characterizations were solid and convincing, and the stroytelling kept me changing in my perceptions, even though I already knew the end of the book. <br /> <br /> A clever and well-crafted film.
