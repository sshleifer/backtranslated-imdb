I saw this 1918 movie recently in our local film archive in Helsinki. It seems that the Danish Film Institute rebuilt it in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Nordisk film company, which was one of the largest in the world in the early twentieth century. I believe that there are several copies with English translations circulating in Europe at the moment. <br /> <br /> I found the film fascinating and the voyage to Mars well thought out. The plot is certainly original, but I really do not want to reveal anything else at the moment, as now the danger of spoiling things for you really exists ;-). <br /> <br /> The film is also available on DVD, see the web pages of the Danish Film Institute (Det Danske Filminstitut) at dfi.dk with 'Himmelskibet' for more information.
