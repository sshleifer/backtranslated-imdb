This is the first cartoon of Pepe Le Pew and, to a certain extent, is much like the later ones, but in some other strange ways it is not. While Pepe's affection object is a cat, it strangely seems to be a BOY cat! This whole situation occurs because a cat is tired of being abused by others and dresses up as a possum and tries to smell like a possum so that it can be left alone. Unfortunately, that attracts our hero, Pepe. Most of the action is pretty typical to the very funny and unexpected end - and this really makes this one of the best cartoons in the series. Excellent animation (although the style is different from the later examples), excellent writing and a good sense of humor make this a keeper.
