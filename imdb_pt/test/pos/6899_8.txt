I saw this at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival and I really enjoyed it. It worked for me as a somewhat strange comedy because I do not like horror, but there were only a few minutes that I had to close my eyes. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was good, the costumes and the scenery were not too far from the quality of the BBC, which is amazing for an indie movie. I liked the way the plot twists and even snakes, this surprised me in good manners. I even got into the character Willy Grimes, whom I did not like at first. It would have been better if there had been some motivation for the woman being so interested in going to the island: this looked a lot like a plot device. <br /> <br /> I really like Dominic Monaghan, and He did a good job of falling, in horror, and in the most thoughtful moments. Good voice in the narration too. <br /> <br /> This would be a fun and unusual movie.
