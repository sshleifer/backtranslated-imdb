I do not particularly care about Michael Jackson. In addition to being a pedophile, I really do not like his music, except for a few songs from his reference album, THRILLER. This is one of them. I like this video because it is one of the first and most important video clips of all time. <br /> <br /> This was directed by John Landis, best known for horror fans as director of American Werewolf in London. This music video is not so much a video clip, but more or less a short horror film. M.J. and his date are in a werewolf movie. When they leave the movie, they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies when Michael Jackson does his famous dance "Thriller." <br /> <br /> You know, this is great music with good synthesized beats. This and "Beat It" are probably the only two Michael Jackson songs that I can tolerate over and over. I particularly love the participation of Vincent Price as narrator. His distinctive voice is perfect for a horror-themed music video. Even if you do not like M.J's music, you need to watch this video at least once. By the way, he was good before he became a scary white woman with a fake nose.
