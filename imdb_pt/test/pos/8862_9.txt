Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base is surprised by a couple of crazy Norwegians who are chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill him. All Norwegians are killed and Americans are left with nothing but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. This is the beginning of the biggest horror / thriller I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, everything to the end, you feel the tense and paranoid mood. Helpless and alone in no man's land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for the Razzie Award for his score. Why I do not know why, as far as I can see, your score is simple, scary and very good. This really leaves you in the good mood. <br /> <br /> The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog which is simply fantastic. As for Russell and the others on two legs, I can say no less. <br /> <br /> You might think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You did not see everything until you saw it. Parts of the falling body and creatures changing shapes ... Rob Bottin did a great job that today is a milestone in special effects makeup. <br /> <br /> The film did not have a great answer when it came in first place. big screen due to other alien movies at the time and so is not very well known. In fact, you can almost consider an unknown film. No one I asked has ever heard of it. However, the film managed to survive for more than twenty years as a cult movie in video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and, with the exception of the haircut, the movie is still quite up to date. This movie should be considered a classic. <br /> <br /> The film is undoubtedly one of mine, if not my favorite. I've seen it several times, but it's as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian, the only thing I do not like about this movie is that MacReady continues to call the Norwegians from Swedes!
