Seriously, I really do not understand why people here are attacking. I mean, the idea of ​​a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is quite absurd. The good news is that the producers realized this and made it a comedy in the vein of the Dark Army. <br /> <br /> Especially in the second half of the movie, when the little snowballs attack, I giggled. For example, the one put of the little ones drags itself to a blender (to la Gremlins 1) and to mix it. After that, he turns back into a snowball and shouts in a shrill voice "That was fun!". <br /> <br /> Bottom line - incredible movie, rent it.
