Somehow, I missed many of the early episodes of Farscape, so I see them in all sorts of requests as they are repeated on multiple channels. I caught him-entirely by accident-while resting in a hotel room. The first 10 seconds left me completely hooked - That's what SF is all about. <br /> <br /> The characters are strong; and Moya / Pilot the living ship is what Lexx should have been. The plots vary in quality, but none falls below excellent in my opinion. And I have to mention Rygel - what a gloriously irreverent character! None of your Star Trek aliens covered in sugar here, this is the real deal - cynical, selfish, and filled with disgusting personal habits, Rygel is the creation of a genius. <br /> <br /> Last week, the SciFi channel showed "out of their minds" (the episode of body change). A real classic, I could not stop laughing from beginning to end ... <br /> <br /> Long can Farscape decorate our screens!
