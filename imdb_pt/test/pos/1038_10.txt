I posted on IMDb in this series recently, giving a traditional mailing address on the commercial arm of BBD, where one would write for the feature release. I wrote to that address, mentioning Sam Waterson and his popularity prominently. I just received the following response: From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14, 2006 1:44:00 PM MDT To: kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> Dear Kate, I work for BBFC, the British equivalent of the MPAA, and we sort DVDs and videos as well as movies in this country. Anyway, I am currently in the process of giving a certificate for the 1980 miniseries "Oppenheimer". While researching the work on IMDb, I noticed your post and thought you'd like to know that the work is about to be released (hence the need for a certificate). <br /> <br /> I do not know which company is distributing, but keep an eye on it! <br /> <br /> Greetings, <br /> <br /> Emily +++++++++++++++++ <br /> <br /> hooray! <br /> <br /> I also want to get in touch with Netflix to buy this. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew <br /> <br /> kk2840@earthlink.net I recently emailed the BBC about whether the great Oppenheimer series has already been released on video or DVD. I could not find it. I received the following reply. If you write the BBC, be sure to mention that Sam Waterston is very popular in the USA. You can also type "Oppenheimer (1980)" on amazon.com, and find a box to check the owner's request (BBC) and be notified when it launches. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Here is the response from the BBC: <br /> <br /> Dear Kate <br /> <br /> Thank you for the Your e-mail about 'Oppenheimer'. <br /> <br /> I was interested in reading that you would like a copy of this program that you have liked. I checked the BBC store and online retailers and can not find any records to be available. We are not aware of the current plans to launch this program on DVD. However, if you would like to make a suggestion, I would suggest you write it to the BBC's commercial arm: <br /> <br /> BBC Worldwide Commissioning Editor Woodlands 80 Wood Lane London W12 0TT <br /> <br /> I would like to thank again for having had time to contact the BBC. <br /> <br /> Greetings <br /> <br /> Elaine Hunter BBC Info ______________________________________ <br /> <br /> - ---- Original Message ----- <br /> < I'm trying to find a copy of the fantastic BBC production "Oppenheimer," a six-part series made in 1980 with Sam Waterston from a book / screenplay by Peter Prince, I watched parts of it at the PBS American Playhouse, but I could not find it on video anywhere. <br /> <br /> http://www.bbc.co.uk/
