The Latter Days for me was a very moving film, it showed how hard and disrespectful the gay community really is. The film etherealizes true passion and really explores the feelings of these two characters, the film has a real depth of compassion for the gay community, as it really speaks to the gay man / woman. Personally I think it's more or less time that the homosexual community of all religions should no longer sit there ashamed, just for being there beautiful. The film was very revealing to me because I could not believe how this world really is anti-homosexual. Even in schools, if a boy does not like something, he will refer to it as being "gay." I really hope more films like this are made, and that they are not just labeled as a "Gay" movie, but as a love story because I believe gay directors should show themselves and tell their story through your eyes.
