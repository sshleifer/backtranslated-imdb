It was a movie that made you think a little. Some parts a bit cheesy, some really good parts. Plot sometimes thickened and just when you thought that Angella (Sandra) found a friend the friend was deceived or killed. All I have to say is that DENNIS MILLER should have been in the whole movie. His character was the best, very refreshing after all the crap that Angella had gone through. He would have raised me and Angella by the dumps.
