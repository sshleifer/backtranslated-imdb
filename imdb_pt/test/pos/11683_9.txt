If I assume you know what this movie is about, I am also forced to assume that you have come to this test knowing that you will probably watch it regardless of what I say. If all this sounds true - read on - you are likely to find some consonance with at least part of that review. If you are undecided, or not quite sure what happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s in urban and suburban youth culture, you should probably read one of the reviews you want to be objective. <br /> <br /> Although I did not grow up in California, the American punk scene was the first music scene I really lived in. At the height of hardcore I was immersed in 1979-1981 everyone had a band and the only common denominators between bands and members of their audiences were: <br /> <br /> * > tolerance and enjoyment of difference <br /> <br /> * desire to have fun - hard and fast <br /> <br /> Hairstyles, politics, dislike of authority figures and violent dancing were not essential for the that I experienced, though there were certainly cliques or factions that tended to be intolerant of those who did not dress, speak or act "punk" enough. And there was often a certain amount of non-gaining credit extended from some of these cliques to those who strove hard to live up to the fascist paradigm of the anarchic, mutilating, and angry young men who lived in rage. <br /> <br /> Although interviews with audience punks in Penelope Spheeris' excellent Cal-Punk documentary "Decline of Western Civilization" present a very narrow view of the subculture that some of us liked, interviews with bands, club owners, promoters and even security people are far more representative of at least my own perspective and "scene" memories. However, it is possible for those who approach this with biases about what punk is experiencing this movie without having their prejudices challenged. As regrettable as it may be, the blame for that lies solely with those who promote, believe or feel comfortable with stereotypes - not the filmmakers. Do not blame the messenger. <br /> <br /> The music presented here will not be for everyone - not even for the majority. It is not the grossest thing that exists, but it is noisy, unpleasant, quick, and less concerned with technique than with brute energy. <br /> <br /> For me, seeing the beginning of the Black Flag with Ron Reyes singing, X, Fear and the Circle Jerks was worth much more than the cost of this hard-to-get movie. As much as I like The Germs, seeing Darby Crash through the mess - and the cool guy - it made me feel a bit cold. However, the scenes of Darby playing with his pet tarantula while "Shut Down", continued and continued in the background were precious. Interview X is also great. <br /> <br /> Spheeris's direct documentary style is complemented by pots and wild zooms during the musical segments. During the interviews, the framework is used very well to provide context for what is being said. Considering his experience and budget, Spheeris did as well as anyone could have with this film. <br /> <br /> Recommended for those who appreciate what this movie really is, and for those who have forgotten those few years of fun An honest, pointless rebellion before African-American punk was co-opted for yet another stream in. of the mainstream music and stereotypes have become more important than the basic philosophy.
