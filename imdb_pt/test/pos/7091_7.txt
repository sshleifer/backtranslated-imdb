Sometimes I wonder if maybe Meryl Streep has become as accepted as the most impressive and versatile actress, since, well, maybe just about the beginning of the era of sound that maybe her talent is now given as guaranteed. There are probably about three tics that she consistently uses throughout her performances (most notably a compressed lip), but in addition, her performances are surprisingly variable and original and fresh expressions of inner workings. Even though "Sophie's Choice" and "A Cry in the Dark" and "Silkwood" may be more colorful, her work here and in "Bridges in Madison County" is also remarkable - only more subtle. In "One True Thing", she is sweeter and in love with her domesticated life, and Streep makes what can be routine, even annoying, look attractive and charming. I think she should draw up these mini-theses for each character and find out what the things are that make that person real and interesting. It works from the inside out with each character, and perhaps it is this essential quality that has evoked major criticisms of indifference or self-awareness. I do not think she's cold at all, but instead she thought of the unique qualities of her character. I think your critics are confusing self-consciousness with intelligence. Not many other actors would be so complex, thoughtful and creative as to make Kate Muldrun light and carefree inside her beloved home environment, only to reveal unprecedented depth because of her genuine connection to that cozy environment. Her performances are of unsurpassed consistency, she rarely does anything wrong. I wonder if it is conceivable that any of Streep's images do not seem diminished because of her presence ... Anyway, Kate loves her at home, and her affection for her "family life" is as captivating as her new conflict within Home is shocking. When all of this comes along, and Kate begins to recognize that she can no longer function in the same capacity, and she breaks the pie plate and screams that she is not deficient, it is painfully sad to watch because it has not been someone prone to emotion . Streep is smart enough and generous enough to recognize how much better it all works out because she has felt Kate's dramatic validity and is really the only scene she allows her character to go. But how refreshing it is to see a character who can really surprise you by showing you something you would not have thought possible. Again, Streep's character has at least three dimensions ... God, this sounds like a thesis in itself, but as an actress, Streep only has a special kind of intelligence, incredible empathy, and great expressive abilities. The movie itself is probably a bit mediocre. I suppose William Hurt is an idiot, and he does very well. I think Hurt is really kind of scary, though. Script is quite normal - another tribute to Streep that she was as touching and believable as she was.
