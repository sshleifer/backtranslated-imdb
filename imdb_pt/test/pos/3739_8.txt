That's right, we have a 2008 movie using themes like "Brief Encounter" and "The Bridges of Madison County". It is basically the story of lost loves, redemption and a triumph of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> The performances of Richard Gere and especially Diane Lane are very good. Gere gives the kind of performance contained here as a doctor who is looking for meaning after a patient dies on the operating table. Lane is the mother of a rebellious daughter and a good son, who separated from her errant husband and also suffered the loss of his father that same year. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn steals the show in a one scene encounter with Gere. He is the husband with a broken heart and he tells his love to his deceased wife, it will bring tears to his eyes. Fresh from her triumph as an acquiescent mother in "Doubt," Viola Davis appears as a friend understanding in the film and literally hangs her hair down in a rather benign performance.
