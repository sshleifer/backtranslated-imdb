The Kite Hunter must win an Oscar! It is perfect in every way, in history, in script, in acting, in cinematography ... No one would have imagined it was filmed in China. The story of two childhood friends and what follows in their adult lives will leave a lasting impression. The depiction of life in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime is very real and horrifying. I have not read the book, but I have seen comments that put the film down because "the book is always better" ... It does not really matter. Nobody put "And the Wind Took" because it was not faithful to the book! As a matter of fact, he won an Oscar for best picture and several other Oscars. I think this movie is brilliant - BRAVO for the writer and director, and the actors!
