Surprisingly good drama "Mean Streets" -type crime. Preliminary elements of "Goodfellas" and "Casino". Joe Pesci's first major role. Smart Dialogue. I think the Maltin guide gives a bomb rating. I can only imagine that no one really bothered to watch. <br /> <br /> I saw this at the Tarantino festival and he said that Scorsese used several of these actors in Raging Bull.
