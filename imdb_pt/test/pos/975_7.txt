Much better than expected. A good family movie - see the reruns. The whole is more than the sum of its parts. Paul Giamatti chews the stage - he has a lot more talent than the role deserves. A treat to watch Inspector Uhl from "The Illusionist" is exaggerated. The blue man scenes had my 11 years in points. The apparitions were fun for the parents - it's good to see Lee Majors and Urkel (Jaleel) again. It will be hard to think of 10 lines for this movie, but let's hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and his parents! Amanda Bynes does a good job when she becomes part of the bite. I usually can not stand Frankie Muniz, but he's right here. Let's take the hat off to the casting director - if only to hire Giamatti!
