The mega-epic, Raoul Walsh's spectacular shot in a widescreen process by the great Arthur Edeson, can be slow and static in early talkie modes, but this classic train ride across America to the northwest is thrilling as a pure physical production when viewed on the big screen. In t.v., the lack of close-ups and distant sound reproduction can be daunting. Young John Wayne easily scores in his first lead role with a natural delivery that the rest of the cast can not command. Surprisingly, the film failed and Wayne spent most of the next decade in Western Grade B forage.
