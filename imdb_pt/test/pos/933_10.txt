The final part of Kieslowski's trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematographic image. In red, the image is key, as well as the obvious but intelligent color coding. However, instead of adhering to empty aesthetic inventions based on the cinema du look, the Kieslowski Red is a multi-layered meditation, densely drawn on the nature of fate and love. In Red, love and fate are intertwined, but complex notions dictated by the whims of human beings as well as by the invisible parallel associations that seem to pass through us. You feel that red is really an allegory, a re-enactment of the ubiquitous gestures of Prospero in The Storm, however, is more than your story appears. Red demands innumerable visions, and in each vision something new is discovered, which intertwines in the structure already woven in an immaculate form. <br /> <br /> Although red serves alone as a masterpiece by Kieslowski, it is best seen as part of the trilogy. Blue and white elements are referenced in red, which viewers will enjoy.
