The used submarine was not Varangian! In fact, there were two boats, P614 and P615, both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng in Barrow-in-Furness, but kept by the Royal Navy during the war. The P615 was sunk, but the P614 was finally delivered in 1945. <br /> <br /> The confusion no doubt arose because someone looked at the P61 (as I did) and found Varangiano! When, in fact, the last digit of P614 and P615 was in fact painted only ... <br /> <br /> There are some extremely realistic moments in the film. These Turkish boats were very similar to S-class. As no S-class submarine has survived, their shots (as P61) and tanker "Forth" are part of an interesting record now, plus an excellent movie.
