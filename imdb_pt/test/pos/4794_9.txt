Luis Bunuel has always been a filmmaker whose work was obscure to me. My first experience with him was The Discreet Charm of Bourgeosie, often considered his greatest work, with which I became so frustrated and bored that I ended up closing the tape. In the same way Belle de Jour, which is almost certainly his most well-known film and also generally considered one of his many masterpieces, did not interest me much. I did not hate it like I did with Discreet, but I did not like it. Thirdly, I saw L'Age d'Or. Finally, I had arrived somewhere. Fourth, Los Olvidados, is also good. Still, neither L'Age d'Or nor Los Olvidados surprised me. Great movies, but not masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Nazarin is my fifth Bunuel, and I like just a little more than the other two. He is a priest from Spain, now in Mexico, who refuses to live in the kind of luxury in which most fathers live. He wants to be more like Jesus, leading the mildest life possible. He is also willing to forgive everyone for anything and to suffer without protest. I'm sure Bunuel does not like the character and considers him a little hypocritical. However, I just assume that because of my knowledge of the director, whose most famous quote is "Thank God, I'm still an atheist," which he apparently said in an interview about this same film (I get this information from John Baxter's book on Bunuel, if you're interested). The interviewer who dragged those words out of Bunuel's mouth must have mistaken himself for Nazarin. The one who was more inclined to believe in religious conviction, who also knows nothing about Bunuel, can see the priest as a hero figure. This is especially true if this viewer has his own criticisms of organized religion. The priest may be a little hypocritical, but he seems to be basically a good man. When he harbors a violent prostitute in his bedroom in order to protect her (and presumably to save her soul), people begin to discover and assume that their relationship is sexual. Your superiors assume the same and punish you for it. He later suffered even worse punishments from the clergymen.
