This film is a long-running remake of Fritz Lang's masterpiece "M-Murder." It's well done and with a fun key to talk about fairly serious events and contemporary issues at Eurobe, but not just around the world. Ethnic intolerance is such an evil and very contagious nowadays. Thus, "Children of Wax", or as it is known in the US distribution, reveals the question of German and Turkish hatred in a fun way. There is no doubt that it is well received to be distributed by the great Weinsten brothers. I liked the most is the participation in this film of the favorite actor of Lars von Trier the great Udo Kier that shows to play with such pleasure for the Bulgarian filmmaker Ivan Nichev.
