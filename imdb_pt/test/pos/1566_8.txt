Six of the seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses. The only negative review that happened was (or did) on the first page of the film's IMDb location. <br /> <br /> I found "What Alice Found" to be one of the best movies almost no one heard of that I saw this year. His rating 6.4 is misleading and may be more a function of the subject matter than the film quality. Who would have thought that a movie supposedly about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing? Guess again. <br /> <br /> For me, "Alice" was a positively thrilling psychological thriller. I was practically on the edge of my seat all the time. It's a very credible story with a realistic script and it's very well done. In a fairer world, actress Judith Ivey would win prizes for keeping you guessing whether she was good or bad. <br /> <br /> Ignore the review and watch this great movie. (And by the way, I wish there was a soundtrack album.)
