I was surprised to read the comments of the person who did not like this movie. It's really very funny. There are definitely some laughs that my boyfriend and I quote each other. Some of the situations can be disturbing (bisexuality, drugs, a particularly strange view of the child's sexuality), but they are believable at the same time. It is about communication and lack of communication between men and women.
