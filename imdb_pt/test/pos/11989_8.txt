Incredible, one of my favorite movies at the end. I think I can take pride in not liking what "the general population" tends to look for. Jackie Mason is hilarious in this movie, and Randy Quaid is also hilarious. I can never get enough of his "strong arm" tactics, as in Moving. He was also notable in the National Lampoon's Christmas holiday. I love this guy.
