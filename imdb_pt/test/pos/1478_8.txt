I'm evaluating this out loud just because of Sam Elliott. I could have done without female nudity, but I'd go through almost any absurdity to see Sam show his stuff. He begins to utter wonderfully cynical jokes, many of which I agree with, and it is a joy to see him in a role in which he can actually thrill himself instead of standing around frowning and manly as he might be. My boyfriend opined that this movie resembles a movie in which Ed Harris had a Hispanic partner (in the police sense of the term!) Who was a little anxious to prove himself. You can draw your own conclusions about this, but if you like Sam, you'll enjoy this. You could say I'm partial, but who is not somehow? I would buy this on DVD in a heartbeat!
