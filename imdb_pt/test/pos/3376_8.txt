The premise is quite original and well thought out, but unfortunately, a good story is a very low budget that does not even allow for decent special effects. Jeff Fahey does his best among a poor cast, as does the always beautiful Linda Hoffman. They should make more movies together. The film, while not deserving much praise, guarantees at least one preview.
