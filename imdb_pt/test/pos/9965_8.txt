Michael Radford, the director of "The Merchant of Venice" does a tremendous job opening the game, as he makes it more accessible for everyone to have a great time in the cinema watching this thorny account of a horrible moment in history. The delightful production of Shakespeare's play is a feast for the eyes with its rich details of sixteenth-century Venice. <br /> <br /> This is a story of revenge, prejudice and justice, as William Shakespeare imagines. Having seen the play a few times, we were not prepared for what to expect. Mr. Radford is in charge of presenting the story in so many details so that it can be easily understood by all. In addition, he used a version of English that makes more sense than depending on the original text. In fact, the way Shylock speaks in the film does not shock him, being a member of a minority that has been marginalized by the Venetian authorities and the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Awful Pacino Shylock's picture shows a man vulnerable, arrogant, vindictive, stingy and totally human, all at the same time. Pacino sheds light on the character of the man who is defeated in court by a technical detail. His own daughter has left him and his whole world seems to be falling on him. At the end of the movie, we see a man who has been reduced to being hatred and ridicule by all. <br /> <br /> Lynn Collins, as Portia is a happy discovery. After having seen her in a lighter walkway, she not only surprises but also makes the best of her role and her time in front of the camera. She shows us that she is a woman of great intelligence who comes to the aid of her husband and her best friend who risked her own health by trying to help Bassanio take Portia's hand. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays Antonio, the man who looks for Shylock for a "bridge loan." After all, he knows his ships will be returning with foreign fortunes soon enough. Antonio gets much more than he expected when agreeing with Shylock with the terms of the loan. Antonio's best plans go astray when he is suddenly unable to fulfill his obligations. Mr. Irons gives a subtle performance. <br /> <br /> Joseph Fiennes makes a good appearance as Bassanio. Her good looks and charm impress Portia, who clearly sees a soul mate in this young Venetian because she knows he's the one for her. In addition, in smaller roles, Kris Marshall, Zuleika Robinson and Charlie Cox all contribute to making the film a pleasurable experience. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is Mr. Radford's triumph because of the vision he gives us of Venice and its citizens during a horrific period in the history of mankind.
