Fulci ... Does this man have one of the weirdest, weirdest films ever made? Answer: yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as Nightmare Concert, is Fulci's latest masterpiece. Yes, it does not matter what some people say about it. There are few facts that this film is one of Fulci's best films. <br /> <br /> Fulci has fun and makes movies with this movie. Lead roll in this film is none other then Fulci himself, who plays ... well director of horror-splatter-gore, who thinks he's going crazy. It is full of black humor that, unlike most modern horror movies, works here. Being Fulci flick, you need to know it's bloody. How many? Well practically. I've always loved blood in the movies and I never tire of it, but Cat in the Brain actually stopped my bloodlust, and believe me, it's hard to file. Even Braindead did not stop. CITB is all about blood. Almost every scene revolves around Fulci, who after being hypnotized by * khmmm *, evil psychiatrists are seeing all sorts of horrors for whatever happens to him or whatever he sees. Some of the scenes involve him accidentally dropping the whiskey, and instead he sees a rotting corpse on the floor, which begins to spit some of his wounds. Forget the Beyond or Zombie 2, this is the most fulci film! Now I like how Fulci can apply all these comic parts in the gorefest movie. He's such a brilliant director. Some funny moments and lines happen from time to time, as what Fulci says "making bloody movies is a kind of disease." The ending is very good considering that Fulci (and most of the Italian horror masters) is known for making meaningless end or many plot holes. If you are fun of the Fulci, do not forget to check it out. If you have a weak stomach, avoid it and repeat "It's just a movie" ps. Some of the bloody scenes within this film: Chainsaw breakup (complete), torn tongue, torn eyeballs, larval infested corpses, zombies, beheadings, face being thrown in boiling water, stabbing in the shower (head), throat crevice, many body parts and organs being toasted aside, hammer crushed face ...
