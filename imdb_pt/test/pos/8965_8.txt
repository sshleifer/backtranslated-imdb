... with a single act. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson, congressman, a real character. During the 1990s, when communism in the USSR, the Berlin Wall and the war in Afghanistan (with the Soviets) broke down. He did this, a single denial of money, and everything fell. It must be remembered, so here it is. Your memorial. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Funny, dramatic, snobbish, political or boring. Anyway, it's a clever film about political life, about governing the world, and about, above all else, a lesson to the world. A lesson for every policy out there, a critical point of view referring to countries that support wars with money, weapons and words. Lesson Learned - The world is not a good place to live
