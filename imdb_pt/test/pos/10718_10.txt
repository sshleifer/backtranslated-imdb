This is a phenomenal movie. Truly one of the best movies I've ever watched. I am a serious critic and it takes a lot to shake me, but this movie had all the right combinations to "tinker" with. The passion of the actors, without the overcoming, the pain for all the characters involved, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, all this makes it a film not to be missed, despite the fact that it is the 1970s. This is definitely not a "old movie", but a classic / vintage film. I hope you get involved with this as I did when you consider how volatile relationships of all kinds can be when you also consider how the deep pain associated with love can be and how the hardest decisions to make will always be the most painful , but once they are done the pain will subside, but only gradually. This film certainly demonstrates that more volatile relationships are not necessarily fragile and that getting out certainly is not synonymous with loss / lack of love. The 'creation' of this film certainly emanates from a deep place within one's heart and mind.
