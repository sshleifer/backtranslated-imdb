I and some friends we formed university - alberto lopez, dave hall, celina alcock (we formed in uea, norwich, united kingdom in 1997) we still meet and watch b movies once a month. <br /> <br /> Consuming experts in the art of making bad films, and this film was quickly put into the top 10 of horrible / brilliant films. <br /> <br /> If you just bought the beers and weeds, and need a movie to laugh like a drain, DROID GUNNER aka PHOENIX 2 is the movie for you! Marc Singer is fully aware that you are in a movie turkey here, and milking all you can! Matthius Hues is sublime in his timber performance and his muscular moreness (is that a word?) As he grunts "But I want my 20 grand!" Pure Gold Shlock! TRANCERS, THE RUNESTONE, DOLLMAN and anything from Charles Band or Fred Olen Ray ..... (but be warned: some of your movies are completely and totally without merit and you'll be screaming for those lost hours of your life !!!?!).
