Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it as a horror adventure far worse than I had expected. Instead, director Jeff Lieberman evokes a wonderfully evocative and disturbing atmosphere for large stretches of the film, building the suspense constantly, until I was really unsure of what was going to happen, but I ended up tight as a spring waiting for him. The lack of action in many parts gave him a very Deliverance mixed with the medium The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and when the action really kicks in, it is truly shocking and dramatic without even really needing to be bloody. The characters are similar to this kind of movie, although nicer than some, and the villain, frighteningly weird. Photography and suspense are the real winners in this film and prevent it from being always boring (as suggested). I strongly recommend this to serious horror fans. Do not wait for blood, expect a creepy tale with several incredible moments and a dreamy atmosphere.
