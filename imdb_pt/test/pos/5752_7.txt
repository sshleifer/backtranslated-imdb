I can not see how some people can not find this funny movie I saw the end of it at Sky Movies in 2001 I thought I'd go for the DVD ever since I laughed my balls with lines like Rik Mayalls laughing "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA" and Eddies "Hello night porter" when they never get phone calls in general, I think this movie is very funny.
