Okay, when I rented this several years ago, I had the worst expectations. Yes, the acting is not great, and the image itself looks dated, but while I was there, something strange happened. I started to like this. The action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump. Brion James, perhaps one of the greatest actors of level B next to Bruce Campbell, is great as always. The story is not bad either. Now I would not rush to buy it, but you would not waste your time, at least watching this good post-apocalyptic Western.
