What you saw in BULLITT and THE FRANCHISE CONNECTION is nothing compared to what you have here. The chase lasts almost 15 minutes and is the best you've ever seen. This film has become a classic crime drama from the heyday of the '70s films. It is a bold and realistic portrait of the average streets of New York City. Featuring one of the smartest ever put on the screen, Tony Lo Bianco's behavior in this movie is cool as ice. He is tearing out his own associates and making it seem like the police are responsible. His childhood friend, Roy Scheider, is a street detective who is intrigued by the disappearance of the mafiosi. You can say that Lo Bianco is enjoying the game throughout the movie. Sometimes the movie gets monotonous, but when you feel like giving up, something big happens and it draws you back. The score of Don Ellis sets the tone of the cold and gray winter in New York and on top of that, my man Joe Spinell appears in an early role as Toredano, the garage man. Score, 7 out of 10 Stars
