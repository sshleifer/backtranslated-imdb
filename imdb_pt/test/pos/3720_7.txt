Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic rendering and very very intimate. The most noticeable element of the film is its silence; nobody talks. I do not think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later works, meant as any kind of legal device. I think what makes it so clever and effective is the fact that, with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read based on intuition and the transmission of emotion, no matter how small. Although I was not glued to the canvas after reflection, I see that it is a very touching and sensitive perspective of human nature. Your vehicle is the stylized science fiction movie. Part of his reflection on the nature of the human world is that each of his human beings is not necessarily played as a perfect human being: the hero, a lonely wanderer in the new desolate world, is taken by an older recluse, who refuses to keep his share of a food exchange between him and a hoarse, brutal character played by Jean Reno, and so Reno tries everything he can, using predominantly brute force, to get what he wants. So the antagonist is right, despite not being a good person, and the protagonist and his nice role are wrong, even though both are good people. <br /> <br /> He is filmed in a clear and crisp black and white, edited and captured in a discreet yet spry and small scale approach, and his actors are very real. How can they not be? They, like their characters, are left with basic communication needs. This is one of the few truly good movies that Luc Besson wrote. Your previous work is almost always better than the fluff it now produces.
