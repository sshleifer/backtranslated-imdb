I recently had the pleasure of seeing this emotionally-charged film by director Mani Ratnam at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2002. I granted my highest honor to the Film Festival in this film. Make sure you do not let an opportunity to try this movie gem pass you by ... but be forewarned: this movie will make you shed a tear if you belong to the species known as homo sapien! A 10 !!
