This is a movie about loneliness and how far? physical and emotional - among people tends to hurt relationships. <br /> <br /> The narrative is simple to the point of banality: a young Yusuf (Emin Toprak) from a rural village comes to Istanbul to stay with his oldest and most successful cousin, Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir) ; Yusuf wants work in the big city. After trying for a few weeks to find work to no avail, the strain of having Yusuf living with him is too much for Mahmut. They fight? nothing physical, just verbal. Eventually, Yusuf leaves, leaving Mahmut alone again. End of story ... Except for the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best in the film. Much is said visually; Dialogue is used to reveal disagreement, mistrust, hostility and insecurity that exist within and between the two men. <br /> <br /> There are many visual gems in this movie. For example, while looking for work, young Yusuf, in need of a relationship, tries in vain to catch the attention of several young women in the city. The look on his face, as he is frustrated every time, says it all. <br /> <br /> Or, wanting a cigarette, Yusuf opens the balcony door of Mahmut's apartment and lights the icy December air. leaving the door open; Mahmut eventually gets up from his desk, walks to the door (all glass) and the cousins ​​just look at each other for what seems like a long time. Then Mahmut closes the door, leaving Yusuf in the cold. The metaphor is complete. <br /> <br /> Or, Mahmut cleaning up after Yusuf, reluctantly and with increasing anger; and all the time, Yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of seriously looking for work, and spends Mahmut's money on a toy for a nephew ?? Yusuf is emotional, sloppy, impulsive and vulnerable. Mahmut is rational, logical, self-confident and a maniac by demanding control: the dichotomy of the right brain, on the left side of the brain, represented by two actors who say more with a look, a gesture, a frown that any word can convey. But Mahmut is not completely without emotion: he still loves his ex-wife telling him that she is going to Canada with her future husband. Mahmut affects a distant and confident friendship with her ex, and ensures that she is well on her way. He wants her well. He says goodbye. He leaves the cafeteria where they were talking. Later, when she calls to say one last goodbye, on the way to the airport, Mahmut goes there and secretly watches as she leaves. The poignancy of the emotion in her face as she disappears through a door, is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a featured work by the two main actors and the director, Nuri Ceylan. Some may argue that the pace is too slow; but life goes slow most of the time, especially for those who are alone. The work of the camera is also relatively simple: choose the scene, set the camera and lighting, and let the actors move through the scene, enter the scene and leave the scene, all the while keeping the camera still. There were some panoramic photos, some high angle shots, some rural scenes ?? but much of the film is shown as if it were on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide-angle lens. With the exception of radio and TV music within the story, there is no music soundtrack. And there are many long silences as the two sit and watch TV together and / or engage in very limited conversations. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on TV, so I had fun seeing it in one. On some occasions, I was watching TV while they watched TV too. The silence in the movie matched the silence of my house (I was awake, everyone else in bed); my chair and position matched those of Mahmut while he watched TV. Very strange, giving me a feeling of almost "being there" with him? And in a way, I think I did. <br /> <br /> I will not say anymore, because I want you to enjoy the other scenes that I have not described. It's not a movie for everyone, that's for sure. More than any movie I saw, it shows how much we die when we're alone ?? Just as we are alone when we die. Mahmut's face, as it darkens in the final scene, will stay with me for a very, very long time ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for serious cinephiles.
