Probably because this is Columbia's first color film, the colors look different, especially in the inner scenes. They seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic, but very enjoyable. Randolph Scott is the sheriff, a cool guy, but the real star of the movie is young Glenn Ford, who is an outlaw who wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is the woman who starts falling for Ford and Claire Trevor is the countess who runs the salon. There is a funny character named Nitro who does not think twice before blowing it up. I particularly enjoyed two moments of the movie, one when there is a tremendous stampede of horses and you see thousands of horses, there was no computer to help at that time, so I presume they must have gathered all those horses, no easy task. Another time is the final shootout, technically very good. There is also a punch fight. Seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes makes you come to a sad conclusion: they do not make them anymore. Would they be able, if they wished? I have my doubts.
