I saw this movie when it was released in theaters. It's definitely one to remember, I'd forgotten the title until recently. A friend found him by searching online. <br /> <br /> A dark night is quite unusual for the suspense / horror genre of the time when it does not contain blood. It's the variety of teenage fear, but teens are respectable in their own ways. It's a good old school movie with props and scenes that reflect the times. Our hero rides a motorcycle without a brain bucket, for example. <br /> <br /> As mentioned by previous reviewers, One Dark Night is currently available on DVD. The original negative was not available for the DVD transition. Some coil changes are a bit rough, but that does not take away the story. That said, the colors are vibrant and the lighting is very good. <br /> <br /> Adam West plays a fairly small role in this film as RayMar's son-in-law. Her role as a domineering and indifferent husband is blessedly short. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds throughout the film. Unlike many horror films of the time, One Dark Night is a great suspense story that gives the viewer time to absorb what is happening. <br /> <br /> The final 20 minutes of One Dark Night are what make it so memorable. RayMar's telekinetic skills are used to open old graves in the mausoleum, pull the coffins out, open them and move the corpses around. Attention was given to great detail in the final scenes. The corpses rotted and riddled with worms seem quite real.
