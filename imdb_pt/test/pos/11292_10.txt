The visual effectiveness of this film is unmatched by anything I've seen. And the work needed to achieve it must have been incredibly long and tedious (you do not just have the "Kodak Grainy Film" on your camera to get that look). Do not watch this movie to have fun, watch it to be visually stimulated, see it challenged and provoked in your thoughts in movies and in any other subject that comes to your mind, religion will probably be a thought. <br />
