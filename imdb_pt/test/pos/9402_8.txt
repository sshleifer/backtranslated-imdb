this is a TV movie based on the murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich in the mid-'70s, based on how much it's hard to say. That's right. It's based on the book written by Mark Fuhrman. In any way, the film portrays crime in flashbacks and its aftermath, including the arrest of a suspect, some 25 years later, who was never considered a suspect at the time. In the film, Fuhram is, of course, largely responsible for the arrest and closure of the case by Martha. survivor family, in particular his mother. The narrative of the film is from the ghost of Martha Moxley, speaking in first person. This is a very effective device in this movie. For me, that adds more impact to the film, and puts a human face on the murder victim (if only an actress playing the role) Maggie Grace plays Martha, and I was really impressed with her. There is no way to know for certain why Mark Fuhrman was investigating the crime. a sense of justice and maybe he really cared. Or maybe it just a dollar from a bestselling book future. Either way, it's an interesting movie. He is well acted and quite fast. I did not think there was a lot of unnecessary extra things in the movie, just what was needed to tell the story. One could argue that they left out the things that would have clarified the procedures a little more, and that someone would be right. Also, it could be argued that the ending was abrupt and that again one would be right. I said, to me, I think they told the story with at least most of the essentials. Anything else would probably have required a miniseries. As an aside, there is a miniseries entitled "A Season in Purgatory" that came out 6 years later. (1996), that this movie has some parallels, even if only weak. If you like this movie, "So you might be interested in" A Season in Purgatory. "I believe that" a season in purgatory "is actually , a fictional account of the same crime. Anyway, to me, Murder in Greenwich "is an 8/10
