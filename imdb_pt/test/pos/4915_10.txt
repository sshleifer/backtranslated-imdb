When that popped up at the Seattle International Film Festival, I was the only person standing, clapping and clapping. The rest of the crowd booed or fell silent. It's a small well-played movie that deeply touches the reality of the humanity of a gay young man. It's about a real man; and does not play with the insipid, muscular "gay paositive" that goes through the genre of gay cinema that is not pornographic (and that's why many of the contemporary films of the Gay genre are so monotonous). This film is Intense Passion and Great Tragedy. The acting, direction and cinematography are fantastic; everything keeps the movie clastrophobic, tense and passionate. Do not miss it if you can find it.
