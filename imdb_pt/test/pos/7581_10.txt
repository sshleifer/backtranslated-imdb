Anderson's animation rivals easily with Pixar's and goes beyond anything I've seen at Disney. While some say the story is a bit abstract, I think it's a thought-provoking and refreshing change from the overblown characters and the cluttered animals normally found in short animated films. It's an interplanetary version of CASTAWAY! Anyone who has left the safe haven of home and gone alone to a lonely and frightening spot will readily identify with this helpless microbe. Great job, Mr. Anderson! <br /> <br />
