The film is yet another mockumentary of corruption throughout the American system. Correlations of those who vote that do not matter are as proven on machines that end up voting a comedian to the oval office. Politicians are a joke we almost need a comic book to represent us as we have been ridiculed for years all over the world. Bushism has become a way of life for Americans and will be the only thing left after he leaves office no sooner. Strangely the only person of honesty is someone who has not even been elected to the post and tells the truth in the end. The story is very subtle and if you're for laughter, this is not happening. Lets leave thinking. Overall I enjoyed it.
