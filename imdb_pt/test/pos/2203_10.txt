Although video technology can be dated, this classic musical piece, now on DVD, is the best version of Sondheim's most important and refined work on Broadway. If you've never seen SWEENEY TODD then you should buy this DVD. I saw this production in November 1980 at the Kennedy Center in Washington - and I fell in love with a pre - "Murder She Wrote" Angela Lansbury. Subsequently, I tried to find all her work, including: MOVIES: "The Harvey Girls", "The Portrait of Dorian Gray", "Manchurian Candidate"; CDs: "Mame", "Dear World" and "Gypsy"; and many more. The rest of the cast is flawless as well. All in all, this wonderful DVD gives us the definitive version of Sondheim's opera!
