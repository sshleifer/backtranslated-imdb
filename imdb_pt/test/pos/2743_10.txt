This is a witty and delicious adaptation of Dr. Seuss's book, brilliantly animated by the best of UPA and deserving of his Oscar. Special mention should be made of the excellent soundtrack and sound effects, which are an integral element to help make this drawing so memorable and enjoyable. Subsequent episodes of the series (of which there were four in all) were not actually based on Dr. Seuss's original material, although all but the latter continued to use his familiar rhyming style. The three sequences were: Symphony by Gerald McBoing Boing (1953); As now Boing Boing (1954); Gerald McBoing Boing on Planet Moo (1956) - although it also appeared in a later episode of Mr. Magoo.
