One of my favorite movies. I like horses, I like happy endings and I like Walter Matthau. I miss him and I'm glad to have a great movie like that to remind me why he was so wonderful. Watch it with your kids (or your horse). <br /> <br /> The story of an old hard horse trainer with children, and his luck. If you've ever had or enjoyed horse racing, you'll appreciate the rags to the riches plot. It may be a little below "Seabiscuit", but not much. The story is the same, except that it is the quarter horse version. Proper running and running terms and equipment, plus good running scenes. Do not take my word for it, take it and make your own opinion.
