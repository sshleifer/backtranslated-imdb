Age can not stain the beauty of this East-West love story for me. Ignoring the famous and lovely title song and its lyrics, what we have is a dramatized biography of two remarkable people caught in a moment of countercurrents involving social conformity, fanaticism, war, doubt, and the need for immense courage. With Hong Kong in the background, this film tells the story of an Eurasian physician and an American journalist who know each other and fall in love during the Korean War. Like Mark Elliott, William Holden is smart, cheerful and a little weak; Jennifer Jones may be almost perfect as Dr. Han Suyin, in turn, full of doubts and ecstatic, anxious and hesitant. Others in the big cast include Toro Thatcher, Isobel Elsom, Murray Matheson, Virginia Gregg, Richard Loo, Soo Yong, Philip Ahn, Jorja Curtright and Donna Martell; many of Hollywood's best Eastern actors also played smaller parts without credits. John Patrick's script closely followed Han's exquisite novel; Henry King's direction was solid as ever. The plot of the plot is how reluctant Han was to fall in love with Elliott, with his busy schedule and demanding as a doctor and his doubts about his future; and how fearless he was, despite the intolerance and interference they faced when their case became known. The film is arguably physically busy, interesting and often beautiful as well. The hill where the lovers are going to separate, the beautiful bay where they swim is turned into a busy and crowded commercial city, big social events and crowded streets, hospital corridors and traffic-laden arteries. With the cinematography of Leon Shamroy, Ben Nye's make-up and Helen Turpin's hairstyles, the great work of set designers, sound and lighting, art department and all concerned, this is one of the most memorable productions of a great city outside the USA. all the time, and one of the hardest to capture in the movie. However, what reminds us most here are lovers, fortunately not very young, facing the odds against them and evaluating exactly what they are - and then proceeding as if love matters and the conditions that are placed as barriers to love do not. The climax of the case is that Mark is returning to war; after that, Han receives his letters, even after knowing that he was killed; they look like messages of better quality. A world where hope is all that matters, courage is the price of admission to this world, and it is always summer on a high, windy hill separated and above an area where beauty and individual desires can be victimized, subdued diseases. fortune or set apart by the militant forces of evil. Truly, love is something very splendorous, says Dr. Han; and this film stands out as one of the brilliant proofs of doctrine, transparent as a pearl, timeless as a Chinese proverb and adorable as polished jade against a rustic background.
