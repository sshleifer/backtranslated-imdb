Hello, looking for a family movie to watch on a Friday night? Can not find what you are looking for? I thought this was an extremely nice movie. Good for the whole family. I found it had a remarkably rare combination of being attractive to adults and children. It was brilliant, to say the least. Bruce Willis's acting was first-rate, there was a lot of humor and overall a great movie. In my opinion, it's a must-see movie. And I do not think about many movies, believe me when I say it takes a lot for a movie to make me think about it. Of course there was a lot of work done by Bruce Willis and cast to finish this movie. Excellent story, good acting and, again, overall, a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
