I do not have much faith in the beginning, but as a citizen of Costa Rica I can confirm that the film shows the reality that we live day by day, and shows many things of our culture, like the way of speaking, our music, our way of defending our rights without fear, without any weapon. <br /> <br /> I am very proud of the work they did and how they did not forget the message throughout the film. they wanted us to receive, not caring about the money, but actually working on a short budget, allowing us to enjoy the beautiful scenery and great photography. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend you watch this movie, you will not regret it.
