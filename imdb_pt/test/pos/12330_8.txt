I can not describe the feeling when I have this low quality VHS tape rental in my hands about 20 years ago. Somehow I got my dad to rent it for me and I watched my younger brother twice. Yes, we have nightmares. This film was originally rated PG in the US, in many other countries, including Finland, it was restricted to children under 18 or 16 years. The film was directed at teenagers, but this should be the darkest movie ever. There is no bad language or nudity in it so ever. Originally made in 1981, it remained on the shelves for a couple of years before launch. <br /> <br /> This is a Class A B movie, a true 80's horror movie well done. A group of college girls decides to spend a night in a mausoleum, not knowing that a supernatural evil awaits ... <br /> <br /> You can almost smell the rotten flesh and feel the atmosphere of this movie. It's extravagant, totally stupid, but they just can not make those movies anymore. There is definitely a certain feel for this 80's horror genre. This is still really scary and fun after all these years. <br /> <br /> Effects are just a quality dripping by Ellis Burman Jr and Thomas R. Burman. The make-up effects play a major role in this film, otherwise it would just be a boring teen slasher. <br /> <br /> It is now finally available on DVD and is a Special Edition DVD including some extras as well. Range of comments is interesting. Below the average DVD download, some flaws and scratches here and there) In the beginning it would be released by Blue Underground, but unfortunately it was canceled. , then the Shriek Show launched it without restoring the impression. What a shame!) <br /> <br /> Great date movie! <br /> <br /> Recommended !!! <br /> <br /> Note! I only gave 8 out of 10 because of the "nostalgic values", otherwise 6 out of 10
