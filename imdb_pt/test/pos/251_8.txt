A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on Broadway, which means she would have to leave the small theater where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends and every Friday they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat it). The story line offers numerous opportunities for music and dance. The film has two questions that Rusty must answer: Is fame all that is cracked? and is it really less so if you are happy? Answering these questions makes the movie. The film also does a good job showing the talents that all three directors had. Never a dull moment!
