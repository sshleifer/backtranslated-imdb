I just love this show. It's so funny and cool. Kuzco is such a hilarious and interesting character, I love him. He's what makes this show what it is, even though Kronk and Yzma are so funny and charming too. All about this show is great for me because it always manages to make me laugh, it does not matter if it's just an episode once. It's so funny and all the characters are so nice and cool that make the show worth watching, unlike some fucking on the Disney Channel. Give this show a chance next time, if you've ever seen the movie, and even if you have not seen the movie, you'll find it to be very enjoyable, so go ahead.
