This was a great series for blacks at the time. We loved it very much. It was the only show about black middle-class families on t.v. at the moment. Please release this on DVD. I know many ... many people who still talk about the show. If I am released, I am sure many young black people will find this enlightening and interesting. The program covered many topics such as racism, race discrimination, teenage pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer pressure, and more. The show ended so abruptly and left the fans speechless and wondering why it was taken off the air. Since then, we've only seen a few of the actors and actresses. Please release it on DVD as soon as possible.
