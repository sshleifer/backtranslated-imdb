I watched this when it was first shown and then lost when it disappeared from the British screens. It showed a different side of Old Australia that we need to see more. Good juxtaposition of old Turkish youth. So the realism of the album was fantastic. Unfortunately it was lost. This show was a cold look on the old way of looking at Australia. Difficult life and hard work. The young idealist shocked at the old practical head. Real Politicka fighting with the young beginners of New Labor. To add modern political vernacular. <br /> <br /> This show was the first of its kind that I came across that did not try to do a tourist job in Australia. It was a great demonstration of the realistic kind of documentary show. Some good movies were at the time doing similar work. It would be great to see more of this kind of TV coming from Australia, because unfortunately, it has been missing for the last twenty years. because all we have fed is the soap pulp of variable quality.
