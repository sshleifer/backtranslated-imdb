Family Guy has to be my favorite cartoon of all time. It's definitely the funniest TV show ever made and it's better than The Simpsons. I've never laughed so hard at a TV show in my life. plot, characters and themes that are dealt with in the show. There are very few themes that were not dealt with in Family Guy. <br /> <br /> I saw just about every episode of Family Guy ever done and would have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons. My favorite characters are Peter because he is very funny and is the best character of the show. My second favorite character is Stewie because he is the funniest villain to be on a TV show. If you love Guiy's family you should check out American Dad because he is so similar and is created by Seth McFarlane. I hope this show will never ends up because he's a comic book genius! 10/10
