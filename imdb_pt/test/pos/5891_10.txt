The Best Years of Our Life perfectly captures the era of my youth and the feelings of that time. The cast was uniformly wonderful. This was arguably the best role of Dana Andrews in his career and he should also have been nominated for an Oscar. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie that it is almost impossible to list them all. Cinematography is among the best of any film. This movie is a time capsule as it was in the 1940s. A must see movie for any true movie fan. Some critics have said that this movie has aged. I disagree. The theme of human desires is timeless. And the obstacles faced by returning veterans will always be with us. This is just a great movie - one that can be watched over and over again.
