Made in the heyday of the Black Power movement, this film portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) as CEO of a corporation after the white CEO dies (white executives hate themselves and can not decide who should be the successor). Former CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization. <br /> <br /> I do not know how Robert Downey Sr. did it, but he did it! "Putney Swope" is the final blow to America's power structure. It's the kind of thing that seems to have gotten out of Richard Pryor's mind. This is a classic comedy in every sense of the word. A true work of art. Hilarious.
