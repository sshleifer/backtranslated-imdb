From the director of Oldboy comes this vampire movie. Kang-ho Song stars as a priest who is accidentally transformed into a vampire while being healed of a deadly and mysterious virus. His vampirism and priesthood are quite in conflict, but he is able to survive by stealing the hospital's blood bank and unconscious patients who may not care about some siphoned blood. Because of his supposedly miraculous survival, he enters the life of the family of Ha-kyun Shin. Shin has cancer and his mother believes that Song can heal him. Unfortunately, Song's vampirism raises his lust levels to a point where he can not help but fall in love with Shin's young wife, OK-vin Kim. Kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism, and the two become lovers. The movie from there goes in strange directions that I think one should experience for themselves. What really should be mentioned is the Chan-wook Park domain over the middle of the cinema. My God, I've rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the height of his powers. The big flaw in the movie is that it's a bit incoherent, especially near the beginning. Park is interested in telling his stories primarily in the visuals, which can be hard to follow sometimes. But when it works, man, it flies. The film is also perversely hilarious. The final sequence, easily one of the best of the decade, is both bleak and deliciously ridiculous. OK-vin Kim should become a superstar after this movie. It gives one of the best performances of the year.
