This film was a marvelous, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in strange places and a tremendous energy. The famous film director (the protagonist) and the events he tries to manipulate through the cinema become entangled in fascinating ways, since he is almost out of place for a prince who has never heard of him. There are wonderfully rich images throughout and suggested paths, but not followed (exactly what is happening to the somber wife of the pedestrian tourist's wedding director?). The end is much better for being sloppy. Realism and logic are not what you should be looking for here. If we are to turn our marriages and our imaginative lives into filmmakers, we should be prepared for a wild ride, this movie seems to suggest.
