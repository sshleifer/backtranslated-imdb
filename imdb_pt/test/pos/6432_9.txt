I recently had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Hauer at the Sarasota Film Festival in 2005 for the first US film. Not only was he gracious enough to autograph my BLADE RUNNER copy, but he also took the time to answer some questions about the film before selecting the ROOM for a crowded theater. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed with the film that I used it as a parameter to compare all the other films I had seen at the festival. It was powerful and moving, yet subtle and brief. The film tells the story of how a young man (an older version played by Rutger) one day finds himself caught up in a seemingly common room in a common building near the street. Walking there, he notices a single, open window, from which an astonishing melody can be heard. Every day, he passes the room, sometimes standing for hours, watching through the silk curtains that float in the light breeze, hoping to catch a glimpse of its occupants. At the end of the movie, we discovered how much this room is really important and what attracted our protagonist to it. <br /> <br /> The movie was cut beautifully. Not a second of screen time was wasted on an uninteresting shot. Any single frame of the film could stand alone in an art gallery. Rutger is incredible. He is mysterious but accessible. His dialogue encompasses a series of reflections on a life that ran, of course, for better or for worse. His words evoke feelings and thoughts familiar to the public. I was particularly moved by a scene in which he is looking at some old photos, remembering his favorite dog, his favorite horse and his first love. You have the feeling that you are in his presence while he allows you in your world to glimpse precious memories of a life that is coming to an end. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something new, smart and moving. Visualization must be required for all major films.
