The Residents is a band known for its strange appearances and strange musical styles, so obviously their music videos will not be exactly normal. In fact, these little videos are abnormal and bizarre, but have tremendous artistic value to them. The atmosphere is built with thoughtful lighting and visuals. It's a great display experience. <br /> <br /> Basically, Icky Flix consists of only a lot of music videos from locals made for your songs. The music itself ranges from rock to synthesized music that sounds like it was straight from a horror movie from the 80's. What does not change is the quality of these videos. They are great! <br /> <br /> Any fan of art films will love these. They are so unique with their visuals, and the angles at which they are filmed, and the lighting especially makes them so interesting. The music is creepy and captivating and highly original and these short films are mini-classics that deserve several observations. This is an almost perfect collection of short videos. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** out of ****. 56 min.
