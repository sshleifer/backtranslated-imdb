I loved the show today !!! It was a variety and not exclusively cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peering around the corner to see what was to come. She is as realistic and agreeable as you, as one of us who made the show even more enjoyable. Special guests who are friends also made a good surprise as well. I loved the 'first' theme and the audience was invited to play as well. I must admit that I was shocked to see her get into her time limits on some things, but she did it and by God I'll be writing those recipes. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with the family. Those who have not yet tuned in, find out what channel and time, I assure you will not be disappointed.
