This movie was working toward two goals: make a political point and tell a scary adventure story. It is often difficult to make a political point and still tell a good story (consider Ellen's highly political, but rarely fun, final age). Beyond Rangoon finds a good balance between politics and storytelling. <br /> <br /> I already knew that Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, and I knew something about the oppressive political situation in Burma, so the political message of the film was mainly a dramatization of what I already knew. But I thought the film did a good job of telling about Aung San Suu Kyi and the faceless dictators who have been trying to silence her for years. The device of presenting an unfamiliar scenery through the eyes of a character with which viewers can identify is quite common, but is very well done in this film. <br /> <br /> Of course the true measure of the movie was Entertainment value. Arquette was excellent as a young woman, whose sister took her to a distant and unfamiliar place to get her out of her depression by the violent death of her husband and son. She is convincingly detached and depressed. Her mourning condition gives her a clear reason for her distracted pilgrimages in the midst of a dangerous situation she does not understand, something she would otherwise be too smart to come across. <br /> <br /> Once the dangers become so obvious that she can see through them, even through the cloud of pain, that is trapped, without easy escape. This puts her on an adventure path where she needs her intelligence to survive. Writers deserve a lot of credit for making her smart and ingenious enough to deal with a number of dangerous situations while still finding a plausible reason for her to be foolish enough to get into trouble in the first place. The direction is also strong, maintaining the tension throughout the race to escape the forces of the dictatorship. <br /> <br /> This movie had an additional impact on me and my wife because of other events from the same time period. We were preparing for a trip to India and heard from Western tourists who had been taken hostage by a terrorist group in India. Avoiding isolated terrorists in a democratic and peaceful country is a completely different matter from escaping from an oppressive dictatorship. But the film and the news shared the element of avoiding danger in an unknown country. This common feature gave the film a meaning beyond the strength of its own skilful narrative. The film illustrates the worst nightmare of the international tourist.
