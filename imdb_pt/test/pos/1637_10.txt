This is definitely the most stressful episode of X-Files's first season. this episode is what I think when I hear "X-Files". the plot is simple but coming out. Our main cast and some scientists will investigate an Alskan outpost in which the research team seems to have killed itself. It turns out that a small parasite that was dug up from the ice infected the research team. The parasite binds to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity. So no one can tell who they can trust, or who is infected or not. <br /> <br /> This episode was a direct tribute to John Carpenter's great horror film, "The Thing." The Thing is set in Antarctica and a team of scientists finds a destroyed outpost in which its occupants were killed or killed. An alien that had been buried in the ice for 10,000 years had been thawed. It has the ability to imitate any way of life. therefore, the main characters can no longer be friends other than enemies. <br /> <br /> Believe me THING is one of the most exciting and exciting horror movies you have ever seen. If you liked the episode ICE I advise you to see. Or if you just saw the THING I advise you to see the ICE. <br /> <br /> ICE is the best direct tribute / tribute to John Carpenter's The COING that I have seen, and lives up to its inspiration as one of the best episodes of X-Files. I give it a 10/10.
