It is a novel based on an applied ethical idea. A film about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie. I received no emotion, ideas are nothing new, tension is lacking, it becomes tedious for the second time, but in the end I think it becomes quite interesting in a burlesque way. I mean, you have this paralyzed bald middle-aged man who gets more women than Don Juan. He does not seem to suffer as much as you would expect from someone completely paralyzed for over 28 years, he has no problems with God (and probably would expect that too), the people around him seem to be the perfect slaves (I can not get out of the Bergman's Cries and Whispers, similar to this in many respects, that simply explodes with emotions, and not all of them are humanitarian), etc. This movie is the perfect recipe for housewives looking for emotional thrills. but do not expect to be surprised. It is worth seeing the film among all the cynicism we received today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical question without any desire to awaken the viewer. Amenabar does not rub his face on him and he does not take sides, he does not want to make us fanatics for a particular idea. I still have no idea why this movie was so highly regarded.
