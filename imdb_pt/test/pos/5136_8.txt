I highly recommend this movie to everyone. My son and I read the book first and then we watched the movie. While the book was better (in my opinion) the movie was still great. My son and I agreed that while we like the version of the book more, we like the end of the film more than the end of the book. The scenery is tremendous and the soundtrack is a must. The fact that Jimmy Buffett has a small role and providing music is an added bonus. Luke Wilson does a decent job in his role as Director Delinko and it's pretty much what I mentally imagined Delinko would be when I read the book. I'm surprised this has not been better in theaters, and I'll be waiting for the DVD to come out.
