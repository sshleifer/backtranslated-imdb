"Brotherhood of Satan" is one of the most underrated horror films of all time. Why he has not attained a cult status is beyond me. This is a chilling tale of terror and witchcraft that contains one of the most powerful and disturbing climaxes in history. the annals of the horror screen. In the small American city some children disappeared and their parents were violently murdered.What is the cause of hysteria? The film is really weird, some scenes are genuinely unnerving and definitely not easily forgotten. The suspense never ceases up, the acting is really good, and the climax is bizarre and disturbing. Check out this forgotten gem of satanic horror. Absolutely recommended.
