Okay, maybe this movie is not a revolution. But it's a very good piece of entertainment, and it's Liv Tyler's variation of Alicia Silverstone's "Clueless" or "There's Something About Mary" by Cameron Diaz. Liv plays a femme fatale, who just wants to have a home of her own and all kinds of material comfort. And well, she does everything she can to get just this ... even crimes. Too many crimes. And she leaves all the boyfriends who do not cooperate to get these things. Also, she really does not mind having some additional lovers next to her current boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie is even more fun to watch, if anyone knows that Liv is indeed a zodiac sign cancer - and the cancer is reported to be very domestic. So the Liv character played here is actually a parody of a cancer! <br /> <br /> I was alone in the movies when I watched that one. This was quite comfortable because I could laugh as much as I wanted all the time - but it also seemed strange, as if no one was really interested in this movie. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. The acting was between very good to excellent, especially the main actors where brilliant. Where there are enough jokes, many of the black type and good dialogues. <br /> <br /> This is a trash movie, and it is full of black humor. If you like this type of movies, try this one!
