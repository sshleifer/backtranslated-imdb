This zany movie rivals Ghost and Mr. Chicken as one of Don Knott's best performances. Knotts is an accountant of a Podunk prefecture which is good for deceiving citizens. They shoot the "three competent bookkeepers and guard the donkey" (Knotts, of course, is the mute). When his garbage collection cohort accidentally empties the wrong garbage can, Knotts finds himself entangled in a bizarre trap set by the prefecture for him. Funny moments in the movie include the Bowling Alley Restroom scene, and the graveyard scene is absolutely hilarious. Typical Knotts, the nervous act is well used, and as usual, it is surrounded by many crazy characters actors of the sixties. Actors such as Frank Welker and Pitt Herbert contribute to chaos. As you might expect, Knotts is armed with a big car, a pretty girl, and no real clue what he's doing. Fun for anyone, especially fans of nostalgia, but almost anyone will love it.
