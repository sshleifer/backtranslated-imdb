I've seen this movie three times. Returning to VCRs in the 1980s, and again on The Encor channel last night (February 11, 2010). Based on a true story that I remember being on the news in the early 80's, I decided that I find it very disturbing to watch again. However, it is difficult to look away from a car accident. The most chilling character is Joshua John Miller, who plays Keeanu Reeves' younger brother. <br /> <br /> (The story on which this movie was based can be found anywhere on the Internet - just on Google.It is about Anthony Jacques Broussard who murdered Marcy Conrad in Milpitas, California, in 1981.) The characters portray Generation X pre-grunge, bordering sociopaths, with the exception of Keeanu Reeves, who grows consciousness. <br /> <br /> The old hippies did a great job creating this generation. <br /> <br /> For that, kid, I thought Joshua Miller was excellent, like the serial killer of the character. In fact, he went to Yale and wrote screenplays as well as directed. His acting skills in this film were astounding. The way he treats his little sister drowning her doll and tearing up her dollhouse, gave me shivers. It gave me nightmares. Even with what is happening in our world today, in 2010, it is still the most degenerate film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The apathy and dysfunction of these families is enough to make us vomit. This emotion almost makes Manson's murders pale in comparison. <br /> <br /> Crispon Glover got a little too much into the character. He ended up with David Lettermen to discuss his role and almost kicked the host in the head. Apparently Glover had to seek psychiatric help after portraying his character. <br /> <br /> Also, fight the good fight with the great Dennis Hopper. You're one of the best!
