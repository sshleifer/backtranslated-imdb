... The reason I like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has. It's a cool summer camp movie, so the jokes are not so petty that they make a character the permanent target of ridicule. Jokes happen, but you get the feeling that the respective faces of the fall would be able to look back and laugh, having been dopey enough to fall in love with them - and without being too tacky, it's cool that everyone is still friends the end ! <br /> <br /> It's an extra special bonus when the master of all these jolly japes is Bill Murray. To me, he is still seen as the god of comedy unparalleled when he has the chance to let go. Nobody is better at generating a feeling of crazy anarchy without really hurting anyone. The tone of the entire film bears the same style as its protagonist, set with a great opening scene showing Murray's way of getting ready for the day. It's all silly, yes, but more important than behaving like an adult is having a lot of good-humored fun. "Meatballs" promises such, and finally offers a nourishing watch.
