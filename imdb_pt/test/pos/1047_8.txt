A magazine columnist who writes about life in her farmhouse, when she actually lives in a New York apartment, must draw up a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, it turns into a fun crazy comedy thanks to an excellent cast. In a major departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in "Double Indemnity," Stanwyck shows a good humorous comedy. Morgan is gentle as the affable war hero, while Greenstreet is well-chosen as editor. However, Sakall steals the film as a chef trying to master the English language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible European accent.
