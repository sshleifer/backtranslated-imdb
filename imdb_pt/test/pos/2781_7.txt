So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We are all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so much because so much of what was happening in the movie happened to us! I mean, yeah, of course some of them were pretty clich√©s, but still true, I know what I'm saying. <br /> <br /> I think I'm more related to the quiet guy (the Italian) than to Xavier, because I'm more the observer in our group. Anyway, I would like to have a hot roommate like Cecile de France. She looks like a nice girl in the movie and really after I saw her hosting the Cannes Film Festival last month. <br /> <br /> Now I'm thinking that I want to go to Barcelona next summer after watching this movie. I have to check out the sequel too that just came out here in France.
