I just saw this delightful classic again after many years, the next film directed by Henry Cornelius, who died three years later at just 45 years old (the same age as the male star in the movie Larry Harvey would also die in 1973). Three future directors were on the team: Jack Clayton (associate producer), Guy Green (director of photography) and Clive Donner (editor). This film is based on the autobiographical story "Goodbye to Berlin," by well-known British author Christopher Isherwood, which was first turned into a play by John van Druten, then made into a film, later transformed into a musical "Cabaret." and finally filmed as "Cabaret," which brought the incredible Liza Minelli to the world's attention with her voice that can break a glass at a distance of a mile. Isherwood appears as a character in the film in his own name. He was gay, but in those days it was illegal and could lead him to jail, so he disguises his inclinations under the description of what he calls "confirmed bachelor." This is the key to his platonic relationship with the eccentric, eccentric, promiscuous, always cheerful and completely unique character he calls Sally Bowles. The portrait of Sally Bowles in this film is a tour-de-force by young Julie Harris, who sweeps all scenes into a magical and captivating web of personal charm. What a vehicle for an actress with a lot of charm! It is one of the great cinematic performances of the 1950s. Isherwood is played to perfection by young Lawrence Harvey in a performance that never lets the comedy go over the edge, and even the farce moments bordering the slapstick remain somehow "almost credible. " Larry is so funny in portraying a hesitant hypochondriac. What an irony considering the total lack of hypochondria demonstrated by his bravery and stoicism in the last year of his life when he died of terminal stomach cancer and behaved with such dignity and lack of complaint. I had known him well for the past three years, and he was a generous, warm, modest person. He adored his little Domino, now also tragically dead. This film was his best initial performance, to be followed by his spectacular work in 'Room at the Top' (1959), 'Summer and Smoke' (1961) and 'The Candidate of Manchuria' (1962). Larry was often devalued in his life because he was too handsome, often seen as a hick, and glamorous boys are not always accepted as good actors, but many of the best actresses played in front of him, and had no doubt of their abilities . and he was a strong lead in many of the most important films of his time. If he had lived beyond middle age, he would have grown stronger and become a "big old man" on the screen. Sitting at his house in Hampstead one day, he handed me a glass of his usual white wine from a huge barrel he had brought from some foreign winery. I said he always gave me such delicious wine, what was it? He proudly replied that it was a Sancerre he had chosen in the vineyard in France and had specially sent it. He then added with extreme melancholy, "You know, I've been waiting for four years for someone to comment and ask me what it is, and you're the first person to ever do that." What mattered to him was being recognized for having taste in the wine, and his most glamorous friends had denied this satisfaction. In this film, Anton Diffring makes an early and touching performance as a serious young man (later he would have to interpret too many Nazi officials, poor fellow), and the young Shelley Winters plays a rich German Jewish girl in her noisy habit. but in an effective way, but it was not too difficult, since she was a Jewish redhead anyway. This film has an air of joy, which is pure delight.
