This one man show may be the most fantastic show I have ever seen. To call this simply a standing act is to do a great injustice, there is a definite reason that this was a Broadway show. John Leguizamo is a master at making people of all cultures feel at home listening to his story of growing up and dealing with his family and life in general. I would recommend this program to anyone as long as they can handle the language.
