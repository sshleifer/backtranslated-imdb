There is no point in comparing this with the original series. Although different in appearance and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an anthology series of horror / science fiction. Due to the indifferent programming in Australia, I only managed to catch a small number of episodes distributed in the first seasons. The first episode really gave me shivers (nightmares at my age ...!), But many others fell on my face; usually when the stories moved in horror realms and away from SF. I just hope the DVDs catch up eventually.
