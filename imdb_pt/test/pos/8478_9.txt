Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) is an extremely talented pianist and singer as well. Ray is a smart man too. Ray began his career in the late 1940s before finding his distinctive style. Ray is certainly popular in nightclubs with his music. Things change when he meets an ambitious music producer (Curtis Armstrong). Who knows Ray has what it takes to be a strong artist and he also meets a woman (Kerry Washington), he also loves and marries along the way. Ray's album becomes a hit, when he mixes soul and gospel together. What makes Ray a controversial man during the 1950s to 1960s. Ray has love for all sorts of music, including country music. But Ray is not always the perfect man as he seems to be. Since he has had too much failed relationship with another woman while he is married. But he also had to fight against racism, people who betrayed him, his musical ideals, and of course his drug addiction. Which made Ray's life extremely difficult for him and also to combat the tragedy of his childhood. That Ray always blamed himself for. <br /> <br /> Directed by Oscar winner: Taylor Hackford (Against All Odds, Devil's Advocate, Dolores Claiborne) has made a fascinating true-to-life story of the always interesting of the late "Ray." "Foxx has won an Academy Award for his moving performance in the last artist, Foxx brings heart and soul to the film and humor as well.But this film has an abundance of rich performances from a top cast including: Regina King, Clifton Powell, Woodburn Bokeem, Aunjaune Ellis, Davis Warwick, Terrence Howard and Sharon Warren as Ray's mother. This is probably the best film of Hackford's career to date.This film also has a lot of music from the best of Charles's music. > DVD has a crisp Pan & Scan (1.33: 1) transfer and excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc 1 has an informative commentary from the director and the DVD also features the original theatrical cut and the extended version. you're better off watching the theatrical version because the bonus images are in poor condition sometimes and you have to click on a logo if you want to see those deleted scenes. Disc 2 deleted scenes with optional comments from the director (which is seen in the version extended), featurettes and more. But the featurettes are disappointingly short for this DVD. Since the movie is unusually good. This film was named four Oscars, including Best Costume Design, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Film. This is an incredible story of real life well told, but of course, Charles's life was even more controversial and outrageous than the final film. Still, it's very close. Screenplay by James L. White. From a story by White and director: Hackford. Winner of the Best Sound Oscar. Do not miss it. (**** Â½ / *****).
