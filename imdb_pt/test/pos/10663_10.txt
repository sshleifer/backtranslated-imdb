Originally supposed to be only part of a great epic The year 1905, representing the 1905 Revolution, Potemkin is the story of the riot of the Potemkin crew at the port of Odessa. The film begins with the crew protesting against the meat and the commander ordering the execution of the dissidents. An uprising occurs during which the revolutionary leader is killed. This crewmember is taken to the beach to stay in the state. When the people of the city gather on a huge flight of stairs overlooking the harbor, Tsarist troops appear and march down the steps that separate the crowd. A naval squadron is sent to retrieve the Potemkin, but by the time the ships arrive within range, their crews allow the mutineers to pass. The non-historically accurate conclusion of Eisenstein is open, indicating that this was the seed of the Bolshevik revolution that would flourish in Russia. The film is divided into five parts: Men and Larvae, Drama in the Quarterdeck, An Appeal of the Dead, The Odessa Steps and Meet the Squad. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein was a revolutionary artist, but with the genius level. Not wanting to make a historical drama, Eisenstein used the visual texture to give the film a news appearance, so the viewer feels that he is listening to an exciting and politically revolutionary story. This technique is used by the Battle of Algiers, Pontecorvo. Unlike Pontecorvo, Eisenstein relied on typology, or the cast of non-professionals who had striking physical appearances. The extraordinary faces of the cast are what he remembers Potemkin. This technique is later used by Frank Capra in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Meet John Doe. But in Potemkin, no individual is cast as a hero or heroine. The story is told through a series of scenes that are combined into a special effect known as montage - editing and selecting short segments to produce a desired effect on the viewer. D.W. Griffith also used the montage, but no one mastered it as well as Eisenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic footage of the crew sleeping in their hammocks is complemented by the graceful swing of hanging chain tables in the kitchen. In contrast, the confrontation between the crew and their officers is charged with electricity and the clenched fists of the masses demonstrate their anger with injustice. Eisenstein introduced the technique of showing an action and repeating it again, but from a slightly different angle to demonstrate intensity. The breaking of a dish with the words "Give us today our daily bread" means the beginning of the end. This technique is used last year in Marienbad. In addition, when the surgeon of the ship is thrown to the side, his pince-nez is hung in the rigging. It was these glasses that the police officer used to inspect and pass on the meat infested with larvae. This sequence links punishment to the corruption of the tsarist era. <br /> <br /> The most notable sequence in the film, and perhaps throughout the history of the cinema, is The Odessa Staircase. The wide expanse of steps is filled with hundreds of extras. Rapid and dramatic violence is always suggested and not explicit, but the visual images of the deaths of some last in the minds of the beholder forever. <br /> <br /> The angular shots of boots and legs running down the steps are deftly accented with long, threatening shadows of a sun at the top of the steps. The rhythm of the sequence is deliberately varied between marching soldiers and some civilians who have the courage to beg them to stop. A close-up of a woman's face frozen in horror after being struck by a soldier's sword is the direct antecedent of Bonnie's bank teller in Clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the tsarist regime. <br /> <br /> The death of a young mother leads to a baby carriage down the steps in a sequence that was copied by Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent by Terry Gilliam in Brazil and Brian DePalma in The Untouchables. This sequence is shown repeatedly from various angles, thus taking what was probably just a five second event. <br /> <br /> Potemkin is a film that immortalizes the revolutionary spirit, celebrates it for those who are already committed, and releases it to the public. not converted. It burns with fire and roars with the injustices of the decadent tsarist regime. Its greatest impact has been on the film students who lent and only slightly improved the techniques invented in Russia several generations ago.
