As the father of four kids in their 40s, I found this movie to be a compelling attraction - if not a cutting-edge song. I deserve a much higher rating than the 4.3 I had when I wrote this. (I gave 7.) <br /> <br /> I agree with some of the comments about the characters, but Cameron Diaz was, again, shining in another very different role. The plot was a bit silly, but the point of the film for me was well summed up in the final sequence, rather surreal. A moving end for any parent. <br /> <br /> I could imagine that a young single could find the film quite boring, but for other people who did not fixate on high doses of testosterone they would find something sweet in it.
