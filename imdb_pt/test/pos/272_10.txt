Stepford Children, in addition to being very good made for TV movies, show the very disturbing result of indoctrination. It is a pretty statement about how to be made to act within the limits of what is considered "Good" behavior can destroy what it is that makes a person unique and individual. I think this is a movie that parents who want to keep some semblance of the thought of wandering within the hearts and minds of the young should watch with their kids and discuss what the movie is saying. I do not know if this was somehow the intention of this film, but I have always been of the opinion that it is one of the best films against the desire to have children in accordance with an unrealistic and domineering pretension of what is in someone's best interest other than that of the children themselves. I hope one day to see this movie on DVD. I'm at the starting gate ... waiting.
