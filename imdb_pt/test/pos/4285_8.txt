Another great performance by Tom Wilkinson marks "Separate Lies," a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it is the story of a couple, James and Ann Manning, where her husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house the night they make a party takes the police around. It's a hit that killed Maggie's Bassett's husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett), when he sees some damage in his car. He confronts Bule, who admits to having done so and promises to go to the police the next day. When James gets home, Ann gets angry that he is making such a big deal of it and says she was driving the car. Of course, James is not so anxious to run to the police. She suggests that they call Bule and tell him his decision. "Oh, f___ Bule," says James. "Well, that's all," Ann says. "I'm f___ing Bule." The devastation of James is only the beginning in this well-worked drama. Without revealing the plot, this is a good example of how gender change changes a story. Example of what I mean: Susan Smith takes her car to a lake and her children drown. She comes to life in prison. What if Dad had done it? The chair. You would be surprised how often the result would be different. The same is true here - if it were James taking the case and doing the subsequent activities, the viewers could feel different about the story. If Ann were in James's place, it would be destructive. As it is, it's awfully sad. Tom Wilkinson is heart-breaking as a man surprised by the woman he adores, and Emily Watson does a beautiful job as Ann, who, once she gets rid of her lies - her involvement in the accident and happy marriage - you know what she has to do. Rupert Everett as Bule is very effective - indolent, arrogant, and ultimately in need. Everyone here is very civilized in their dealings with each other, and no one is good or bad. <br /> <br /> There are separate lies - James that your marriage is happy, Ann as listed above - and there is a uniting lie - the accident, about which all parties remain quiet. It's enough for Ann that Maggie knows. In the end, everyone must deal with the separate lies that the only lie discovered. <br /> <br /> Bright movie.
