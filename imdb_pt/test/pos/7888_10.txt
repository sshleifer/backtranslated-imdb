After seeing recently, Cry Uncle, by the same director, I decided to look for this and I'm glad I did! This is an extraordinarily good film. Much, much better than seems likely given the ingredients. How many times have we had to suffer the embarrassment of someone playing a middle class parent mixing it with the aagh flower children! And here again, thanks to a perfect script, this becomes believable. It is not ideal, it is not good or bad, but it is believable. Peter Boyle, like the working class, hippie and ni Ã¼ber heer and Dennis Patrick as tight suit, play their respective parts immaculately and I do not remember seeing the two classes coming together like that without things getting sentimental. Susan Sarandon is effective as a hippie girl, but does not have much to do in her first movie. This is a real-life film, capturing the very short period in the West, and in particular in the United States when counter-culture was about to burst.
