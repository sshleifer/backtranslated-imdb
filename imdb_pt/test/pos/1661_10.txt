There are not many movies that I would describe as perfect, but Rififi definitely fits the bill. No other assault film came close to him, sooner or later. The plot is simple, but it absorbs you. It never ceases to amaze me how exciting the movie is every time you see it. You take care of all the characters, even though they are bank robbers, because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and defects. It is difficult to imagine any other actor besides Jean Servais in the role of Tony le St√©phanois. When team members are talking about what they are going to do with their money and finally come to Tony, his response and expression on his face say it all. While the 30-minute burglary sequence is the most famous part of the film (and rightly so), the film gets better afterwards. Director Jules Dassin knew what he was doing when he decided not to have any music during the assault scene or the final. shooting, but instead inserted a great climactic score during Tony's final trip toward his destination. To think that if Dassin, an American director, had not been blacklisted in Hollywood and forced to work in France, that movie masterpiece would never have been made the way it was. It certainly would not have been so good if it had been made like an American movie during that time. It was absolutely horrible what Dassin had to go through, but he did his best work because of it, for the benefit of all of us. I'm shrinking at the thought of the upcoming Al Pacino remake. Most of the assault films since Rififi have already lent in one form or another. There is no reason to remake this masterpiece beyond money. Leave the classics alone!
