This is another case of Hollywood Arrogance which presumes to eclipse the French Style. The original, Mon Pere Ceheros, was one of the most charming films of 1991, so naturally Hollywood accountants thought they could hire Depardieu and call the rest. They, however, took the precaution of hiring Francis Veber to write a book in English. version, although using virtually every word in the original. Depardieu brings her Gauls charm and Katherine Heigl shows the promise that is paying off. The thing is that when the French make a kind of Lolita-lite, they get away with it because the thought of the "dirty French postcard" works in their favor; here the Hollywood idea of ​​light subtlety is to have Depardieu (totally unaware that his daughter let it be known that he is really her lover), prevailed to play and sing "something French", cast in a spirited version of Thank Heaven For Little Girls. See the original.
