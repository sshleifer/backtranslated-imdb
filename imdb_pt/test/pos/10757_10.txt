Returning from 20 years in China, a young missionary refuses to become THE CAT'S-PAW for a gang of thugs from his hometown. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit different from Harold Lloyd's previous films. The comedy most derived from dialogue, often quite serious, predominates here, instead of the elaborate gags of vision that fueled Harold's classics in the past. There are some splendid moments, however, that are pure visual enjoyment, like when Harold tries to follow a convertible down a busy street, or when he desperately tries to prevent a stripper from a nightclub from losing his clothes. There is also the climatic scene, set in the basement of Chinatown, in which Harold happily jumps brazenly into the darkest comedy. But most of the humor comes from Harold's refusal to be the scapegoat of the criminals who run his hometown for years. <br /> <br /> And it's a collection of rogue politicians and thugs that Harold faces, played by a bunch of well-known character actors: George Barbier, Nat Pendleton, Grant Mitchell, Edwin Maxwell, Alan Dinehart, Warren Hymer and Stuttering Fuzzy Knight. Pert Una Merkel is at hand as the smoking girl who catches Harold's attention and keeps him intrigued by her practical view of life. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize Samuel S. Hinds as Haroldo's missionary father; Charles Sellon as a senior Stockport cleric; and Herman Bing as a German gangster - all without credits. In addition, appearing for just a few seconds as a kidnapping attempt is Noah Young, a familiar face of Harold's silent films, making his last appearance here in a photo of Lloyd. Fox gave the film a good production. values, especially in the opening scenes in China.
