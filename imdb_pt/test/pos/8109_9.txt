This film was made when Hitler (and Mussolini, who is so well in the film) was at the top and many politicians and even the Roman Church used to close their eyes on the brutality and evil of Nazism. Especially in the USA, there were many people who had not understood what was really happening in Germany and Europe (Charles Lindenbergh, for example). It would be like today a great actor would make a parody of Berlusconi or Chirac. Chaplin may have committed a lot of mistakes in his life, but this is truly a masterpiece of humanity and IMHO a great demonstration that he was a brave man. The film is funny and deep, the final speech has a terrible force and is still updated. I think this movie is one of the best ever made.
