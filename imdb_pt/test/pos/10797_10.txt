In one of the less-watched films of the late 1980s, at a time when Oliver Stone was at its peak with Platoon and Wall Street (and before his work Born on the Fourth of July), he co-wrote and directed that look at world of radio, specifically a radio host in the middle of Texas. This man is Barry Champlain, once at a time in the career of Eric Bogosian, who wrote the original play and also co-wrote the screenplay. Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of those experts you hear on the radio stations that many of us can turn off. He has ideas in his mind, opinions, and he is not only unafraid to speak of them, but also to face the callers. Callers, in fact, are the driving force behind the film, as Barry has to fight against the careless, the obscene, the racist, and the purely distracted. As this continues, he also has to deal with his boss (Alec Baldwin) and a deal of success or failure to go all over the country, outside the confines of the southern station in which he is. <br /> <br /> While after watching the film I felt curious to see how this would have been done on stage (I imagine it was a one-man show, as Bogosian had several alongside), the direction of the film is phenomenal. Stone is known as a director who loves quick cuts, unlimited editing effects and effects with camera work styles and other little tricks, which give his films in the 90's a distinct, almost authoritative look. But in the 1980s he had this energy and feverish quality in the film's visuals, and was not as frantic as the other films. In order to add the appropriate intensity that is inside the studio and head-space of Barry Champlain, he and DP Robert Richardson make the space look claustrophobic at times, brave, unsure and definitely on the edge. The scenes in the middle of the movie, when Barry is not in the studio, are quite common, but the style along with the substance in the radio scenes is among the best I've seen of the Stone / Richardson combination. <br /> And you can not misjudge Bogosian's performance, which can be nasty, offensive, irritable, passive, and everything we love and hate about radio show hosts. There is also a supporting role for Michael Wincott, as Kent / Michael / Joe, who calls him one night, and the next is invited to the studio. These scenes are a little uncomfortable for a viewer, but it goes far into the head space of the 1980s subculture that Barry is as intrigued as he is critical. The stoner can not "catch" him, but as he tells him "it's his show". In fact, it is difficult to cover everything that happens within the talk, and there is a lot of it. But it's never boring and, like Champlain himself, it's not easy to ignore. And when Bogosian enters his climactic speech in the air, with the backdrop circling 360 degrees continuous, it becomes intoxicating, and one reason why freedom of speech is so powerful. Stone has been synonymous with a hot topic filmmaker who takes on subjects that were or are still controversial and gives them a life force that is not always great but is all yours. Here, his skills and ambitions do not get in the way of Bogosian's - it is propelled, if there is anything, creating an extremely skilful view of what is essentially a spectacle almost of a single man, which in itself is well written.
