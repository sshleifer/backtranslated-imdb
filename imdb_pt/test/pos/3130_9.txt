Watching The Wagonmaster will probably not result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films such as The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling . of admiration and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a convoy of Mormons arrive in California. Along the way, they encounter a healer whose mules have fled, a group of bank robbers and some Navajos. There is a lot of adventure and excitement on the trail, and the film is imbued with fun and beauty. The music is absolutely beautiful. The setting, again of Monument Valley, is as beautiful as it always was. Also, how can you go wrong with James Arness? The Wagonmaster may not be one of John Ford's best-known films, but it's still a must-see if you get the chance. 9/10
