SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> We've all heard the legend of "Boy Who Cried Wolf". But what if the wolf were a person in the modern world? Well, it may be something like Big Fat Liar. Fourteen-year-old Jason Sheperd (Frankie Muniz of "Malcolm in the Middle") is always lying to keep out of trouble. One day he is pressured to write an essay in English, but ends up in the hands of the despicable filmmaker Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who plans to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood blockbuster. No one believes in Jason when he for once tells the truth and ends up in summer school. However, Jason is determined to prove his parents the truth and travels to LA with his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes). When Wolf refuses to admit that he has torn his story, Jason plans to turn Wolf's life into hell. B.F.L. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a good way to spend 90 minutes of your time. I wished they could have made it a little longer though and there are not so many so many pizzas although they are smart enough (I like the pool-dye the best). I might not have liked it as much as I had, were it not for Paul Giamatti. He's just hilarious at it. If you have 90 minutes to kill, try this. You can just have fun.
