This movie surprised me. The box is misleading, the slogan is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading. The film is quite bloody, well executed and beautifully filmed. The special effects are top notch and seem to be ahead of their time until you realize that this movie came out in 1979, not 1963, as the tone suggests. It is a unique version of Dr. Moreau's story and one of the best filmed versions. The first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking, but the movie never collapses. Definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of dramatic costume / horror classics and gore-fests.
