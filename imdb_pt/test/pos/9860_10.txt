The Moving Image Museum in New York recently made a comprehensive retrospective of Jacques Rivette's films. After falling in love with his "Paris Nous Appartient", I decided that this was not to be wasted. <br /> <br /> Largely through extended outtakes and flexibly structured scenes, the film portrays two avant-garde theater companies preparing their interpretations. of "Seven Against Thebes" and "Prometheus" of Aeschylus. In addition, we are shown the day-to-day life of two distantly connected business people: a working-class woman named Frederique who finds creative ways to take men out of her money, and a young man named Colin who visits local cafes. posing like a deaf-mute, and plays the bagpipe strident to customers until they pay him to leave. The first four hours are dedicated to establishing the characters and their patterns, before a somewhat loose and capricious plot finally appears involving a conspiracy and decoding secret clandestine letters. <br /> <br /> The film is largely about life. society. Theater companies are a desperate subject, using their elaborate, emotionally draining exercises (which are really something to watch) to distract themselves from the fact that their acts can hardly be staged or even seen. Colin and Frederique both have very few friends, who only briefly find any emotion or purpose after the conspiracy touches them, as they are encouraged to find out more about it. The film meditates on the consequences of rejecting normal society in several memorable sequences, including a long shot of Colin as he wanders the streets of France shouting poetry for himself. As such, the film has been referred to as an analysis of the 1960s counterculture. There is no picture of the film that is not bursting with energy and vitality. The fact that much of the dialogue and movement is improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous, much more immediate. The camera also becomes an important character in this sense; Throughout the movie boom, shadows are visible here and there, or other similar mistakes, but they seem natural and fit with the flow of action because the camera is such an important player in that. <br /> <br /> More than anything to me, the movie seems like a great example of another way of making movies, a place for movies out of the usual pattern. For me, it was an experience of opening the mind, even more so than "Paris Nous Appartient", although the latter has many similarities of theme and structure. A must-see for anyone pondering the nature of art.
