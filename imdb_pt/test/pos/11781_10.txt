The hysterical Hardware Wars finally came out on DVD. HW has gained its niche among parody classics and is not only a short 20 minute but a staple in the low budget film production classes which is where much of the cult status of the film is derived and resides. With the DVD, we not only get a chance to revisit the original parody (4T2, Cinnamon-Bun Head, Ballistic Toast, and others) that Ernie F. did in 1978, but also a lot of additional material showing Fosselius wit. . Antique Sideshow is a parody that is very funny but makes a statement about the confluence of ignorance and greed at the same time. The Director's Commentary is also hysterical, as is the Creature Feature, which makes parodies of filming a movie on the circuit of talk shows and, in fact, is based on bringing HW to the circuit talk show, although the public access circuit. I would love to see Ernie, Michael Wiese, and the team take on some other exaggerated and overly-planned contemporary targets for parody - like any movie that Hollywood produces $ 100 million a day - not so ingenious films as Spider-Man or Men in Black true parody to themselves!), but any number of exaggerated, exaggerated, exaggerated and overvalued features. <br /> <br />
