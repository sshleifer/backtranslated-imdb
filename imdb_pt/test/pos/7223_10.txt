ROMEO AND JULIET were interpreted in many ways, but very few of the versions captured the essence of the play. The only ones I can think of who really preach the spirit of the novel were WEST SIDE STORY and, believe it or not, TROOPE AND JULIET, from Troma Film. At first glance, this is another mere splendor, and many would think this bastard to the Shakespearean classic. However, the film has an honest feel about it. Updated to appeal to today's sick-minded young people, of course, but not without merit. Yes, frequent break-ups, body piercings, car crashes, lesbian sex scenes, masturbation and incest are in bad taste, but what's wrong when you have a love story as sweet as the foundation? As bad as most of the acting in this movie is (I mean, it's Troma, after all), the two clues have some genuine chemistry, more so than the big-budget monstrosities TITANIC and STAR WARS EPISODE TWO. There is a lot of modernization, but much of the original text is intact, especially when Tromeu and Juliet are together. There is a big scene in which Juliet utters the famous "The farewell is such a sweet sadness," and I chant quickly follows in the mid-1990s the grunge fashion, "Yeah, it sucks." I think it's really unfortunate that this movie does not get the recognition or the broad release it deserves. I hope people who see it on the shelves of video stores are not turned off by the film's rudeness because they are missing out on a rather subversive experience.
