This movie is very good, it really is like a good wine, it gets better the more you watch. The pace is pretty slow for a high-octane topic, but cinematography is beautiful and surreal. There is a blue tint that "mounts" any movie. There is also a great performance in Gabriel Casseus's performance of the character "Midget". He is fantastic. Why does not this guy work anymore? If the film had better support, it probably would.
