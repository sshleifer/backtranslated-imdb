Two college classmates - one tense nerd, the other a coarse goofy - embark on a trip across the country. On the way, they find a vicious vehicle that looks like an army tank combined with a monster truck, which tries to run over their car. They escape but only enrage the mysterious and dangerous driver more when one of them takes a leak at the top of the hatch while at a rest stop. Later, they pick up a sexy hitchhiker who ends up getting involved in their life-threatening situation. MONSTER MAN is an extremely entertaining horror comedy that has some good moments of suspense as well as some good and bloody ones. The two main characters and their constant fights are fun to watch on their own and the end has a turn like TCM, which was very well done. Absolutely worth checking out.
