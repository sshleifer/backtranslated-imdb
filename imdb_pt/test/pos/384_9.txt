<br /> <br /> "Let's change murder - your wife, my father" - seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet during lunch on a train trip. Guy, a respectable and solid tennis player, whose problem is that his wife, Miriam, will not divorce him so he can marry the senator's daughter, Anne, laughing at all the talk as a joke. The next week he is no longer laughing. In a classic Hitchcock thriller scene, Bruno chases Miriam through a carnival and strangles her. When he does, her glasses fall off and we see the murder reflected twice through her lenses. With a cold and amoral heart, Bruno, his part of the contract concluded, approaches a shocked Guy waiting, even pressing him to "do his part". The questions are not helped when Anne's younger sister Frank appears suspicious of the murder of Guy of Miriam. So accused of a murder he did not commit and hoped to commit another, what will Guy do? The power of this film is in the presentation of humans as having a killer side in their nature - and that Hitchcock does perfection.
