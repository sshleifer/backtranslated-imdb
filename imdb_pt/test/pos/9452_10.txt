I just rented this movie from the rental company last night. Being new and not released long ago here, the rent was only overnight. I, my little sister and my older brother, who usually hate watching this kind of movie, sat down and watched. Once the movie started and after staying there watching for a while, we were all laughing historically. Even my brother. This movie is hilarious, I really laughed. No matter how funny some movies are ... even if I find it funny, sometimes I can not laugh. But this movie ... I laughed. My brother ended up thinking it was the best "that kind of movie" he had seen. I ended up watching the movie again about 2 or 3 hours later.
