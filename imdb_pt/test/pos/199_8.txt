While watching this movie recently, I always had to remind myself that it was done in 1957 .......... and in the USSR! This makes it all the more remarkable. Many of the film's effects seem cliches in 2002, but they were quite original in 1957. I first saw this movie in 1963, when it was released in the United States, and I was struck by its originality. Now, only after seeing 40 years later, I have no reason to change my mind.
