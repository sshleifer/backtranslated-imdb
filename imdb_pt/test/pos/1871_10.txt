One of the best sitcoms to perform on Indian television along with Dekh Bhai Dekh and Idhar Udhar. Great acting, well paced and an extremely entertaining script made this a truly memorable series. The fun opening montage (sung by none other than the inimitable Kishore Kumar) gave a very accurate picture of what one might expect. I used to borrow it from my local video library years after Doordarshan stopped broadcasting it. I would like Indian television to go back to shows like these instead of the saas-bahu asinine soaps and reality shows, which is good for these days. Anyone who has found a genuinely good comedy should go and get this series. You can also enjoy a pair of Pakistani sitcoms such as ups and downs and aik aur aik which are certainly comparable to the best in India.
