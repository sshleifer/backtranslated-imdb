Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is the king of geniuses. Watching this movie makes me feel stupid. But it's a great movie. Not much fun, but very intriguing. The film revolves around Stephen Hawkings, a man who makes Einstein look average, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, galaxy and black holes. Everyone at one time or another during an intense high arrives at a time when they think they have discovered the universe and the cosmos and swear that once they are sober, they will write everything. Well, here's a man who actually kept that feeling for over six hours. Here is a man who, despite suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, has become the biggest mind the world has ever seen. Look at this and hear how he formulated theories about black holes. Impressive. You will not be the same after seeing it.
