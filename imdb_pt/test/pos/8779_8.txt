I liked this movie, which in many ways, as Hitchcock did on several occasions, was a first attempt at a plot that he re-shot later in his career. Possibly the most amazing thing about this, however, is how faceless the main characters are. After watching, he remembers Murray Alper as the jovial truck driver, Vaughan Glaser's touch as a blind "patriot", the unforgettable show Freak and of course Otto Kruger as the suave and sophisticated villain, all of whom obfuscate completely Bob Cummings. a more or less wooden runaway (compare this bridge jump with Harrison Ford's similar trick in Andrew Davis's "The Fugitive") and Priscilla Lane, whose subsequent change of heart and love to Cummings is never fully believable. <br /> <br /> The other great player of support is, of course, Hitchcock himself, who supports the film with two extraordinary acrobatics. Many people criticize older films for their lack of realistic special effects. My feelings are that with the lack of technology, even trying and conveying what the director wants to show is an incredible achievement. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film carries an anti-fascist message, made in the Second's era. World War, but being a Hitchcock is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on action. Worth checking, especially for the support functions.
