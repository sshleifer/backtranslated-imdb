I think Josh Duhamel is so good !! The rest of the show is fun to watch, but, I think it's the beautiful and sexy Josh Duhamel who makes the show "Las Vegas" really fun to watch !! In the days of "Magnum" I loved Tom Selleck, I thought he was the sexiest man on the face of the earth !! A piece of a television program is a must for women to enjoy watching something, especially just for the purpose of innocuous entertainment! I would have done anything to "win a date with Tad Hamilton" !! Josh Duhamel is amazing and I will always have a super passion for him !! Josh is definitely a HUNK !! and I'm going to watch "Las Vegas" all the time, Josh Duhamel is a big reason why too !!
