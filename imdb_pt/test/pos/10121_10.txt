This is a very moving film about life itself. The challenges that a person with disabilities must face in a land that expects perfection is brought up for all to see and hopefully understand. You must teach the fanatics of society that we are all human, and while some of us are endowed with a sound mind, heart and body, there are decent human beings who exist in the world who are not so lucky, or perhaps we are. the unhappy. We do not always see the beauty of the world because we are involved in our "blind" ambitions and we see it only in a light "what this world can do for me !!!". Maybe we all like to be like Radio, a loving and happy person ... who loves everyone.
