Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, half human, half vampire known as Daywalker. He has all his strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since joining the whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has pursued vampires who have lived among us unseen for centuries, but the omnipotent Mr. Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with humans (food as he calls them) and he plans to awaken the god of blood and take control of the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is well written, written and directed; ensuring that the viewer has an exciting experience from start to finish. Packed with large strings of fights and smooth dialogues, Blade is certainly more action than horror, but definitely delivery. <br /> <br /> 8/10
