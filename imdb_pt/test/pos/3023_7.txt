A serial killer, Carl Stargher, has kidnapped and murdered young women by letting them drown in a water-filled cell. He is detained by the FBI but is in a coma and his last victim of abduction waits in a cell to fill with water <br /> <br /> Take a look at the above premise and you will see that there is a very much seen everything before look at it. The magic of Mark Protosevich's script is that it changes an old chestnut storyline to something quite different from what you're expecting. If I mentioned the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter the mind of Stargher, then set up a different movie entirely <br /> <br /> That would not be enough to make THE CELL a different class of thriller, but director Tarsem Singh creates a visually stunning surreal thriller. Paul Laufer's cinematography, where the opaque primary colors are in the foreground, is impressive, but Singh does not end here, things like costumes in which Stargher wanders into his idiosyncratic universe wearing opulent clothes has a visual impact that does so much more than What prevents THE CELL from becoming a classic movie, however, is that you get to become increasingly aware that the whole movie revolves around the visual rather than having a natural narrative. We see a third character, an FBI man entering Stargher's domain, but this looks more like a turnaround planned only to present the public with more impressive but also very troubling moments. <br /> <br /> It should also be pointed out that this is a rather disturbing thriller with an atmosphere that is very depressing and that prevents the film from being, if not pleasant, involving. A scene where an FBI agent recounts a case in which a pedophile hits a beat only to then cut off his victim's heart will fill his heart with such desperation that you can pick up the shut down button. You will probably have to watch a huge amount of thrillers until you see another as disconcerting as this
