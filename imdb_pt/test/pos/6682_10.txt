The always pleasant Kevin Spacey makes us once again question certain truths in our lives. After leading us to believe that he is a grumpy little crook (just to expose the true power of film misunderstanding) in the classic The Usual Suspect; this time he leads us to believe that he is Prot, a sympathetic alien who takes on a human form as he walks around the Earth. Prot is a peculiar stranger who apparently appeared out of nowhere just to be hospitalized at the Manhattan Psychiatric Institution. Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) soon shows extreme interest in him, and he even finds himself wondering if Prot is actually a supreme being on the planet K-PAX, or maybe he is just a forgotten human being with serious psychiatric problems. Although the ending can be seen and discussed in various ways, it remains a complex and enlightening journey, leaving a host of intriguing / philosophical issues behind it.
