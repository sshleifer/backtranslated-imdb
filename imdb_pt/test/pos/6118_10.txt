I loved this thing. The most wonderful thing about the Pink Flamingos is that it strives desperately to have a horrible taste but has actually won a following cult all over the world. It says a lot about us (being people) it's not that. Pink Flamingos is successful because Waters made the film he wanted to do. A movie need not be disgusting to succeed, but it can be. When you watch this movie, you see things that are disgusting, but they are brilliant because they are displayed freely. What we have here is an honest expression of personal creative expression. Anyone who already cares to succeed as an artist, whether in movies or any other media, should watch this movie.
