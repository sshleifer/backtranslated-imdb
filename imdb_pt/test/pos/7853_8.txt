I thought Eastwood's most unusual role was that of The Bridges of Madison County, but that was until I saw The Beguiled. He manages to do this, giving a very good performance and so does the rest of the cast. The direction is imaginative, since the film was made in 1971 and if there were not any holes - which the director seems to have difficulty covering up at times - we would be talking about an excellent film. It remains powerful, however. <br /> <br /> 8
