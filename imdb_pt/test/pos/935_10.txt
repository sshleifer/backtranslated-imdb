See three colors: blue and three colors: white. Both are wonderful films and will add an additional dimension to the final Three Colors: Red. Red is a fantastic film. It can be enjoyed in a single view and, in fact, the movie's climax is very powerful at first display. But watch it again. Once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie, you will see new things with each view. With the first visualization, you understand that the movie is the work of a brilliant mind. With each additional visualization, you discover that it is, in fact, a work of genius. Red symbolizes brotherhood on the French flag. History transforms the theme of fraternity around being seen at angles that would never be suspected. The facets of fraternity shared by the different characters are as deep as you'd like to see. If you're accustomed to the blatant "symbolism" in most mass-produced movies, you might find Red a bit slow. You can see yourself looking at a screen full of intensity that you do not understand ... and yawning, imagine the reason for all the excitement. This is not a vicarious and meaningless experience. Everything is not explained to you. You should think while watching. You should see ... do not just look. Wonderful movie ... a meaning to be enjoyed by a wonderful viewer.
