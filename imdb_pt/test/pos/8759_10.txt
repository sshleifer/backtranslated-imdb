I can only agree with many observers that Traffik is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television. I saw Traffik when I was on TV, and I just watched it again. I am particularly moved by Tim Souster's original music and especially by the painful tensions of Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony Orchestra in C minor (the song about credits and parts of the film). The music intensifies the despair of the characters as they pursue their sad fate. Music is powerfully emotional. This arrangement combines two of the movements of the symphony, but I recommend listening to the symphony per se.
