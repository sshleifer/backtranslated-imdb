<br /> <br /> As a teenager, I have about a hundred years of movies to keep up with. I try to see a mix of classics, mainstream, art-house and other movies. The 1970s are one of the most important decades for films: it is when ordinary, classic and ordinary films are transformed into messages and antisocial behavior. It has become like nothing anyone has ever seen before. What a decade under the influence shows basically is how important all the films of The Graduate on Star Wars. Richard LaGravenese and the late Ted Demme are the main interviewers of this documentary, which interviews such people as Dennis Hopper, Francis Coppola Ford, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and Jon Voight, among others, about how these few years have changed cinema forever . It is a very professional and polished documentary, and is even funded by IFC films. However, as this is very professional, I think they could at least edit the noise of someone behind the camera laughing. For me, this took a lot of how everything was cleaned and tidy. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's a very interesting documentary, about the movie of the people who do it. Of course, they're not hitting their own movies or anything like that, but they're portraying honesty about what they thought of the movies and what they meant. I do not know much about movies (but I want to be involved in it when I become an adult), so I feel like someone like me in this movie is a great asset. I saw quite a few movies that they mentioned, such as Chinatown and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but a little more insight into those films were very informative. <br /> <br /> The main reason, however, I didn The Love Influence is, however slippery it has been edited, seemed to take a while at first and be quite relaxed so not having enough time to get to whatever they they wanted to show. They were filled with Star Wars and Jaws in the last minutes, when they were two of the most important. It seemed like they tried a lot to show a lot of clips, and that's fine, but some of them were not important, like an extended Network. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, Influence is a very catchy, informative documentary that has helped me at least to learn more about a second "golden age" in American cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for language, and images of sexuality, violence and drug use.
