I saw this evening with moderate expectations - if Tartan Films caught something and is releasing what is usually a good sign, however I am not usually a fan of Julie Walters, usually does not like their comedy roles (sorry to any fan , but it's a personal thing - I just do not find her funny in the comedy). <br /> <br /> That was magnificent - a great performance from everyone, but Grint and Walters are exceptional! Lots of laughter, very pathetic, great timing and a wonderfully stimulated movie - a ripping movie like that would not normally be something I'd expect so much, but I can not recommend it enough - and watch Rupert Grint as he matures into a good actor as well.
