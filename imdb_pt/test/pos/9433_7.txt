Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has written a number of reports by Sherlock Holmes, but the popularity of the famous detective has ensured that the continuations in both the media and in the cinema would extend far beyond the works of the author. In "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon," Holmes, Basil Rathbone, patriotically serves British intelligence to secure the desperate need of a Swiss scientist. The film is from 1942 and I wonder if the producers and writers realized how the vital secrets of the bomb were (Norden's American aim was guarded almost as zealously as the new radar devices that would change the course of World War II). Holmes and his faithful but hopeful companion, Dr. Watson, Nigel Bruce, fight Dr. Moriarty, Lionel Atwill. As bad as Moriarty always was, it's a shock to see that he signed up with Hitler. Does man have no trace of decency? I think not. But Atwill is deliciously evil. <br /> <br /> The story is fairly accelerated when Holmes and Watson try to retrieve stolen components from the bomb sight before they can be delivered to a submarine. Rathbone is his gentle personality and several holmsian outfits are well executed. <br /> <br /> This and other 1940s Holmes stories are now available on DVD and oldies.com has released a beautiful set of four albums on a DVD. Wood Box: This movie is included along with a bonus CD from an interview with the elderly Doyle. The set sells for about $ 26 in large DVD and CD stores, but I found this and other sets of oldies.com in a warehouse club for $ 14.98. The transfers are very good. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant and relaxing night vision. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
