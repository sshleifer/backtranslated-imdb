I found this movie enjoyable and engaging to watch, and I'm surprised it's rated so low. Actually, I can see why that is; I imagine it's the fans of Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano who have given most of the 1s and 2s because if you put the tape on the machine expecting to see something starring one or both, you might be disappointed. Eric appears for about half an hour at the end of the movie, and Alyssa for about 5 scenes in the second half, and in those she says little and uses less (though never naked, if that's what you're looking for, stay with the vampire's embrace) . Although it's always a pleasure, it's a shame that she, or Eric, does not have much time on the screen, but I still give it a 8. <br /> <br />
