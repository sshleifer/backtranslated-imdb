My wife and I watched this wonderful film tonight because we will watch the Russian dolls tomorrow and the first one is important to see before the second. <br /> <br /> We love The Spaniah Apartment and we're going to enjoy following some of the characters. in the early years of their lives - now in St. Pertersburg, Russia. We both identified a bit with the story frame because we were students, Florence Italy for us, so the script was not completely foreign to our first lives. Our way of life was considerably different, but just like in this movie, when you bring together young people who go through the same obstacles as anyone in the developed world, they will experience the same situations in life. <br /> <br /> The collection of people and the personal difficulties they faced were universal and in that lies the beauty of this film and probably its sequel that I will see tomorrow. As I wrote, the characters and these situations are familiar to all of us and therefore we can enjoy living their lives for some time. This must be one of the film's great strengths-allowing the viewer to vicariously experience the emotional convulsions of the people involved, and yet remain indifferent. The spectator can, through this distance, laugh at himself thinking, "I would not have done something so stupid" or "I would have avoided this trap." Maybe that's why we go to the movies.
