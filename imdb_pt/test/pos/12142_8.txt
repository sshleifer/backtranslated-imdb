I only saw about half a dozen movies starring Lino Ventura, but this one seems a lot like the others. He plays a laconic criminal - one who has few words and is subdued, but occasionally explosive. Given his quiet persona in films like ARMY OF SHADOWS and SECOND BREATH, I noticed that his minimalist acting style is extremely effective. In other words, because he is so quiet and polite, when he does bad things that you tend to notice. And, like these other films, he also has a very strong, yet distorted, moral code. <br /> <br /> Abel Davos (Ventura) and his partner, Lilane, live in Italy and are career criminals. Both grew up in France and eventually had to jump because of their criminal activities. Now in Italy, when the film starts, they continue to live the life of bad guys and the heat is on to catch them. Oddly enough, instead of running for a third country, they decide to go back to France - even though Davos has been tried and convicted in absentia - and if caught, could mean life imprisonment or the death penalty. Much of the first third of the film concerns its covert return. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Davos, the return does not go perfectly and now it seems that every cop in France is looking for him. Moreover, the reaction of his former compatriots in crime is nothing he expected. In fact, his lukewarm response to his return has just triggered a series of terrible events at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Davos picks up and takes in my stranger, Eric Stark (Jean -Paul Belmondo). Although Davos apparently has no friends, Stark and his friend do their best to make their return successful. What throws another monkey wrench into it, though, are the two very young sons of Davos - what does Davos have to do with them - keep them with him in their hiding place? <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very good crime movie - like the French Film Noir. Unlike American Noir, the many French versions I saw have a more realistic and somber perspective for them. Fatalism reigns supreme, for sure! The acting is first rate (especially Ventura and Belmondo), the direction very sure and the writing very good, although I make sure that many will not like the end. It just seems to be added - as a belated reflection. I understood why they did it this way, but also can see how this can leave many dissatisfied. As for me, that made me a little boring. Otherwise, an exceptional movie.
