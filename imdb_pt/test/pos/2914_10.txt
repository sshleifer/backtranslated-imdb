Based on Mika Waltari's book, this already made CinemaScope movie is full of rich colors, beautiful music and scenic spectacle. The plot sometimes gets confused with contrite wording, but everything has a strong social content: man is governed by his emotions, and that every action has an equal consequence. But to really enjoy this movie, first watch the movie, then read the book. Although different, it illuminates a number of things that were not seen on the screen, and breathes for a bit more of the depth of Sinuhe.
