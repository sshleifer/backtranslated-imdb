Recovery is a well-judged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that does not send the main characters. David Tennant and Sarah Parish bring to light the complex and conflicting emotions of a deeply passionate couple struggling to accept the personality changes they both face and must also make to survive a tragic accident. <br /> <br /> Tennant, like Alan, brings humor and also a dangerous lasciviousness, like an engineer recovering from a memory loss caused by a traffic accident. Alan is not portrayed simply as a victim, but as a human being with feelings doing the best he can to make sense of his new life. Sarah Parish's Tricia is not a clich√© housewife, who will do anything to support her husband. She struggles to be dismayed by Alan, since the man she once knew and loved now is a completely different person - a stranger to her. <br /> <br /> Contrary to some opinions, this - in my opinion - makes perfect Sunday night viewing. Often we are shown family dramas or detective series, such as Heartbeat, which rot and rot the brain. Program stewards seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our minds go to sleep. A more challenging and thought-provoking drama, like that of Recovery, would seriously change the situation.
