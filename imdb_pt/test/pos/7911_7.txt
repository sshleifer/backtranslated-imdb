Considered by many as a strangely overlooked Chabrol, it seems to me that the reason he was coldly shoved is his sleaze factor. Not as overtly sexy, violent or bloody as many films of this period, however, it starts off quite surprisingly and, though becoming more measured, continues to emanate an unpleasant odor. Ms Audran, not here the ice damsel, but a drunken mother, Donald Pleasence makes an appearance as a child molester, David Hemmings has his eyes on the minor sex and the central theme involves the relationship between a brother, sister and niece. It's nothing really cool and Chabrol treats everything as if it were very normal (as if it were in a small French village!) Instead of the city of Ed McBain in New York. If this had been treated in a more sensational way, it would have been a more acceptable but smaller film. Here we really have to choose between the probability of several unpleasant options before the final outcome. Very watchable
