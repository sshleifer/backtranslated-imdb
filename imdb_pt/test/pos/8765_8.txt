Saboteur is a 1942 film, partly intended to gain American support for the war against Nazi Germany. Advertising or not, it's great entertainment. The lead actors are Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, although director Alfred Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck in the roles, which would have given the film more stature. This is a good movie anyway with Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane bringing their own style to the characters. As in other Hitchcock films, we see the director's disregard of the socially soft and wealthy. He often portrayed foreign spies and agents as good upper-class people who, at the same time, ridiculed democratic values ​​and concepts as guilty until proven innocent. These traitors of the upper crust are the last ones the police chase or even suspect. Hitchcock had a lifelong mistrust of the police. He wanted to raise the normal guy, the bumbler, and the guy who does not take himself too seriously. One can see him wanting Gary Cooper as an icon in Frank Capra's cast. However, Bob Cummings puts his own brand on the kid's door and works well on paper. Priscilla Lane, as the brave female protagonist, appears as the all-American girl who can behave very well when put to the test. Robert Cummings, as a worker at the defense plant Barry Kane, is framed by an assassination attempt that kills his best friend. This leads to a chase scene that reminds other Hitchcock heroes on the run. Hitchcock repeats some of the well-established formulas of previous films - the reluctant female who is drawn to action, for example, Madeleine Carroll in the 39 Steps, risking her life to flee the authorities at her heels. We see scenes from America as Kane tries to find the real culprit in the bombing he is accused of. We see rivers, bridges, huts, truckers, the Hoover Dam, and finally New York City. New York is a suitable backdrop for the climax as we move from the Rockefeller Center to the ocean liners (with a cut to the Normandy ship) and the grand finale of the Statue of Liberty. Great movie with uninterrupted action. Do not miss it.
