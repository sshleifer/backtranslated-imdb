I am a college student and I bought this movie in a used book store because it looked very funny from the description back. Nothing would prepare me for what would be THE FUNNIEST MOVIE THAT WOULD! <br /> <br /> It's especially good to see if you're an atheist, like me. Because then you can see how these Christian people are silly. They seem to think that non-believers like to live in really disgusting and messy homes and do nothing but drink beer and be mean to their neighbors. IT'S A DELICIOUS RIVER! My friends and I watch every two weeks so we can have fun beyond our craziest imaginations! Watch this movie NOW! <br /> <br /> Let's hope Rich Christiano makes more of these movies to entertain the heathens!
