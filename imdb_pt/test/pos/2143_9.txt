I saw this movie for the first time when it was released in 1980. From other sources, I learned that the only cut release of 219 minutes was in New York, after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes. So, I think I saw the first shorter version that at the time, I thought, was a very interesting anti-western, if a bit confusing ... <br /> <br /> So it was with even more interest that I finally got a DVD of the full version. I am glad that I did it because this second exhibition confirmed to me that the film is a true classic, and the critical criticism given to Michael Cimino was unwarranted, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a long movie, but so has been many others. For example: Once upon a time in America (1984) at 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; The Ten Commandments (1956) at 220 minutes; Spartacus (restored version) (1960) at 198 minutes; And the Wind Took (1939) at 222 minutes and others. So it can not be the fact of running the time that made so many bubbles in the mouth when Heaven's Gate came on the scene. <br /> <br /> But note this: all those films above all have to do with reinforcing myths about history and heroes. <br /> <br /> It is not like the Gate of Paradise: in this narrative, the American West is shown in all its implacable, implacable hardness, injustice, and poverty. And that's probably the first reason so many disliked this movie: it exposed the circumstances of the 1892 Johnson County War in Wyoming, showing how the Wyoming Producers Association hired 50 assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of immigrants Europeans accused of cattle rustling; and all with the assistance and connivance of the authorities, to the President of the United States. For an essay on this war, against the background and what happened, there is a Wikipedia link under Johnson County War. Very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in the history of their country , and that fly in the face of what the country should be. If it had been a documentary, it would have been palatable to most; as entertainment, was almost destined to fail commercially and to be shattered by the sharp and infamous. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the socio-political diatribe that Cimino launched here, and the narrative? ??? the story of the three main characters? Well, it probably was not unusual for the men of that time to fall in love with a local prostitute, just as probably not uncommon now. It is a rather standardized love triangle by which Ella must choose between the two men and finally decides with the younger man, Nathan, who, though not above a cold-blooded murder, shows more spirit and commitment than the old man James. (or Jim, as most people in the movie say). For some, this part of the topics in the story is very slow, perhaps; in the context of the wider war narrative, however, I think it is entirely appropriate. <br /> <br /> And this war is represented graphically, cruelly and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are beautifully staged and edited. no flaws ?? although in the final massacre between the Association and the immigrants, I am certain that some scenes of wagons that burst are repeated. A minor point and perhaps brought when the 219 minute cut was restored? Anyway, you look at the face, with the noise, the dust, the chaos and the confusion of the war ... <br /> <br /> Which leads me to another criticism of others: noise and dust is such that it is often difficult to hear the dialogue and to see clearly what is happening. I admit that I found this a bit annoying at first, even going back to play parts to try to get the picture or the words ?? until I realized that it really was not necessary if you accepted the director's intention: life is chaotic, it is difficult to hear and see in overcrowded situations, and in war it is the sine qua non of this scene. In short, it's as if you're really present inside and inside the scenes ... <br /> <br /> What about the title? From Shakespeare, it refers to a figurative closeness of God and so, if you equate God with the natural world, the dazzling landscape that permeates the film? and is it amazing, astonishingly equal to that of David Lean's Doctor Jivago (1965) ?? is a useful metaphor. I tend to think, however, that Cimino had something else to say, meaning the idea that brave immigrants ?? the God-fearing salt of the earth? they were denied entry into heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that claims to be the defender of freedom. <br /> <br /> Was that Cimino's intention? spoil the myth of the American West? To show how in America only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred in one way or another throughout history? Is that news? Not really, as we all know. What really hurts, however, is to show how the United States was not, and by implication, not the land of the free and the home of the brave. Instead, after absorbing this narrative, we get the impression that the foundations of America have more to do with a land of destitute slaves and a home for the rascals ...
