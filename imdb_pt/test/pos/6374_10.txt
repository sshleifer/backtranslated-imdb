Every show is great. Finally, a program about something other than the reason to be a married or good-looking person talking about why they are like normal people. Shame it was canceled. <br /> <br /> Mike Scully and Julie Thacker, formerly of the Simpsons, wrote or produced some of the funniest episodes in the series and much of the similar humor style infiltrates here. Take Officer Steve Cox and think about Troy McClure. However, it comes with its own brand of humor and let's face it, a teenager will love it only on the faces alone. <br /> <br /> What is it with the television that cancels more good shows and we are fed by spoon with such abominations as Who my mother almost slept with or what this show is called? Please, learn a lesson. Not everything has to be about cuteness or romantic work or especially reality shows on how to demystify every aspect of life. Some people really like to laugh and do not need to think about it later. Well, my grip is made for the day. Now back to the Simpsons. When connected? Oh yes! All the time.
