This film is based on one piece and is the second adaptation of this work. Paul Sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players who against all odds took home the championship 20 years ago. They all met for a meeting. Terry Kinney plays James, a director of Junior High, and will quickly get on your nerves with all your regret and feel sorry for my role. Vincent D'Onofrio, like Phil, plays an obnoxious entrepreneur with just the right amount of "money" arrogance. Tony Shalhoub is George, the current mayor of the city, and seems to be on the verge of some kind of collapse. Gary Sinise plays Tom, a writer, turned alcoholic and, in my opinion, is excellent in the role. While all of them should be celebrating their championship, conflicts, jealousies and fights are plentiful. As men come to terms with what they were and are now, they are forced to look at their lives in an unpleasant way. It's unusual to have a group of men chattering and crying about what might have been, and I found it interesting to see them relate. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it sure is good enough for a performance.
