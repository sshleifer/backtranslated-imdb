Clifton Webb as "Mr. Scoutmaster" is one of the greatest of all time for comedy and remember an innocence, now diminished in the world. I can not understand why networks such as American Movie Classics and such do not show this movie, although I have asked for this several times. <br /> <br /> This movie should be shown to children now by their interpretation of loyalty, respect, dedication and determination to achieve the best possible on an individual basis. There is so much low self-esteem spoken in today's everyday life, but this film among many, many others would be a wonderful learning tool for the younger generation today to see what can be accomplished by common sense and decency and pride in self himself and his achievements to improve himself. It's sad that this kind of movie does not appeal to the modern audience. It certainly appealed to the generation of baby boomers yesterday. THE ANCIENT LESSONS ARE UNIVERSAL AND INTENSE.
