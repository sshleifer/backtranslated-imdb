I remember watching this 1978 comedy in one of the bargain matinees I did when I was looking for a break from my college courses. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson make some effective attempts in the Tracy-Hepburn style in this featherweight game directed by the trusted Howard Zieff (he did "Private Benjamin") about the aggressive re-entry of a newly widowed doctor into the dating game. All breeze quickly thanks mainly to the clever script by veteran screenwriter Julius J. Epstein ("Casablanca") along with Alan Mandel, Max Shulman and future director Charles Shyer. <br /> <br /> Dr. Charley Nichols has just returned from Hawaii after his wife's death. Upon his return, he becomes aware that he is instantaneous to any and all single women in Los Angeles. He works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile team leader, Amos Willoughby, who Charley has to pacify to maintain his residence. Enter Ann Atkinson, a transplanted Englishwoman who makes cheese cakes and has certain definite opinions about the medical profession, which she freely expresses on a PBS talk show. Of course, Charley is on the program's discussion board, and sparks, as they say, fly. This leads to common complications about how seriously Charley is willing to become about Ann. At the same time, the hospital has to deal with a possible wrongful death proceeding of the widow of a wealthy baseball team owner who died in hospital under Willoughby's careless supervision. <br /> <br /> It's great to see that. mature but stimulating love story between two characters inhabited by actors who deliver lines with the skill of surgeons wielding scalpels. Matthau is the usual group of always of the 1970s and a beautiful sight, with his arms squeezing holding akimbo in his walk of power. Far from her heavy, award-winning Elizabethan roles, Jackson is extremely sarcastic and charmingly vulnerable as the lively Ann, who thinks all doctors should aspire to be Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with predictable arrogance, while Richard Benjamin offers kindly support as Charley's colleague, Dr. Solomon. It's all very compact with some nice strokes on greed inside the medical profession. There are no extras on the 2005 DVD.
