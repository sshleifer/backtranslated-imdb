I took this movie at Glenwood Cinemas this weekend as part of the Kansas International Film Festival, which, as usual, provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of the world's cinema. <br /> <br /> I've really enjoyed the Australian Film for several years, so I was happy to know that this movie was included, and I certainly was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Superbly filmed, firmly directed, it is a mysterious tale of a man and his journey into the heart of darkness, so to speak. It reminded me a little of Lynch's Wild at Heart, it has that weird madness, but I was stuck with the film for other reasons - namely, that it features a portrait of Australia that is ... well, very believable. <BR> I spent the holidays in Land Down Under a number of times, once in the 80's and again about 7 years ago with my wife. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go too far explaining my holiday, but director Frayne seems to have a lot of idea about what I find so strange and eccentric about Australia, a country that is responsible for the ends of, let's say , Nick Cave on one side, and Steve Irwin (the 'Crocodile Hunter') on the other. <br /> <br /> An incy whincy whinge - - I would have preferred even more of the 'unknown' Australia. Much more in fact. But I also realize that there is only 1 and a half hours to do everything in ... 'Sigh'. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is very, very accomplished.
