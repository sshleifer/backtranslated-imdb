While driving dangerously zigzagging on a lonely road at night, teenager Cliff (Jay R. Ferguson) is in a car accident with his friends Lauren (Christine Taylor), Alex (Kim Murphy) and Eric (Christopher Masterson). By spending the cold night stranded in the woods around a campfire, they kill time telling ghost stories. In "The Honeymoon," the couple Rick (Ron Livingston) and Valerie (Jennifer MacDonald) travel in their trailer to Las Vegas on their honeymoon. Rick takes a shortcut to visit the Clayton Caves at night, but the strange Cole (Hawthorne James) advises them to leave the place since dangerous creatures attack people on the full moon. In "People Can Lick Too," on the eve of her twelfth birthday, Amanda (Alex McKenna) tells her Internet friend Jessica that she is alone at home. However, Jessica is actually a psychopath. In "The Locket," motorcycle rider Scott (Glenn Quinn) is crossing the country on his bike. When he has a problem with his bike, he finds an isolated house where the beautiful donkey Heather Wallace (Jacinda Barrett) lives with her father. When the man returns from his herd, Scott discovers the truth about Heather. <br /> <br /> "Campfire Tales" features three good horror tales, with monsters, psychopaths and ghosts, and an astounding twist at the end. The weaker segment is "The Hook" with Eddie and Jenny, but the other stories are great. The plot point is totally unexpected and gives a great conclusion to this above average horror movie. My vote is seven. Title: Midnight Tales
