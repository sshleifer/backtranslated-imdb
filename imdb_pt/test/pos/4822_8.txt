This is unrelated to Virtual Encounters 1, so it's not really a sequel. The two videos only share the general concept of people who have simulated sex through a virtual reality machine. So if you were really impressed with the story and dialogue in VC 1 (yes, right), and waiting for a continuation in VC 2, just be warned. All the actors and actresses are new, but have the same excellent director, Sybil Richards. <br /> <br /> But, like VC 1, you have many beautiful women and a lot of great sex scenes that push the envelope of If you have VC 1 and you liked it, you will like VC 2. If you do not have one, but like good softcore sex, get them both.
