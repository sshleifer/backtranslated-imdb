Intense, funny, witty and, most of all, social comedy about adult dating modes and their results - whether good or bad. Mohr and Nicholson are engaged two months from the date of their wedding when a bizarre event at their engagement party forces Nicholson to rethink the relationship and start dating other people so she does not feel so immaculate when it comes to sexual experience. . This leads to a disaster of events following Mohr, Nicholson and his companions. Very intelligent and necessary at this time of clumsy and condescending comedy, containing his usual array of comic, sexual, and frustrated characters (especially Charles as a sexually frustrated sex addict ... very annoying) who even seem to have the right feel for this heart felt comments. <br /> <br /> The film follows the path that movies should follow these days, showing that guys are sensitive in their hearts and have morals. Most male characters are moralistic eyes and direct, while the woman is a person who walks on the street, who does not stop at anything to get pleasure. The boys will appreciate the message made to the boys with self respect, however, it is easy to assume that most of the men who see this movie will use the masculine sensibility message to cover up any flaw or trait that a woman might find offensive. Still, the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for your male leads, particularly those of Mohr, Richter, and find the director at one end as a salesperson! <br /> <br /> The females are close by. far as promiscuous as they speak of nothing but pleasure and what it would be like ... with another person. They have friendly traits, although they are covered by the image of kittens of sexual behavior. Very funny stuff. <br /> <br /> On another level, the film follows some of its ensembles in different relationship works. Richter meets a stressed-out divorcee (a VERY remarkable and noteworthy performance from the ever-reliable Helen Slater) named Penelope, who is divorced with a son who hates her for leaving his father. As the two go deeper into a relationship, human interest is revealed and both comedy and the tragedy of divorce, and starting over, are studied. At the end of the film, Mohr and Nicholson have become a way of going deeper to see what's coming, and it's up to them to learn about each other and to decide what will be. comes next. It becomes appropriate and dramatic at the right time. <br /> <br /> Wallodorski's direction is imitated very well when the characters learn to face each other after all that has happened ... with the right ending. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie should have been released across the country, and I hope it's for some Oscars ... maybe Helen Slater can finally get the recognition she deserves. Anywho, this movie is a did not hit homesick, give everything you have romantic sexual farce, displayed very mature and aesthetically. <br /> <br /> Great movie!
