What a great movie! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but I was familiar with his fun and playful music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change music in the 50's. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I do not know how accurate the film is, but suppose at least it's mostly accurate, which makes the film even more interesting. The song throughout the film only adds excitement to this biography. I do not think I would change a thing in this movie, it was okay! What a difference in the stars of the 50's to the stars of today's music. How can you compare someone like Buddy Holly to Justin Timberlake? or any of the other popular singers of this generation?
