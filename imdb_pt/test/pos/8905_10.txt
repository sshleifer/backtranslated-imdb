Watching this movie was an excuse to escape the work I had to do for my classes, but it turned out to be one of my best experiences here in France. The film does a quick job of building multidimensional characters and has a very smooth plot. The characters really had the voices you'd expect them to read the graphic novels and the artistic talent exceeded my expectations. The music was captivating and the comedy fun and cheerful, almost an inclusion flirting of modern items in a playful way. The film attracted attention, fluffy and action packed at the same time. A wonderful tale turned deftly. I'll show my French students.
