This is one of the first of the boys, but some people may not be satisfied with this like all the others. I thought it was different in some way than its ordinary Stooge antics. It was funnier for jokes than for nudges or slaps. Pay attention to a hilarious role when Larry grabs Moe's stethoscope and sings at it. Moe gives him a good slap. That part made me laugh for a good ten minutes. Another success for the Stooges.
