I can honestly say that "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" was a much better movie than I expected. Let me clarify the plot if the title of the film is a bit too vague - there is a bed that eats. A bed of evil. Eat people. Several unsuspecting women in a "walk" of some sort, stumble into the sinister "sack" and end up being victims of hunger. The process of devouring the bed consists of a yellow foam that soaks the people inside ... stomach acid; all complete with chewing sounds. This is a very strange cult film and the only George Barry movie that had forgotten that he did until word of mouth from newly acquired cult status came back to him and he decided to release it on DVD. It's not a bad movie, if you can see beyond the bad acting and enjoy the liar effects - the most ridiculous is the guy whose hands are eaten and he gets only a plastic looking at the fingers ... A very dreamy tone, too, looking very surreal and aberrant - especially the whole thing involving the artist behind the painting and the demonic story of the bed. If you like bizarre movies with no budget, eccentric than definitely looking for "Death Bed".
