The true life story of perhaps the greatest football coach the game has ever known. Knute Rockne led the football game out of the "Stone Age" with innovations such as the forward pass and offensive training changes. But he is probably best known for his motivational speeches in the changing rooms. Along the way, he brought fame and glory to a small, unknown Catholic school in Indiana. Pat O'Brien is unparalleled in her role as Rockne. A great cast that includes Ronald Reagan, who does a great performance as the first superstar of Notre Dame, George Gipp. <br /> <br /> For football aficionados, this is the biggest football movie ever. Do yourself a favor and rent the black and white version. (Some versions deleted scenes for some reason) If you have the good version, look for a brief appearance of the immortal Jim Thorpe as he stuck his head in the locker room telling Rockne and the team that they have only minutes before part two begins.
