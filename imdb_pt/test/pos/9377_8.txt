As a rule, there are few things more daunting than Hollywood's attempts to be brave. Mixing caution with a heavy hand, "message boards" pat on the back for daring to solve big problems. CROSSFIRE is not totally free from this stain; includes a sermon about the nature of senseless hate that is embarrassingly obvious, assuming a level of naivety in your audience that is depressing to contemplate. As late as 1947, it was a big deal for a movie to announce that anti-Semitism existed and was bad. (It was unthinkable, of course, that Hollywood tackled the true subject of the book on which the film was based - its victim was homosexual.) However, thanks to good writing and excellent acting, CROSSFIRE remains a persuasive examination of what now we would call it a hate crime. <br /> <br /> Post-war malaise was one of the main components of film noir, and CROSSFIRE addresses this directly. The film is set in Washington, D.C., among soldiers still in uniform, but idle, spending their days playing poker and bar-crawling. Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), an intelligent and kind Jew, explains that the end of the war has created a void: all the energy that was used to hate and fight the enemy is now out of focus and bottled up. Samuels finds three soldiers in a bar: the sensitive Mitchell, who is close to a nervous breakdown, the weak Floyd Bowers and Montgomery, a tall, arrogant bully who deprecates a young Tennessee soldier as an idiot jerk. The three soldiers end up in Samuels' apartment, where the drunken Monty becomes increasingly violent, calling his host "Jewish boy." Samuels is beaten to death, and Mitchell disappears, becoming the prime suspect for the murder. Unraveling the crime are Detective Finlay (Robert Young), dry and by-the-book, and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows that Mitchell is incapable of killing. Among the pieces of the puzzle are Ginny (Gloria Grahame), a nightclub who met Mitchell and gave him the key to the apartment, and Floyd (Steve Brodie), who as a witness to the crime, is terrified of a decaying house . Although there is no real "whodunit" suspense, the story remains thrilling and the murderer's trap is extremely clever. <br /> <br /> The strong noir atmosphere prevents the film from becoming didactic or hypocritical. Cinematography is a remarkable play of shadows, with dark shadows and strong lights, rooms often illuminated by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke. The world's weariness is as widespread as the noir lighting. "Nothing interests me," says Finlay in a low voice; "Not at all," is Ginny's toast at the nightclub. Gloria Grahame, the paradigm of femininity noir, almost steals the film with its two scenes. Platinum blonde, tired and caustic, she is the quintessential B-girl, poisoned by the "stinking gin mill" where she works ("for laughs," she says bitterly), her sweet face itching when Mitchell says she reminds him of his wife. From time to time a melancholy kindness spies through her defensive shell, as when she dances with Mitchell in a deserted courtyard, then offers to cook spaghetti in her apartment. When he goes there, he meets a man with a rough, deformed face (Paul Kelly), who seems to undress Gina, and whose conversation is a dense overlay of lies and false confessions. Gloria expels Mitchell's wife from the screen in a scene in which she asks to give an alibi to Mitchell. Lean and frail in her bathrobe, with her girlish grunt, she lets us see how often Ginny was insulted and dismissed as a tramp. Robert Young is an undecided actor, and he has no chance against Mitchum's charisma, but he does a good job at keeping his character from smoking a pipe, overwhelmed with the candid message of the movie, this side of pomp. Mitchum, meanwhile, gets a legal dialogue, but not enough to do; Still, even when he is doing nothing but relaxing in a corner, you can not take his eyes off him. The third Robert, Ryan, creates a totally gloomy and frighteningly convincing picture of an ignorant and unstable fanatic; we see his false genius, his intimidation, his resentment of anyone with advantages, his "Am I right or am I right?" presumption; how easily he inserts labels into people, and what satisfaction he gets from despising them. <br /> <br /> CROSSFIRE's message seems cautious and dated now, though not as much as the same GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT. Finlay's speech on intolerance comes from a hundred years for an example of white victimization, noting that Irish Catholics have already been persecuted; then they may be Tennessee people, he says, or men wearing striped ties. Or maybe blacks, Japanese, homosexuals or communists? The script seems to be afraid to mention real and contemporary problems. She sweetens her message by making the Jewish victim holy, as if her innocence is not enough; and takes care to exonerate the military, having a superior officer declaring that the army is ashamed of men like Montgomery, and emphasizing that Samuels served honorably in the war. Still, it took courage to portray, right after World War II, an American who could have been happier in the Nazi army, and the basic premise of the film is still valid. If Monty were alive today, he would have left on September 12, 2001 and beat a Sikh.
