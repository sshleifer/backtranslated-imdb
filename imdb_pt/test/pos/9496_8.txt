I thought this movie was really good. He ends up showing the viewers in the end that Leila should keep what she had. Leila was tired of her husband Jim, who was more concerned with work than with her. He was so into his job that he forgot his birthday. He was also very sloppy. She could not take it any more, so she left to see if he would miss her. The film shows that he misses her, he even tries to make up for the night he messed it up. He goes to her and tries to bring her home. She ends up finding another man named Schuyler. He looked like the man she'd always wanted and groomed. In the end she kind of prefigures when she looks at the Schuylers shoes and the way he lets his cigar ash fall to the floor the way Jim did the same sort of thing. Jim ends up making lots of money and cleaning up. Leila thinks that in the end she should keep her husband because it was all she really wanted and he changed.
