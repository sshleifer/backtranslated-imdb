Where the Da Vinci Code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his puzzle-solving talent, Angels and Demons raises the ante by providing a huge puzzle with a limit of 8 hours. <br /> <br /> With a cast of award-winning actors Ron Howard does a good job of directing an easy-to-follow story and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick break in the bathroom would leave you a little confused in return. I did not feel that it was with Angels and Demons, the plot was straightforward and the action kept the level of interest attained. <br /> <br /> Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the film. His interpretation of the elitist hierarchy, though misunderstood, of the Catholic Church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment, the camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will find yourself choosing sides immediately after the introduction. There is not a great deal of time for Tom Hanks, since the film focuses more on story than on character development, and it did well with me because I had a more than enough introduction of the first film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I found Ayelet Zurer's character, Vittoria Vetra, as an unnecessary assistant of femme in the mission, since their lines were somewhat limited and looked a lot like a late reflection. It plays a key role in the beginning of things, but soon disappears in the context of being "familiar" to Langdon more than a necessary partner. <br /> <br /> The plot is, as such, one of the organizations. which the Catholic Church has harmed in the past (there have been very few) have sought revenge in a more artistic way. Some church men are kidnapped and must be executed at specific times until a definite end for the church itself takes place. Dr. Robert Landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and joins the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the church enemy. <br /> <br /> The music remains relevant and the cinematography is beautiful, I could talk about these less important things, but what makes Angels and Demons work totally is the conclusion. It was by far one of the amazingly surprising finals I saw in a movie and was impressed by how off guard I was when it hit me. Like anyone else, I enjoy a great movie finale and this movie ends well and drops a beautiful bow on it. Needless to say, I left the theater satisfied with the film in its entirety. <br /> <br /> If you are religious and are not sure if this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where DaVinci's code painted Catholicism as a sombre group of sadists, Angels and Demons paints them with a much lighter brush. The church is shown to be a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who used their colors and even some who infiltrated their modern ranks.
