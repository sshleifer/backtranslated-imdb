Best Years of Our Lives is a movie that has fallen on my radar for years - I had heard about it but never got a chance to watch it. Thanks to TCM On Demand, I was able to watch it without cuts and without commercials. <br /> <br /> What surprised me in this movie was the speed with which it was made after the war. The film frankly deals with people who have been wounded in the war, both physically and mentally. It manages neatly to encompass almost every variety of war experience within three characters. <br /> <br /> We have the Air Force officer, who was a veteran of the European bombing campaign. Due to the enormous rate of friction between bomber crews, the Air Force at that time had a reputation for creating police officers who quickly rose in the hierarchy. Such was the case with this guy who went from a humble squeeze of life soda to a captain and bomber to his B-17. He also suffers from PTSD, called "battle fatigue" at the time. <br /> <br /> We have the non-army that served in the Pacific and suffered the horrors of that campaign. His story is the opposite of that of the Air Force colleague, as he moves from a prestigious job as a banker to a humble grunt in the Army and up the sergeant post. From the stripes on his sleeve, it's clear he's the highest level of Sergeant, but he's still on the front line. <br /> <br /> Finally, we have the Navy Seaman, who is part of the faceless support team. , commonly referred to as REMFs (Rear Echelon MFers) by teammates on the line. Ironically, he suffers the worst physical wounds while working as a mechanic on the deck of a Navy ship, his ship is struck, presumably by a kamikaze and is sunk with the loss of 400 lives. It is withdrawn from the water, but its severely burned hands are amputated and replaced with prosthetic hooks. <br /> <br /> BYOOL tells the story of how these three find themselves in a transport plane they have embarked home, and how they readjust themselves. What struck me most about this film is that, despite the obvious issues facing the three protagonists, it never goes down to melodrama. The navy boy, played by a real amputee, is put in situations where we may feel sorry for him, but the script never lets us feel that emotion. The Army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and history points it out, but he never talks about it. The Air Force captain fights status loss when he is forced to return to the drugstore where he drank (now bought by a large chain) and take a humiliating job to support his ungrateful and disloyal wife. <br /> <br /> The script allows many opportunities for all these characters to reach a dramatic climax in relation to their difficulties, but avoid it. But for the overly dramatic score, the director proceeded to explore the obvious. <br /> <br /> In a scene that represents the entire film well, the daughter of Army sergeant (Frederic March) is having an argument with her. father and mother in relation to the captain of the Air Force. Despite their marriage, they fell in love, and she is determined to end the marriage that is obviously problematic. Now we've seen thousands of typical scenes of this where the father is shaking angrily and the daughter runs to her room in tears, slamming the door and falling on the bed. Later, Mother appears, comforts her daughter and offers words of maternal wisdom, and all live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> In BYOOL, this scene is completely different than the cliché I described above. Of course the conversation is heated, but all parties are reasonable, and there is a serious and timeless discussion about the nature of relationships that has some of the best dialogues I have seen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, BYOOL is highly satisfying movie with honest performances from all over the cast. Technically, it's well filmed, the editing and cinematography frame, but it never overshadows the engaging narrative. Despite the punctuation, which is cliché and super-dramatic, I give this film the highest rating it clearly deserves
