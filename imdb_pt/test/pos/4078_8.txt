I absolutely hate the idea of ​​being made for television movies. To me, TVMs often involve Jane Seymour or Jaclyn Smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult disease to treat, made so sugary that the public does not need tissues that need insulin. So when MORADA VOYAGE made for a BBC TV movie and HBO based on a real story that I vaguely remembered from a couple of years before it appeared on TV shows, I sat waiting to get bored senseless. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> Without striking that last sentence, I was not surprised to be shocked. Here is a TVM that holds you more than a great white shark, in fact, MORTAL VOYAGE does not deserve to be relegated to TV shows that should have been made and distributed by a major Hollywood movie company because of its absolutely terrifying premise . s more is - unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS - completely true <br /> <br /> For those who do not know the story !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AS A PLOT !!!!! sometime in the early 1990s, a bunch of Africans were housed on a Ukrainian cargo ship bound for France to work there. Of course it was an illegal immigration attempt, but the freighter's crew had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants on their ship from a previous day and no longer want to get in trouble with maritime and immigration officials the crew killed the Africans after find them hiding in the basement. All but an African Kingsley Ofusu, who manages to escape from the firing squad, but who must try to survive aboard the ship, but the problem is that the crew is hunting him and France is still several days away. <br /> <br /> Just typing the paragraph above reminds you of how good the fatal journey is. What a remarkable story, and once again is - unlike many stories they claim to be - totally true. It's very well written, directed and acted out, especially by Sean Pertwee (Why is not this a big star?), And above all it's a disturbing claustrophobic suspense that I still vividly remember six years after seeing for the first and only turn. I look forward to seeing again. <br /> <br /> But you have to ask yourself how can a TVM be better than most Hollywood blockbusters that popped up around the same time? Ah, wait, I just had a disturbing thought about Jerry Bruickhiemer doing a remake with Tony Scott directing and with Denzil Washington playing Kingsley, Brad Pitt playing the role of Pertwee, massive artistic license taken with events etc. Let's keep MORTOS VOYAGE a superlative TVM, instead of a poor blockbuster
