Uzumaki manages to plunge you into a bizarre surreality, where Uzumaki's forms haunt and curse a city. He fails to be a competent horror film. Although the film is sure to draw attention primarily to the bizarre plot and some interesting visual delights, it will come out better as a dark comedy than as a horror movie. It is definitely a movie that you should see if you like things like that, but if you are looking for a scare or even a little cold, you will want to look elsewhere. Uzumaki does not really have much more up his sleeve, but a great chain of strange events. <br /> <br />
