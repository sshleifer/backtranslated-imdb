River's Edge is an excellent film and it's a shame that it has not made another mark for itself in film history. There were a number of films based on school kids made in the 80's, but of all the ones I saw; this is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing. The film has a storyline that is disturbing in itself and adds the theme of teen revelers and their indifferent attitude about things, which takes the story to another level. The film works because the central story is interesting and is interpreted by complex characters. The movie begins with a murder. Then we follow the killer, nicknamed John, when he goes back to school and tells all his friends about what he did. Instead of giving the expected reaction, the majority hardly reacts and the strongest reaction the killer receives comes from Layne; who makes him his number one priority to help John clear up the mess he's in and get him out of it. The other friends meditate on the crime, and in a short time one of them goes to the police ... River's Edge presents a series of great performances of his young cast. Keanu Reeves has a reputation for acting wood and for good reason; but it fits nicely into this starter role and this performance is easily one of your best. Crispin Glover is the biggest standout as the slightly insane Layne. Glover always stands out in all the films in which he is, and although he overdoes it a little; He convinces well as the lead in this film. Reeves and Glover get the support of a talented young cast that includes Daniel Roebuck and Joshua John Miller as well as the great Dennis Hopper in another wild role. The film presents a very brave image that bodes well with its nihilistic tone. The central characters are all of the "lazy" generation and the way they genuinely do not seem to mind the murder of their friend is more shocking than the murder itself; and the point the film attempts to make about modern society is strong and well defined. The film is also quite funny, due to some of the lines of the characters; but the humor is black and clearly this movie was never meant to be a comedy. Overall, this is an excellent and memorable movie that is definitely worth seeing!
