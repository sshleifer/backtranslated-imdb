An amazingly beautiful film. Beautifully designed, beautifully directed, beautifully rendered, beautifully rendered and beautifully photographed ... cinematography is nothing short of splendid. It's a war movie, but it's epic in its scope and combines romance, tragedy and comedy in a story as distressing as it is provocative.
