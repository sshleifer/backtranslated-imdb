"One True Thing" is the type of film in which audiences are inspired by greatly inspired performances. I'm not necessarily claiming that the film is uplifting because it is not. In fact, the film is pretty depressed. I'm trying to say that it takes a lot for a movie to generate emotional tears from an audience. <br /> <br /> I cried in "One True Thing," enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotionally powerful films of 1998. The characters were perfectly fused. The performances are all guaranteed Oscar Nominees, especially Meryl Streep, who portrays Kate's death extremely well. Her acting alone was enough to make the film excellent to the point of recommendation, and gives her a new point of view for her. I also thought that Renee Zellweger portrayed a realistic, single, free woman who has to take care of her own mother. The other cast members, including William Hurt and Tom Everett Scott, were also excellent. The script for this movie was really fantastic. It's funny how the concept of the movie has to do with the controversial events in my local area. You know, I live near Lansing, Michigan, and right now a big question here is the way the suicidal doctor-assistant Jack Kavorkian (excuse me, if any) has just been banned. The public will vote on this according to their beliefs in November. After watching "One True Thing", this really changed my perspective on this topic, although I have always believed in it. Without revealing the end of the film, I will simply say that suicide is a distant subject in this film and I think it fits precisely with the wonderful story. Overall, this movie actually has more emotional impact than "Titanic", "Saving Private Ryan" or any other tearjerker released in recent years. I think it's because the main idea of ​​this movie is that this kind of thing happens every day, so it relates better to the audience. And, in fact, this can happen to you.
