GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has to be the best Robim Williams I've ever seen. He acts perfectly. That was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is .. It almost made me cry looking at him. <br /> <br /> I had no idea that Robin was as close to John Belushi as he was. The picture of this relationship was very good and could almost be done on its own merits. Very sad, what both passed. <br /> <br /> I really felt as much about Val as about Robin during his hard times. Glad they finished with a high note! <br /> <br /> I hope Robin puts a $ 100 bill into this guy's hat !! <br /> <br /> And it was great that it was filmed in Vancouver!
