I watched it the other night at a local station because I did not feel like watching tripe like 'American Idol'. Peter Strauss gives a great performance as a convict named 'Rain' Murphy, who stands alone. He admits his crime and does not make bones that he does not feel ashamed for it. Your cell is empty of any comfort that other inmates have like books and photos. The only time he feels in another zone is running. He does this often and can run a mile in less than four minutes. When a college coach overhears this, he wants to prepare him for a chance at the Olympics. At first, 'Rain' does not want to be a part of it, but when his best friend is killed, he shows interest. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, period. Strauss is very good (what did you expect, nothing less?) And Michael Mann shows signs of greatness that would come to bloom years later. This movie had a bit of realism (probably because it was filmed among the damned). It almost seems like this was a true story. The additional cast is good. There are many notable names like Brian Dennehy, Roger E. Mosley and Richard Moll as well. <br /> <br /> My heart sank when a pompous board of directors did not let him run because he did not. feel bad for his crime. His last act made me stand up and cheer. When they drew their dreams, he took them back with force. That was when the TV movies were really good. 'The Jericho Mile' is a gem of a movie. ESPN Classic, PLEASE SHOW THIS MOVIE !!!
