We moved far beyond this experimental incursion into a forbidden area - drug addiction - in the 1950s. As such, the film may look dated. The man with the golden arm served his job is to peel a layer from the underside of society, an eye opener for a southern country boy in 1955, when I first saw this movie in the theater. After some serious considerations about being too young, I was allowed to go. It was powerful and affecting then and still holds some painful moments of soul naked. Like a movie portraying loneliness in the core of being, it succeeds. <br /> <br /> Full of anguish, Frank Sinatra, in his best role, creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathetic to the viewer. He conveys his impotence and ineffectiveness in a beautifully restrained performance. As voice of common sense in the urban jungle with no way out, Kim Novak as Molly is very good. She is compassionate and still on solid ground. The interaction between Sinatra and Novak is very good. Darren McGavin plays a slimy character and does it very well. Eleanor Parker is superbly annoying and painfully insecure in her role of the pathetic Zosch, Sinatra's crippled wife. Arnold Stang is another unlikely street survivor. Regarded as pitiful and despicable, his character Sparrow provides comic moments. <br /> <br /> Music is almost the star of this film - dark, frenetic, moody and moving. Elmer Bernstein's punctuation perfectly accentuates the tensions of Frankie Machine's spiritual weakness and the physical need for heroin. Molly's theme is bittersweet and audibly captures what the film portrays visually. I do not know of any other soundtrack that effectively complements the tension and defeat within a man as effectively as this.
