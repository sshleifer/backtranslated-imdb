I originally watched this because I thought it was going to be the continuation of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and this movie is a totally different thing going on here - a comedy! However, I loved it anyway! <br /> <br /> The Gentlemen's League is apparently a British TV series with some rather strange characters and keen humor. This is the British comedy, so it revolves around being very silly, dressing up with costumes and making lots of fun from Germans and French, homosexual references - in short, it's very, very funny! <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the writers of the TV show deciding to cancel some of the characters and characters coming out of their dimension in the writer's dimension to prevent this from happening. It's a fun twist and there are a lot of great scenes on this silly adventure. I laughed out loud several times and applauded the cheeky humor style. That makes Mr. Bean look how weak he is. (Rowan is much better in the Black Adder btw series) <br /> <br /> That's not Monty Python, but you can never escape the comparison when you're talking British humor, and there are some similarities, but not as many that prevent it is something new and proper. He leans more towards the young and to the Guest House Paradiso in his comic style. <br /> <br /> If you liked it, check out The Young Ones series and the movie Guest House Paradiso, and of course, I take the TV The Gentlemen's League series should be pretty funny too.
