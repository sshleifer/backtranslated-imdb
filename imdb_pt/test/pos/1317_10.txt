Mishima - a life in four chapters is, in my opinion, the best Paul Schrader film to date. Mesmorizing's cinematography, accompanied by Philip Glass's mystical musical score, added a completely magical aura to the story of one of Japan's greatest novelists, whose originality and picturesque narrative are beautifully portrayed in this picture. Like any gifted character, Mishima was worried about serious self-conflicts, the main one being the conflict between the "pen and a sword" as the director puts it in his final chapter, or the struggle between the sensitive poet and homosexual feelings, living in a notoriously masculine society with secular traditions of warriors, thus widening the distance between the sensitive and the traditionally militant side of the Mishima itself. All Schrader's films (and those for which he wrote scripts) are basically stories of inner conflict within a man who does not belong to an environment in which he lives. This also applies to Mishima, who, in addition to Japanese school education, is educated with love for theater and words. His death consisted of both key points of his life, was about words and theatrical end in a long life piece. Films like this happen every now and then, and most will have to wait a lifetime to achieve that beauty. 20 out of 10 !!
