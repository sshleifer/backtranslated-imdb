I absolutely loved this movie. Realistic and excellent combat images for one thing and a poignant and genuine story as well. The calm and discreet way of the main character, Franta, makes him very nice. Human relations in history seemed very typical and possible than might be expected in wartime. The bond between Franta and Carel shows the loyalty that comrades of war can have for each other and this is often described in books and interviews with veterans. The legends do not diminish the story and serve to underline the problems that the Czech pilots have had in the RAF. The postwar story is a great reminder that for many the suffering of World War II did not end in 1945, especially in the countries occupied by Russia. The cinematography was also very good. I wish I had seen it on the big screen.
