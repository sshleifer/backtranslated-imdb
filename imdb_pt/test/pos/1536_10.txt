"Closet Land" tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements. You can read many things about the movie plot before, but you really do not have to. All you need to know is that the movie is about an interrogation. Along the way, we learn many things about the interrogator and the person being questioned. We also learned that the world can be a dark and scary place. Especially when you have absolutely no control over it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film is a warning (actually the film has several different aspects) about what happens to people's freedom when they "look the other way" and ignore the injustices they happen to those around you. If you have about an hour and a half and know where you can rent it, I strongly recommend that you do it.
