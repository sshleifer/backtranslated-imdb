One seldom sees a sequence of films that exceeds or even equals the grandeur of its original predecessor. A movie like this is VIrtual Encounters 2. It's about a college couple selling virtual sex for the entire campus. If you like to see naked girls, this delivery. Chrissy Styler, six feet tall, is an incredible specimen and you'll be dreaming about it for days if you're lucky enough to get the unrated version. She uses the right amount of body shine in her multiple nudity scenes and her giant cans look real. With the exception of James Cameron's "Aliens", Francis For Coppola's "The Godfather Part II" and - of course - Zuckers' "Airplane 2", this is the only sequel to film history that takes a classic movie and improves upon it. <br /> <br /> It is criminal how this film was ignored by the academy, Nikki Fritz and that girl who gets tied at the beginning (as well as the brunette who gets a massage at the end) deserved the best supporting actress. <br /> <br /> Shame on Hollywood !!!
