I read that Paolo Sorrintino's inspiration for The Consequences of Love came simply by watching a businessman alone in a Brazilian hotel, and speculating what he might be doing there. The film unfolds for us in a similar way. We see the existence of Titta, who has lived alone in a hotel in Switzerland for 8 years. He is reserved and avoids friendship. His life is dominated by order and regularly. Gradually, the truth of his existence is revealed to us until at last his world begins to crumble. <br /> <br /> The mystery of Titta is central to The Consequences of Love and works largely thanks to the excellent performance of Toni Servillo. His character becomes even more intriguing to us when little details are revealed - that he injects heroin once a week, which he has no imagination. Although some here criticize the dialogue for not being naturalists, it does not matter, in my opinion - it's not that kind of movie, and I think the script is great. The camera work is also great. <br /> <br /> If you have to criticize, the movie loses its shape in the later scenes, when the mystery of Titta's existence is revealed to us, and when his world begins to fall apart. However, the tragic final scenes are as good as the previous ones.
