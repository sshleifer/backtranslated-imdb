Murder by Numbers is a very good movie. Even though the plot rolls in the rhythm of a snail, which with the character of Sandra Bullock mingling with her partner and the movie blinking back to a previous trauma situation in which she was, she manages to keep the viewer involved in the film. <br /> <br /> That said, I think he does a good job at defining this mysterious type of "who did it" type atmosphere. You figure out which of the boys was really behind the murder, if not both. I think Ryan Gosling and that other kid (lol) do a good job of selling that bully versus idiot relationship. I'm not sure if Gosling is a tough guy, but for a guy who later would star in a movie like The Notebook, he did a great job. Once the movie starts, I really got caught up in the story, sort of asking myself, "Oh my God, what would I do if I were in this situation?" As I said, a good CSI-like movie, maybe not for the movie addicted to EXTREME police drama, but a good movie everywhere. <br /> 8 outta 10
