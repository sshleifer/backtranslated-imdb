I really liked this movie. I found it a lot of fun for me because I feel it captured the romanticism of Irish-American culture at the turn of the century. There are no messages. There is no violence and there is no obvious sex, just a healthy entertainment style of 1947 and Dennis Morgan had the chance to sing some really good songs. A very good movie.
