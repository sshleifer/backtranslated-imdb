I totally agree with GarryJohal of Singapore's comments on this film. Quote: 'Yes, non-Singaporean can not see what the big problem is about this movie. Some of the references in this film go directly over the head of foreign spectators and, especially, of Singaporeans, are the ones who truly "understand". It is still not quite the truth, and as Malaysian-Chinese, I understand, although I do not speak Hokkien, because we also have similar 'problems' in Malaysia. I know it's really hard to understand and accept this as a REALITY, but it's definitely not a 'non-real story'. I had the pleasure of seeing this film outside of Malaysia because it will definitely be banned in Malaysia as well. Which means you can get it on 'copied VCDs or illegal DVDs' or expect someone to be kind enough to 'share' it on the internet. This is not a 'violent teenage drama .......' because it portrays the reality that exists in Singapore (and also in Malaysia) in an interesting way (sad + moody). I was a bit sad to know that this movie received about 20 cuts in censorship. What a waste!
