This movie is like a song. UNTIL it reaches musical numbers that are like MIND F * CK, but softer, like a mental caress. MIND FORCE. The depressing vibe given by the speed and desperation of the characters can be beautiful, Kill-Yourself-Awesome, until you reach the musical numbers. It's a great movie. Optimistic. Weird. Manic-depressive (bipolar). That's it! THIS MOVIE IS BIPOLAR. anyway, see. IT'S A MUSICAL !!! WITH DEPTH !!!! If you like existential slag like The Stranger, or Waiting for Godot, then you'll probably get a real kick out of this. I had to get the DVD from Amazon.com for about $ 12. OH and the songs are rock. Well, they are rock, but they are not rock, there is no calypso, jazz, Broadway, but by Grace Chung, and I can not find the soundtrack right now, but I want the songs to be great, and the dances are so fun
