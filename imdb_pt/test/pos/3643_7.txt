Based on the comic manga by well-known artist Masamune Shirow, this animated film was a little disappointment to me. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but the animation is merely "OK" as long as it could / should have been mindblowing. The film is appropriate, but it seems somehow flat and uninspired if you know what I mean. A missed opportunity, if you consider that another work by Shirow, "Ghost In The Shell," is considered a classic in many ways. It set new standards for Japanese animation and generated, among other things, a brilliant series called "GiTS: Stand Alone Complex". <br /> <br /> I consider it worth renting unless you are a fan of Shirow. and I want it all. Check out the original manga, which is highly recommended.
