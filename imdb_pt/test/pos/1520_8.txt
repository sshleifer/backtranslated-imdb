The land of the closet is not in the happy movie. Nor is it bound to any kind of social realism. This is perhaps your strength. The distance of time and specific nations strengthens the message, makes it more powerful, and destroys the burden of nationalism and propaganda that you often feel in films made to criticize nations opposed to yours (of course I speak primarily of US propaganda in some commercial movie) <br /> <br /> The land of the closet is much more than a message. It is a film of pure surreal beauty, filled with the same clean and clinical form that you find in works like 1984 and it is the same. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Alan Rickman, the man with the golden sarcasm (and, I might add, the unparalleled sexual appeal ;-)). The outplay between him and Madeleine Stowe is brilliant. Every time I see him, he seems to play a character even more unpleasant than the last one ... <br /> <br /> But sweet enough. The movie is not in action. I do not want cars crashing, but I want something to happen except pure talk. After an hour, I was really tired of the interrogation room, the foreseeable actions, and most of all, I wanted a more complex view of everything, the world, the characters' previous lives, and the rest of the structure that was missing. For some people a nice touch. For me, something less positive. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the Closet Land is a movie worth doing if you're ready to take a trip to the abyss of human nature. <br /> <br /> And of course for us who really loves the always evil Alan Rickman.
