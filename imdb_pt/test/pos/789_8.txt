I saw this for the first time on UK TV with good musical accompaniment. The elevator scene is classy, ​​especially when it does the thing to get down in the phone booth, and then it touches the floor indicator. The jump through the transom panel is really impressive, and there is so much more. In addition to all the things that have been mentioned before, there is the quarrel with the man who has bullied the woman with the dog - it seems so simple. The only drawback is the plot - he gets involved with Dead Eye Dan, who then escapes, but does not reappear, even as more gangsters get involved later. The scene in which he seems to be shooting at the great inspector is funny, but it would have been better if the Dead Eye were the only one to pull the trigger.
