The summary is only for those who hate this movie, as finding the movie OK or the average is acceptable. Visiting this movie on IMDb made me nostalgic because I can not stop myself from going back in the year 1994. I was one of the lucky few who watched this movie in theaters. It instantly became one of my favorite comedies and it took a few years to make it my favorite. How can I tell you what made this movie my favorite? It was the excellent writing (the story was good, but the script and dialogues were fabulous). Were the superlative performances? Was it the mood of the movie? <br /> <br /> After thinking about it for so many years, I say it has to be a mix. It's one of those movies that did not fail even their music (the other movie that comes into my head right now is Sholay) PS: Rajkumar Santoshi please keep a balance between your drama films and comedy. Only 1 comedy is not enough. I want moreeeeeeee ..........
