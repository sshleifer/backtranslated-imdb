What a great show! A very underrated dramatic show. It's great as there are no main characters and each episode some other characters are the main characters. I think the best character on the show is Vern Schillinger. He is a tough, bad guy and an Aryan in addition, which makes him a real prisoner who has many who are known to be. This show has a lot of murders, I think it's a little overdone for the murder on the show, but I have to admit that's one of the reasons I think the show is so good. I think some characters were killed a little early, but some of them sure left their mark. You can not compare things like Prison Break to this show, they are totally different. I think some of the actors in the show are also very good and underestimated and what is due to them. A great show, my favorite. A show that should be considered great for many years.
