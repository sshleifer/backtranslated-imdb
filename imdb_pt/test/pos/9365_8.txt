Brilliant Thriller, deserving much more fame, Mitchum and Ryan are incredible in their main roles as well as all supporting cast. A truly engaging film with wonderful images and great dialogue, at the heart of it all is a strong message of tolerance and understanding. Based on a novel about homophobia, this film attacks post-war anti-emitism, and all intolerance and hatred, with considerable power. Although the parts may seem a bit cursory to the modern audience, it still has the power to shock and works very well as a thriller by itself. A credit to all involved.
