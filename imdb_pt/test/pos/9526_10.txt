I think together all the reviewers have captured this movie very well. I've seen it over and over, but I still feel a sense of joy and warmth, just like I did the first time. My emotional reaction to this movie never seems to go away. The final scene certainly brings me to tears, but also the scene between Perks and The Children on their birthday. As for the gentle gentleman. Something else is happening with this character. A generous provider and problem solver. He knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere. A perfect father to run around and make us feel safe. I do not know how the film does this, but it touches something very English in the background, which has long disappeared from our daily experience, but we all recognize it instantly and yearn again.
