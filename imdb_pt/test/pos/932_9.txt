It is not difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do the exact opposite: see them in order, Blue, White and Red, and consider them together as a complete work. . It is true that they are distinct stories with distinct themes: freedom, equality, fraternity, and each of them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and art. Each of them is worth seeing independently, but I believe they are best viewed as a job. Collectively, he would rate the trilogy as 9; separately, I put each one in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994. <br /> <br /> The red color is more memorable in the third movie as a backdrop in an outdoor advertisement whose model is the main of the three main characters in the film. The other two characters make a double recognition of a varying degree of recognition when they first reach the ad, posted larger than life alongside a busy intersection of the city. This ad is not an important part of the plot of this film, but its image becomes striking and is one of the reasons why I called Red an "amazing" movie. This is the third of the three-color Kieslowski trilogy, based on the blue-white-red of the French flag and the three parts of its motto, "Freedom, Equality, Fraternity". Films focus mainly on these themes, maintaining the basic levels of one, two or three main characters, but with each film the plot's complexity increases as the three principles move from fundamentally personal (Liberty, Blue) to relational (Equality , White) for social (Fraternity, Red). Red is my favorite of these movies, and I give it 9. It stands out as a great movie, but one should see Blue and White first for the most complete effect.
