This is a fantastic movie. Hana is a very old guy with a very young heart. He knows how to live his life fully every day by joining his friend by playing tricks on almost everything, even on his own death. While his wife can not cope with his "irresponsible" behavior, she also knows that this is exactly why she has loved her husband for nearly half a century. I would love to date this guy because he knows how to enjoy live and never fear death. He is cheerful, witty, naughty and never boring. Vlastimil Brodský brilliantly played Hána at the age of 79. Every look in his eyes and every movement of his aged muscles convey much of the character to the audience. This is a movie that leaves a big smile on my face later, and it makes me look at my own live a little closer. Tomorrow I'm going to buy a mansion and have some fun. If Hana, I can too. But I think I'll skip the smoking part.
