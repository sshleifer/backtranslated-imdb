If you like suspense this movie has it. The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute increases her insolence and increases suspense. The appearance of Alec Guiness was cool, but did not contribute much to the film. I'm not sure if the role of Evan Richard as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he should just be a clumsy idiot. I thought cinematography was great. This added not only to production quality, but also to suspense. The tub view with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful. Also the scene in which the knife descends and then changes to Andy Clarke by cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done. I would call this good entertainment in general
