I would not compare this to Le Placard, IMHO had more comedic moments, but Romuald & Juliette, although being a slow beginner, certainly kept his attention throughout the film, well paced and coming to a cheering conclusion :) There have been many wonderful comedic moments , some brilliant pathos and a realistic situation acting for all the actors. <br /> <br /> It was a typically French film, in which confronting prejudices and phobias, which in turn made the viewer confront their own shortcomings! I'm certainly happy to have this in my library and will undoubtedly watch it over and over again, which for me is a mark of a great movie.
