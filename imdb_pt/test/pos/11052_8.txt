78 years ago ... the debut of "Anna Christie" announced by the slogan "Garbo Talks!" The film lasts 16 minutes and spectators reach the climax of curiosity: Greta enters the bar and goes through the long-awaited transfer from silence to sound: a few seconds closing her silent era, and finally Greta Garbo says a historical line: "Give me a whiskey, ginger ale on the side and do not be stingy, baby! " "Anna Christie" (1930) is the film by Clarence Brown, who introduced a great silent star, Greta Garbo, in the spoken films. Nowadays, we can only imagine the serious transference to actors and actresses. The careers of many were doomed to the end - something we hardly see or see at the moment. And it was not by accident that it was Clarence Brown who directed the first talkie with Swedish beauty. Garbo relied on the director after two of his great silent productions, FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1926) and A WOMAN OF AFFAIRS (1928): Films that achieved blockbuster box office success, both with Garbo leading. <br /> <br /> But we are in 2008 and this fact about the film, now purely historical, seems to be of lesser importance. The question for today's viewer is not how Garbo's voice sounds, but whether the film is still watchable after those 78 years. In other words, we all strive to answer the question whether the film stood the test of time. Does? <br /> <br /> When I recently watched, I came to the conclusion that except for some minor technicalities, including the static camera, "Anna Christie" is still a lot of fun. It is, on the one hand, a wonderful story of a life, of a reality that the young woman faces (being based on the play of Eugene O "Neill) and, on the other hand, an artistic manifestation of true magnificence in the field of direction and performance. Let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs. Content: Chris Christopherson (George F Marion), a heavy drinker, lives a life of a sailor, in a barge. Although his days full of sorrows, he is comforted by a letter from his daughter Anna (Garbo), whom he has not seen for fifteen years, says he will return to him, begins to change everything for the better, but forgets that his daughter is no longer an inexperienced child, but a 23-year- several kinds of things on a farm in Minnessota where she lived and worked, and forgets that she has the right to accept another kind of masculine love ... in her life ... This brief presentation of the content not from the perspective of the main chara But the what are we Sooner than Anna (her father, Chris) makes you realize just how universal it is. Merely no letter of all the text that life seems to have been erased after all these years. Cases discussed here in 1930 are still significant and valid ... PERFORMANCES. There are not many characters in the film, but there are two who really shine in the roles. Of course Greta Garbo did something extraordinary in her 15-year phenomenon, the presence that strongly influenced the history of early cinema (something I've discussed in many of my earlier comments about her films). But here, Garbo is a little different. I admit there are moments in this movie when she does not feel very comfortable with her role. This seems to be caused by his new experience with sound in English; however, its performance is, as always, genuine and unique. But that's what everyone expected of Garbo. The true surprise of the movie for the 1930's viewers and also for us is Marie Dressler as Marthy. She excels in her facial expressions, in her accent, in the whole depiction of a woman who drinks and looks at life from the standpoint of "hitting the bottle." Her best moments include the conversation with Anna Christie at the bar preceded by her hilarious conversation with Chris. The rest of the support cast is fine, but it's no big deal (the German version makes up for it). Particularly Dressler, with the exception of Garbo herself, is an absolutely perfect choice. <br /> <br /> If you asked me what I like about "Anna Christie" today, that's what I'd tell you: it's a classic movie. However, there is one more thing I should mention in the end. It is humor, wonderful intelligence that is noticed everywhere. Although the content is quite serious and "Anna Christie" does not have a comedic spirit (Garbo's only comedy was NINOTCHKA), there are times when you're going to split your sides. Do not skip, for example, the visit of Anna and Matt in the amusement park, particularly in the restaurant where he orders milk for her to think how virtuous and innocent she is, beer for herself and where suddenly Marthy joins them by chance. .. "Anna Christie" is a perfect movie for classic fans and a must see for everyone, at least a bit interested in the true magnificence of performance. If you're fed up with many of these modern stars, look for these movies and you'll be satisfied. Worth your research! <br /> <br /> Skaal Greta Garbo! Skaal Marie Dressler! Let's toast to the great work you've done in the movie! Skaal after all these years, when the taste of wine is much better and your spirit is with us in a different sense ...
