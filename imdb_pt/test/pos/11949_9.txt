This is the classic humor of the 80's. If you were a teenager in the 80's, this was a summer hit to go see. It was a first look at the now super stars. This and Better Off Dead are just fun and silly movies to sit and enjoy. Everyone can admit they had a crazy summer when they were teenagers. Even a crazy family and friends like these characters. Being introduced to some of these characters was a lot of fun. Uncle who is crazy sitting all the time on a radio waiting to win a million dollars, the grandmother who just likes the granddaughter and handed an account to the children after dinner, the twin brothers who do not look anything, and meet hoopz was so lot of fun. That may not win a prize, but it's just a fun movie to get lost in one afternoon.
