This belongs to the top level, although there were others, such as Micro-Phonies and Punch Drunks, who were more deserving of Oscar nominations than this. But if nothing else, the recurring speaker ad, "Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard," followed by "Woo woo woo woo" by Curly, makes this a classic on two levels. First, it symbolizes everything the Stooges represent; My daughter loves repeating the ad when she's in the middle of doing something silly. Second, the absurdity of these three as doctors in a hospital; I imagine the terror I would feel if I were a real patient in a real hospital and heard this ad on the loudspeaker. Throughout this short, you hear this ad and you know something horrible is about to happen, and the speaker's voice stays with you for months afterwards.
