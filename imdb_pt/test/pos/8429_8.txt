I'm a big fan of the 1995 version, which I've seen many times and consider it an excellent and subtle film. That 1971 version I bought yesterday, a bit hesitant, but now that I've seen it, I'm glad I made it, because it's more faithful to Austen's book and insights. The 1995 version has more dramatic power, mainly because it sharpens many of the characters - in the 1995 version, Lady Russell is snobbish, more manipulative, less truly looking at Anne; Sir Walter is even more vain and insipid; Elizabeth is more unpleasant; Mary is more unbearable; Mr. Elliot is smarter; Lady Dalrymple is a lot more stupid - but I think the characterizations of this 1971 version are closer to the book, to Austen's vision and to the real people of the day. The 1971 version also includes more of the main lines and scenes from the book, including especially the key scene in the field where Anne hears Wentworth talking to Louisa (or Henrietta?) About the importance of character strength. I found the performance more subtle and evocative than many of the critics here, but the performance in the 1995 version is more powerful. I agree with the critics here that the actress who plays Anne is too old for the role; I researched her role in IMDb and she was 38 at the time of filming, when her character was supposed to be 28 years old. I thought her acting was subtle and effective, though. Wentworth is the right age and I found him very convincing. In particular, this 1971 version of Wentworth has a lot more of his sense of humor and provocation; the one of 1995, much more of the sense of power that a sea captain would have, and more passion. The admiral in the 1971 version lacks the coarse presence and human warmth of the one in the 1995 version and has no sense of the power an admiral would certainly convey; I found the only really weak element in production. I agree with the others that the staging of the "fall" scene was a lot of wood, and it seemed unconvincing that she had been so hurt with such a small fall. However, it may be that she hit the back of the head on the edge of the stone step, which, if so, would indeed produce a very dangerous injury, and make the scene more convincing than the scene in the 1995 version , where it falls farther, but is free of any sharp edges that could cause a serious head injury. As for the costumes that some have criticized, I am no expert and I can not answer, but I will note that none of the Navy characters (Wentworth, Admiral Croft, Benwick, Harville) in the 1971 version wear their uniforms, while in the 1995 Version all of them consistently wear their extravagant uniforms. I suspect the 1971 version is the most accurate, and it always bothered me a bit in the 1995 version, the police being always in uniform when the nation is at peace and the police are separated from the active. My father and grandfather were naval captains of the US Navy who commanded aircraft carriers and submarines, and did not spend all day off or leisure in their bluesuits. I doubt it was any different 180 years ago. The uniforms give the 1995 version a lot of zing, and I prefer it, but I doubt it is historically necessary for these cops to wear their uniforms so often. Lastly, it is true, the production values ​​of the 1971 version are much smaller than the 1995 version, but given the year (1971), the TV format and the budget, we can not blame the artists for that. Contemporary viewers who can make a mental concession for lower production values ​​may find that this version is well worth their time.
