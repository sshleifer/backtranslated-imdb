Two sisters, Su-mi (IM Soo-jung) and Su-yeon (MOON Geun-young) return home with their father (Kim Gap-soo). Eun-joo (YEOM Jeong-ah) welcomes them, but Su-mi's way is bitter for her. Su-mi hates Eun-joo because her father let her act as the wife of the house after the sisters' mother died. Seeing his attitude, Eun-joo begins to treat the sisters coldly and there grows a tense atmosphere between them. As if called by the atmosphere, a series of mysterious things occur in the house. When Su-mi is hanging the dress in her wardrobe, many dresses of the same design have already been hung. When she puts her diary in a drawer, she finds another journal of the same type there. When she is sleeping in her bed with fear Su-yeon, a nightmare wakes her up and she finds a woman standing over her - and a hand hanging out of the woman's skirt! <br /> <br /> Mysterious things happen to other people as well. On the night of the next weekend, Eun-joo's brother and his wife visit the family and dine together. Eun-joo speaks cheerfully about a crazy man he met when she was a child, but no one is interested in his talk. She says the madman has angered her brother, but he says he knows nothing about the man. <br /> <br /> Hearing their conversation, his brother's wife is in a panic. <br /> <br /> After dinner, the conflict between Eun-joo and the sisters becomes worse. Eun-joo pulls Su-yeon into a wardrobe and locks her in it. Su-mi rescues her sister crying and complains with her father what Eun-joo did with her daughter. But his response is unexpected. "Give me some time." he says angrily, "Su-mi, please. Do not tire me anymore." <br /> <br /> And the following words from the mouth of the father are more shocking than what they saw in the house. <br /> <br /> To tell you the truth, I hate horror movies. Although I sat in a theater because my intuition told me that the movie was something different, I was regretting what my curiosity made me act when it began to appear. Repentance, however, had become joy in expectation ten minutes later. <br /> <br /> This film is more of a tragic mystery than a horror - painful more than horrible; beautiful more than sensational. This may have a hard core horror fan disappointed, but for a mystery fan like me, this movie is a must see. (9 out of 10)
