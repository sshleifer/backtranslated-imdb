It kicks your stomach. There are other films with more convincing characters, a more realistic story and perhaps more in-depth in political invocations. But again, most of them are not directed by Peter Watkins. Perhaps the only brilliant British Film artist to emerge from the 1960s, Watkins has made a lot of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the outside-aesthetic world - the world of political events, social problems, and government solutions. Thus, his work is probably less "filmic" than, say, political, which some might call the weakening of his inherent artistic quality. Then again, why should art not allow itself to be engaged? Watkins dares. And successful. You will not feel good about this. You will not feel happy. In fact, you will not like the movie very much; is intransigent, honest, direct, without shame; a break in his face, in short. You can not help but be angry, you can not resist letting the things you see touch you. That's what makes Watkins' films so rewarding.
