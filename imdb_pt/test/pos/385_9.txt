It's obvious from the outset that playboy actress Robert Walker chose Farley Granger as an involuntary accomplice to a couple of murders. Granger is a semi-public figure, he is a tennis pro, but not a particularly high professional. But enough for him to know that Granger is stuck in a loveless marriage and would like the freedom to marry Ruth Roman. So when they meet as complete Strangers On A Train one afternoon, Walker knows enough that Granger will at least be intrigued enough that if the two complete strangers commit homicide in parties that the other would be convinced by his death. Although Granger is repelled by the idea, one of the beautiful things about this movie, is that you can see in the performance he gives that Granger could submit to the temptation. <br /> <br /> In fact, when Walker kills Laura Elliot, Granger's wife, who was twice he and even got pregnant by another man, he hopes that Granger, in turn, assassinates Walker's father to that Walker can inherit his property. Today, Walker would be called a fiduciary baby and quite malevolent. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker for his career role, ironically in his last full-length movie. Walker died the following year with most of my son John finished. Hitchcock does not do much harm for Farley Granger as well. <br /> <br /> Of course when Granger dodges himself of committing murder in people who have never done anything to him, the tension. Strangers On A Train is also featured by a great edition, first in the tennis match in which Granger has to end the match and challenge Walker before he plants evidence condemning Granger at the crime scene. And also in that final climax with a fight in a wild uncontrolled carousel between Walker and Granger. <br /> <br /> Strangers on a train is Hitchcock at its best, should not be missed and should be necessary viewing when the film lessons study edition.
