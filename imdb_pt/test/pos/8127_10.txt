I really enjoyed watching this movie for the first time a few years ago, and whenever it's replayed somewhere (which luckily happens on European cable TV) I experience the same thing, I get excited and I end up wishing <br /> <br /> All this deals with Leo (Kevin McKidd) and his group of friends who live in London's urban area, Leo as a gay guy following a friend to a hilarious New Age Men's Group. and falls in love with Brendon, a straight guy, played by James Purefoy, who ends up not being so straight. Launched as supporting characters are the equally great Tom Hollander and Hugo Weaving, whose parallel story is worth watching the film, Simon Callow as the leader of the Men's group, performing a great performance as always. But it's very hard to pick some people here, because all the characters, like Jennifer Ehle's, Julie Graham's and Harriet Walter's too, are exquisitely represented. Maybe even Kevin McKidd looks a little pale in comparison to his co-actors, but this benefits his somewhat depressed character. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this film is simple: there is never just black-and-white, ratings are difficult and may not always stand the test of time. Leo identifies himself as gay, but ends up falling in love with a woman who ends up being his teenage girlfriend and Brendon's longtime girlfriend. Brendon starts straight but begins to learn that gay can be more than just an option for him and being bisexual may not be that bad. Darren and Jeremy (Hollander and Weaving) are gay and kind, and even the film's heterosexuals, like Leo's roommate Angie, get their fair share of love and funny moments by the end of the movie. Comedy excerpts (especially Tom Hollander, which is hilarious) are funny and fair, and emotions are believable, however confusing they may seem to read this summary. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie is a genuinely positive notion. If you're gay, straight, bisexual or just not sure, this movie leaves you with the feeling that it's okay to not be sure and that being "unsure" may be worth living too! Sexuality is portrayed as fluid in this film, and none of the main characters seems to have a real problem with it, in addition to all the gay / straight-camp fights that you sometimes feast on in other gay-themed films. I can only honestly agree with the subtext of the movie, that what you are sure of one day, when you think you identify as gay, straight, whatever, it may look very different in another. I've never seen (what to call it?) Bisexuality or maybe just the absence of the segregating need for sexual classification is portrayed in such a comforting and true way to life. <br /> <br /> This movie dares to go where some movies, gay or straight films go, not playing on stereotyped sex labels and assumptions and relying on it. It goes beyond and assumes that there may be a life for sex after well-known ratings and I think the times are more than ready for this and other movies exploring postmodern themes like this! <br /> <br /> And for everyone else who does not care about it, it's a funny comedy that's worth watching on a rainy Saturday night with a little popcorn in your hands. Try it! <br /> <br /> I loved it!
