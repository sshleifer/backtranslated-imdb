Being a Belgian, I have an interest in Congo's history. It was our only colony for many years (Rwanda was a Belgian protectorate, but not a colony), and it is part of the history of our country. Nowadays it seems very popular to say that everything the Belgians did to Congo was wrong, especially in the nineteenth century. I'm not saying bad things did not happen. Of course they did, but back then it was not abnormal. Do you really think that the French or the British were much better off in their colonies? No, they were not. It was "normal" for our king Leopold II to use the Congo as a way to gain personal wealth. It was his private property (he did not belong to the state) and he tried to get the most out of it. Of course, horrible things like cutting hands happened, but today's standards are inadmissible, but in those days it was common practice. And it has to be said, all this has not happened in the last decades ... I know several people who lived and worked in Congo for many years before the declaration of Congolese independence. It is true that they had several black servants, but they are very nice people and I really can not imagine that they have never treated them badly. As far as I know, they always treated them with a lot of respect (however, I'm not saying that all Belgians did). In fact, if they were not so old now (almost all at 80), they would like to return to the Congo. The good thing about this film is that it gives a historically accurate view of what happened during the last years of Belgian governance and the early years of Congolese independence. The story is not so black and white (maybe not the best words in this context, but how else to explain what I mean) as I feared it to be. It does not say that everything the Belgians did was wrong and everything the Congolese did was good. It shows perfectly how the Congolese, in their race to become independent of the Belgians, did not mind accepting the help of the Russians and Americans, who had more attention to raw materials like copper, diamonds, bauxite and rubber. ... and catching the Congolese in their political 'field' and were not so interested in their independence. Not only does it give a good idea of ​​how Lumumba became more powerful, but also how Mobutu played a double role. It shows the Belgian reaction in some of our compatriots being raped, threatened and even murdered (My father was one of the paratroopers who were sent to the Congo to rescue the Belgians). It gives a good idea of ​​the political problems that Lumumba encountered, since the province of Katanga did not want to be part of the Republic of Congo, the role that the Belgians played in the murder in Lumumba ... everything is part of this film. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be very accurate and the characters really look and act like the real ones. This film was able to give a good idea of ​​what life was like in the Congo in the late fifties and early sixties and that should be seen by all who were interested in the history of the country. But it should also be shown in history classes, especially in Belgium, because it is a part of our history that should never be forgotten. I give it a 7.5 / 10, maybe even an 8/10.
