George Scott made the performance of a life in Paddy Chayefsky's THE HOSPITAL, a very somber drama about a big city hospital and a middle-aged doctor on the brink of suicide. Along comes Diana Rigg as a free spirit determined to save him from himself. Their dialogue pops, and of course they are meant for each other from the start. But will she save him? His sex scene is both graphic and memorable for his passion and fury. Meanwhile, the hospital is surrounded by a group of agitators who do not want to turn a condemned building into a cancer center. And a serial killer is released at the hospital, specializing in doctors and nurses. A good part of the film, however, is directly focused on Scott. How it should be. What a difference a few years ago when this movie was made. 1962 gave us the INTERNS, an old-fashioned reformulation of DR. KILDARE with terrible acting and a cardboard script. Together came 1971 and THE HOSPITAL. Less than 10 years later. Hollywood did something right for a change. Attending HOSPITAL today is a reminder of how many medical shows, such as ST. IN ANOTHER PLACE and EFFORTS owe to this enduring classic. And if the HOSPITAL reminds you of the NETWORK, you should. Same scripter.
