Clearly my rating for this is not to suggest that it compares to the class horrors of Argento's tastes, but with another low budget of the 70's, driving at fare and in that department is truly a classic. The lack of money shows, (Does anyone care too much?) The acting is adequate rather than professional, (does this make it more realistic?), But unlike so many other movies, not just low budget, this does not a moment . Crap, it can be, but without stopping crap, in your face crap and although inevitably a little overdone sometimes, this is a must see for anyone who has any idea what I'm talking about. Sometimes delirious, this little crazy movie full of crazy characters is clearly made for fun and fun, it's to watch.
