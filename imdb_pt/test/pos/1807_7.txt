There were lots of dumb teenagers doing sex movies in the 80's and many horror movies, but there were only a handful that was done with thought, made you laugh and captured the right time period; this was one of them. Cage is Hillarious, as well as Forman, who, from his biography, disappeared from the Hollywood spotlight. I would love to see this released on DVD in a special version with comments from Cage and Forman. Thought of desire, I know. I've always wanted to plan an 80's movie weekend, rent it, Sure Thing and 16 candles and Breakfast Club. It will take you back to a time "Totally Rad" that looked like at the time, was much simpler. Memo for studios: time to launch the DVD!
