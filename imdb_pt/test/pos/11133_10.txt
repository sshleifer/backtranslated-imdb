'Fame' (1980) is brilliant. It has all these qualities that made the late 1970s films so good. He is proud of his frankness and is not ashamed to be exaggerated. <br /> <br /> What really matters here is the journey, not the destination. Foolish idiots with the novel mentality will never realize that 'Fame' is about the struggles, anxieties and triumphs of these young people, not about their careers. <br /> <br /> Ironically, none of the very talented actors of 'Fame' did this in Hollywood. 'Fame' marked the end of an era. The end of freedom and artistic experimentation and the beginning of marketing and political correctness. It is the last statement of a generation that had a voice of its own. <br /> <br /> 10/10
