It's an amazing movie that puts you in your chair waiting for the last minute of the movie, leaving in its heels a sweet taste of: ... I want more! There are very good actors, Portuguese actors who have much experience in the world of theater and cinema. It's not a million-euro movie, but we can still see the destruction of a car in a great perspective that puts it in the film. If you have the opportunity to get your hands on this great movie, do not wait another minute: just watch the movie! I think Portuguese films are increasing quality. Beware of Spanish producers ... The Portuguese are getting a high standard of quality. I've seen the movie and I'm waiting for more ...
