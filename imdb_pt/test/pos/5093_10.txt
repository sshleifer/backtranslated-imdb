Peter O'Toole gives a brilliant performance in this film. I saw the original version with Robert Donat and I much prefer the performance of Peter O'Toole and the film in general, even being a musical. I've never really seen anything that Mr. O'Toole is that I do not like. He is a brilliant, multi-talented actor, giving performances full of passion and depth. Petula Clark also performed surprisingly well and was perfect for the role. It is an exciting film, full of sweetness and sweet bitterness. I will always remember (in a para-phrase) the line in which Mr. Chips laments that he has never given her children, and she replies, "Of course you have, hundreds of them - all boys." Thanks for the opportunity to vote for this movie and express my opinion.
