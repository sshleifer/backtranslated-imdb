As a long-time admirer of the 2001 film "Moulin Rouge," and Jean Renoir's latest film admirer, I knew I would inevitably watch the French Cancan sooner or later. The film tells a fictional story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub. The businessman Danglard (Jean Gabin) tries to transform the washerwoman of Montmartre Nini (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) into a canana star, without arousing the wrath of his stormy lover, the belly dance Lola (Maria Felix). This is just one of the many love triangles in "French Cancan" - faithful to the stereotype, these French showbiz folk are always falling in love. <br /> <br /> Renoir drives with his typical gentle humor and attention to the supporting characters, and also wrote the lyrics of a beautiful waltz song featured in the film. Gabin perfectly embodies the aged French playboy hero. Arnoul is a fluffy redhead who performs on the dance numbers except for a few tricks in which a double is obviously used. <br /> <br /> The "French Cancan" is advertised as a musical comedy and there are many things. of musical numbers that take place on the stage of the club, etc., only one character, Casimir, always starts singing in the middle of the conversation. The actor who plays him, Philippe Clay, is fun to watch - a tall, skinny young man who sings, dances, and twists. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a long string of cancan, as all characters learn to triumph over their problems and to make art together. The dance is much brighter and more coherently edited than in "Moulin Rouge"; In fact, if I have a complaint about "French Cancan", it's that the whole thing is a bit Technicolor. Even when Nini experiences a broken heart or someone sings a melancholy song, the lighting is bright and flat with no intrusive shadows. Yes, the result is a cheerful and affectionate musical comedy; it's just that I can not help but think that things have never been so colorful and innocent in real life.
