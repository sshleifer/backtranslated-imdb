This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a little younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I did not have much taste at the time (not to say I do now), so I can not guarantee my nine year old very well. The movie was probably a 7/10, but it had good music so I gave it an extra point. Yes, it is worth watching. I know some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that pops up when she's in the car crash. The song is "Play a Love Song" by the Jaguars and is VERY hard to find and get. In fact, this movie is also. I can not find it anywhere online or on DVD or VHS. I'd like to see him again so I can gauge if it was really a good movie. Oh well.
