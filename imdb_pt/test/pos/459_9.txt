"The Journey" is a romantic version of the Cold War. It is about an Englishwoman (Deborah Kerr) trying to smuggle her old love, a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards, Jr.), out of Hungary during the Hungarian Uprising in 1956. She is aboard a bus with thirteen other international people who are trying to leave Hungary by the Austrian border. <br /> <br /> Of course the bus is stopped by the Russians for a security check. The Russian officer in charge (Yul Brynner) is attracted by the English woman (Deborah Kerr) and delays the trip. Of course the Russian official knows the truth about the Hungarian scientist who presents himself as a British citizen, but decides not to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for the Englishwoman to come to him. Of course, this all sounds absurd, but it's a fun movie to watch. Despite the romantic flow of dialogue between Mr. Brynner and Mrs. Kerr, which seems inappropriate in the situation they are in, the film becomes suspenseful and interesting. Good acting replaces some of the silly dialogues. Maybe some people involved in the Hungarian Uprising do not appreciate this movie; they would consider a piece of fluff. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite role of Yul Brynner. He speaks with his own male voice and is very attractive, especially when he becomes vulnerable. This is the second time Deborah Kerr has worked with Yul Brynner since they made "The King and I" in 1956. They make a very attractive couple. Too bad they never worked again. This was Kerr's second sexy role since "From Here to Eternity." Despite the fact that Kerr was wearing heavy winter clothes throughout the film, she was very beautiful and sensual. <br /> <br /> The excellent support cast was directed by Jason Robards Jr. in his first movie role. Some of the international actors were recognized, such as Robert Morley of England. However, the rest of the actors, I've never seen before or after, were great in the movie. In the background, it was fun to see Senta Berger, as one of the maids, speak a few lines of Hungarian. Some years later, in 1966, she was in a movie, "Cast a Giant Shadow", with Yul Brynner as its protagonist. She's still working today.
