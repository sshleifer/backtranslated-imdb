I slowly collected the films available on DVD from Catherine Deneuve and Fran√ßois Truffaut. Both the actress and the director made some festivities in their time - luckily the Mississipi Mermaid is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Next to "The Soft Skin," coincidentally staring at Deneuve's sister (the late Francoise Dorleac), it has to be my favorite Truffaut movie. In addition to directing, Truffaut also wrote the screenplay. Something that always amazes me about Truffaut is his almost childlike innocence in presenting a story - one could almost say it is naive. <br /> <br /> There is a scene at the end of the movie where Belmondo returns to the apartment in Lyon. with the remains of the serve. He rings the doorbell and Deneuve responds by wearing a robe. In the time that Belmondo takes to get to her room from the street, Deneuve exchanges her dress, puts on her best pair of socks and shoes, then lies in bed and pretends to be asleep. It's a scene that could almost come from a child's mind - but that's Truffaut for you. <br /> <br /> Watching Catherine Deneuve in her late 60s films is indeed a sensory pleasure. She is so extraordinarily beautiful that it is almost painful for us to watch. Incidentally, for these fans, there are some topless scenes of her in this film - indeed a sinful pleasure. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the previous posters. I do not see anything 'Hitchcockiano' about the movie. As for his 'look' - I love the look of the old movie used in the 60's. It certainly gives the films of this period a unique look. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for fans of Deneuve and Truffaut ......
