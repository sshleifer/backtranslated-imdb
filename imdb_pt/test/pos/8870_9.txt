I do not understand this movie distinctly average rating!? <br /> <br /> I really liked it, I still stayed up until early morning to finish watching late night tv <br /> <br /> are three excellent characters here, excellent characters. Danny DeVito threw a jewel, a great feat, considering he was driving as well. His laughter sometimes traced character was brilliantly written and was surreal in an absolutely believable way. There are people like that, Owen was just in line without crossing it. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal's comic style and sense of timing were PERFECT for his role. His frustration / comedy was interesting and captivating and what's more ... you could understand his feelings. To really feel that you know that a character is hard to get from the writers' point of view, finding the right actor to do that is an art in itself and both have been achieved here three times. <br /> <br /> Third Who else could have played Mama? There is no one who can play this part so well. There is a style there unlike any other, something that you like to watch, I found myself waiting for it to appear on the screen ... and not because the rest was bad, oh no, but because Mom's character was, again, so in line without crossing it which was great to watch. <br /> <br /> And what is more? A happy ending with new friends, no one getting hurt and everyone getting what they wanted in life ... without a big piece of cheese tied at the end. <br /> <br /> Bright script, brilliant idea, perfect cast, great movie.
