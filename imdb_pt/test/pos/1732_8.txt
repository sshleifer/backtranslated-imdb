I just watched the end of the second season of Doctor Who, and besides some boring episodes this show is fantastic. <br /> <br /> It's a sad loss to say goodbye to a main character once again in the final season, but the show continues. <br /> <br /> The BBC needs to increase the budget of the program, there are so many things that can happen in London and the surrounding areas. In addition, some of the special effects, although the main very good, on the odd occasion need to be a little more polished. <br /> <br /> It was a huge bet for the BBC to bring back a show that lost its way a long time ago and they should be congratulated for doing so. <br /> <br /> Rolling for the 2006 Christmas special, the 2005 Christmas special was by far the best thing on television.
