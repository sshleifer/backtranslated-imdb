This is a great movie. No, it's not Mel Gibson in "Braveheart", but it's not trying to be. In fact, "The Emperor and the Killer" probably (fortunately) has more in common with a Shakespeare production than a Hollywood blockbuster. In the third century BC, the King of Qin is trying to unite (in other words "conquer") the seven kingdoms of China. He has already overthrown the Han Kingdom. Now he needs an excuse to invade the Kingdom of Yan. <br /> <br /> This is where Ms. Zhao comes in. She and the king have been friends since childhood. They are obviously very much in love but can not marry for political reasons. Together they plan a plot. She will pretend to have fallen in disgrace with the king and flee to Yan. Once there she will persuade the Prince of Yan to send a murderer back to kill the king. When the assassination fails, the king will have his excuse to invade Yan. <br /> <br /> Once in Yan, however, Lady Zhao begins to reconsider. Listening to and seeing more and more examples of cruelty from her former childhood friend, she begins to wonder if the king may need to be truly murdered. <br /> <br /> A clear sign that you are not watching a Hollywood production is the final encounter between the king and the murderer. Unlike a Hollywood movie where the hero and the villain are clearly defined and the final outcome already predetermined, this is a fight that can actually happen anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a well-crafted and well-depicted story of a tumultuous tumult. time in China's history. There is a mix of incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. The most beautiful of all, however, is Gong Li as Ms. Zhao. I grow more and more convinced every time I see her that Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world. <br /> <br /> I must say, however, that she has an unintentionally funny line in this movie. In the beginning, Gong Li asks one of his servants, "Do I have a pretty face?" <br /> <br /> Duh !!!
