This film tells the stories of several couples dealing with post-World War II life. Through many moving accounts, audiences learn how the War has changed people, while their human spirit has triumphed. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where a young recruiter, who came home as a double amputee (after losing both arms to the elbow) is sure that he would not be good for his girlfriend, who still wants to marry him. His girl simply said that he would help him with the things he would not be able to do, but that they would be well together. Moved by this true demonstration of love, the man embraces his bride in tears. <br /> <br /> The scene in which an employee asked for a bank loan is also a highlight. When he is initially turned down as a "high risk," a senior bank official assumes, "You fought for our country and kept us safe - that's good enough for me. "The Best Years of Our Lives" has won 6 Oscars, including a special statuette for the disabled actor who has shown us all that life goes on and will continue to be worth even with a serious disadvantage. This movie is a joy to watch over and over again. A real classic! Highly recommended!
