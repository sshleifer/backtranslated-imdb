This is a well done action movie. There are many fight scenes, the acting is compelling (for that genre) and the RS1 is incredible. I do not know why people feel compelled to throw garbage on RS1, I found that their effects were executed very well and their design was great. The plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie. <br /> <br /> That said, I must tell you that Richard Sun is one of the worst actors in Hong Kong I've ever seen. At least RS1 had the right idea to kill him. Now, for all of you who thought Sam Lee (Alien) was a bad actor ... he should not be taken seriously! I just had the pleasure of watching Gen-X Cops (prequel) and Sam Lee played the same character the same way! <br /> <br /> Now, please, all of you watching the highly prized Oscar winners: DO NOT JUDGE THIS IS THE MOVIE OF A PENSIVE MAN! NOT NEEDED TO THINK! Just to be appreciated, that's all. I hope they do another one soon.
