These guys combine low-brow with low budget. It's glorious. <br /> <br /> Look, if you want Bergman, rent "Seventh Seal" or something. If you want to see gross humor and sexual exploitation, this is the one. <br /> <br /> I think Jane Jensen as Julia does everything watchable. She can really act (very well), she is a complete dream boat, and she does not seem to feel above all else.
