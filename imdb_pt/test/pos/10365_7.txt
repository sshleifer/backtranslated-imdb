This production was very good. The usual fabulous setting, interesting and quirky characters. It was so strange not to have Captain Hastings, Miss. Lemon and Poirot's office / residence, so highlighted in the original PBS / BBC Mysteries. <br /> <br /> In the original series, a lot happened in the office. Hastings reading the newspaper, while Poirot "exercises his little gray cells." Miss Lemon launching whenever necessary. <br /> <br /> Poirot without Captain Hastings would be like Holmes without Watson ... he can certainly solve the crime, but it is not so interesting. <br /> <br /> And what would be a mystery of Poirot without Hastings, with his impeccable manners, falling in love with some beautiful and unattainable woman.
