"Crossfire," by Edward Dmytryk, is a rare movie coming from Hollywood in the 1940s. This was groundbreaking for Mr. Dmytryk and the studio because of what the director and his adapter, John Paxton, decided to do with romance on which the film is based. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, please stop reading now. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks's novel was about the death of a gay soldier. In the film, the subject was turned into prejudice against the Jews, a topic that was taboo during that time in American cinema. It is to the credit of Mr. Dmytryk to have had the courage to get involved with this film project. <br /> <br /> The film is an excellent piece of film, because the way the director presents it. Obviously influenced by the film noir style, we are taken to postwar Washington. The opening scene about the brutal murder of Samuels shows such uncommon cruelty being inflicted upon a decent man, whom we do not yet know, or why he was killed, but who did not deserve to die so horribly. <Br /> <br /> The basis of murder is prejudice, pure and simple. We realize how in the mind of an ignorant man, the simple fact of being successful and different, plays in the mind of the killer. Samuels remains as the sacrificial lamb, just as the gay soldier is the victim of the novel. The parallels are well designed. <br /> <br /> This film makes a compelling vision because of the brilliant star of Robert Ryan, like Montgomery. Ryan was an actor who has always played interesting roles, but never as well as in "Crossfire." In addition, there is a great appearance of Gloria Grahame, as Ginny, the prostitute with the heart in the right place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast plays as a set. Robert Young, as the investigative police detective acts, is a decent man who knows the prejudice at first hand in his own family and speaks loudly against him. Robert Mitchum plays a legal sergeant. Keeley who is deeply touched by the crime when one of his men is accused of committing it. Sam Levene excels in his small role as Samuels. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to watch because of him, probably the first to speak out loud against ignorance.
