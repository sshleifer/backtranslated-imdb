MCBOING BOING is one of the designs that has stayed in my head over the years and finally decided to look at it as it was pleasantly surprised and also was surprised at the people involved with the production. As I recall, we had to watch at a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days at UHF that is not part of the regular TV to tune the local station to watch the big business cartoon in those days that made the show still more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk about. A great memory more than 50 years ago. I'll have to see what other memories may be hiding on the web. By the way I try to do computer animation is where johnl3d comes on the scene
