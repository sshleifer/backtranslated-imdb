"I fought with death.It is the most uninteresting competition you can imagine. It happens in an impalpable gray, with nothing around, nothing around, no spectators, no clamor, no glory, no great desire for victory, no the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism, without much belief in his own right, and even less in his adversary. If this is the form of supreme wisdom, then life is a bigger puzzle than some of us I think it is. "Marlow in Joseph Conrad's" Heart of Darkness "It is difficult to render the subject of death lyrical in any work of art. However, films have recently made audacious attempts to humanize it, insofar as it is adopted as part of the cycle of all living things, and can be chosen rather than legislated. "Chosen" is the key word for Alejandro Amenabar's Sea Inside, based on the true story of the Galician sailor Ramon Sampedro. It is a drama about euthanasia without prejudice, clad in love, poetry and friendship. If this sounds like Barbarian Invasions (2003), in which a cancerous professor says goodbye to friends and long-standing loves before he takes his life, then you're right. In fact, the Sea is better because it spends a more intimate time with the protagonist before leaving, a remarkable achievement, without one of those moments less boring or uninteresting. Javier Bardem as Ramon has expressive eyes and commanding the voice for the romantic quadriplegic, a combination of realistic and poetic sufferer. Belen Rueda plays poor lawyer Julia, who becomes an imaginary lover of Ramon, increasing in radiance as her life degenerates from illness. Added to the already almost novel circumstance is Lola Duenas as Rosa, a blue-collar visitor who initially tries to dissuade Ramon from seeking death but quickly falls in love with him. Talk about romanticism of disability? This guy has unbelievable luck to attract substantial women, and he can not move a finger. But he says that he can, proving the final argument about what women want: the love that speaks, not only does. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from mentioning the great film now for an Oscar that presents euthanasia as its climax. so as not to spoil the novice experience. Suffice it to say that both films succeed in opening up both sides of a contentious subject without forcing a specific point of view. The religious right has the right to complain that the old film and the barbarian invasions celebrate suicide; has no right to accuse the wonderfully balanced Sea Inside of it. <br /> <br /> "A life in this condition has no dignity," says Ramon. The irony is that he conducts himself with supreme dignity that makes anyone question his determination to end his life. "The Sea Inside" is a formidable entry into the 2004 Oscar nominations for best foreign language film.
