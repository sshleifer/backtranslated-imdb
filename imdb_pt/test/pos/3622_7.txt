Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated filmmakers over the years, and 2002's "Puckoon," unfortunately, is no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the division of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community (the title 'Puckoon'). Due to a colossal mistake, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Residents go to the restrooms in the back of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their way. Drinkers crowd like sardines in a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper beer. A dead man must have a passport in his name before the villagers can reach the graveyard to bury him. <br /> <br /> 'Puckoon' is a kind of Irish Under Milk Wood with comic characters and surreal events. abundance. The protagonist, Dan Milligan (renamed 'Madigan' in the film) is misinterpreted by Sean Hughes and has conversations with the narrator (Richard Attenborough). Also in the film are Milo O'Shea, Griff Rhys Jones, David Kelly (from Robin's Nest), Freddie Jones, Joe McGann and Elliott Gould. <br /> <br /> Interviewed for the 'Making of' Puckoon 'documentary, writer / director Terence Ryan expressed eternal awe for the book. Shows on the screen. But unfortunately, like the ill-fated movie "The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy," a good book does not necessarily make a good movie. The problem with 'Puckoon' is that, like Milligan's other books, they just do not work on the big screen. 'Puckoon' is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot. <br /> <br /> In no way can the movie be compared to training debris like 'Potato Men's Sex Lives', 'Fat Slags' and 'Lesbian Vampire Killers', but it's not as good as it should have been been. The last half hour involves a lot of rushing by the police, the British army, some locals who have hidden explosives in a coffin and it is really tedious to sit. Ryan's decision to closely follow the book is the main reason for his failure to work as a film. <br /> <br /> The other problem is the total absence of charm. 'Waking Ned' had this in mind, while the television series 'Father Ted' was far more fun. Spike lived long enough to see the movie and apparently liked it. His daughter, Jane, has a tip as the bride of Madigan. The highlight for me was the quote at the beginning: "I do not mind dying!" Spike said: I do not want to be there when it happens!
