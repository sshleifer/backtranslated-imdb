This is a wonderful family sitcom. Rowan Atkinson appeared in other excellent sitcoms, The Thin Blue Line (Best Thing) and Blackadder (No Better Than It). <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is a human disaster that does not speak. He goes to places and gets into absolute chaos, chaos includes: Climb to the top and be afraid to jump, taking about 20 minutes, until some children eventually throw it away, ending up inside a washer and driving his car while he was sitting on a roof. Bean runs a Mini and has a teddy bear. <br /> <br /> This was very similar to The Baldy Man, a series that looks at Gregor Fisher, who says very little, but gets himself into a better place: Do it Yourself, Mr. Bean, Episode 9: Bean he organizes a New Year's Eve party, so he picks up some things to decorate his apartment, but there's a lot going on and he has to drive his car on the roof.
