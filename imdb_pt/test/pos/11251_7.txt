I'm from Texas, and I live very close to Plano, where the actual deaths occurred, so I might be a bit biased in saying that "Wasted" is a movie you just can not get out of your head. <br /> <Stahl, Phoenix and Paul interpret their characters in a very realistic way. You truly believe they are high school students every day who end up being addicted to heroin. The content of drugs is also treated graphically - although everything that happens in the film serves a purpose, and at every moment the characters spiraling downward are heart-breaking. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. After watching, stay with you!
