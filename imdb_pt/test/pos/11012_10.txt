When I saw this movie the first time I was very impressed with the kind of atmosphere that the director creates. It is also very interesting to see how they imagine the near future in the year 1974. If you see the film, you will see many sets and customs that today are called crazy and modern again. <br /> <br /> The topic of the film deals with the old question "What is real and what is illusion?". If you see "The Matrix," you will find many similarities. But the two films are not comparable because "Welt am Draht" is art and "Matrix" is entertainment. If you prefer the first. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I lost my video copy. <br /> <br />
