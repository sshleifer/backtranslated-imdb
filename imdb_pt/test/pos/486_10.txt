I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart that it's about time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings. Such a waste of human life as this story was perhaps some good result of it. And Eric is hotter than ever. Often, in movies, First Nations people are seen as other than ordinary people. We are always portrayed as chiefs or healers. Hey we're just like everyone else. And this movie showed just that. We get hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in pursuit of justice. It's really bad that the big movie companies can not see it. I can not wait until it comes out on DVD. Thank you to those who chose to show this story as it really was.
