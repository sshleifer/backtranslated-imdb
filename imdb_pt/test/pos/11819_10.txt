Way back in 1996, one of the plane pilots where I used to work gave me a copy of this movie. He told me he's going to make me cry. I never believed him and even made bets. After watching the movie .... I cried a bucket! Even after watching the movie, I found myself in the bathroom crying. In fact, it was the most moving film I have ever seen. I like the part where Dexter's mother confronted Eric's mother the phrase was something like ... "your children's best friend just died today ... and it will not be easy ... if you put your hands in him again ... I'll kill you! " The last part where Dexter got Eric's shoe was a scene that never left my mind until today. Honestly, just thinking about it makes my eyes water. A story of true friendship. My girlfriend also loved it ... She hated me for letting her watch the movie. I cried a bucket, she cried a river.
