Can a black youth with mental problems be a catalyst to unite people in a city in South Carolina? The answer seems to be that despite his disadvantage, James Kennedy understood much more than he was credited and became a prominent element on the sports scene. In addition, the film is telling how many of us ignore people with problems that can be helped if we have the patience that Coach Jones showed the young man because of his own guilt in his heart. <br /> <br /> "Radio", directed by Michael Tolllin, is a formula movie inspired by a true story. However, the film is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances that the director was able to get from his wonderful cast. <br /> <br /> Coach Jones is instrumental in getting the young man, who is called radio because his passion for collecting them, engaged in sports, a passion that he discovers in this retarded man who had only hard blows on his young life. Coming from a poor past, Radio lives with his mother, who is protective of him and questions the intentions of the coach. Radio is seen by school children as a mascot; at first, their sunny disposition assures you of the acceptance of all, because he is a good person, without a trace of malice in his body. <br /> <br /> The film owes much to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. who make a great pair as Coach and Radio. Mr. Harris, one of the best actors of our time, is never annoying at anything he likes with his presence. He gets the essence of the principles coach who sees the possibility of making amends for something that bothers him from his past. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged youngster. <br /> <br /> The support cast is excellent. S. Ephata Merkerson, one of the best actresses of her generation, does an interesting job as the mother of Radio. Alfre Woodard, another good actress interprets the principle of high school with style. Debra Winger, there are only a few scenes in the movie. "Radio", although sentimental, will warm anybody's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people in our society that we know nothing about and how fast we are to judge them. Michael Tollin puts many ideas in the right perspective for us.
