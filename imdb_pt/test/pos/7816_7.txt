The cast only tells you that this will be a step above the usual Italian west. Veterans Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy join Alex Cord, who at the time seemed on the verge of stardom. The result is a film that is both off-beat and down-beat and yet will satisfy those who seek more of a western than just a gunfight. Especially interesting here is the character played by Alex Cord. The "hero" of these Westerners is expected to be taciturn and introspective, but "Clay McCord" is an extreme example and, surprisingly, he often shines in a passive and even weak position. There is much talk of the fact that he fears being the victim of the epileptic seizures that have immobilized his father and, in these moments of helplessness, he is either at the mercy of those who wish to harm him or those who wish to help him. To emphasize your passivity, Clay McCord - do not you love that name? - is often shined up to the waist as if it were little more than an attractive toy being put on display. There is even a strong masochistic trait in its nature, most in evidence when it is used as a punching bag by its enemies and then suspended by its wrists and left hanging above the middle of a street. Not only does he often fail to protect himself, but McCord is equally ineffective at protecting those around him. Almost everyone who helps him is dead. <br /> <br /> While "A minute to pray, a second to die" is far from being a complete success, has a depth and a tone that sets it apart and keeps it in the memory. It is also a good showcase for Alex Cord, whose career tended to decline after that point after a promising few in the mid-1960s. He must be about 36 when he filmed it - at his physical height - and his scene hanging by the wrists, with bare and sweaty chest, is a memorable piece of cinematic beefcake.
