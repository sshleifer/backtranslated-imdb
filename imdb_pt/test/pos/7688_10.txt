"Porgy & Bess" was the first movie my parents took me to see. Even at the tender age of 5, I was so thrilled by the drama that I screamed loudly on the screen "Crown, PLEASE do not take Bess!" I was fortunate to see Porgy & Bess's only TV broadcast so many years ago and now all I have is the great memories (and the album) to remember this wonderful and wonderful movie. I've been waiting and wishing and hoping that one day I might have a copy of "Porgy & Bess" - but it does not look like it's going to happen. What's the delay? Obviously, there is enough public interest in this film to ensure a release. After all these years, I remember that and it sure looks like I'm not alone. This movie is full of human emotions - jealousy, lust, anger, courage, determination. "Porgy & Bess" is a buried gem that deserves to be brought to light for a new audience to admire and an old audience to savor.
