Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about surviving in a hostile and alien world against even more hostile enemies. The task becomes even more difficult when the closest enemies can be found within their own surviving group. <br /> <br /> The plot of Pitch Black is quite usual and has been seen several times in different variations. But what makes this movie shine above the others, are the well-written characters. <br /> <br /> The group consists of very different people, with few more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot having difficulty with his own conscience; Johns, a bounty hunter with a drug habit; Imam, a holy man who faces the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a convict and a murderer learning to value others, not just himself. Characters begin to live in the film. They are not just roles as in many other films of this genre. You start to care about the characters, especially for Riddick, even though it sounds weird. He should be the bad guy. In this film, the line between light and black is very thin. All characters are familiar with both. <br /> <br /> Another thing that works in this movie is the cast. Rarely do actors fit well in their roles. Radha Mitchell is suitable for frying. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelty and sense of responsibility to Johns. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does a great job as Riddick. In his hands, Riddick is quite scary, definitely very dangerous and also a deep character, just as he should be. <br /> <br /> So, how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your close friends and enemies even closer.
