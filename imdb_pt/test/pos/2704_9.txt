While watching this movie, I was amazed at how media perception can shape a person's opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unreliable young woman whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard climb the charts with wonderful songs. As with all of today's celebrities, they were often criticized about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. This had a huge effect on Karen who fought a battle against her eating and lost weight drastically, which eventually caused your death. This heart felt movie was not initially something I would have thought of watching. But as I began to see, I was hooked. Like Tina Turner's story, this movie illuminates you and lets you see the lives of young artists. The acting was excellent and even after almost 20 years after it was made, then the directional and the dialogue are still fun. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to anyone who has not yet attended. It is incredibly accurate and emotionally charged.
