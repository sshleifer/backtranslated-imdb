I saw this movie on a screen and it's the best movie I've seen in a loooong time. I loved!!!! James Franco is so hot and he and Sienna Miller make the perfect couple. I do not want to give what happens but they do a couple of honeymooners who go to their honeymoon to Niagara Falls and some pretty wild things happen along the way ... The movie is really very funny, sad and unique. I can not even say what reminded me, but go and see! I cried so much, but I really loved it and want to see it again as soon as I leave! My friends cried too. I hope it leaves soon - does anyone know when? I would really see if I were you.
