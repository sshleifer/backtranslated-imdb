At first I thought this movie would irritate me. It was as if I had seen this movie somewhere before. The disillusioned hero, the paternal figure and the 9-year-old sister who is older and wiser than her years (see Gregory's girl), but then, less than 15 minutes, became a movie laugh. Dylan Moran (which I thought would only bother me) was excellent. How was Mr. Gambon and the crazy Scottish killer. Lena Headey was extremely sexy. For half the film I was trying to remember where I had seen it before. The probation officer. She has the most incredible smile. But clearly the true hero of this movie is Mr. Caine. This man should do a lot more comedy. This ranks alongside some of his best comedy roles (Without a clue, filthy rotten bastards). It is a pleasure to watch in all your scenes, but especially in the end. <br /> <br /> Nobody can say f ** k the way that Michael can. <br /> <br />
