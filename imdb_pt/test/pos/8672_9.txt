One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, accurate in your vision, and beautiful and highly imaginative in its accomplishment. I can not say too much without giving up, and I do not recommend that you really read much about this movie before you see - just watch. <br /> <br /> But, ah, we need to get ten lines of text to have a review listed on IMDb. Puzzle. What can I do? Talk about the movie? No. You can not do that. I think I liked this movie precisely because I saw it without prejudice. Please do the same. <br /> <br /> I think this can be said: the acting is excellent and discreet, and what I learned to love about foreign films is that the movies are about the MOVIES, not about the movies. stars.
