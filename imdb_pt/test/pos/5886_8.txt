With the end of World War II, movie studios quickly rushed to focus on the veterinarians returning home. "The best years of our lives" was probably the best example. He portrays several people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their prewar lives but also to the ever-changing world. Probably the most interesting cast member is the non-actor Harold Russell. Having lost his hands in the war, he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be, and reminds people that he wants to be treated like everyone else; he went on to win the award for Best Supporting Actor and a special Oscar for the role, making him the only person to win two Oscars for the same role. There will probably always be a debate about whether it deserved the Best Picture than "It's a Wonderful Life," but I certainly think they did a good job with it. Well done.
