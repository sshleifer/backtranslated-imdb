Lifeforce begins in outer space where HMS Churchill tracks Haley's Comet and his equipment detects a 150-mile-long alien spacecraft on the comet's head, unable to contact the Earth because of interference Colonel Tom Carlsen (Steve Railsback) decides that this is the only chance to investigate this. Going out in space suits Carlsen and some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship and find the remains of a bat as a race of creatures and three perfect-looking humanoids, two men (Chris Jagger and Bill Malin) and a beautiful woman (Mathilda May ). whom they take aboard Churchill. Thirty days later and back to Earth, Churchill is detected on radar, a rescue mission is sent only to find that the spacecraft is burned and the entire crew allegedly dead. The rescue team finds the three humanoid aliens and takes them back to Earth, where at a space research center in London they come back to life and start literally sucking the life force of human victims who in turn need to do the same to stop turning into dust, things look bleak as the epidemic spreads through London ... <br /> <br /> This English production was produced by the famous Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus who during the 1980s was responsible for many low-budget action films under his Cannon producer usually starring Chuck Norris and they wanted to move to the big time and sign director Tobe Hooper in a three-deal deal (which were this remake of Lifeforce, The Invaders from Mars (1986) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), a continuation of Hooper's classic, which failed and basically failed Golan & Globus & Cannon did not exist. of being a commercial failure at the box office I have to say that I think Lifeforce is a highly enjoyable, yet somewhat silly, science fiction horror. When originally released in theaters in 1985, Lifefore was reduced to 101 minutes by Golan & Globus, but in recent years the longest 116-minute cut replaced it on DVD, VHS, Laserdisc and TV, although apparently the original cut of the film it lasted 128 minutes, so there are more scenes out there somewhere. I'll base my comments on the longer 116-minute cut, Dan O'Bannon's screenplay, Don Jakoby and unreleased rewrites of Michael Armstrong and Olaf Pooley were based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel The Space Vampires & scope is truly ambitious and felt that ends up being a bit of a mess but a hell of a fun. It moves like a rocket and in the heart there is a really interesting story here, although the movie becomes a tangle. There are also a few hilarious moments in Lifeforce, the scene in which the security man tries to convince the naked Vampire to indulge, offering him a half-eaten cookie is a true camp classic, the horribly hypnotic scenes, including the one in which Railsback ends up kissing . Patrick Stewart and many, many more. I do not know, call me weird, but I found Lifeforce to be tremendously fun and highly entertaining in almost every way, from bizarre character dialogues, weird ideas that never come together, and some incredible visuals. Lifeforce is certainly not a movie that will annoy you. Director Hooper had almost more money here to play with than he ever had (double what he had for Poltergeist (1982)) and he uses every bit of it to bring this spectacular movie to the screen great, John Dykstra the guy responsible for Star Wars (1977), Star Trek: The Movie (1979) and most recently Spider-Man (2002) was brought in to deal with visual effects and in general they look fabulous. The outer space-defined sequences in particular with spaceships look great, and there are also some really good visual effects on Earth, including the destruction of London, while hundreds of blue souls fly everywhere. There is some nudity, but not much blood, there are some withered corpses, some gunshot wounds, the skin of someone's hand peels, blood spurts from someone's eyes, nose and ears, and there is a severed arm, as well as some zombies. The special effects of makeup are also generally very good. I would not say that Lifeforce is scary, it's more a science fiction movie than horror, I love the way Hooper films the sequences of space while he turns his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness and that there is no " solid "walk as it was. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 25,000,000 made less than half that in his theatrical run and did not set the world on video or DVD, which is a shame because despite being a mess it is very pleasant to watch. Filmed on location in England. Well filmed in widescreen 2: 35: 1, the 4: 3 cropped image is horrible and cuts out large chunks of information from both sides of the screen, this is most noticeable during the opening scenes in space where it is sometimes difficult to see what is happening and the sense of the vastness of space and the alien ship is lost. The acting is correct in a very silly movie, Patrick Stewart replaced Sir John Gielgud, Nancy Paul replaced Olivia Hussey, Frank Finlay replaced Klaus Kinski, while Anthony Hopkins took over the role of Caine. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a bizarre movie, there are not two ways about it really and anyone looking for something simple and simple should look elsewhere. Anyone who is looking for something a little different in the science fiction genre than giving lifeforce a shot, since it is so bad that they are good movies with stunning effects and it is not your average movie showing the factory.
