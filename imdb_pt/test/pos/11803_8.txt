"The Cure" is a moving and moving drama. The film focuses on two neighborhood kids who become good friends. One of the boys has AIDS. The boys become good friends despite Erik's apprehension at first. The film shows the boys' journey to discover "the cure," which is in Ohio according to "The National Examiner," and how that affects their relationship. The acting is wonderful (I've never seen Annabella Sciorra do better), and the film is simply touching. I could not stop crying with the shoe scene. This is a good tearjerker. Keep Kleenex close. 8/10
