This is a novelty in Danish cinema. The mood is no different from that of Anders Thomas Jensen's Blinkende Lygter, but with a new twist. One difference is fewer characters, leaving much more space for them to be inhabited. And what characters?! The two butchers are perfect. Mads Mikkelsen is a dominant parody and maddened, and Nikolaj Lie Kaas, an indifferent loser with a twin brother, more or less a profane couple of the two.
