Alejandro Amenabar, the young and talented Spanish director, shows us clearly that he is a serious filmmaker. Anyone who doubts this should take a look at their latest movie "The Sea Inside". This is a film that has been rewarded with countless accolades, not just in Spain, but in the world, wherever this wonderful film has been exhibited. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie yet, you may want to Stop here. <br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro is a man confined to bed. Being quadriplegic, it depends on the kindness of strangers to everything. Since his accident, Ramon only thinks of one thing alone: ​​how to end his life! This is the moral issue at the center of the story, based on the real life of Ramon Sampedro. <br /> <br /> Mr. Amenabar tells the story from Ramon's point of view. There is nothing here that is false or manipulative on his part. After all, he relies on facts that were well known in his country, as this case became a "cause celebre" in favor of euthanasia, a subject that nobody in that country wanted to treat in Spain. With its history of being a predominantly Roman Catholic country, Spain has evolved into one of the most democratic societies in Europe, a distinction that is most notable because of its long years dominated by a dictator. However, despite the advances in this society, the idea of ​​taking one's own life is something that is not clearly understood by most of its citizens, who still considered this subject as something that could not be done in their country. <BR> Ramon Sampedro was a man who loved life. He lived an intense life when he was young, when he enlisted as a sailor to discover the world. Not having money, this was the only way he could see other lands, get to know other cultures. Ramon's love affair with the sea is something that people in Galicia have learned to love since childhood. Imagine how this same sea friend is the one who takes the life of Ramon, as he knew! In a second, Ramon goes from a vibrant young man into a vegetable! <br /> <br /> Ramon's family is destroyed by experience. Suddenly, they must leave everything aside to take care of him at home. Her brother and sister-in-law are Stoic people who deal with the de facto situation. Their lives become a sort of belated reflection, because Ramon's life comes first. They take care of the sick man without protest, or blame Ramon for the sacrifices they must make to keep him alive. <br /> <br /> That is why in their minds the Sampedros can not understand Ramon's desire to do away with him. all. Did not they give up a normal life to take care of him? This moral issue weighs heavily on these simple and uncomplicated people, because in their minds, they are doing what came naturally. <br /> <br /> The second theme of the film is the legal issue of euthanasia and well-intentioned people who suddenly enter Ramon's life into his desire to help him put an end to his suffering. There is Julia, the lawyer who is deficient and suffers from a rare disease. There is Rosa, the fish cannery who falls in love with Ramon. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem, makes a brilliant Ramon Sampedro. Your transformation is total. We do not doubt a moment when he is no one but the paralyzed man in that bed. Bardem can only use the face to convey all the emotions trapped within Ramon. Mr. Bardem makes this real man. This is perhaps the best role of Javier Bardem in his career. He surpasses his own award-winning performance as Reynaldo Arenas, the late Cuban poet he portrayed in "Before Night Falls." In the supporting roles, Belen Rueda makes an impressive appearance as Julia, the woman struggling against her own physical problems. Lola Duenas is also effective as Rose, the soul affine who loves Ramon deeply. Celso Bugallo, like Ramon's brother, shows a man at the crossroads of his own life. Mabel Rivera makes a compassionate Manuela, the sister-in-law who never asks for anything of life, but tends to Ramon without questioning why she has to do it. <br /> <br /> Mr. Amenabar also composed the film's astonishing soundtrack. He is a man who never ceases to amaze. You can imagine what your next project will be, but you want success in whatever he decides to do in the future.
