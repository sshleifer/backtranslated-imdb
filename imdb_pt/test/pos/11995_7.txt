Seriously. If this had been Shack's first film, it would have been acceptable as funny, silly and silly. Light satire comments on the class system would make it a nice location at the end of the night. <br /> <br /> However, everyone wants to compare it to the first movie, and maybe that's not fair. The first film is a cult classic; What could follow? Anything. So take this second movie as a stand alone, and it certainly has its moments. <br /> Jackie Mason is entertaining, making her best personification of Rodney-wannabe. Is he as good as Rodney? No. Are your lines good? No. But he's funny. The rest of the cast falls on the line as being decent but not excellent. You will recognize faces in the cast and wonder how they got where they are today. <br /> <br /> The film is predictable, but is not it more of that genre? Again, it's not the best comedy you'll see, but if you like Cannonball Run, you'll enjoy this.
