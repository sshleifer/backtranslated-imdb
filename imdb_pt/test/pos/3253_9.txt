Two Hands is a fun-filled Australian crime chase that succeeds in how the film easily combines tense dramatic moments with characters and fun situations to give the movie the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughter was not elaborately elaborated and was not much worked. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that every character in the film is excellent, and that every actor / actress recognizes and can relate to the Australian mood. They portray this very well and very realistically. Of course, they are immensely helped by a fantastic script by writer / director Gregor Jordan. I was reading another review of this movie from an American I had seen, and he criticized it strongly, basically passing it off as a clone of Pulp Fiction. I think this is just crap. This movie is not trying to be Pulp Fiction, the feel and style of each of these excellent films are totally opposite. Without wishing to appear superior or arrogant, I think of fully understanding this film; humor, sincerity, characters, etc ... you have to be Australian, or at least understand the culture, which the other guy obviously does not have a clue about. Some Americans, whose reviews of certain non-American films, seem ignorant (and have difficulty understanding) anything that is not an American product. It's a shame because this is a great movie. The love story between the main character and the girl is also portrayed in a very real, sincere and sweet way. I'm very proud to have this movie in my collection. 4 out of 5
