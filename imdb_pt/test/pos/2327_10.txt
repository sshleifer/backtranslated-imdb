The subtle comedy script is unmatched by any movie in recent years. The characters are interesting, even if they are a bit predictable. The comic timing written in the script is more than enough to make up for a well-worn underdog plot. When you're sure you know the end .... SURPRISE! Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger group probably will not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate a particular kitchen scene! Great movie!
