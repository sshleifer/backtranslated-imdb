A documentary about a nomadic tribe in Tibet that goes to a dry lake to get salt does not look very appealing. But this is not a popcorn movie, but a visual cultural banquet in which you participate in a rapidly disappearing piece of humanity. Superstitions, epic songs and poetry, the faith of a people who truly believe in following their own standards of life are something that the West had in Homer's times, but which is now unfortunately completely foreign to most of us . "We have lost the spiritual serenity that comes from following well-established patterns of life, often with terrible mental consequences in our increasingly soulless society." The filmmakers intimately intertwined us in the fabric of these poor but spiritually poor and rudimentary men. And it made us realize that there was more to life than shopping and pop culture. So disconnect your land lines, turn off your cells, turn off the garage lights, and sit back in a timeless adventure.
