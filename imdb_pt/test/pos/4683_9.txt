I really liked the movie. Everything in The Italian Job is simple. An explosive guy, a secure cracker, a computer genius, a man of wheel and a man with a spectacular plan to steal 35 million without using a weapon. This movie is fun, although it does not have a central idea. It's a non-stop movie with lots of action. All the stunt work is beautiful. From the boat chase in Venice at the beginning to the chase in the busy streets of Los Angeles, involving three mini-cooperators and even a helicopter. The best chase I've ever seen. I like mini coopers. Special thieves used mini-coopers for escape cars. The chase between mini-coopers and bikes is incredible. They chased in the basement. I can say that there was not a moment when I was bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Rob√£o Bonito), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (Left Ear) and Edwin Norton job. job. I like the actors in this movie. I've seen a lot of assault movie, but the Italian Job & is one of my favorites. A great Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. After all, I love this kind of movie.
