There are some movies that are loved by almost everyone you encounter and yet they are box office failures. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and hilarious comedy, fits into this catogoria. For the first time, an Indian director kept the public's sensibilities in mind, and did not produce a stereotyped Kader Khan-like farce. The film is about two guys who dream of riches, and try to achieve this by courting the daughter of a millionaire. A humorous drama unfolds as many complexities appear in history. Complexities increase the sheer comedy of the whole plot. Aamir Khan plays a smart guy, while Salman Khan performs unexpectedly good as the dumb face. The villain played by Paresh Rawal and his henchmen, Junior Ajit and "Kaliaa", make you laugh while you sleep. Although the film has been borrowed from many other films, despite being a bad movie, and despite being "noisy" at times, it remains one of the "funny" movies that Bombay created after films like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaekar. . It's sad that it did not go well at the box office, because producers return to formulas and creativity is abandoned.
