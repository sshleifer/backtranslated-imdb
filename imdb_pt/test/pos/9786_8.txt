Milo is a neglected and underrated horror film from the late 1990s, but the feel and atmosphere is more than a horror movie from the 80s. It seems like a bunch of little girls are taken to "see things" in the father of Milo, a gynecologist, and as a reward for being able to see what's in bottles (yes, a gynecologist and something else ...) that a girl plays "doctor" with Milo. Hmm, his first patient and he lost it. Now Milo is a scary kid who always wears a yellow raincoat, rain or shine, and he talks funny ... but that's not all that's weird about him. Fast forward to the present where these girls are adults and there is a marriage planned for one of them but the tragedy strikes and leaves a girl who came from out of town with the option of replacing or not her friend as a school teacher, does. And then strange things start to happen again. Which naturally wrap this child in a raincoat. This is not overly violent or graphic, but has a strange strangeness that you do not find in many modern horror movies, and it's worth seeing it. One wonders why it is so hard to find good horror movies in this day and age, but here is one that is criminally overlooked and definitely worth it if you take a look. 8 out of 10.
