'Rejseholdet' is one of the best new Danish TV series I've seen. <br /> <br /> The series is about unit 1 of the Danish police force - a kind of FBI-style team that helps solve murder cases everywhere. the country, and the cases in which they work, plus the influence their work exerts on their personal lives and the price they sometimes have to pay to be part of a front-line police force. <br /> <br /> I hope so much when I started watching the series - I was pleasantly surprised, the series is thrilling, sometimes fun, has drama and suspense, I love it.
