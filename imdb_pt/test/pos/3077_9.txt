This movie was amazing, if you want a movie with puns and non-stop laughs, then it's the right thing for you. This movie was great because it took the Robin Hood seriously and did something that the whole family can enjoy and have a good laugh. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 10 and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything that is involved, "By order of the financial secretary of Kings H and R Blockhead?" <br /> <br /> Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes (Robin Hood) in life, whether or not he is a liar liar with the "claw" or saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth watching
