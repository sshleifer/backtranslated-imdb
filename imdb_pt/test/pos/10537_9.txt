I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival in the family section. I'm not sure that my kids actually have the movie, but I have to say it was a wonderful short film. <br /> <br /> 'Nostradamus and Me' is an interesting short on hopes and fears. that we all feel grown up in the 1980s, which in turn extends to how my kids feel today. So, we had Regan, today, we have Bush. Instead of Nuclear War, we have Terrorism. <br /> <br /> I really identified with the main character, and I even dated a 'Curehead' in high school. We all felt like 'nothing mattered' when we were 16, but it's great to see a movie where they find out that everything is important !!! <br /> <br /> Once again, I probably would not have put it in the family section ... there were a few bad words for the younger kids, but it was a wonderful and enjoyable movie to watch.
