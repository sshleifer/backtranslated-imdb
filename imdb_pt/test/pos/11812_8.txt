I really enjoyed the movie, I found it very entertaining and dramatic. But I only had one question about music is the movie. I could not find any kind of soundtrack (if there is one). And specifically, I was wondering if anyone could tell me the name of the song that is playing while the boys are coming down the river on their way to New Orleans? I thought it was something like "My great escape", but I searched the internet, books, pretty much everything I could think of trying, and I just can not find it anywhere. If anyone could help, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
