Not surprisingly, this movie was made by I'm in the moment it was. I examine the beauty and tragedy of life in the Chosun Dynasty in Seopyonje and delightfully explore a popular Korean tale in Chunhyang, and these included his last two films. What is more surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon, his 2002 offer, is not presented in the pansori style of the two previous films. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I'm experienced hand appears. We explore together the life of a real person: a painter of the late 19th century Chosun dynasty who rides on the brink of modernity but who is not noble and who, because of this, causes agitation in contemporary Korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old Korean noble class and its contempt for would-be Japanese settlers. The painter, Chang Seung Up, popularly known as Oh Won (magnificently played by Choi Min Sik, the famous star of Park Chan Wook's already legendary "OldBoy"), becomes increasingly influential and therefore more dangerous along of the movie. The contemporary Korean public will support a hero like this, despite the fact, or perhaps because of the fact, that he was so ostracized in his time. I am sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in the story remains intact. I am a master at capturing the past idiosyncrasies of his country and, in this film, he almost surpasses himself. As expected in a movie, cinematography is breathtaking, editing is accurate and the story is central. <br /> <br /> The plots are against Seung Up, the family ties are tested and broken, the outrageous behavior is alleged. (and sometimes it's real), all to overthrow the man who "painted fire." But against all the intricacies of the detailed, but sometimes complicated, story of Seung Up's life, Seung Up himself can survive. He becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy the famous Chinese paintings after just one look. Traders and art dealers surround him and try to make money with "Oh Won". In other words, lines of people who wish to take advantage of the true Seung Up, an artistic star, begin to form. But he refuses to be manipulated. His cleverness to stall the massive hordes and Imperial minions impresses the public, if not the cast. <br /> <br /> What does Seung Up think? He possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting, such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living beings and that they are never truly finished. He despises those who try to turn art into profit. And he does not care about politicians who use their power to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as a traitor. But he also thinks painting plays a role in the upcoming uprisings. Horrible scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented. I am the historical symbol of the signature, and its influence in the kingdom, remains in prominent display in this multi-millionaire epic. <br /> <br /> The protagonist causes more suffering for himself and for those who care for him when he refuses to paint. This is when history takes on a whole new meaning, which is not only political but of a social nature. I am assuming the issues in a commendable realistic way. <br /> <br /> He, Oh Won, becomes a figure of Jesus. People believe he is capable of performing artistic miracles and the government feels he needs his artistic support, but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and disdainful of what others want him to do. Eventually, both the government and the people descend upon Seung Up in a way taken directly from the Bible. His holiness becomes human; his humanity is not accepted; he dies (or escapes) the sins of the plebeians, the art critics, the politicians who persecute him. <br /> <br /> But does he die? As with most I'm movies, one issue remains. In this case, does Seung Up really become an immortal hermit? The film does not address this issue; only presents a possible end to the real man of Chang Seung Up, or Oh Won. No death is described because no death is known. <br /> <br /> It is hard to find flaws in this film, but I have become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in your culture that when it does, no wonder more. As usual for I'm movies, cinematography, editing and writing are all top notch. It's a well-crafted movie imbued with I'm supernatural storytelling ability. Granted, he may be better at doing this through the ancient Korean musical art of pansori. Still, the film contains excerpts from this admirable art form, and in the end, viewers feel they have been privy to a large, untold story. And they have, because that, precisely, is the gift that I am.
