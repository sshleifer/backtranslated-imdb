The first of St Trinian's five films (although the latter is usually discounted) was based on high school characters by artist Ronald Searle, and features the wondrous Alastair Sim in the drag as Millicent Fritton, director, as well as his own brother. Much of the humor is dated, but curiously touching and outrageous in today's PC world - girls drink, play, smoke, and then sell themselves to wealthy Arabs, but they always remain in control, defeating bureaucrats, police officers, judges, and other establishment figures. they sack through England. Perhaps because the movies have been regularly seen on TV, St Trinians still inspires fantasy parties and nightclubs. The films have recurring characters such as PC Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell) and Flash Harry (George Cole). The forerunner of the entire series is a charming film called "The Happiest Days of Your Life" (1950).
