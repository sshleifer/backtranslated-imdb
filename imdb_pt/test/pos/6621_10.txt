Being in the suburbs of New York, when the Z-Boys were making history in Dogtown, I was only exposed to a glimpse of what was happening. I had a P-O-S Black Knight skateboard with clay wheels. It's been a long time, and in the ash heap of my personal life. But I never forgot. It's like seeing brothers and friends long lost, and it hits me exactly where I live. I can not watch this movie enough. Every time I see, some other aspect rises to the top, some other point of view comes into focus. The vintage images, the incredible stills, the present personalities mingle with the vivid shadows of the enlightened past, the sincere and not exaggerated narrative, all beautifully edited together to make a historical documentary of a genuine slice of American history. In the words of Glen Friedman - "It was F-ing unbelievable."
