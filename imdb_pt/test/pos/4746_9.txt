Roy Scheider is not Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood, but who is it? Seven-Ups is one of the best detective movies to date, and only loses to the McQueen, Bullitt and Dirty Harry series, which is not a bad company. There are three things that seem to make a good crime thriller: Credible Screenplay with great acting, great car chase scenes and some heavy action. This movie has all three and the car chase scene is better than Dirty Harry's. Scheider plays the head of a group of cops so the NY thugs are sentenced to seven years or more; hence the name Seven-Ups. Overall, not much to Dirty Harry or Bullitt, but far better than all the crime films made since the Dirty Harry series. 9/10
