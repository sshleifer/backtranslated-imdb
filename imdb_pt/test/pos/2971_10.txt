When I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed that the song was from Elton John so I realized I had nothing to lose so I got it. What a surprise!!! The movie was incredible. It was true love is everything. The characters (Paul and Michelle) did not have luxuries, money and sometimes they had no food, but still they were happy. I recommended this movie to all my friends, but they all criticized my tastes, and even called me names, because the movie showed two smaller nudes. I think that just made the movie more realistic. The cinematography was great and only comes to show the great skills of director Lewis Gilbert
