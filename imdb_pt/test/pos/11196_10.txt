ý thýk uzak is one of the best films of all time and everyone should hold this film. I am a Turkish boy and a great cinema fun. and in this days our film industry is on the rise. And UZAK is the best Turkish film of the last ten years. and perhaps one of the best films of all time. The director nuri bilge ceylan is quite amazing. Telling stories, characters, the atmosphere is wonderful. He is a minimalist director and talks about the family of routine events, dreams, expectations, life.tells about you, talks about me, talks about us. I promise you will find a piece of your body in this movie. with a new director.he is waiting to perform.I promise you will love this movie please watch
