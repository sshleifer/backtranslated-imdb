A fun first draft for "North By Northwest," "Saboteur" has some wonderful Hitchcockian moments (one of the best occurs at a table when the hero is asked by a woman who has not yet seen that he is wearing handcuffs, to give she does a plate, trying to do this, he also drops a knife on the floor, exposing himself even more!), but suffers from an ill-chosen leadership (whether he's preaching patriotic speeches, dating Priscilla Lane, making jokes or trying to look worried, Robert Cummings is made of wood), and the lack of really distinct villains (ah, there are villains, many of them, but almost no one has enough screen time).
