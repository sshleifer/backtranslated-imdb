I loved this movie! Kicking old school! I love the idea. I love the script. Love the characters. I really loved the Geeks! I was excited to see the silly silly horror movies still being honored. That was with my favs like Saturday 14th and Pandemonium. If you are a big fan of scary and silly then this is your movie! I only took one star because I would love to have a better sound. Not bad sound, but would have liked to have more. Big splashes of blood. Great murder weapons. Great costumes! I really love the nod for the great teenage 1980's morning coffee stereotype. And I can appreciate the non-CGI suspense. Really good camera action and slight suspense rather than hack to CGI. I'd rather have a good fake than be really fake. <br /> <br /> Kisses to the cast and the creators! Oh, I loved the making-of, too!
