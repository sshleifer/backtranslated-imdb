The opening of Imamura's masterpiece avoids mere sensationalism in his depiction of the horribly indecipherable events of August 6, 1945, in which 90% of Hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were annihilated in an instant. Instead, Imamura emphasizes the unprecedented strangeness of the catastrophe, concentrating on images as portentous as the devilish mushroom cloud that silently stretches out at a distance and the black rain splashing the face of a beautiful young woman. The rest of the film traces the ramifications of the last incident, bringing the atomic holocaust and its aftermath (more than 100,000 people died of radiation poisoning) to the intelligible level of Yasuko's (Yoshiko Tanaka) situation and his small "community bound by the bomb . "<br /> <br /> Survivors struggle for normality and continuity, mainly trying to find a suitable marriage for Yasuko, but the imminent possibility of radiation sickness obscures every aspect of their lives. Yasuko's potential suitors, of course, run away from a young woman, however attractive she may be and suddenly die. Genuine love, when it finally appears, does so unexpectedly and ambiguously. We wonder if love through class lines is yet another sign of Yasuko's status as "damaged goods" or of a common humanity, which is overcome by the difficult circumstances that transcends class divisions. <br /> <br /> The film Classically restricted style enhances the impact, the spare and eloquent shots of the interior, reminding us that Imamura began his career as assistant to the great Ozu. Imamura's dominance is evident, for example, in the paired scenes of Yasuko bathing, the first emphasizing her lovely back and legs, the second as her hair is falling. The shots are almost like props for the trajectory of the narrative, distilling its tragic essence. The documentary style realism of the film is violated for expressive purposes several times, perhaps most notably in a scene that reveals the troubled inner life of a veteran in shock. Both the soundtrack of renowned avant-garde composer Toru Takemitsu and breathtaking black-and-white photography all contribute enormously to the melancholy mood of the film. When, in the final shot, Yasuko's uncle (Kazuo Kitamura), the laconic narrator of the film, looks at the empty sky as a sign of hope and regeneration, the black and white image suddenly becomes so poignant that it is almost unbearable. Few films from Japan (or anywhere else) could be compared to the great humanist Japanese works of art of the 1950s. This film is one of them. When I finished seeing him for the first time, I was stunned, unable to move for at least five minutes, overwhelmed by the emotions that the great tragedy should inspire: terror and pity.
