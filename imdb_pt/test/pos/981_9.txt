"Big Fat Liar" comes as a welcome - shallow but welcome - breath of fresh air after many movies with restrooms, body fluids, acid pets, gassy jokes and groin jokes. After all, "See Spot Run," "The Great Motion of Max Keeble," and "Snow Dogs," had signaled The Degenerative Spiral of Creating Children's Movies. Worse yet is the perception that the young audience would later be satiated by the more obscure offers of "Not Another Teen Movie" and "Slackers." Written by producers Nickelodeon Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (who co-starred in the 1980's "Head of the Class" series), the film stars Frankie Muniz as Jason, who is always ready with a good lie to get out of scratches . (His father is choking on a Swedish dumpling.) His teacher (Sandra Oh) gives an ultimatum: deliver the paper at the end of the day or take the summer course. Jason launches a story called "Big Fat Liar" and is taken to the school by a limousine that leads insensitive Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Wolf gives him a ride, but Jason leaves the paper behind. No one will hear the truth this time, and Daddy tells him that he has lost his confidence. Months later, Jason and his best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) watched a preview of the movie "Big Fat Liar," and Go to Los Angeles to wreak havoc on Wolf's life - all for get a confession that he stole Jason's newspaper to make the movie. They even earn the sympathy of some of Wolf's malicious employees, including his assistant (Amanda Detmer), former driver (Donald Faison), movie star Jaleel "Urkel" White and stunt coordinator Lee Majors. Because "Big Fat Liar" is without the edge that his sitcom "Malcolm in the Middle" is known for, Muniz is easy to cheer but does not have much to work with. Likewise, for Bynes, who heads his own Tracey Ullman-style show on Nickelodeon. All impurity is given to Giamatti, whose eyes swell and dampen with every sarcastic insult. <br /> <br /> The movie is just thrown by trying the road and should be enjoyed by its target audience (especially since most of the high jinks take place in the Universal Studios lot). But here's one thing: the message is worth telling the truth. But have not we just seen Jason getting his return telling white lies throughout the movie? Well, at least there's no poop.
