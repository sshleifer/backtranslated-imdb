This movie was different. It took a sort of typical suspense story and came up with a more interesting and in-depth look at an individual character's struggle with faith. Of course, it helped that Andrew McCarthy's main performance was excellent. The other performances were also quite interesting, though not as consistent. The ending was a bit disappointing, but there were many good times. The filmmakers tried something different here - they did not just look for the obvious chills and scares. This is a dark movie (not for everyone), but if you want to have fun and do not talk down, try this one.
