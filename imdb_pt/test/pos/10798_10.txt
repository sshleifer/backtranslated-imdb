When you think 'Oliver Stone', the films that come to mind are the biggest and most controversial, such as Platoon, JFK, Born on Fourth of July, or Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio generally does not. It's a really small movie, actually. More than half of the movie happens to Barry Champlain on his radio station talking on his microphone. But believe me, this is one of Oliver Stone's greatest films and should not be missed. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a character study. Barry Champlain is a rude, risky, self-destructive and risky radio host who tells a lot of things and starts having problems with his boss, his lovers, his fans and even some Nazis. He does not like his audience and his interlocutors, and many of them do not like him (or like him or like him, but have no idea why). But in the end, he says in his program, "I think we're stuck with each other." <br /> <br /> Watch Talk Radio, even if you do not like Oliver Stone movies. You may be surprised. I'm sure it was. My rating: 10/10
