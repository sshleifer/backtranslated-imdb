Another good entry in the series Crime Doctor [# 4/10], with atmospheric almost black and white photos and some splendid settings and Spanish American scenarios. And a plot more off the wall too! <br /> <br /> A man who looks like the insane killer of his two first wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner. Doctor Crime is on the scene (ostensibly as a guest) to immediately and resignately proclaim the murder, and so we are introduced to a rather strange group of people to think about, as one of them did the deed. It was the brother of the first dead wife, the third wife and wealthy widow Hilary Brooke, brother dancing and vampire siblings, the intense young man, the eccentric cabinet maker Lloyd Corrigan, borrowed by Boston Blackie, the irreplaceable butler, or chances - in Jerome Cowan? Police inspector Emory Parnell had his work cut, but Warner Baxter as Ordway was as undisturbed as ever working at it all. One of the cheats listed on the IMDb is wrong: when invading the murder room, Ordway says "Right in the middle of the forehead" and Cowan replies "He did not waste that time". Favorite Bashter: Baxter and Cowan traveling through sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make up for the interrupted dinner; The scene in which the resting place of Braga is apparently resounding. The plot seems to wander a little at times and the way everything was explained was perhaps more worthy of monogram, but let it in the air as the supernatural would not either! <br /> <br /> It's worth noting if you already like the genre, you will not be disappointed unless you really do not like the genre.
