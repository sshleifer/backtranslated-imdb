I tried Nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago and was pleasantly surprised by the results. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker would have revitalized the horror with Hellraiser, but this is a film that effectively paralyzed his film career. a little. What an unfortunate thing to happen because, like the Midianites, this movie seems to be misinterpreted. Barker has created a crossroads of basic genres in this story - begins as a traditional horror film. but soon becomes a fable about the inhumanity of man to man. To evoke sympathy for the devil is difficult at best, but when the characters are as visually demonic as they are in this film, it becomes almost impossible (suggest the child!). The human insurgency practically similar to Klan (forcados and holy wrath!) At the conclusion of the films becomes doubly disturbing before what happened before. As a parable of ethnic tension and white supremacy, this film can be quite evocative. I pity those who do not see the film from this angle and think of it as Barker's fantastic indulgence that went too far. We have a genuine gem forgotten here and the sooner the studio and Mr. Barker do well and take some time for it - the better.
