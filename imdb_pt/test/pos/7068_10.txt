Some people have the ability to use only 3 neurons, one to eat, one to breathe and one to drink ... This is not a movie for them ... <br /> <br /> But for those who like to use the brain ... the whole movie is a metaphor, everything is there with a purpose, every detail, the coffee mug, the red sofa, everything ... it's an underrated masterpiece ... /> It's hilarious, it's raw and totally realistic, that's how we really interact ... it's a real comedy ... total causality ... <br /> <br /> Just wait, do not let the first scene te shock ... wait ... and enjoy the show ....
