I was first introduced to this movie while I was in San Antonio, TX. This movie was the second. in a double feature. Unfortunately, the theater where I saw this was overthrown. Anyway, Five Fingers of Death (aka King Boxer) was released in 1972 and released in the US the following year. Like a bunch of "other" Kung-Fu movies released while walking on Enter the Dragon's "coats", this particular movie was very good. It is the story of a country boy who is sent to a martial arts institute to improve himself and his fighting skills. Meanwhile, martial arts school plans "opponents" and scheme to thwart our hero by using dirty tactics to try to get him off the track and try to stop him from attending the tournament. Surprisingly, I felt that since Warner Bros. distributed this film in the USA, to Warner Bros. was releasing a DVD. This never happened. As far as I know, this movie was released in English and Cantonise, w / sub-titles ..... the latter a more "cleaner and clearer" version. Although the fight sequences are a little funny to watch (eg flying in the air and hitting, jumping into buildings, a fighter using his head ... literally ... to hit the opponent, etc.), however, it's classic Beautifully planned and executed kung-fu action. If you like Enter the Dragon, Five Fingers of Death would be a great addition to any movie collection ..... if you can find it.
