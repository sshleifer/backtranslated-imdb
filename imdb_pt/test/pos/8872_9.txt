I thought the interaction between Crystal and DeVito was great. The film is a little off the wall, but there are some unforgettable lines. Ramsey as "Momma" is vulgar and exaggerated, but also very funny and effective. Does the character have to be horrible because anyone else would think about killing their mother? Now Crystal's wife - she is a "slut" to whom everyone would like to receive her punishment, so her role, although minor, is also effective, because she has to justify the ridiculous case of Crystal's "writer's block." Although there are certainly somber moments, the film is not depressing and, despite the murderous drives the protagonists feel, they also have redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is one of the funniest movies I can remember, one that I do not mind watching multiple times.
