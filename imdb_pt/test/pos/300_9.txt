Firstly, I believe this film is much appreciated by viewers who actually read Joseph Conrad's "Heart Of Darkness," the book that was the literary base of the film. With that said, I believe this movie is amazing. It is an excellent war movie that does not focus so much on the blood and brutality of the Vietnam conflict, but more the psychological toll that it has on the young "inexperienced" young people who were sent to fight it. Coppola has demonstrated true genius in the art of making films, using many visual aids to help tell the story. The acting I felt was definitely complete. The participation of Marlon Brando in the film is what really got me to act. His elucidation to Willard at the end of the film shows you and reveals the emptiness of a man you've heard about and wanted to see throughout the film. Those who consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed insight into all the literary elements that are intertwined with this film because there is a lot of meaning behind it all. In my opinion, this is one of the most sculpted and best-made films of all time.
