I own this video as well as the concert version of the musical with Patti Lupone and George Hearn with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. George Hearn is fantastic in my book, as well as Angela Lansbury and composer Stephen Sondheim. This musical is operatic in scope and shows a lot of ingenuity in composition. I certainly hope this VHS is available on DVD !! Hearn's performance is frighteningly nice. The only annoying performance is the young woman who plays the role of Joanna. I believe this performance was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, not on a Broadway stage, and I'm not sure if the minimalist set was used in New York, as it was in that production. But I found the scaffold being dragged across the stage to be quite effective in "portraying" the streets of London. I recommend this movie.
