I saw Le Conseguenze Dell'Amore at the 2005 Rotterdam Film Festival, it was the first of ten films I saw there. <br /> <br /> Le Conseguenze left the most powerful impression of the ten films. From the first shot, you know the movie is going to be something special. Beautiful cinematography has impressed me with what can be done with a camera. The music is also on the same level of visuals, complementing the colorful and elegant images of the architecture. <br /> <br /> Toni Servillo plays the main character in the movie, Titta. He is a tax expert who missed and lives in a hotel. Every week he brings a suitcase with money to a bank and history plays with it. <br /> <br /> He is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion to anyone; He looks calculated and well dressed. He has a habit of ignoring people who are not significant to him. For example, Sofia (very well played by Olivia Magnani), who works as a waitress at the hotel where she lives. Although she has been working at the hotel for two years, he never greets her, even though she greets him. One day she confronts him with this and the next day he sits in the bar, instead of his usual place in a window. From here, the story really begins, and will unfold in a strong tale of love, sacrifice and the mafia. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the rest of the movie. Watch this movie if you like stylish movies like David Lynch, The Godfather, etc. Do not see this if you're an action buff.
