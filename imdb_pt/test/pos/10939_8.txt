I watch a lot of vampire movies. I know vampire movies. Hammer Films has always been my favorite. Christopher Lee will always be the best Dracula. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is a fun movie from beginning to end. The dubbing is not good, but I also like Godzilla movies, so I'm used to badly dubbed movies. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie. SFX is great. Even though Jackie Chans's part in the movie has nothing to do with the plot and seems to be added to sell the movie, it's nice in it. Fang's work is excellent. The acting is not great, but this may have something to do with bad dubbing. Maybe the current language would sound better with the film if I could understand. I'm sure the movie Gone With The Wind sounds worse in another language. <br /> <br /> I own it on DVD and it would not separate me. I have it sitting on my shelf next to my Hammer Films DVDs.
