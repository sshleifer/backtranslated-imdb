This was Eisenstein's first completed project in over ten years. The film takes place in the 13th century during a Russian invasion by the Germans (Teutonic Knights - I think). Launched in 1938, it is a very vague parallel with the close involvement of Russia in World War II and the advance of Germany in Eastern Europe. There are some incredible, most notable scenes in the battle near the end of the movie, and there is a shock when the children are thrown into a fire pit, but it is not an easy watch. The film trails and is not as consistently bright as "Potemkin" or "Ivan the Terrible". Sometimes Eisenstein is better at clips. His brilliance is present, however, and is a "must see" for Eisenstein's fans and film historians. Russian propaganda at its best.
