There's a sign on The Lost Highway that says: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD (but you already knew that, did not you?) <br /> <br /> Since there are a lot of people who apparently did not understand the purpose of this film, I would like to contribute my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense. As others have pointed out, a single view of this movie is not enough. If you have the MD DVD, you can "cheat" by looking at the "Top 10 Tips to Unlock MD" by David Lynch (but only after the second or third preview, please.); /> Everything, Mulholland Drive is downright brilliant. A masterpiece. This is the kind of movie that refuses to leave your head. There are often comments about very accurate DVDs, but "stays inside your head and stays there" from Vogue. David Lynch deserves praise for creating a film that not only looks elegant - cinematography-wise, has great acting (esp. Naomi Watts), an astonishing soundtrack by Badalamenti, and a quality very similar to a dream - but, in addition, it also engages the viewer in such a way that few movies have before. (After all, when was the last time you saw a movie that did not go out of your head and that everyone felt compelled to speak and write, regardless of whether they like it or hate it?) All right, enough about all this, it is time to justify these statements. <br /> <br /> Most people who have struggled to join the plot will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion / a dream sequence. <br /> <br /> Of course this is very bad for all those who try to understand the film by expecting "traditional" methods in which the story is exposed in a timely manner. logic and linear way for the viewer. But for those who expect this, I urge you to check out the director's name and come back again. ;) <br /> <br /> MD is the story of the sad death of Diane Selwyn, an aspiring actor who is hopelessly in love with another actress, Camilla Rowles. Due to Diane's lack of talent, she is constantly struggling to make progress in her career, and feels that she has not been able to fulfill her parents' expectations alone. Upon realizing that Camilla will never be hers (C. becomes engaged to Adam Kesher, the director), she hires a killer to get rid of her, and subsequently has to deal with the guilt she produces. <br /> <br /> The film begins with what may seem like a strange opening for this kind of suspense; which is a 1950s jitterbug / dance contest, in which we can see the main character Betty giving a great performance. We also see an elderly couple (which we'll see more twice over the course of the film) along with her and applauding her. <br /> <br /> No, wait. This is what most people see the first time they see it. In fact, there is another very significant fact that is given before the credits - the camera moving towards an object (though blurry) and the scene disappearing rapidly. If you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, revealing that what follows is a dream. <br /> <br /> The main characters seen in the first half of the movie: Betty: Diane Selwyn's imaginary self, used in the first half of the "dream sequence" a positive portrait of a young aspiring actor (the opposite of Diane). "Betty" was chosen as the name because it is the real name of the Winkies waitress. Note that in the dream version, the waitress's name is 'Diane'. <br /> Rita: The fanciful version of Camilla Rhodes who, through Diane's dream, and with the help of an imaginary car accident, is transformed into an amnesiac. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diane's love. She is then conveniently placed in the luxurious home of Aunt Betty / Diane, where Betty was allowed to stay. <br /> <br /> Coco: In real life, Adam's mother. In the dream part, the woman in charge of the apartment complex where Betty stays. She is primarily a strong authority figure, as can be witnessed in both parts of the film. <br /> <br /> Adam: The director. We know from the second half that he gets involved with Camilla. Her only goal of being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for Betty / Diane, since she develops such hatred against him. <br /> <br /> Aunt Ruth: Diane's true aunt, but instead of being out of town, she's really dead. Diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used it to pay for the murder of Camilla. <br /> <br /> Cheap: A typical Lynch character. Unreal; appears only in the sequence of Diane's dreams. He is a mysterious and influential person who controls the chain of events in the dream of his wheelchair. It serves the same function as the talking dwarf (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> The killer: The person who kills Camilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, although rendered in a slightly more goofy way following the dreams (more on that below). <br /> <br /> Now, having established the various versions of the characters in the film, we can begin to delve into the plot. Of course I will not go into every little detail (nor will I do it chronologically), but I will try to explain some of the important scenes, in relation to Lynch's "tip sheet." As I mentioned above, Camilla was re-produced as an amnesiac through her unlikely survival from a car accident in the first 10 minutes of the film, which left her completely vulnerable. What I found very intriguing with MD, is that Lynch constantly gives advice on what is real and what is not. I've already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow, but note how there are two cars walking on each lane approaching the limo. <br /> <br /> Only one of the cars crashes into the limo; and the other? Even if they stayed away from the accident, would not they try to help others, or at least ask for help? My theory is that since this is a dream, the presence of the other car is left out and forgotten. Since, as Rogert Ebert says so eloquently: "Like real dreams, this does not explain, does not complete its sequences, remains on what it finds fascinating, rejects unpromising plots." Soon after Rita crawls down from the crash site in Mulholland Dr., and down the hill slope and sneaks into Aunt Ruth's apartment, Betty arrives and we see this scary old couple pulling away, looking ugly to each other and smiling at themselves and at the camera. This is the first indication that what we are seeing is a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Although the old couple does not seem to be familiar to Betty, I think they are actually her parents (since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest). Maybe she did not know them so well, and really did not have as good a relationship with them as she wanted, so the couple is shown as very nice and helpful to her in the dream. They also represent her feelings of guilt for the murder and Diane's sense of dissatisfaction with her unattainable goals in her life. <br /> <br /> A rather long and hilarious scene involves the killer. Diane apparently sees him as the main force behind the campaign that tries to pressure the director into accepting the role of Camilla in the film (from Adam's party in the second half of the movie), so he occupies an important part of his dream. Because of her feelings of guilt and remorse over Camilla's murder, a part of her wants him to fail, so she turns him into a stupid criminal. <br /> <br /> That scene, I think, is also Lynch's attempt. to totally spoil their audience, since they have a false claim to see the movie. <br /> <br /> You have to love this line 'Something just bit me badly', though. :) The next interesting scene is the one with the two people in Twinkies, who are talking about how one of them continues having this recurring nightmare involving a man who is seen by him through a wall. outside the restaurant where they are sitting. After a little conversation, they go out and continue walking towards the corner of a fence, accompanied, of course, with great music that matches the mood of the scene. <br /> <br /> Upon reaching the corner, a character resembling a vagabond with a disfigured face appears behind the corner, startling the man who is having the nightmare. This nightmare only exists in Diane's mind; she saw that guy in the restaurant when he paid for the murder. So, in short, his objections translate into the nightmares of that poor bastard. The bum also means Diane's evil side, as can be seen later in the film. Cowboy is (along with the dwarf) one of the strange characters who are always present in the Lynchian landscape - Diane only saw him briefly at Adam's party, but just as our own dreams can reward people insignificant who hardly know an important role in our dreams, he can also receive an important part in his dream. Also we are given additional clues during his scenes that what we are seeing is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.) <br /> <br /> The Cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the Director when he knows with him in the strange place (the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream). Notice also how he says he will appear once more if he (Adam) does good, or twice more if he does something bad. Throughout the film he appears two more times, indicating to Diane that she did it wrong. He is also the only one to wake her to reality (this scene is probably an illusion made to fit his demands for him to appear twice), and soon afterwards she commits suicide. The espresso scene with The Castigliane brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, as Luigi) is probably the result of the fact that Diane was having espresso just before Camilla and Adam did his announcement at Adam's party in the second half. It could at the same time be a statement from Lynch. <br /> <br /> During the scene when they enter Diane's apartment, the body lying on the bed is Camilla, but note how she took over Diane's sleeping position; Diane is seeing herself in her own dream, but the face is not hers, although she has the same wounds on her face that Diane would have shot herself. This scene is also filled with a genuine Lynch fight. Since Diane did not know where (or when) the killer would get to Camilla and end it, she would just put her in her own house. <br /> <br /> In real life, Diane's audition for the movie part was bad. . In her dream, she does a perfect audition - leaving the entire crew ecstatic about her performance. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is the fact that real-life money was used to pay for Camilla's murder now appears on the Rita / Camilla Stock Exchange. This is part of Diane's undoing for the terrible act of actually getting the money back, since the murder has not happened now. <br /> <br /> When her neighbor arrives to pick up the ashtray in piano format, another tip is given; she picks up the ashtray from the table and leaves, but then, as Camilla and Betty meet on the sofa, we see the ashtray reappear as the camera passes over the table, suggesting that Betty's encounter with her neighbor was a fantasy. /> <br /> The slogan of the movie Adam is auditions of actresses is "She is the girl"; which are exactly the same words Diane uses when giving the photo resume of the murderer Camilla. The blue box and key represent the main turning point in the film, and that's where the true identities of the characters are revealed. There is a lot of symbolism going on here; the box may represent Diane's future (it's empty), or it may be some kind of Pandora's box (the killer laughs when she asks him what the key will open). Either way, he is linked to the murder by the blue key (which is placed next to it after the murder has taken place). The box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured butt. <br /> <br /> Club Silencio is a little addition to remind the viewer even more that what he is seeing is not real. It also means that Diane is about to wake up to her reality (her reality is a nightmare from which she is unable to escape, even in her dreams). <br /> <br /> During the chilling scene at the end where the scary old couple reappears, Diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out of the screams and avoid being haunted by her fears. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's my $ 0.02. I hope this helps people unfold in this movie and call it "the worst movie ever" or something, without realizing the plot. <br /> <br /> As always, Lynch has everything to do with creating irrational fears, and he certainly achieves this with that image as well. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
