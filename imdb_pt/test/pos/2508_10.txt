Director Peter Chan, Screenplay Maria Maggenti. <br /> <br /> Based on Cathleen Schine's novel "The Love Letter," the film version of director Peter Chan, released in 1999, was not a blockbuster, not even for a romantic movie with some elements of comedy. Although not so popular in theaters, it soon became a beloved movie on cable and VHS / DVD. Set in a port city in good old USA (I forgot the exact location), this is the story of a mysterious, passionately written love letter that ignites emotions and confusion between the main characters, each one who thinks the letter is in person addressed to them. At the end of the movie, we do not know who the lover or lover is, but the power of the card has changed the lives of almost everyone in the small town. The cast is comprised of wonderful actors who performed well on TV and in the movies, among them Kate Capshaw in the leading role of middle-aged beauty Helen, a bookstore owner, comedian Ellen DeGeneres as her friend / employee Janet Hall, a young hot Tom Everett Scott as Johnny, the young 20 something who falls in love with older Hellen and older Tom Selleck as firefighter George Matthias who must compete with Johnny for Helen's affections. There are special roles of veteran Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart, who is best known to modern audiences as the older Rose in "Titanic" (1997) and a special guest appearance of Kate Capshaw's daughter Steven Spielberg (Jessica Capshaw). The love triangle is between a middle-aged woman, an older man and a young man, each of whom feels as passionately about Helena as the writer of the mysterious letter. The conflict lies in Helen's indecision. Will she choose the right person? Which man has more to offer? Johnny is in a relationship with a girl of his age, who loves him with a passion of his own, and is, in fact, a kind of reminder of how Helen was at her age. George is in the process of divorcing his wife and has lived a mundane and eventful life. A cultured intellectual, he takes Helen on an opera date, where the tragic death of Puccini Tosca's ultra-Italian heroine moves Helen to explosive tears. There are many beautiful views of the charming seaside town, beautifully portrayed by the director of photography Tami Reiker. The score is a paradise of romantic and adorable songs - "I've never fallen in love before", "I'm in the mood for love" and "Just the lonely." Ellen DeGeneres as Janet Hall, who is constantly behind schedule in her work at Helen's bookstore, dating men without being able to find the right guy, is simply marvelous. She did not lose her comedic talent, although at this point in her career she did not show up much on TV or in the movies because only about two years before her TV show "Ellen" was canceled because of her "leaving" as a lesbian and new lesbian theme of the program. Here you even meet the comedian Jack Black, long before he became big, in the small part of a fisherman. This is a poignant film about human emotions and decision-making that are meaningful, about the human need for a passionate burning love and the general love of escapism brought not only through books, lyrics and music, but through a genuinely loving and safe. This is a great movie with wonderful moments and a contagious romantic spirit.
