I saw this movie for the first time with my fiancee many years after he left. I thought I'd hate it, but to my surprise it's so tacky it's great. We spent many hours reenacting parts of the movie ("Sylvia ?! Yes, Mickey?" Or "I'm sorry you saw this Baby. Sometimes in this world, we see things we do not want.") My financier shudders every time I imitate Neil. Also the music is classic and fun to sing along, especially on road trips. Of course I do not admit it to my male friends. It's like guilty pleasure. I seriously watch Dirty Dancing once a month or more and it feels so good every time. Jennifer Gray is also so cute in this movie. It's too bad your career has never taken off.
