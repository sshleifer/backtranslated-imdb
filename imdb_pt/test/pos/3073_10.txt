If you do not like Mel Brooks, you will not like this movie. That's a given. Why would not someone want their movies to be unfamiliar to me, but to those who can not see the light, avoid them. <br /> <br /> Everyone else: This is a classic. The entire cast is perfect: Carey Elwes is a rugged and intelligent British Robin Hood, Amy Yasbeck acts appropriately as Marion, Richard Lewis is his usual distracted and annoyed, Roger Rees is a brilliant combination of fury and violence as "Mervyn." Rottingham Sheriff, Dave Chapelle, Eric Allan Kramer, Mark Blankfield, and Matthew Poretta, unfortunately underutilized, are the perfect Happy Men. <br /> <br /> There are similarities to Spaceballs, Burning Saddles ... and all the other Mel Movie Brooks. But why do you want him to change his style when he works so well? The pop culture references in this movie are old enough to be funny again ... from the point of view of a person of at least 16 years. It is complete parody and total, every second a joke to laugh. Some of them do not work, but most do and well. I discovered new jokes for the fifth and sixth time I watched the movie! <br /> <br /> Of course, if being attacked by constant visual and verbal jokes is not your style, you would not like that. This is not an Oscar winner, it's Mel Brooks. You know what it is when you're getting into it. If you want uninterrupted laughter, surprisingly well-developed characters, and lifelong slogans, watch this.
