Putney Swope is the story of a black man on the board of a large advertising firm who is accidentally elected chairman of the board when the owner of the firm walks away while trying to stifle an idea that he was apparently quite excited. Putney, of course, takes his new role seriously and shoots most people at the agency, hires a new team (all black, except for a symbolic white guy) and starts producing the most offensive and non-PC-related ads someone could do. for. Now it's a very heterogeneous team he has, and yet they manage to be successful while raising money. I prefer the scene where potential advertisers are being sacked and then sent off. And your commercials will follow later, like them or not. The story is good but of course the highlight here are the nasty commercials themselves, especially the one for the acne "Face Off" cream. That's a bit dated, but it's still a fun movie full of hilarious moments. Robert Downey Sr. was working for an ad agency doing experimental ads at the time and I think this was his middle finger for the Madison Avenue agencies. Very good and very funny. 8 out of 10.
