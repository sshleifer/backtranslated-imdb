It is rare that I have the opportunity to review a movie for IMDb that relates to my own life in such a close way. However, as someone living with cerebral palsy (although less serious than Michael, one of the main characters in the film), I do not wish to give this movie a "free pass" just because it addresses a subject that is rarely addressed; and when it is, it is usually treated with serious seriousness. There were minor problems I had with the film; and I would like to address these issues first, so that people are made aware that it is not my situation that has obscured my judgment of this excellent film in general! <br /> <br /> * Parts of what I felt were shameless to please the crowd at the expense of realism. If I had a pound for every time a well-meaning member of the public mentioned electric wheelchair racing for me, I would be the richest man; but speaking in person, this fits more in the public perception of how we deal with our disadvantages, rather than the reality of what actually happens. Same thing about spending time watching people with disabilities go to the pub - it's not a big deal for those of us who really do, no matter how admirable it is to outsiders. I appreciate that this is from Michael's formerly sheltered perspective; but I still think he'd be focusing more on enjoying the experience, rather than pondering how great he really was in there in the first place. As such, the amount of time we spent watching them have fun seemed a bit much. <br /> <br /> * I felt that the terminal nature of Rory's disease was brought to our attention very late; meaning that it was only used as a cheap sentimental device to interpose between the two rather than something that everyone knew all along would have to be dealt with. <br /> <br /> To balance these criticisms, I have to make a plate. A lot of compliments, too. Although I thought some scenes that showed familiarity with normal life were a bit overdone; the script also ventured into some tricky places that I had not expected, and left with a lot of credit for it. For example, raising the issue of love and relationships; and showing the daily apparatus often used to help and assist the lives of unhealthy people. Furthermore, while the brutal emotional shock tactic of death has been thrown upon us, the film as a whole is far less sappy than anyone has the right to expect such a movie to be. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker can and has presented variations of her role competently on autopilot for what seems to be years; but Robertson and McAvoy share a special interaction that should be noted. Inside, I'm doing pirouettes that a group of people somewhere has finally made a movie living up to the greed for the lives of many people with disabilities.
