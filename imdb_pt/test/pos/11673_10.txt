Penelope Spheeris (of Wayne's World fame) made her mark with the documentary "The Decline of Western Civilization," about the Los Angeles punk scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Most of the documentary features interviews with the punks and filming of concerts (which often become violent). Overall, we can see how the punk movement was a reaction to hippies: while hippies were natural, punks wanted to have themselves as upset as possible, with spiky hair and everything. But also, we see how dissatisfied they really are and sometimes becoming skinheads. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is really a great time capsule. We are not sure if we want to look forward to it or feel revulsion for it. But this is definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral. Really worth seeing.
