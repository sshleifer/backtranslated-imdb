I first saw "Signs of Life" on PBS as a presentation from the American Playhouse. It's a wonderfully written ensemble production, with incredible performances from Michael Lewis such as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last papers, is also excellent as an old shipyard, whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast, which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker, gives remarkable clarity and substance to their characters. <br /> <br /> The steering is subtle and effective. I have watched this movie several times over the years and highly recommend it. A beautiful piece of film.
