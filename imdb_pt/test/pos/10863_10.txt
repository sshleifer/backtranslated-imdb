Tipping the Velvet has just been released three weeks ago in the UK and I already see countless letters reaching national newspapers and TV guides claiming that it has a fine plot, weak performances and an even weaker script. <br /> You find me irritated. This is heresy. <br /> <br /> I would really like to dispel all doubts first by congratulating Andrew Davies for empowering Geoffrey Sax to create this wonderful dramatization of Sarah Waters's novel, cushioning him with such a fantastic script. Kudos But I fear that now you need to change course. <br /> <br /> I've seen one of the top TV guides here in the UK (which will remain unnamed) relentlessly depicting Tipping the Velvet as a "lesbian love story." If they are, and I suppose they are, trying to promote interest in the movie, then this is completely the wrong way to do it (besides the phrase being a disappointingly inaccurate description). By saying such a thing, they are either a) pushing away those who would be instinctively repelled by "that" subject, or b) attracting a class of people who will just watch some "serious girl-to-girl action." Buy a video! Through this display of serious disregard, this and other magazines are cheapening what is a brilliant adaptation of one of the greatest works of recent literature. Tearing Down the Velvet is a story of love, passion, moving forward, loss and heartbreak. It's not a lesbian love story. No siren. <br /> <br /> The end result is an elegant affair, with excellent performances everywhere (especially from Stirling, Hawes, Chancellor and May). In terms of direction, it is intoxicating and immersive - sometimes accelerated, sometimes not - but never ceases to be anything less than compelling. As a whole, it is polished and well done, sex is performed with tenderness and delicacy - and although many do not classify it as a real "movie", it will remain among my favorites for some time.
