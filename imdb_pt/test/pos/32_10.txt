LACKAWANNA BLUES is an excellent piece by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even better film, as the author has adapted his own life story to the screen. This brilliant movie lights up the screen with rich color, exquisite music, brilliant editing, George C. Wolfe's superb direction and such a dazzling cast that makes viewing an encore mandatory! Yeah, it feels so good. The story is based on the author's life as the 'Junior' child (Marcus Carl Franklin) raised in the inimitable house of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby (S Epatha Merkerson), a lady who dedicated his life to helping the underprivileged by transporting them from the South, from psychiatric hospitals, and from the streets to Lackawanna, New York. The boy recalls all the lessons he learned about the lives of the villagers - strange characters with painful past - and the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by the nanny. Terrence Howard, Rosie Perez, Mos Def, the beautiful Carmen Ejogo, Louis Gossett Jr., Jeffrey Wright, Ernie Hudson, Charlayne Woodward, and many other characters from the house are too numerous to outline, but are portrayed by some of the best actors in the business. , Jimmy Smits, Patricia Wettig, Macy Gray, Liev Schreiber, Kathleen Chalfant, Lou Myers, Hill Harper - the list goes on. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, we are introduced to the cruelties of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the contagious joy of the contributions of African American music to our musical culture, and courage of a beautiful woman who fought against all the difficulties that the world can dignity of those with whom she came into contact. S. Epatha Merkerson is totally submerged in this role, a role she makes shine as a beacon of reason in a world of chaos. It offers one of the most impressive performances of the last few years, and if this movie had been released in theaters instead of being an HBO movie, it would no doubt add the Oscar to put next to its Golden Globe. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is exceptional and Wolfe deals with acting and history as a master: like riffs on a jazz piece, he glues tiny moments of conversation with each character and Junior along with flashes of scenes history with the matrix. of dance festivals in local clubs overflowing with incredible blues, jazz, dance and joy. The production team has assembled this small miracle of an image with extreme care and never, for a moment, attention rests at the time of history. Highly recommended, almost mandatory! Grady Harp
