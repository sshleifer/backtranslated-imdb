Someone I know said there was this movie called flatliners that was probably on my street. I was told about this movie after watching the final destination 2 and watching the extra feature about the near-detox experience. <br /> <br /> I bought the flatliners DVD for the modest price of 5 pounds. I got home and watched. And I could not help but smile and feel good wondering how this movie had not been in my life before. The film is about a group of medical students trying to see what it's like after the near-death experience. But then sins come back to reality and can physically harm them. Acting from Kevin Bacon and Keifer Sutherland is great as you'd expect from the pair. And Joel Schmacheur made this a great movie like he did with the lost boys. <br /> <br /> This is a bold and elegant thriller to please the type of movie fan.
