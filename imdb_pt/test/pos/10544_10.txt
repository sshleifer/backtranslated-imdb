At first, it seems like the romantic novel in which a girl meets a boy and falls in love, but the point is that this movie has a feeling that others do not have. The first time I saw him, I could not see him full because I had to leave. But while I was walking I thought I should see it again, but I had no chance until then. A year went by until I saw this movie on a non-free channel and I saw it and I recorded it too. I saw it once, twice ... up to 200 times and not kidding. I knew all the dialogues by hart and I do not know why, but I've seen it every day and never get bored. And I have to say that I'm not used to seeing a movie more than twice. The act is very good. Gerard Depardieu is a talented actor and Katherine Heigl too. I wish she was in a good movie because I think she can do it. It's a movie that I can not get out of my head.
