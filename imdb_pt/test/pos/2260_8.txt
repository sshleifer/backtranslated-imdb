Not having read the book, I was more open to the new interpretation that each director gives to his medium (which is the film, not the letter of the reproductions of the literature) about this particular film. I was glad that the holocaust that occurred in Russia (and in the neighboring countries) finally received some attention. The Nazis were particularly cruel against Russians and Russian Jews. If you read the stories and see the monuments built in Smolensk and surrounding areas, you will understand this film and why many were silent when they should have spoken. <br /> <br /> It was certainly time for this to be told. and I hope more stories come out of it. The time has come.
