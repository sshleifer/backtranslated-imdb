Two years after 'Airplane!' Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker have released one of their stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this hilarious television series, a glorious takeoff of old American detective programs like "Dragnet." Nielsen played Frank Drebin, America's answer to "Inspector Clouseau." He had the same humor style as 'Airplane!'; Intelligent visual jokes in the background, unnoticed absurdities and recurring characters like Johnny, the boy who seems to know everything about everything. Guest stars (including William Shatner!) Were killed in the opening credits. 'Police Squad' was the first US sitcom since 'Batman' did not have a laughing track. Many lamented the fact that only six episodes were made, but I think it was right. The concept could never have sustained a full run of 24 episodes. Five years later, "Police Squad" made a successful transfer to the big screen, when the first of the trilogy "Naked Gun" was released. Jim, Jerry, David and Leslie had their last laugh.
