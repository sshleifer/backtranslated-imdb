I can honestly say that this movie is the most amazing movie ever !!! If you're in the mood for a comedy, I totally recommend this movie! So, here is the summary. There is this girl (Nikki) who is fourteen and a half years old and she goes on vacation with her father (Andre), whom she has not seen for about two years. She hopes the holidays are totally boring, until she meets this boy (Ben), who is much older than she is. So to try to impress him, she says that she is not on vacation with her father, but with her lover. This is a hysterical movie from beginning to end, and I strongly suggest. Then rent and enjoy !!!
