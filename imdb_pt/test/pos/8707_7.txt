"Subspecies", like many other horror films, has a gross contract with IMDb. Most moviegoers have a sincere contempt for terror, and when they occasionally rent horror movies, they want to laugh at them or shrink with overly bloody scenes. Unfortunately, "Subspecies" is not particularly laughable, and not so bloody, so it gets a low rating. This is very bad. <br /> <br /> Of course there is much to criticize here. Non-actors are flat, subspecies have a bad special effect and the night scenes are very illuminated. But what do you expect? For a straight-to-video horror movie, "Subspecies" has decent production values ​​and more integrity than you could imagine. The Romanian scenario of the film is virtually unique (I believe it was the first American film ever made in that country, post-communism), and the locations, both internal and external, are beautiful. The script has moments of intelligence, especially when it delves into local folklore (all false, I'm sure). Somehow, the location script and smart script work well together - "Subspecies" has its own very different world. To risk oneself with a slight compliment ... can be much more dumb. <br /> <br /> Fans of the most horrific aspects of horror will no doubt have fun with the bloody vampire villain, Radu. He is quite effective in this film - powerful, with a hoarse and memorable voice - but I like him more in the sequences, when actor Anders Hove gives a more parody performance of himself. A totally sincere Radu is a little silly. Other silly aspects include free nudity and the subspecies itself, which are clearly only in the film because producer Charles Band has a fetish for small evil creatures (see also Puppetmaster and Demonic Toys). <br /> <br /> But I was late too. much about the flaws of the film. For what it is - vampire horror straight into the video - "Subspecies" is perfectly fine. The sequences have better production values, more violence and a little more thought lines, so I recommend them even more. Still, this is not a bad start to the series.
