What can be said about any Wilder film other than the most human and real stories about people and what guides them, bothers them, haunts them. Billy created paintings as paintings that forever reflect the human condition. He paints good and evil in all of us. He also paints with love. I can not imagine anyone taking a list of great movies without a Wilder movie about it. They will last because they are true. I saw this movie for the first time on TV in the 60's when I was a child and had to leave the room because I felt tears in me and I was ashamed. Now I'm an old man and I still feel the tears, but I do not leave the room. I knew these people and I loved them and grew up around them. Billy preserved them in this film and not in a "higher generation" way, but in a more realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit.
