Why does everyone feel they need to constantly put this movie in the air? It's cute and funny (exactly what it should be). Madonna did not want to prove she was an Oscar artist with this movie anyway! She was just doing what the character asked for, and she did it well. I loved her in this movie; It's my second favorite movie of Madonna after Evita. The soundtrack is also great. It's not better or worse than any 80's cheese movie. For all critics, do not take this so seriously and you can have fun watching. Madonna is a goddess !!!
