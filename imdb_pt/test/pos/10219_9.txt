This film is masterfully directed by Clive Barker, he really knows how to establish a relationship between the audience and the characters. I think there is a sequel missing for this one, Barker should have dedicated himself to continuing this film instead of making the boring Lord of Illusions, this is one that I think was a real crap. But I also think because of that and because of the lack of sequel, NBreed has become a cult classic of horror movies.
