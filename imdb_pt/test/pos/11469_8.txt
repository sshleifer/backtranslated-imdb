This movie has had a lot of ups and downs ... The plot is strong as you tell the growing saga of Ma'Barker, and then your misadventures with your boys and the FBI ... Theresa Russell is very talented and her beauty shines through , as Ma 'Barker, in Public Enemies. The direction of Mark L. Lester, though not as good as in "85 Commando was still very interesting. Eric Roberts plays a short-lived role as a security guard, turned thug (and Ma's lover and Alyssa Milano plays a prostitute , who walks with the gang Frank Stallone, plays a gangster who helps the gang, and while one of his exploits causes problems to one of Ma's boys, he exposes himself, in a final way, so to speak ... < > <br /> I was puzzled, intrigued & captivated, throughout this film .. So, that makes me think that all those others who voted so low watched! .. To all Those who wondered ... The FBI was really so bad at first, did not have guns like the outlaws, and therefore were at a disadvantage, whenever they went into gang shootings of that era.I saw the 1930s, I felt it was more realistic than many others films made portraying that era ... It is in May as a Train cident going on ... You do not want to atch, but you just have it too ... Enjoy !!!
