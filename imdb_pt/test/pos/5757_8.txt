Bottom has been my favorite sitcom since I saw it on t.v and the movie is even better if your background fan I say this is a must buy !!! the plot is that Eddie and Ritchie run a hotel called guest house Paradise, but not everything works out for them as clients leave until a famous actress comes to stay, they try to impress her better, but not all right, right, is a british cinema education then buy this and you will get wet from laughing so much. also starring Simon Peggi (Shaun of the Dead) and also bill neigh (love, actually) may not be good at the box office or by the looks of it on this site, but do not listen to them buy it and I swear you'll love it
