All I can say after watching the DVDs of the first season is that I can not believe the NBC "green-lit" this show. It's so different from what's currently in fashion, except for Lost. Those who lose the X Files may have a worthy successor. Not as mysterious or intense as Lost, I think it's more fun. <br /> <br /> This kind of story is hard to do. I mean, it can degenerate into child drool if most of the elements are not coherent. But coherently, they do and I think the cast is great, the writing is sharp, the location and purposes are top notch, and the special effects are very good for a television budget. Of course this pushes what is plausible, but how it never gets so silly as to insult his intelligence. <br /> <br /> Bottomline is that this is a great science fiction drama for the whole family. I doubt it's a classic with a long run like X-Files, but meanwhile I recommend getting the DVD if you missed it like I did the first time. This fall, my shows must have just come on in another series! <br /> <br /> PS: I just heard that it was canceled by NBC ... I hope Sci-Fi catches it.
