All you need is a great home, a nanny and a telephone. Simon West directs this thrilling and chilling remake of the 1979 original. This version is more of a thriller than a horror movie. Emotionally tense with a growing fear factor. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) needs to work with an excessive cell phone bill; she takes on the task of caring for the two sons of Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis (Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant). The house is a beautiful piece of wood and glass art from 1970. Secluded and peaceful. The children are already in bed, the wind accumulates and is accompanied by a torrential rain. The phone starts to play, play, and play. The nanny is soon in a frenetic mode of survival afraid of the frightening stranger on the other side of the phone. <br /> <br /> Belle is great as the innocent, intelligent and strong teen nanny. The stranger's voice on the phone is Lance Henriksen's, while the strange physicist is played by Tommy Flanagan. Also featured are Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. Many compliments to James Dooley for the original and atmospheric music.
