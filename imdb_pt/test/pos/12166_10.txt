This little summary absolutely fascinates me. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have seen so far is a bit of the work of Sam Brakhage, the creator of Dog Star Man. However, where Brakhage is trying to weaken "making us learn to see again" and provide us with an affront to headache inducing bright colors and flashes (which I still create and fully embrace as high art ...), this film I would characterize as very relaxing and mesmerizing. Man Ray's general use of rotating objects / camera does not create so much sensation of dizziness, but a warm flow of senses, blending and accompanying the gravity of the moving world around us. <br /> <br /> An interesting concept of this very short work is that as they go forward, objects become more and more recognizable until we end up in a bare torso (of which I feel the breasts are less feminine and well rounded ones that I've ever seen). The circles and spirals of shadow and light over his torso make him an object of surreal beauty, something that you could hang on your wall and plunge forever. It is because of this and other images in this film that I had to watch it several times (possibly a total of seven times) just because it fascinates me completely. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
