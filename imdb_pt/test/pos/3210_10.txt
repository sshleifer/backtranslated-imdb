This show is really great. It is funny. It is funny. It's great to act and write. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. Dialogues are really funny and well represented. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have great chemistry. You truly believe they are mother and daughter. This show really did show that mother-daughter relationships do not really have to be just mother and daughter, they may be best friends, but at the same time it shows that it's really hard being a mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily. Just watch this program which I highly recommend. It's great and definitely the best show in the air. Season 7 stars Tuesday, September 26, 2006, 8/7c in the new The CW
