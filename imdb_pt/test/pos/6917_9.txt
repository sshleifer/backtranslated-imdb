The original story and compelling characters had a great time partying for a teenage party movie (2 times). I loved it, it was fun and it moved quickly, without boring scenes. It is violent and has a bit of language (although most of it is covered up). It's a great movie. David Strickland was a great actor. Ron Eldard did a wonderful job. I watch with the girls every time.
