Where do I start? Let me say that after watching the whole movie and the special features of the DVD, my wife and I watched the whole movie again with the director's comment running. I do not remember having endured more than 7 minutes of such comment for a movie. Worth listening to. <br /> <br /> I'm not a southern kid, but I spent some time in Memphis a long time ago and I have an idea of ​​the area. This movie almost smells like the South, it's so real. Samuel Jackson, one of my favorite actors of all time, is magnificent as the emotionally inclined Lazarus, and Christina Ricci gives the performance of a life as Rae, a woman who was seriously injured during her brief life. I've always enjoyed Ricci's work, but in this performance she's giving 137% of herself with every second on the screen. Awards and small statues are not enough to reward her for what she puts before the audience of this film. <br /> <br /> There are other places where you can read the essence of the story, so I'm just commenting on the work. I had heard the name Justin Timberlake before seeing "BSM" but had no idea how he was, or even why he was famous. Beating my head at age 60, I'm out of your target audience, to say the least. After seeing this movie I will recognize it. He can take action! It gives a substantial and compelling performance as the loving twin soul of the county slut. <br /> <br /> The director is from Memphis, and shows reverence for his home region. He is also an excellent storyteller. <br /> <br /> I need to mention the song. I love Blues, and the Black Snake Moan soundtrack is a real feast for a blues fan. <br /> <br /> I'm writing less coherently than usual, because my enthusiasm for this film is surpassing my sentence structure. Watch this movie, and I mean now.
