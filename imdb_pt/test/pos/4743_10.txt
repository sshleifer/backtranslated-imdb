Things that are just now "news" were taken as a given in this shocking documentary. I fear that as the investigation proceeds, the producers of this film will be acquitted. <br /> <br /> Producers show us the Davidians, the government agents, the researchers, with all their faults and all of their humanity. Nothing that any reviewer could say could address the impact of watching and listening for himself. Pieces of evidence - Congressional testimony, 911 tapes, news footage, expert commentary, interviews, photos and home videos - are perfectly intertwined and tell a disturbing story. <br /> <br /> Do not wait. Watch this movie and tell your friends.
