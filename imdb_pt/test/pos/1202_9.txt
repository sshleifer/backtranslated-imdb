The 1979 HAIR musical movie was loosely based on the infamous 1960s Broadway musical that became famous because of its infamous nudity scene. The stage musical is not much more than a group of skits attached to some fun musical numbers; however, for filmmaker Milos Foreman (who won an Oscar for directing One Nine of the Cuckoo's Nest) and the writers took the basic premise of the piece and the track and built a real story to make the program more "easy to use". the big screen. In the film, naive farmboy Claude Hooper Buchowski (John Savage) is about to go to the army and decides to spend a few days in New York, where he meets a group of older hippies (Treat Williams, Dorsey Wright, Annie Golden, Don Dacus) that involve him in a group of crazy misadventures, including the quest for a society snobbish girl (Beverly D'Angelo). The story splits into a series of vignettes ranging from ridiculous to sublime, but everything is beautifully photographed with clever use of New York locations and imaginatively staged musical numbers (choreographed prominently by the legendary Twyla Tharp). Treat Williams illuminates the screen as Berger, the unconventional and free-spirited hippie who does his best to make Claude come loose and is accompanied by the scene of Savage as Claude, who brings a lovely sweetness to the role of Claude. Annie Golden is a charming as Jeannie, the pregnant hippie who is pregnant with Wright or Dacus, does not know which is the father and does not seem to care. There is an exceptional musical number after another here ... "Aquarius" is a tour of Central Park, which includes dancing horses ... Treat Williams interrupts a fancy dinner in "I Got Life" ... "Black Boys / White Boys "features the late Nell Carter and Ellen Foley extolling the ethnic virtues of men and" Easy to Be Hard "is a powerful rendering of one of the show's best songs by the original cast member Cheryl Barnes, who plays the ex-girlfriend and mother of Wright from his son. This is a journey of psychedelic sung and danced acid from a movie that must be seen and, once seen, will initiate multiple views, as this dazzler has much to offer to capture everything in one view.
