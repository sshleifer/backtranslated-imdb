Somewhere in IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all time (Spielberg, Copolla and others are named there). The biggest argument was around Spielberg and whether or not he is a great director. The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master technician, most of his films have no depth. Saving Ryan is really excellent from a technical point of view, but his message is monotonous and although it's a lot of fun, it does not make you think about anything. AN is the best film I've ever seen because it combines great footage with a profound philosophical perspective on so many things, starting with war in general, clash of civilizations, soldier status in times of war (a soldier is a hero or a killer "Brando says it's neither, the French lady says he's both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they try to discuss whether these points are true or false. But a great film, and a great work of art in general, should unleash arguments, not to solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe he is not, no one holds the truth anyway. You can watch this movie for its outward beauty, incredible scenes, great acting quotes and memorable and you will be totally satisfied. But what really makes this film a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can not fail to make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary. Both Copolla and Moore address similar issues, but while Copolla presents issues from an objective point of view, Moore takes a very partisan stance that really compromises the whole point of view. a documentary ... It's really a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 9/11 has won a prestigious award like Cannes. But anyway, if you want to start understanding a little bit about the Vietnam War, the Iraq War, the Second World War and any war in general, you should definitely see this movie, not the other ...
