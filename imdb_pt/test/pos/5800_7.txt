Captain and Tennille have released a very good 3 DVDs package with minimal editing. Unlike most variety releases, these shows have not been cut into pieces. The musical and dance numbers are included in the skits, as well as in the first transmission. I suspect that some musical numbers on the DVD may have been edited in programs where they did not originally appear, but could not verify this suspicion. I noticed some inconsistencies between what's on the DVD and the program information I found on the net. I was unable to verify that the network information is inaccurate or the musical presentations have been edited in the DVD programs. Whatever the truth, I am very grateful for the efforts made by the producer. I would like every variety show launched to show the same respect for the format. I think about half of the programs are included. I believe they ran into rights issues at shows that were not included. I hope these issues can be resolved and a Volume 2 can be released sometime in the future. There are some individual music videos along with a dance rehearsal between extras. I recommend this DVD to any C & T fan.
