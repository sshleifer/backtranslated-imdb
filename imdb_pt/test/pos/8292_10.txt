I loved this movie for a long time. I had not seen this for some time, so I checked again and really found it even more enjoyable now. I loved the Chipmunks cartoon when I was young, so naturally I loved 'The Chipmunk Adventure'. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not think of a better plot for this movie. Not very creative, but I've always wanted to travel the world, so I have a lot of fun watching while my desire to travel grows even more. The part with Elenore singing for the little penguin always makes me cry ... <br /> <br /> 'The squirrel's adventure' will remain my favorite forever, I'm sure. I guess it's because I saw it when I was so young. I do not think it would make a big impact on someone older to see this for the first time. (Unless, of course, they have a young heart)
