I think the Mario Van Peebles film, Posse, is a very important film. It's a great movie entry point to one side of the story that many are not aware of. This is a story of the first black settlers, cowboy boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a gold deposit. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black and infant settlers is explored in this excellent cast including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios' father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane. <br /> <br /> Peeples struggled to use as many notable black actors (and some not so remarkable) as possible :) Maybe many, some notable people (Issac Hayes, Pamela Grier) are just a scene soon, others briefly as Tone Loc. The sentiment and efforts of Peebles' efforts to expose these actors will be understood by some. The big cast (one made for any director) works well and does a good job of telling the story in the classic western "revenge and fight against justice". <br /> <br /> Most notable was the veteran's wonderful narrative role. actor Woody Strode (from Once Upon A Time In The West), who had a life of his own as a barrier separator, within the context of an earlier yet unfinished era, has vanished from memory. No other actor could have done better. Read the mini bio on Woody Strode here as a primer: http://imdb.com/name/nm0834754/bio <br /> <br /> The movie does a good job of balancing the action with a bit of sarcastic humor . The dialogue was great if a bit contemporary! And, as others have already mentioned, the profanation was not correct at that time. The sex scene was a little too much - not really necessary. There are some historical inaccuracies, such as the apparent electronic trademark of cattle etc. But Posse is a good effort to open the door to more historical and creative works that reflect other untold stories and events. The actual photos of real cowboys on the final credits was very nice touch.
