As I said in another review, this is one of the best movies for teenagers of all time, and one of my personal favorites. for me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time. second only to the breakfast club. the last American virgin is also perhaps the most honest teen movie of all time. is underestimated and practically a movie unknown to many people. It comes on TBS maybe once a year, but sometimes more. the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with some honest scenes. then the second half is pure and honest and, most of the time, serious. with only a few comic strips. In my opinion, this is the best soundtrack of all time. I've never heard so many good songs in a movie before. There are four love songs in this movie that I think are some of the best love songs ever. the movie is about a pizzeria called Gary who is a virgin. He is in high school and has a couple of best friends. his two friends are teenagers with sexual sarcasm. the first half of the movie is almost sexual misadventures. That's really funny. Gary is the biggest fan of the new girl in school. He later discovers that his best friend is dating her. he also cheats on the side. You can feel the love that Gary has for this girl. you can feel even more in the second half. Gary's friend ends up being an idiot. but your other friend is pretty cool. the movie shows how people can be more. you can relate to a lot of this movie. the plot sounds like her typical teen sex comedy. but it is much more than that. It's a very honest movie. It's also very 80ish that I love. if you love the 80's or grew up in the 80's, rent this movie. but there may be some people who do not like the 80's, but may still like this movie. I saw this movie for the first time in 1987, I think. It's a lot of fun and very funny. combines very exciting moments with very funny moments. is an underrated gem! I have the movie. I love it! I give the last American virgin *** 1/2 ****
