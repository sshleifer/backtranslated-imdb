Having finally attained this "masterpiece," it seems to me that it must have seemed terribly intelligent in its day. It is French, artistic, subjugated to the point of agony and finally discouraged. But seen from the point of view of 37 years in the future, it is also a bit empty, pretentious and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Others summed up the story, but I do not think anyone has pointed out the dramatic flaw. in the heart of this movie: the main characters Corey and Vogel really do not deserve what they get. They play according to the code, never harm those who did not ask for it, and show a lot of courage and initiative. In addition, Corey in particular is victimized by his "friend" of the former thug who stole his girl and repeatedly tries to kill him, apparently only because he (Corey) dared to "borrow" a few thousand francs. These are guys who really should have a break! Instead, things go much worse for them than they really need, within the logic of history. <br /> <br /> We could argue that this is the main point: that real villains are never caught; that they conspire with the police when necessary, sell their friends and always go out on top. But this is not shown either. Corey's old gangster friend is not shown in collusion with the police. Nor is he shown rejoicing over his victory. In fact, after materializing several times when he is needed, he is far from seen in conclusion, leaving a dramatic tension (his rivalry with Corey) totally unsolvable! <br /> <br /> However, I would say that this movie is worth seeing for its beautiful photography, its slow and deliberate rhythm, its large, unimpressive performances, its elaborate Heistian sequence and its encapsulation of the art film style of the late 60's.
