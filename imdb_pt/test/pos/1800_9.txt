This is a good film that is defective in many ways with low output. Martha Coolidge said she only had $ 350,000 to work with. This is a movie I loved growing up in the Midwest. I remember friends and I having the nostalgic trip in this movie 10 years ago. Great things about this movie .... Great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director. Bad points of this film .... To small of a budget asking for much improvisation. If Martha Coolidge had received more money and time in this film, the results would be even better. They should have taken the story of a potential of 20 years and not of a high school point of 15 to 17 years. Most of the actors were in their first 20 years trying to play from 15 to 17 years .... (come on) The music is extremely memorable and the two soundtracks are played all the time in my car. The best scenes in this movie happen in Hollywood clubs decadent by the character of Nicolas Cage. I gave this movie a high rating of 9/10 for five reasons. Improvisation of Nicholas Cage at the place of performance; The camera work and the angles are excellent given the budget they had and only being able to have a shot of each scene; The sytles, music and language are captured perfectly and forever; Once again the music is incredible and carries the story throughout scene the scene; And finally ... Martha Coolidge could turn a weak script, unknown actors and a very low budget, and 20 days of filming the entire movie in such a good and memorable film is amazing!
