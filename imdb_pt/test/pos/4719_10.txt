"Beyond Rangoon" is simply wonderful. From the traumatic opening to the uplifting end, you'll be amazed at how well set up this movie is. Patricia Arquette surprisingly portrays Laura Bowman, who we meet as a shutdown and we stop young discouraged, unable to cope with their pain by the loss of her husband and son. Throughout the film, while she is stuck in Burma, witnesses the massacre and the Democratic agitation in the capital of Rangoon, runs away for her life and saves the life of her tour guide (U Aung Ko), she is regaining her will. to live. This may seem artificial or heavy: it is not. John Boorman, a master of spiritual and emotional conflicts, paints the film with broad strokes and often uses symbolism to capture Laura's emotional state and physical condition. Patricia Arquette, as usual, gives a wonderfully convincing and compelling performance as the emotionally wounded Laura. What Arquette does surprisingly, in whatever role she plays, is to give us a window into the heart of the character without words. Every time she is introduced in the movie, the audience gets insight into her character. She does not have to speak to convey emotions or be exaggerated. Some critics criticized Arquette's performance in the film when it was released on August 25, 1995, considering it was "boring" or "bland" on paper. I found his characterization dead, staying well away from the melodramas that are usually part of an actor's performance when a personal tragedy occurs. She is in shock and is reserved about her feelings: this is as normal as shouting at those around her. I hope Warner Brothers will release this title on DVD very soon. With Arquette's extremely successful drama, NBC's "Medium," bringing it to family name status, not to mention an Emmy win and now an indication for 2007, it would be in the studio's interest to do so. I hope there are extras, with the alternate ending. Do not go through this movie. It is one that you certainly will not forget after seeing.
