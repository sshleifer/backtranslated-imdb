I am surprised how a notorious filmmaker for his left-wing political fervor could make such an image subtle and not hypocritical. If you are for capital punishment, you will still be up for it after seeing this. If you are against the death penalty, you will still be against it. But whatever your position, this movie will, at the very least, make you reflect on why you feel that way. There is not a fake note in the movie.
