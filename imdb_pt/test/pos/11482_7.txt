It is important and fair to remember that, at the time this short was produced, there was a state of war between the United States and the Empire of Japan. Add to this the enormous ill will created by the beginning of the war, as well as the Death of Bataan and other incidents and the only surprising thing about it, and others, was that there were no more of them. One other thing: my only problem with this is that it seems to try to be funny, but it's not. I'm not sure someone connected to him actually tried to make the jokes work, or even care. It would have been much better if they had done what Disney did with Education For Death and were totally serious. But this short takes a bad rap and should not be judged out of context. Times were different and that is an important consideration. Anyone spending energy trying to save the world from a sixty-year-old cartoon needs to take a step back. Like me, wasting energy defending that same cartoon. This should be available to stakeholders, even if it is not in widespread circulation. Not a good cartoon, but sometimes life is not cool.
