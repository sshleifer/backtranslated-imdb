Someone on these councils has established that the whole thing is being dreamed by the protagonist's best friend, albeit a friend he has not seen for 20 years. I am reluctant to ignore this, but this raises some viable questions. Why a phone engineer - or a shoe salesman or butcher - wants to create a mythical world and wrap it around a friend who fills him in the process with a set of equally mythical characters. With a good imagination the friend should be writing not Dreaming. Dream or not SOMEONE, and the obvious candidate is the director Paolo Sorrentino, created a very watchable world in which Tony Servillo transforms the stillness into Fine Arts. We are invited to believe that the forty-something Titta La Girolomo (Servillo) 'disturbed' the Mafia a few years before we found him and, as penance, he is a virtual prisoner in a small Swiss hotel, from which he drives weekly to a local bank . with a suitcase containing nine thousand large sheets of used notes. In addition to this weekly trip, he is free to do what he likes and what he likes to do is smoke, play cards with a cheating man and a wife who remembers her husband how much they fell socially and ignore Olivia's friendly openings . Magnani, who spent two years trying to get a smile and / or a 'good night' for him. For reasons better known and inconsistent with a man who has no interest in anything or anyone, Servillo spends a certain amount of time each day applying a stethoscope on the wall of his bedroom and listening to his father's private conversations. playing partners. Eventually he responds to Magnani - he has to do this or they would not be movies. This is Plot 6f: the one about Destry, who never uses a weapon, or Sean (Duke Wayne), the "Quiet Man" who refuses to stand up for provocation and fight until the mandatory scene where the weapon is tied and the fists but rather than settle for a polite stai oggi, he removes 100,000 of the suitcase and buys a car for her. The final inconsistency occurs when Magnani says she will pick it up the next day at 4 pm in her car and they will drive to the mountains to celebrate her birthday. We have established that she lives locally, so because she is seen driving from somewhere far away, ignoring a police barrier to get off the road and knock down the car, no one knows. These inconsistencies aside continue to be an excellent piece of filmmaking with excellent lead performance and excellent support.
