I love pop culture, but I was a little apprehensive when I heard about it. So, I saw an episode, and I love it! I was a bit annoyed when I discovered that Christopher Eccelson would no longer be representing Doctor Who. He was probably the best they had. It fits the character very well. It's sad to see you go. I really do not think the new guy will take the doctor away as well as Eccelson. <br /> <br /> I think everyone can ignore the effects of cheese on some points and creatures, like the Dirks. Stories and characters can more than make up for it. I am currently waiting for the second season and I will review this too, in case, for any reason, the quality drops. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think everyone should try to watch an episode. I did, and I have loved since. Well written, well cast and well produced, this show is worth the time to watch. Doctor Who gets a 10/10
