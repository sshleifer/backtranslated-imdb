I actually found out about Favela Rising through IMDb's site. I have a particular interest in Afro-Brazilian culture and films. Favela Rising is one of those jewels that gives a new meaning to human transformation. Wonderfully documented and filmed by Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary, this is the story of Anderson Sa, a former drug dealer from Rio de Janeiro, who after the death of family and friends becomes a Christ, Malcolm X and Ghandi, all together. Sa has formed AfroReggae, a grassroots cultural movement that uses Afro-Brazilian hiphop, capoeira and other art forms to turn desperate and often irritated youth into vibrant, viable, and caring individuals. <BR> <BR> Some years ago I remember going to a City of God exhibit and leaving the theater completely asleep. The images were dark and impressive and you could not take your eyes off the screen. I remember how some situations were lost in the favelas and how society was decadent due to the negligence of governments. Because drug dealing was a way of life, how indifferent were the citizens of the favelas, because death was an everyday occurrence. As City Of God, Anderson Sa talks about how slum people were also desensitized. He talks about police corruption, and how communities were so immobilized by drugs and gangs that you could not visit family members in other slums that you had to meet in a neutral location. Unlike Anderson Sa's popular movement, AfroReggae provides solutions to anger, lack of hope. <br /> <br /> There was a part in the documentary in which Anderson, in the spirit of a preacher, approached some young people and asked them to participate. AfroReggae. These tired young men were so marked by everyday survival and violence. Their models were drug dealers and that's what they aspired to be. Anderson then said that traffickers do not live long. There was reluctance, of course, but five months later he got some of the young people joining AfroReggae. <br /> <br /> The visuals of Favela Rising are incredible. It's clear to me that Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary are not just great storytellers but visual artists as well. This is a must-see documentary! There are some truly magical and transformative moments in this documentary. I do not want to ruin them for you. I want you to see for yourself. Please tell your friends, academics, youth counselors, family members about this wonderful film. It will make you worry about the world and our children. <br /> <br /> I would give eleven stars!
