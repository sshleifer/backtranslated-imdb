I loved this movie and I never knew it was that old man who left the day I was born and now I'm 19 I still love this movie especially the songs like "My Mother" and "Boys and Girls of Rock N Roll" and I remember as a child I believe I was 5 n my sister was 6 and my cousin (boy) was 6 we used to pretend to be the characters in the movie I was Eloner and Janette and my sister was Britany and my cousin was Alvin Simon and Theodore those were good times and I miss it and having this movie reminds me of the good times since my cousin is old for these things and me too and my sister let's not forget the squirrel and I still remember the songs and the words of color, although I have not seen this movie for 12 years, but now I'm starting to love it again.
