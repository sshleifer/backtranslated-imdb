Film historians have said a great deal about ancient epics that have been in the interest of many directors since the beginning of cinema. The pioneers of such particularly biblical epics were D.W Griffith with his "mother of all epics" INTOLERANCE (1916), and Cecil B DeMille with his flair for magnificent spectacles, costumes and luxurious scenes. Who can forget his TEN COMMANDMENTS (1923, 1956) or THE SIGN OF THE CROSS (1932)? However, here comes another epic, made in the 1950s, directed by Michael Curtiz, and based on the novel by Mika Waltari, "The Egyptian." Michael Curtiz, already famous for his great classic CASABLANCA (1941), can beautifully adjust his film to audiences of the time to engage the most important ideas and facts of the thick novel and to recreate the lifestyle of the Egyptians who lived in one of the periods most incredible, in the reign of Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> The first and most important fact for me in this film is the psychological development of the protagonist Edmund Purdom plays. Sinuhe, having been raised in a simple family by his adoptive parents, becomes a physician. All his life, he never stops asking a question "why?" and looking for the answer. The seductive love he meets in a courtesan Nefer (Bella Darvi) leads to financial and spiritual disaster. He has to repair the mistakes by working hard at the House of Death and start building his reputation out of nowhere. First, he thinks the only cure is revenge. However, in the long run, he realizes that "eye for an eye" is no solution. Finally, what is before him in very strange circumstances is the temptation to be a pharaoh. However, there is a time when he finds the answer to his questions that touched him throughout his life ... The story of the main character, though based on the book, is so psychologically interesting that every open-minded person should consider this aspect in the book. movie. The psychological struggle of the main character is heightened by the times in which he lived, times in which, probably for the first time, the power of the sword collided with the power of thought. <br /> <br /> Curtiz's film also retains a rule that all the films of his era maintained: great castings and luxurious productions. There are mainly British actors and actresses who perform very well. How can you not mention the mainstay of the old epic, Victor Mature. This time he is not Demetrius, Hannibal or Samson, but Horemheb - a fighter, a lover, finally a pharaoh. Jean Simmons appears in a very delicate role of Merit, a woman who loved Sinuhe all her life, but it was already too late when he realized it. Peter Ustinov, probably most famous for his gorgeous performance as Nero in QUO VADIS? three years ago, does a great job as Kaptah, Sinuhe's friend. The film's royalty is also played by two great actors, Gene Tierney and Michael Wilding. Tierney is excellent as the cold, desirous of being able Baketamon, Pharaoh's sister. Wilding gives a wonderful performance as "insane" Akhnaton. When I was in the Louvre in Paris and saw the original face of Akhnaton carved in stone, he looked very much the same as the actor in the film. Bella Darvi, an actress born in Poland, is memorable as a courtesan Nefer. And there is another actress who appears only in one scene but who is hard to forget, Judith Evelyn as Taia, Pharaoh's mother. That voice, those eyes! <br /> <br /> The scenarios are magnificent. The director recreated the most likely image of the open-air temple of Aaton, the god the Egyptians worshiped in the reign of Amenhotep IV. I also loved the scene of Pharaoh's first entrance. What a glorious picture that lasts forever in someone's memory !!! However, there is also one aspect that I would like to draw to the attention of all people interested in watching the film. The Egyptian is similar to other epics in many ways, but also stands out as a unique film. There are very few films that make such wonderful use of different curiosities as in ancient times. There is a mention of iron first used by the Hetitas. It is also the only film about ancient Egypt that speaks openly about the magnificent healing abilities of the Egyptians. He memorably shows the contrasts of lifestyles, particularly the time of the death of a slave to whom no one cares followed by the announcement and consequently the widespread mourning after the death of the pharaoh. Finally, "The Egyptian" shows a historical fact: there were other nations except the Jews (before Christ), where the spirit of God shone in some human hearts. However, the only difference was that it did not survive as long as the Jews, because it did not have a strong foundation. The death scene of Akhnaton gives you so many biblical and Christian values ​​that you may think you are watching a religious film. All things considered, I highly recommend Michael Curtiz's movie. It is a great production on several levels: an entertainment for epic fans, an admiration of wonderful performances for movie fans, a soul feast for spiritual people. Finally, it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things that happened thirteen centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ.
