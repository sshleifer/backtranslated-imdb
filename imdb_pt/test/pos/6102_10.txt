I just watched this movie on TV and it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I had just planned to see while doing some work, however I ended up seeing the whole movie without work because it was so good! <br /> <br /> The actors do not know very well, but the plot makes up for it. the fact that the actors are less known only makes it more believable that events can occur. I did not feel inclined towards a character, since I have no judgment on character types, since I've never seen any of the actors in a movie before it made it even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I would recommend watching this.
