I can not say that this was not well done. At a recent film festival, the director admitted that some scenes had 30 takes. And there is not the slightest indication that he did not get exactly what he wanted. But this is a strangely non-Hispanic movie, just as West Side Story was many years ago. Both leaders, a brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. The scenery, a kind of underground car repair district in Queens, is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission alone. But there is something unsatisfying about the key issue of the film, namely, what the sister feels she needs to do to survive. I can understand the reaction of the brother, but it seems too easy for me. The movie seems to suggest that people like these do not need our help, who will find a way to survive without the usual support systems. I would not encourage anyone to believe that. There would be much more resistance to the choices made here than those described. Also, as entertainment, it works well. As a precise representation of a culture, not so well, I think.
