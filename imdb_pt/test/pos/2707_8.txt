Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about the complex life of singer Karen Carpenter. Although it fails to provide accurate facts and details. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a good election. She is a good actress, but plays a very naive and half-witted Karing Carpenter. I think the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality. <br /> <br /> The role of Louise Fletcher as Agnes Carpenter is fantastic, she does a great job as Karen's mother. <br /> <br /> There are great songs that could have been included. on a soundtrack album. Unfortunately they were not, although this movie was at the top of the rankings in the US and several other countries.
