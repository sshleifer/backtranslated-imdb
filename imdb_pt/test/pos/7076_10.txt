After renting One True Thing the other night, I learned to respect my family and not give them their health as a guarantee. I've never seen such a real picture of a cancer screen victim as Meryl delivered. She deserves an Oscar nomination, but she has some tough competitors in the race. All I can say is beautiful film, great acting from Streep and Zellwegger. Meryl Streep has revealed her true skill in this great movie!
