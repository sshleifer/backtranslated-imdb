Victor Sjöström was the master of this film, having starred, directed and even written the script! This is amazing. While few today have any idea who Sjöström was, he may be familiar with Ingmar Bergman's fans as the star of Bergman's most acclaimed films, WILD STRAWBERRIES. <br /> <br /> As far as this movie is concerned, it's a very mixed movie. Handbag. On the one hand, you have to respect because, for 1921, it is a very good film. The idea of ​​the Grim Reaper sitting with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is quite imaginative. In addition, the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is quite convincing and, technically speaking, this is a well worked film. On the other hand, it's an incredibly dated and lazy movie - more like something you'd expect to be shown in Sunday School, rather than in a theater of honest goodness. In addition, some elements of the story simply do not make sense. Instead of looking dedicated or good, the dying Salvation Army worker looks like a sap - a very sad and confused sap. Why is she "in love" with this man? Am I missing something? <br /> <br /> So, my recommendation is that if you're madly in love with silences (like me), then, by all means, watch. But, if you're not a silent fan, this movie may do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so melodramatic and dated.
