This film was one of those movies that has your heart beating all the time. As always Damian Chapa is brilliant, his in. Screenplay is as powerful as any Hollywood actor. The cast of this movie is perfect. Each character made the story more complete. The photograph was captivating and lifted the film. I was totally stuck to the screen and could not stop watching, no there was how to prepare for the popcorn or anything else. This movie is one of the best of the year, maybe even the best. Definitely rent this movie, I recommend this movie if you want to see great filming or just for pure entertainment.
