"Just before dawn" is one of the best horror films. It's very realistic and atmospheric. It reminds me of Tobe Hooper`s "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Liberation". Deborah Benson very good plays the heroine and director Jeff Lieberman created very scary and dark movie. "Just before dawn" is beautifully photographed and soundtrack is very disturbing. I've never liked horror movies or gore except with this one. Very impressive and convincing film (at least for me)
