Andaz Apna Apna is a film that I value and its only film, I do not care to see at any time ... well almost at any time! This movie is simply wonderful and, according to me, it's the funniest movie I've ever seen! And yes, I put on Hera Pheri ... reason? Hera Pheri has scenes that you will watch, but Andaz Apna Apna? It's not possible! Simply because every scene is a scene you have to observe! Aamir & Salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes, but I'll put the characters in order of favoritism: Rank # 1. Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor's best performance to date and yes, this happened before the casting sofa): Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to the well-reputed family of Mogambo (Mr. India fame). Master of the Crime Gogo is actually the nephew of Mogambo, but for Mogambo, he is more than a charming, responsible, handsome and charismatic son. Gogo makes the biggest mistake of his life by lending 36,000 rupees to Texas (which, as Balla had said, "A Fraud and a Fraud!"). Now, Gogo's only goal is to recover what is his, and on his journey to recover his lost money, Gogo realizes that there are more than 36,000 that he needs to achieve and thus Gogo's fight against the sinful world begins. Rank # 2. Tile (Hoon Main Tile, Mark Idhar Hai!): Tile is an evil character who is the twin of Ram Gopal Bajaj. Originally called Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Teja decides to change his name to suit his personality. Teja, as a child, always envied his brother and one day, things got worse when his father gave all his wealth to Ram Bajaj. Teja decided to kill his father, but in the darkness of the night, instead killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Raveena's father), although Teja did not regret his actions. The only mission of the Teja, now, is to recover its property and to begin its own Farm of Poultry and Bakeries. Teja also needs to repay the loan to Gogo (but has no intention of doing so). In order to achieve his evil goals, Teja employs two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who is very good at pointing) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, clone and son of Ajit ... who is a very smart boy!) <Br / > Rank # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): Want to marry rich heiress Raveena, then he sells his father's cheap bar and goes to Mumbai. To love, it's okay to take care of the big deal that Raveena's father will deliver him after the wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and move to London if necessary. Position # 4 Prem (Salman Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way Amar tries to take advantage of him in a friend's mask is tragic. <br /> <br /> I've won. Do not reveal more characters because Jesus Christ! I would not stop typing! The film is absolutely stunning! Go and get the DVD now and beware of those cheap VCDs, since they have omitted many good scenes from the movie. <br /> <br /> The background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final found between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (watch out for it), appears at the climax. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teaches us a lot about life, values ​​and ethics. This teaches us about bravery (why else would Amar ask Prem to stay back when they met the kidnapper, though Prem was complaining that he had to go to the bathroom?). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes in which Salman is targeted by Aamir and gets overdose of stomach pills, the part in which Teja reveals his sad feelings as to why he could not go to London and the part where Gogo is stuck at the end, without even recovering his 36,000. Andaz Apna Apna is generally a complete package .... sit back and enjoy the ride! I bet there will be a second ride after that ... and then a third! <br /> <br /> The film was considered a failure at that time and I bet no one liked it but squeeze the faces! This movie is a great success! Even if you do not have enough people coming to theaters, the movie is one of the best-selling homemade DVDs and one of the movies most often on most channels, so producers laughed a lot to the banks a long time ago!
