A beautiful film about the silent film arrival in China. SHADOW MAGIC cleverly combines a love story with the drama of cultural shock between the ancient traditions of China and modern Western culture in film form. An incredible first film by Chinese director Ann Hu. If I correctly understood Hu's comments at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival, this film was produced as an American film co-funded by the Chinese government and filmed in China. SHADOW MAGIC reminds me of movies like IL POSTINO and CINEMA PARADISO - not necessarily in theme or plot, but it has a similar feel.
