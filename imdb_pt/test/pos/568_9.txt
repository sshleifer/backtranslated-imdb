I just watched the movie through Netflix. I was intrigued by how the movie was described, but in the end it was better. I was moved in many different directions while watching this movie. I was full of heartache, hatred, anger, bitterness, pain and finally relief. Looking at the accused young man would break his heart and convince you that they had the wrong person. The presumption of the police, do you believe, because, just as Rodney King Beating brought to light, the brutality of the police, this film brings the total lack of moral fiber in these policemen. And the fact that they beat this kid and got away with it, only makes him more angry. <br /> <br /> But, I have to tell you, I fell in love with the lawyer, Mc Guinness. One of my favorite phrases when he was telling us what a police hole was ... The policeman told him to continue sucking that cancer stick. Mc Guinness told the police officer ... 'I always have a cigarette before sex ...' I was letting him know I was going to ruin him '<br /> <br /> I have a new respect for some of the laws in this country.
