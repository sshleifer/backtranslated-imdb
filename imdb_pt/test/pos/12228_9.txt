I came across this movie while the canal surfed one day; and I decided to give it a try. To my surprise, I enjoyed this darkhorse movie. I felt a genuine chemistry between Challen Cates and Malcolm-Jamal Warner. It was such a light and warm film that when it was over I felt optimistic. Of course, this movie was predictable right from the start, but I get high marks for the way it made me feel when it was over. I must admit I've never seen Challen Cates before, but I feel she can definitely take action. When you combine his good acting with his fluffy face and attractive figure. It has the ingredients of at least becoming a well known star.
