Fun bad movie that should amuse. One of the last performances by Joan Crawford as the successful editor directed against all those beautiful and eager young beavers fresh out of the elite Seven Sisters Colleges. Great atmosphere in the 50's of New York. Wonderful costumes and period hairstyles. Fantastic art direction. Treat story, but rousting tearjerker. Interesting cameo by Robert Evans as a rich cad.
