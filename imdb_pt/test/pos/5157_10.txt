Smaller spoilers will follow. <br /> <br /> This movie is even stranger and unconventional than "second-floor music". There is no main character that we follow around. There is no "plot" in the conventional way. There is no emphasis on a happy ending. There is crowdpleasing. In other words, Roy Andersson is back with a vengeance. Instead of resorting to convention and fixed formula, Roy Andersson focuses his film around an idea. I will not get into what this idea is, but even if you do not "get it" I promise you'll see the biggest visual depth ever put into the movies. The majestic scenes of "songs" pale in comparison here. A work of visual splendor. <br /> <br /> So be kind to your fellow men, because after all "we are the living", and only you and I have the power to change our lives. That's at least what I thought when I saw the final scene of the movie, with the inhuman planes of bombing sweeping the city in the film to take our lives. <br /> <br /> And of course, do not forget to watch this movie when it gets close to you. This is one of those movies that really has the power to make you a better person, like Sica's "Bicycle Thieves". A very warm and humanistic film.
