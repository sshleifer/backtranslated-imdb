an incredible feat for the science fiction movie film that far outweighs many of the previous efforts they've made. Bruce Campbell is in excellent shape as a potential investor who gets caught up in a bizarre experiment led by a delirious teacher, Stacey Keach, and his middle-aged help, Ted Raimi. The movie is pure gold film and it's great to see Keach and appear onscreen with Bruce, and the fact that much of the film works purely with Bruce's comedy is what makes him hilarious, and makes me the Why is not this guy commanding more of his scripts? It really is a sick world. Definitely worth watching.
