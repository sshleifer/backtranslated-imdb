Eric Bogosian's ability to roll character to character in this 'one man show' exhibits his true reach as a character actor. Each person has his own message to convey about truth, society, class, drugs, etc. This is an absolute must have for anyone who is a big fan of acting! His performance contains some of the most hilarious and real moments I've ever experienced as an audience.
