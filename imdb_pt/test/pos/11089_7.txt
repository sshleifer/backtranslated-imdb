Director John Schlesinger's tense, frantic film tells the true story of Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee, two young men who sold US government secrets to the Soviet Union in the early 1970s. Timothy Hutton plays Christopher Boyce very competently. He is a very disillusioned young man with the covert CIA activities in Australia allied. Sean Penn, like the doped Dr. Andrew Daulton Lee, is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Schlesinger's competent and professional leadership, along with a very good performance, makes "The Hawk and the Snowman" a success. espionage thriller not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Tuesday, February 4, 1992 - Video
