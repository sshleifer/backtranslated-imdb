I was in the mood for a French movie and I saw it on Blockbuster. What a little gem turned out to be! I do not know how I lost Gregori Derangere all those years, but he's fantastic. Such innocence and grace! I love his face and the way he moves. Isabelle Adjani was hilarious - reminded me of Nicole Kidman's exaggerated performance at the Moulin Rouge. She looks the same as 20 years ago ... truly remarkable. Gerard Depardieu did not keep up so well, but his performance continues to amaze. He's perfect in this movie. Probably going to buy this, I liked it a lot. If you want to see another great French film, rent Joyeux Noel. Impressive.
