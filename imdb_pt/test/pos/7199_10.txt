This movie is the smartest comedy I've ever seen, many jokes are a parody of another movie (from star wars to dragon ball, power rangers, kung fu, etc.) or somehow related to the story of anything, the elevator), a lot of jokes are also related to the modern world and had fun because it was BC (Like the wheels of the cart spinning) Other jokes are simply absurd, but also hilarious (like the famous scene, with the dog running after the face Roman with the little music). In fact, in this movie they mix quite a lot of humor. I watched this movie 6 times and every time I watch I find other subtle jokes. (like the scene in which waldo is part of the Egyptian crowd). It's the funniest movie I look like, finally a loud, laughing comedy that does not include bathroom or sex humor. Numerobis is also what makes the film, everything that comes out of this guy's mouth is hilarious. This movie is almost perfect except for a few cliches, like the fact that Asterix takes his power back because he's kissed, that's just stupid. But overall a great movie !! 9.5 to 10
