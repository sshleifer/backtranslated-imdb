The marriage of a chic couple from New York to the child collapses when the wife wants to leave ("It took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door!", A neighbor tells us); the busy and distracted husband assumes the "motherly" responsibilities and approaches his son, but soon the wife returns. A highly manipulative image does not give us a very realistic family unit (with young Justin Henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep!), But the dynamics are intriguing and engaging, and director Robert Benton maintains the rhythm bursting with great intelligence, wonderful classical music, shrewd editing, and infallible bits of humor. Streep's character is designed to be a cold, self-centered witch, but I was ready to feel so much more for her than Benton probably wanted. Everything has to be painted in terms of black and white, good and bad, with Hoffman learning how much his wife had and having a second chance at being a good father. The film never fails in its preconceived way, and the very good acting almost saved, but I'm not sure where Benton was directing the film in the final act, and the final scene is very abrupt. *** in ****
