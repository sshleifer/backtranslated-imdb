What can I say about this band, I was addicted to 68, I was a ten year old kid, I grew up in the Blues despite my dad, so these guys from the Midlands came along, a fusion of Country Rock, Heavy Rock and Blues , I wish I could see them live in the early years, I was lucky enough to be there in 79 (Knebworth), which was the best show I've seen so far, I expect a full version of that August. the night will be more real soon. This CD gave me a chance to see the boys again and again, Song remains the same, but this CD reaches its climax. <br /> <br /> Long live the Zepp.
