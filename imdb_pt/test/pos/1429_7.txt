Proof that it is not necessary for a movie to have a story of many layers and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie. Even though history can be expanded in many directions, especially in a more sociological way (people crave for money), it seems to be perfect the way it is. Through many sudden changes it takes the viewer to the end without unnecessary complications and without letting the viewer take his eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> But the acting for me is not so good. With the exception of Lindsey McKeon, the others were medium or worse. In some scenes, they just lay empty in front of themselves. By exception of Lindsey, that was most convincing. It's a very simple movie to relax and enjoy. <br /> <br /> 7/10
