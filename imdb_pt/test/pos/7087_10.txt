Written by someone who's been there, you can tell, but only if you've been there. Excellent performances by Meryl Streep (of course!), Renee Zellweger and William Hurt. <br /> <br /> Many people have said that this is a dysfunctional family, I think every family is dysfunctional when they are facing this kind of torment. NOT being dysfunctional would be dysfunctional! You're losing your family as you know it, can anything be worse? People need to see this movie, so when they come across this nightmare, they may change the way they do it. Perhaps they see that the father is denying himself valuable time that he will never take a chance again. Maybe they realize how hard it is to die or see someone you love die for. They have not missed much of the nightmare, it's hard to forget.
