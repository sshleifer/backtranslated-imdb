I really enjoyed this movie ... but the ads I saw implied, and a comment posted actually said, that this movie "benefits from a light touch." This is very misleading to me. There is, in fact, a lot of humor: eccentric humor, non-subtle, sometimes somewhat distorted: the kind of humor I usually find very attractive. But most of the humor is the kind that seems to be conscious at all times of things that are deeply serious, deeply sensitive, and even deeply painful. The film interweaves themes of Past and Present, Perception and Truth, Memory and Activity, Life and Death. The entire film is permeated by the history of European anti-Semitism in general, and the Holocaust in particular. <br /> <br /> How can humor and horror be combined in the same movie? The review I saw suggested that humor is absurd. I do not think that's the case; at least not in common sense. Instead, I think this movie is in the tradition of much Jewish / Yiddish literature and theater. I do not intend to be some kind of expert in this area; but from what I've seen, humor is used in this cultural context, as well as a coping tool for the terribly tragic experiences of this people; and also Humor is used as a means of "recovering the Divine" for men and women who choose a path of Faith instead of a path of Despair or Absurdity. See "Fiddler on the Roof" for the humor used in both directions in this rich tradition. Elijah Wood (Jonathon) Wood wears horn-rimmed glasses that really make him look, well, weird: compare Sin City when he wore the same kind of glasses with creepy effect. In this movie, it's easy to see how glasses become a metaphor for your Search and for your Fighting Between Perception and Truth. Eugene Hutz (Young Alex) and Boris Lesking (Alex Old) are really wonderful. Jonathon and Young Alex are of the same generation, but they seem very, very different; and then discover that they are not so different, after all. And the way the Narrative's Narrative Voice gradually shifts from Jonathon to Alex Young ... as a journey of discovery for Jonathon becomes a discovery for both Young Alex and Old Alex ... for me it's a lot exciting <br /> <br /> There are wonderful scenes and panoramas of (I'm told) Prague and surroundings, representing Ukraine's history. Everything seems very authentic and seems to give a wonderful feeling of place; although I have never been myself to Ukraine and can hardly witness this firsthand experience. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're looking for light comedy, I would not recommend this movie at all. On the other hand, if you are interested in a wonderful, delicious and moving film, check out this wonderful film.
