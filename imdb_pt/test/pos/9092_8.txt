I intend to write a review of this movie for some time, but only now can I really lower my thoughts to reading others. <br /> <br /> I've never had the pleasure of seeing this. Big screen movie that is a shame, as it is often visually stunning, but I've reviewed it on video countless times over the years, enjoying it immensely every time. It's definitely on my personal favorite movie list, and for more than just starring Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon, two of my 'actors to watch'. <br /> <br /> Maybe I enjoy this film so much, because it attracts my taste a little out of tune in entertainment. I like my movies a little to the left of the center - unpredictable and fresh. And whether you believe it or not in the story of the movie, you have to admit, it's different! Everyone has different tastes and opinions but my impression of some of the negative reviews about this movie is that viewers have never really seen beyond the superficial level of this movie. They got involved in technical details: "Why would there be green lighting on a subway?" or "Why did the medical students do such a stupid trick?" and failed to see the artistic and psychological depth of the play. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some medical and technical aspects that do not make logical sense, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief just a little bit, it can be a very engaging movie. <br /> <br /> First, a note about the artistic quality of the film. Some complained about the dim lighting and the illogical nature of the scenarios - but for me, using innovative lighting techniques, plastic and sheet sets, unusual settings in old buildings and dripping, dripping tunnels, use of statuary, rain and rolling curtains - all adds a poetic flavor to this film, an astounding beauty that adapts to the dark nature of the questions asked about life, death and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I will focus on just two examples; in an alley scene, a change in illumination allows certain elements of the set to be dramatically focused, then disappear when the illumination returns to normal. It is an innovative means of transmitting a change in the "reality" of the moment and works beautifully. We can also see the interior of the character apartments - contrasting the warm wood, the bright colors, the golden lighting and the messy comfort of Labraccio's rooms with Nelson's crisp white void. Both reflect the characters themselves. Nelson's lack of 'objects' reflects our lack of knowledge about his past. and his carefully constructed mask that keeps his companions at bay. His past, we learn, is chaos and conflict. He determined to leave it behind in favor of an organized emptiness. unfortunately, the void is also a reflection of his relationships with others, a perception that comes along his personal journey of self-discovery in this film. <br /> <br /> Flatliners is not your typical horror movie. Nor is it a typical drama or a thriller. It is more a fusion of all, to have the best elements of all genres intertwined in a complex and suspenseful plot. <br /> <br /> This is a set piece, and cast does an excellent job of giving life to your individual characters. His immediate impression is that the characters are each representative of a well-established "stereotype": the ice queen, the slightly neurotic "doctor", the playboy, and the socially conscious "legal face". However, as the film progresses and the characters are even more elaborate, they take on multiple dimensions and depth. <br /> <br /> Most interesting of all is the character of Nelson de Sutherland. Nelson is not an easy character to like - in fact, he is a b * tard, a master manipulator who definitely puts self-interest above all else. However, Sutherland plays with a hint of insecurity that lends him a certain appeal. As events unfold, you realize that much of Nelson's unpleasant personality is a smokescreen, a protective mask behind which hides a very uncertain and vulnerable young man overwhelmed by a terrible secret. Revealing fragments of Nelson's complex personality throughout the film, the writers, directors and cast gradually lead to greater understanding and sympathy for him. The character who started out as an "idiot" becomes important and valued by himself - as you learn to "forgive" your previous behavior in the light of new information. His journey of discovery with Nelson reflects the journeys of the characters toward self-knowledge, for they also realize that everyone has value and "everything we do is important." Which leads to my final comment. While many of the posters here have learned to defy death ... few seem to have touched on what I see as the film's premise - the importance of forgiveness, and the need to be aware of everything you do, because "it matters ". <br /> <br />
