Treading Water is a very beautiful film. I would put it directly under the wonderful short film: Fiona MacKenzie's beautiful thing. It is not just a question of going out, but also of tolerance and acceptance in general. I look forward to seeing more of Laurel Himmel's work in the future. The actors Angie Redman and Nina Landey are very good. The relationship of the main characters could have been strengthened a bit, since we understand that there is a very strong bond between them, but perhaps this may have been explained a bit. I'm surprised that Angie Redman does not show up much in other movies. A great first step as director of Laurel Himmel, I'm sure there's more to see from her abilities.
