I rented this movie without knowing what to expect, but WHOA was me for a treat! <br /> <br /> For those of you who, like me, have been waiting for a good movie to combine horror and science fiction, it's time to rejoice that the wait is finally over. Writing, acting, filming and directing - all first-rate. I hate to admit it, but I actually cried at one point (when Dracula was talking to the crippled face). Truly an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. The ship's halls provided the perfect scary backdrop to this tale and the actors were actually able to make their fear come to life for me. And Coolio as a vampire .... very good! <br /> <br /> And believe me .... as great as most of the movie was ... the end will end up with you! I know this movie is heavily criticized on this site for some reason, but I know none of you have seen the ending coming. Bright!
