The cast is admirably chosen and well-balanced. This cinematography is excellent. The music is as charming as all of Burt Bacharach's music, and is appropriate for the plot. Making a musical version of the Hilton tale is a welcome change from a slow reuse. We see experienced actors who add real depth to the emotional content and meaning of each scene. I can not agree with the critics who have overlooked this shimmering gem of a movie. It's a silver screen treasure! Find it if you can - and let your magic take you beyond the painful work of daily worries, inspiring you to find your own "Lost Horizon."
