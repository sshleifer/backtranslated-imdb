"twin peaks" and "blue velvet" have always been two of my favorite pieces of film production, and even if old Lynch movies were a bit disappointing to me, they were always worth watching several times. To be pretentious, lynching can be like good wine - it must be savored and mixed. but in the end you must decide on what you have seen, because lynch never gives you the full answers. <br /> <br /> Many people will leave the mulholland drive, possibly wanting to strangle. the visual puzzle that has just unfolded before them. but there's a distorted logic in that movie, you just have to look for clues. betty (naomi watts) arrives in hollywood, with eyes wide open and in search of stardom. she then finds an amnesiac in her bathroom who escaped an assassination attempt on a mulholland car. together they try to discover the secrets behind the life of the amnesiac. All this leads to a club called silence, where a blue box will reveal everything. and that's where the movie throws everything out the window. people who thought we were totally different people ... is it a dream? a reminiscence about the earlier escapades of life? you're going to love this movie or hate it. David Lynch always takes these extreme reactions from his viewers. but as his own universe is always over extremes, it is appropriate that his films provoke such reactions. <br /> <br /> It is better to look at this film thematically, rather than a direct narrative. and I appreciate the fact that Lynch is a filmmaker who still allows you to draw your own conclusions. he has had many imitators lately, particularly in the "vanilla sky," where a mind-blowing movie decides to give you all the answers in the last five minutes, and you'll probably forget the movie as soon as you leave the theater. the mulholland unit will haunt you.
