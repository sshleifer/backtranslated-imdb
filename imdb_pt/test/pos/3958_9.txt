Films belonging to the genre "film noir" usually contain similar elements: a plot twist "deus ex machina" that takes the main character to madness, a beautiful but psychotic girl, a beautiful but psychotic, lots of money, a lot of brutality and usually one end in the desert. Think of "High Sierra" or "White Heat." <br /> <br /> There are many hard-boiled noir in the market. But when film noir is good, you can not take your eyes off the train crash of human lives. <br /> <br /> It is this last tradition to which "Blind Spot" belongs. The film follows Danny Alton, a troubled teenager (superbly interpreted with depth, grace, emotional integrity and frank simplicity by James Franco, who gives himself completely to that role) who fell in love with the disgusting streetkid, Darcy. <br /> From the beginning, you know that this is going to be bad. <br /> <br /> Darcy invites Danny to his house. But the house is empty and for sale, and a bloody check for thousands of dollars is on the floor. Danny is robbed of his clothes and belongings, but uses the check to track down another suicidal lover of April - Darcy. When they reach Darcy's real home, they find Wayne - a thug chasing Darcy for the money he stole. Together, the three can locate Darcy in a dusty, decadent motel in the desert. But that's just the beginning of the tale, such as plastic explosives, drugs, gun runs, a sinister undertaker, bisexual killers and a solitary semi-finished house in the desert bring events to an explosive head in an alley in front of a tattoo studio . Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> This movie contains some of the best noir cinematography I've seen in years. In one scene, Danny races across the desert to the semi-finished house in the desert, where he believes Darcy may have been taken away that night by mobsters. A very long shot with accentuated lighting effects shows Danny - arms and legs agitated, palpable fear engraved on his face (visible up to that distance), dust cloud creeping behind him as the wind blows towards him - running through the apartments desert toward home. The loneliness, the despair, the desperation that Danny feels is shocking. There are many such scenes in this movie, wonderfully created by the experienced Maximo Munzi. This is an Oscar winning material. <br /> <br /> The issue is also surprising. The movie contains small moments in which the characters gain insight into themselves or their situation. Pieces of time, where memory and feeling come back. In these moments, rapid mounts of images pass through the screen. This is an excellent edition of director-writer and publisher Stephan Woloszczuk. In an initial set-up, Danny describes the wonderful feelings he has now that Darcy came into his life. Danny's diary flashes on the screen: the words "4 life", "lucky" and "safe" stop momentarily, while page on the word page, the contents of a human heart, run through the screen - out of focus too fast to read. It's like the flood of emotions that Danny himself feels. <br /> <br /> The flurry of images reveals something more about this film: how beautiful is the design of Nathaniel Waters production. Darcy's house is the perfect combination of high-tech and slob (a tribute to the attention of the scenographer Kimberly Foster). The stunning scene of the house in the desert is simply creepy. The ruined motel where Darcy hides can be found in any small abandoned town in America. The sinister (and surprisingly illuminated) funeral parlor, where the plot takes a horrible turn, mixes the roughness with the death shroud hovering over the entire film. (It's a shame that the lighting director of the film is not credited.) This film has a superb production design that improves every frame and performance of each actor. <br /> <br /> This is the fourth element of this movie that makes you cling to and hold on to you: acting. James Franco is an excellent actor. Even in "Spider-Man" - where practically nothing was given to him - Franco showed that he understands human emotion like no other actor of his generation. He is not a handsome boy who looks like Brad Pitt. Franco portrays deep emotion at full strength. Their performances contain pure human heart. Consider the scene in the phone booth outside the funeral home where Danny collapses after telling April and Wayne that Darcy is dead. Smaller actors could not lead to the complete emotional breakdown of a human being. Franco does. <br /> <br /> Shawn Montgomery, in his first film, simply snatches him off with his performance as the April suicide. Deeply in love with Darcy, suffering from massive depression after having to bury her unborn child alone (after the fetus aborts spontaneously) in a perfume box in the woods, her life of luxury and perfection is now a mess: April is one of the best characters drawn in the movie I've seen. While Danny's relationship with Darcy is slowly elicited during the film, April's nervous breakdown is revealed only to the public. Neither Danny nor Wayne seem particularly interested in her as a human being. April's desperation when she realizes that Danny was also Darcy's lover is poignant and potent, even if it is truncated by the character's complete inability to feel any emotion for a long time now. Montgomery brings to April a pathetic who puts his heart in place. <br /> <br /> Mark Patrick Gleason has the hardest job in the movie: having to do something human and real with the bad guy, Wayne. At first, Wayne is simply one of any number of drug-smuggled drug dealers / drug dealers who appear in any number of films (from "Kindergarten Cop" to "Beverly Hills Cop 2"). Gleason does very well with what he's given, but he does not get to where you're sorry for Wayne. It's hard to say if that's the Gleason problem or the stuff. There is a moment - where Wayne (who is Darcy's brother, though neither Danny nor April know about it) reads Danny's diary and notices the sexual and emotional bond between the two men - where you know that Wayne will get homophobic Danny's ass. But the explosion never comes. (Thankfully, complacent lots are the death of film noir.) Once the revelation about the brothers comes to the end of the film, the audience is quite surprised to realize the depth of love and compassion that Wayne really felt for Darcy - so deep that Wayne accepted. Danny's homosexual love for his bisexual brother. But all of this happens off-screen. Gleason never gets a chance to represent Wayne's feelings. It must have been very frustrating for the performer. <br /> <br /> The story is quite inventive, although the contraband device seen at the end of the movie is able to remind viewers of "Diamonds Are Forever" (yes, James). Link). A traditional narrative narration (which proves that Franco is a great voice talent as a physical actor) provides a fantastic atmosphere, though it tends to flow to schmaltz a few times until the end of the film (provoking unintentional laughter). ). Fantastic locations play important visual roles in the film. Many compliments to the discovery finder to find such amazing buildings! The end of the film seemed a bit rushed; not pat, but a little too firm for my taste of movie noir. <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen the public hate or love "Blind Spot". Audiences in modern films, exposed to the most extreme brutality and violence, often have little appreciation for the subtleties of film noir. My suggestion is to get a small group of friends who do not see despair, emotional collapse, despair or depression as laughable. Take them to a small theater where they can boast in the spectacle of the movie's vision, but where their vision will not be ruined by a multitude of people who will not recognize the good film noir. Get some popcorn (believe me, they'll be so entertained they will not finish), get a soda pop for them and let them be overloaded. Go somewhere bright and cheery later, to wash away the dirt and the melancholy of your soul. Because this movie is so good at making you feel, you need this restorative.
