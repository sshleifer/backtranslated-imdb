This movie was never intended as a big budget movie, but it was a cute photo that pretty much anyone could enjoy. It will probably not change your life, but it is certainly charming and engaging. <br /> Clifton Webb plays a cranky (who is certainly not new) who has a TV. However, his ratings are failing and he is worried about the cancellation. So he decides that maybe he's way out of touch with the kids - since he and his wife do not have any of them. So he volunteers as Scoutmaster and regrets doing it almost immediately! Remember, he is grumpy and does not particularly like children. To make things worse, one of the kids really likes him and follows him like a lost puppy. No matter how indifferent he acts toward the boy, the child just wants to spend time with him! The kid is cute and almost steals the show alone! <br /> <br /> What happens next and the plot twists are something you will have to figure out for yourself. Understand that this is a lightweight, beautiful and yet not cloying movie that you will probably enjoy.
