This exploration of a single decade in American cinema begins with the collapse of an empire in crisis and culminating in the unstoppable rise of another, also associated with escapism and box-office receipts. Meet the new boss, just like the old boss. Or, as Peter Fonda noted in Easy Rider: "We screwed up." In the middle, from Bonnie and Clyde to Star Wars, the young Turks (some under the guerrilla tutelage of Roger Corman) were crawling under the wires to produce some of the greatest works of art of the twentieth century. Although familiar enough with Peter Biskind's Easy Riders, the directors of Raging Bulls, Demme and LaGravenese, are less concerned with muckraking than providing a platform for filmmakers and stars. <br /> <br /> Everyone from Martin Scorsese to Francis Ford Coppola and Julie Christie are interviewed and a list of well-edited clips puts the decade in a socio-cultural and economic context.

Ex-Warner Bros. John Calley recalls that when he first saw Robert De Niro in Mean Streets he assumed that Scorsese had secured the launch of the psychopath's day for filming. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a certain amount of difficult perspective has entered the mix. as might be expected from a politically motivated and conscientious generation, Hopper emphasizes that "there is a lot of crap there too" Julie Christie notes that American cinema in the 1970s was not a good time for women. a spoonful of ice cream for women's movies - Alice's short clips do not live here anymore, they shoot horses, do not do them and Klute - we'll soon be dragged back to the usual male contests to piss on the wall. <br /> <br /> The shift from hard and socially conscious cinema to the pleasure of not risking the public, like Jaws, to 'tired and eager audience of fancy is also documented, though a little rushed. less sung, but equally relevant films like Panic In Needle Park and Joe. "We were not handsome," muses Bruce Dern in his contemporaries. "But we were very interesting."
