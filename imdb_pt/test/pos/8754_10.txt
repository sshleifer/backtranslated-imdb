The best thing you can say about the movie "Traffic" is that it drew attention to the British mini-series "Traffik". As many people have noted, the current film suffers from the truncation of the story to accommodate moviegoers 'short attention span and moviegoers' return time, which measures the success of a movie with expensive food sales. <br /> <br /> I recorded this mini series for the first time in 1990 when it was shown on Public TV and watched many times. The entire documentary style series has a strong element of tragedy and disgrace on the subject as the characters are moving towards their final destination. The strongest of the three tales is that of the Pakistani family forced into the city to find a way to keep body and soul together after the poppy harvest is burned by the army in a show of force staged for the benefit of Western politicians. The difficulties of the family are similar to those of the family of rickshaws in "Cidade da Alegria". Eventually the farmer finds work, but he compromises his pride and honesty. <br /> <br /> The Pakistani segment of the film has a special relevance for today's fight against Al Qaeda's supporters and gives some understanding of support for such movements among the disadvantaged poor of Pakistan and Afghanistan, who rarely receive money for these countries. The film insists that farmers receive only 25% of the aid, which is supposed to encourage them to grow other crops. With the inability of Americans to see anything other than black and white-good guys. thugs - it's interesting to see another view where there is no black and white, just shades of gray. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler ahead. The only problem I had with the story was that instead of going on as before, as in real life, being a work of fiction, they had to wrap it up with the "bad guys," getting what was coming to them. Other than that, this was a beautiful job of the kind we see very rarely. The cast was excellent and the German and Pakistani locals helped give the film a "different" feel (which made the Germans see something different from the villains in a WWII movie).
