"L'appartement" has to be among the best French films I have ever seen (along with "Hatred", also starring Vincent Cassel, and those great films by Gerard DÃ©pardieu / Pierre Richard). Cassel and Bellucci are amazing in the lead roles. In addition to "Brotherhood Of The Wolves" and "Dobermann" I have not yet seen a bad movie with this couple. "L'appartement" sucks you right from the start and the twists and turns make you thrilled until the end. Fragment narration does not really work as well since "Pulp Fiction". Let's just hope there is not an American refuge from this mystery novel / suspense. (EDIT: Guess what! A godawful American remake was done!)!
