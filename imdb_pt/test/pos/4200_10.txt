I had heard of John Garfield, but I did not know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He was in real life too, so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He was guilty. He is a family friend who has doubts and is not sure what to do with him. All kinds of small plots happen. My favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and a Dead End Kid could not swim, and none of them could leave. John's character saves the day. The Dead End Kids were great as their friends and followers. One of them to the end. Ann Sheridan played the family's daughter and John's eventual love interest. She was believable, but not kind in my opinion, the only weak link in the film.
