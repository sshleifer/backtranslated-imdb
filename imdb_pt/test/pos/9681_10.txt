Family Guy has been hilarious for so long, but I feel like I lost the sharp, random mood at the beginning of Season 6. Although I liked Blue Harvest, it seemed the remaining episodes were "wrapping-up" - episodes where the producers made little attempt to fulfill the reputation of American Family Guy's satire. <br /> <br /> I saw all the episodes of season 7 and was totally surprised and happy that Family Guy has found its true colors again. Season 7 offers many fantastic episodes and lots of jokes about the current situations in America, which is exactly what we need now - more fun. <br /> <br /> I feel like the Simpsons have lost all their spark. together, this show, however, has made a fantastic recovery of going down to prove just how perfectly satirical they can be. Good job!
