The film is incredible, it has a soundtrack that sets the tone of the movie. The movie lines are great, like "Nothing Good for Friends" and "Your Charlie Collection Time Collection Time." I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are unique. I feel that when I watch this movie I want to go out and take down bad guys, if there is a movie that you do not want to miss, this is it. "They killed the Giggler man, they killed the Giggler." "They had no right to do that, he's in our territory, he does not take care of that." The lines continue to arrive in the film. Deff. get out and not rent, but buying this movie worth the money trusts me.
