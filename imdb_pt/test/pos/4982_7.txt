The Violent Men is a very good western that certainly benefits from the excellent cast. <br /> <br /> Edward G. Robinson is the great farmer who attempts to extirpate the smaller farmers, one of whom is Glenn Ford. Ford is ready to sell to appease her fianc√© (May Wynn) until Robinson's ambitious brother (Brian Keith) kills one of Ford's hands. So you know what happens next. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is like Robinson's wife plotting the kind of paper she specialized in. Dianne Foster plays her daughter who admires Ford. <br /> <br /> The Violent Man is nothing more than a "B" plot with an "A" cast, but it is very well done.
