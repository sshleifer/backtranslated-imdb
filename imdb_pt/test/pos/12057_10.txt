So many times, Bollywood has tried to re-do Hollywood hits, only to produce total failures. Fortunately, Yash Chopra's interpretation of "Sleeping with the Enemy" is an extremely elegant and well-made film. <br /> Shah Rukh Khan is obsessed with Juhi Chawla (who is looking for his best here!). When he realizes that Juhi has a fianc√© in Sunny Deol, he stops at nothing to make sure she becomes his. <br /> <br /> Every frame in this movie is a delight to watch. Be Shah Rukh singing his trademark "I love you, K ... k ... k ... kiran!" or the muscular scenes of feeling good between Sunny and Juhi (which makes a perfect match), you will not feel like letting your eating in boredom. <br /> <br /> Each and every song on the soundtrack is pleasing to the ears, especially Jaadu Teri Nazar and Tu Mere Samne. As I said, Juhi looks like a goddess in this movie. Darr may not be the best SRK movie (this honor goes to Baazigar), but it's definitely one of his most perfect performances! Sunny is fine. He's done similar roles before, but he's good. <br /> <br /> Overall, Darr is g ... g ... g ... great! ;)
