More and more French films demonstrate that he is the only one able to confront Hollywood and spend large sums of money on his films. If Bon Voyage had been made in the USA, no one would be surprised. Perfectly defined in France in the 40's, when the technically irreproachable Nazi invasion, and with some of the most international French actors (Depardieu, Adjani, Ledoyen ...). Bon Voyage focuses on two parallel stories: a scientist and his disciple (Ledoyen) who tries to hide one of his discoveries (a type of water that can act as an atomic bomb) of the Nazis; and a poor boy in love with a known actress (Adjani), who ends up in prison accused of a crime he did not commit to protect her. <br /> <br /> Bon Voyage seems to have been made in the old style, without unnecessary camera movements and effects. No big twists in the plot. As I said before, regarding the production itself, they did a great job. But the main problem with this movie is about the script. Is it a spy movie? A romantic comedy? A spy comedy? A comedy of intrigue? It is not clear. This makes Bon Voyage a bit unbalanced. When you think you're watching a comedy, it suddenly shifts to another story line, a more dramatic, slower ... I think they should have focused on one of the lines of argumentation (the one about the spy storyline) and I left the romantic parts in the background. <br /> <br /> My fee: 6.5 / 10
