This gives the average boy the chance to be on television singing like his favorite stars. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, they sound like the lead singer they should be doing. <br /> <br /> Another twist - a team of fashionable people and customers dresses the participant as a singer. They may not look like them, but the probability of getting someone who sounds like a person just like them is very small. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun for your Saturday night - and competitors are not practicing wannabes as they are on another TV show. The fact that there are no prizes involved and is for fun means that it will attract a different kind of person. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is with the Kids version - it looks like they did the round of performing schools, what happened to normal kids?
