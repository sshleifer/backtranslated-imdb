this show is the best that is full of laughs and Kevin James is the best so if you want a good show I recommend the king of queens and it is a disappointment that they canceled so in the end this show will make you forget your worries and problems cause if you have a cast with Kevin James and Jerry Stiller you can not go wrong. so I do not know why the show canceled if anyone knows please tell me.now one day you can not find a lot of concerts that suit your needs as public.after Seinfeld and the king of queens the only show that is worth watching is jail breaking and if it stops I do not know what to do. in the end, if I had to recommend a show, it would be the king of the queens.
