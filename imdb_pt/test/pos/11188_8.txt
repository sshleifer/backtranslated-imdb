One of the classic low budget movies of the 70s, this movie was found at a bargain video store in London for only 50p. (Interestingly, the package lists the star of the movie as 'Charles Bone' which sounds like a porn star, but since the role of credits is obvious that the image is aligned to the right of the TV screen, so that the whole cast members have the last letter missing in their names) <br /> <br /> From the moment the narrator introduces us to the situation in the desperate tenants of a filthy New York apartment block, you know that is in search of a fromage roller coaster ride. The direction is from Ed Wood's one-take school - if one or two extras were looking at the film crew, then what the heck? <br /> <br /> The films end with a twist in the story that puts The Usual Suspects of Shame.
