I saw Sweeney Todd on Broadway in 1980. It starred George Hearn and featured most of the other casting directors who appeared in the production of the national tour company, which was filmed for TV in Los Angeles in 1982. Last night I watched the new DVD release of Los Angeles production, although I have owned the videotape for many years. Production and performances could hardly have been better, but the original tape age showed that both audio and video quality are below modern standards, even on a newly released DVD. However, I still give it 10 out of 10 because of the greatness of the work and amazingly wonderful performances of George Hearns and Angels Lansbury. Even today, my most memorable memory of a live musical theater performance has to be Hearn's version of "These are My Friends." "You're going to dribble rubies," brrr.
