The British nobleman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene) decides to look for his two best friends who disappeared after visiting the count Karl von Bruno (Stephen MaNally), a bad and powerful man who lives in the Black Castle. Sir Burton travels in disguise with another identity, as he fought Count von Bruno in Afrika with his two missing friends and the earl lost an eye on a battle. When he arrives at the castle, he is invited to hunt in the Black Forest around the castle with the count while he seeks evidence that the count has killed his friends. Later, he and the Count's wife, Countess Elga von Bruno (Rita Corday), fall in love with each other and, with the support of Dr. Meissen (Boris Karloff), Sir Burton and the Countess try to escape the clutches of Count Von . Bruno. "The Black Castle" is an excellent romantic period film with action, romance, mystery and even horror. The story is thrilling and is an excellent entertainment for any audience. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Castle of Pavor" ("The Castle of Fear")
