On New Year's Eve, the Tuberculous Sister of the Salvation Army Edit (Astrid Holm) asks her mother and her colleague Maria (Lisa Lundholm) to call David Holm (Victor Sjöström) to visit her on her deathbed. Meanwhile, alcoholic David is telling two other drunks in the graveyard the legend of the Phantom Coach and his charioteer: according to legend, the last sinner to die at the turn of the New Year becomes the collector of souls, gathering souls in his coach. When David denies visiting Edit, his friends argue with him, they fight and David dies. When the coachman arrives, he recognizes his friend Georges (Tore Svennberg), who died at the end of last year. George revisits parts of David's detestable life and in flashbacks, it shows how David was evil and selfish. <br /> <br /> "Körkarlen" is an impressive and elegant silent film with magnificent special effects (for a 1921 film). The characters are very well developed; however, the story is dated and there is a strange and inexplicable situation when Sister Edit says she loves David Holm. Why does an enlightened woman love a man so despicable that he wasted his life by corrupting other people? Despite being religiously dated these days, it gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption in the end. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Ghost Wagon" ("The Ghost Coach")
