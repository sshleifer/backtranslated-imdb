This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira in the dark. Another small detail is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord of the owner of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is the most glorious story to tell. Must sell more copies than the bible. My parents had a role in suggesting the release of this movie at a local movie theater. The movie lasted a week and we were one of 4 families watching. The lady who gave it the go ahead (friend of the family) was let go by the theater. I was 3 years old. I recorded 4 copies on VHS and finally converted it into DVD. It's beautiful.
