This is the best of the movies (so far) that Christopher Guest created using his talented cast. Previously, they had done the excellent WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and following the BEST IN SHOW, they made the VERY NICE A MIGHTY WIND. As for your most recent, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, the less said the better. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a documentary about dog shows and several competitors in particular. You follow these few dogs from pre-show preparations to the big night when one of them is chosen as the best show in the fictional Mayflower Kennel Club. However, none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talents improvisation actors who parody many of the most common types of people you know in the world of dog show. Surprisingly, even though the characters are quite strange, there is a lot of truth in the personalities they are parodying - as decades ago I had some experience with dog shows and this is a very rude group of people! My favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly high-pressure and tense yuppie pair that just exuded anger and volatility. I also loved the overtly gay couple, as they were terribly funny and clever. However, the best performance probably was not from any of the couples, but from Fred Willard, who played the most stupid and less talented broadcaster in the world in the history of mankind. His comments were uniformly insane and often betrayed him as an incredibly stupid person - how he came to be the host of such a prestigious show, no one knows. The other competitors presented were also quite funny - the high-priced professional poodle handler and his wealthy owner, the country boy and his hunting dog, as well as Winkie's "parents" who could barely gather enough to get to the show . <br /> <br /> Despite the improvised style of making movies, all the pieces fit wonderfully and told a very funny and compelling story - one that is not just for dog owners. Outstanding performance made this one of the best comedies of the last decade. Smart and consistently funny. <br /> <br /> By the way, try to find this on DVD, since the extras really paid off. Although a bit painful to watch, I loved seeing Harlan Pepper and his collection of beach balls in particular!
