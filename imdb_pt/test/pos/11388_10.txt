The next image will only grow over time. Better than any of the best nominees in 97 and reward repeated views. I've seen it three times now, so I know. Anderson has been compared to some of the great American directors (Altman, Scorcese, Tarantino) and he may have these influences, but chances are, after a few more films, he himself be considered part of this short list. <br /> One last note: Julianne Moore's "Amber Waves," will resonate in memory long after the other 90's characters have disappeared. The best performance of the year - in any of the four categories.
