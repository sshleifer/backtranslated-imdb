Quite simply a well-written, well-written and beautifully rendered film. Eastwood is a classic like Frank Horrigan, secret agent of the secret service, and Rene Russo, who is his partner (and love interest), Lilly Raines. But the greatness of the film rests on John Malkovich's shoulders as "Booth." He captures the fury and hatred of this character as well as his humanity strangely. Personally, I think that was his best performance and should have received an Oscar for him (But I also loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive that year). Overall, a great movie to watch you want to spy on a killer's mind and stand on the edge of your seat all the time. Appreciate!!
