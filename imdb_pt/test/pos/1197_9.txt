Hair is one of my all time favorite movies. Even though I'm not part of my generation, I've watched this movie 9 times and I'm not tired of the beautiful message of understanding, passion, beauty and love. This movie is against the Vietnam War and shows how people should be united regardless of color, backgrounds, religions and classes. I love the characters Berger and Woof and I think Central Park from the 70's is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> By the way, I still have this song in mind: <When the moon is in the Seventh House And Jupiter aligns with Mars Then peace will guide the planets And love will guide the stars This is the beginning of the age of Aquarius Aquarius Era Aquarius! Aquarium! <br /> <br /> Harmony and understanding Sympathy and trust in abundance No more falsehoods or decisions Living golden dreams of visions Mystical crystalline revelation And the true liberation of the mind Aquarius! Aquarium! <br /> <br /> ps: I am surprised to see that the director of this film is the same director of AMADEUS. I love both movies!
