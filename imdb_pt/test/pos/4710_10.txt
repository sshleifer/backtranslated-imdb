Exuberant cinematography, beautifully written and edited, John Boorman's Beyond Rangoon is a must-see for anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation. It entwines a personal and political tale that continues to haunt me, appearing in my mind often. The plot is thrilling, and the internal and external travels are parallel with care and delicacy, both cinematically and in the plot. I've watched this movie at least six times, and this really applies to scrutiny. It is particularly relevant today given the world events. Check it out, you will not regret it! BTW, NetFlix does not yet download, but you can request that they do.
