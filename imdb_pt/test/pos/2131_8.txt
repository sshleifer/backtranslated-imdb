Although this movie has destroyed the career of director and screenwriter Michael Cimino and bankrupt United Artists, he still stands out as one of the top films of all time. There are many reasons to prematurely dismiss this film for sure. Among them: their duration, their technical problems, their colossal mistreatment of animals on set - the list goes on indefinitely. And yet, for all that, it's still a movie that captures something. It is a classic example of naturalistic narrative along with Strindberg - his moments last as long as they could in reality, not having been sulk for a good cinematographic time. It seems real in your moments of anger, love and war (and hopelessness). This movie should be seen by anyone who enjoys cinema and story telling.
