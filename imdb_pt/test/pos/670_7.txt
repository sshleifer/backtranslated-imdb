Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by the crazy Robert Ryan in "Beware, My Lovely," a 1952 film by RKO. Lupino and Ryan made three films together and worked well as a team, both being accomplished professionals and strong performers. In this movie, based on a Broadway play called "The Man," Lupino is a World War I widow who rents a room in her home. She is very active and sweet in her community, and although her husband has been dead for two years, she is not ready to move on. The man who rents his room goes on vacation, and Lupino hires Robert Ryan to help her with a heavy cleaning in the house. He is friendly enough to begin with, but then terrifies her by locking her in the house, not allowing her to answer the phone or the door while he becomes violent and out of touch with reality. <br /> <br /> A character played by Ryan is shown at the beginning of the movie by running away when he discovers a corpse in another house he is working on. It is unclear whether or not he is the killer, since he seems surprised to see the body. He may be a split personality, as when his personality becomes ugly for Lupino, he seems to have no memory of his activities when he leaves her. He does not know that he has the keys to Lupino's house in his pocket and does not know why he has tickets to a party he bought from small children who came to the door. <br /> "My Lovely Care," is a very suspenseful movie, and the two protagonists give great performances. The tension increases to a very high level and ends in a way that you are not expecting.
