This cheapo remake of the fantastic Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting. Humphrey Bogart stars as the manager of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to increase sagging rates. The owner decides to have a series of morality pieces written about a famous murder case 20 years ago. So they hire the false preacher (Harry Hayden) to track down the murderess, who has been absolved and has lived quietly under a false name. The preacher arrives on her daughter's wedding day, but the relentless radio station refuses to expose her mother and ruin their lives. <br /> <br /> Bogart is always good. Hayden is good for the slimy preacher and Henry O'Neill is good as a father. Everyone is just awful. Beverly Roberts is fine, but always seems old, Claire Dodd and Hobart Cavanagh have no parts, Carlyle Moore is a failure as the boy friend, Virginia Brissac is Miscast as the parent company, Robert Middlemas overacts as the station owner. <br /> <br /> This comes in less than an hour, but it's a pale copy of the original that prided itself on dynamic performances by Edward G. Robinson, Aline MacMahon, Frances Starr and Boris Karloff. But it is always worth seeing the Boagrt.
