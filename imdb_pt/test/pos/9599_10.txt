I'm not a football fan by any means, but I watched it with a friend as there was nothing else in the box at the moment. (Thank God). Not only did we laugh from start to finish, but about a week later at the pub, when we started arguing, we made a sure show of ourselves with uncontrollable laughter. Does this inclined step really exist? I will release my email here, so if anyone knows of your future availability or a replay on the television, please let me know. Definitely the funniest thing I've seen on TV !!! King Leek was also good !! another classic by Tim Healy
