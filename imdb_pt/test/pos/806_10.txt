This movie deserves a 20/10 if I could give one. "THE HOLLOW" is a great novel by Hercule Poirot and the twist in the end deceives most people. I am very happy that this film remained completely faithful to the novel. There was not much difference that I could detect. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced to the story earlier than in the novel. The acting was excellent, and the music, as usual, was amazing! David Suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles as well. In no other film I've seen so far, Poirot has been portrayed so brilliantly! We took the hat off to the producers - they made a movie that I, along with many others, will do for a long time!
