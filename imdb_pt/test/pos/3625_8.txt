If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here's a Zinger Zinger! In 1933, Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice to the character Olive Oyl for the animated comic version of the Popeye comics by Fleischer Studios. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best imitation of "Olive Oyl" walking around whining and touching her hands or clinging to the cop's sheet. I kept waiting for her to say "ohhh myyyy", but instead "something always happens to someone". The first time I saw this movie, I loved Zasu and found his character very funny. I've seen her in other movies, where she does the same whining, tense, and fragile routine. Then, watching this movie again, I started to get a little annoyed with the constant hissing hysterics and near a piece of dust. But there are some funny comedies here, and it's also a mystery movie. It's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that really works. The mystery plot joins well through the camp of Zasu Pitts and James Gleason, who plays Arthur Crimmer, the cop. The haunted house is fun with many secret passages and even a skeleton in the attic! Worth the watch. Read more movie reviews in the public domain at: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/
