My friends and I spent most of a Saturday afternoon watching a selection of "bad" movies. Among the films we watched, the strongest candidate (for poor movie quality) was easily Jack-O. It's ridiculous that movies like "Gigli", "Glitter" and "You Got Served" are listed on the IMDB 100 background. While they are certainly bad movies, they do not belong to the 100 fund. They are stealing "Jack-O", and "Guardian of Time," etc., of Poor Movie Quality that they so richly deserve. <br /> <br /> So, what makes Jack-O so good (in terms of bad movies)? To begin with, Steve Latshaw, the director, decided to release his son, Ryan Latshaw, in the role of Sean Kelly. Unfortunately for Steve, Ryan Latshaw was dangerously close to being overtaken by a block of wood. The kid, seriously, has no ability to do anything. The end result: unintentional comic gold. The boy may be hearing a joke, or just a few moments of having his head broken, and his expression is of a "lack of emotion" of stone. <br /> <br /> The other aspect of the movie that we find incredible was the large number of "double dream" sequences. What is a double dream? Well, it's when a character wakes up from a nightmare, and then something equally nightmarish happens, and then the character wakes up again. Basically: they wake up after dreaming of waking up from a nightmare. Smart device, right? I believe Sean Kelly's character has experienced no less than 3 double dream sequences. <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what else? Oh yeah! This movie has a real cast of thousands. It's really amazing to see how many spoken papers are introduced throughout the film. Best of all: almost none of the characters has anything to do with the story. They're killed by Jack-O, or they're no good. <br /> <br /> Jack-O himself was very dear. Like most other B movie monsters, Jack-O has the incredible ability to apparently teleport over long distances. He's always coming out, somewhere deep down, whenever you're dealing with an important character. What is intriguing, however, is that when he is actually chasing someone, he moves at a slow, wobbly pace, yet is able to follow the people who are running. <br /> <br /> That's all for now. Final Comments: If you are looking for a bad and hilarious movie, you can not go wrong by renting this beast. <br /> <br /> Result of the movie: 7/10 Good Movie Score: 3.5 / 10
