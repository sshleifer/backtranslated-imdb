Maybe people like to have the devil around more than God. Maybe we like this safety net of a reason; make a mistake just to blame the devil for the pain and suffering in the world. There are so many difficulties, pouring into the masses, that it is hard not to see the sadness on the faces of everything you go through. Leland P. Fitzgerald understands all this; He knows that maybe everything will not work out, and maybe helping someone to leave Earth to avoid the pain that their life is waiting for is a risk he needs to take to someone he loves. Credit goes to screenwriter and director Matthew Ryan Hoge for creating a lyric prose about two suburban families who have met in good and bad times. Just look at the cast of almost every actor on the A and B list, showing that the material really resonates with your audience. Emotions do not need to be used on the sleeve to exist. Sometimes all we want to do is end the suffering. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling brings a discreet tabletop performance that encompasses the innermost emotions of his character Leland. He is a very passionate and intelligent young man, cutting off the BS of life, knowing what he sees and accepting the worst with the best. The film is a catharsis for the souls of those affected by the horrific event of Leland killing the brother with mental problems of his ex-girlfriend. In the confused mind of this teenager, he goes to the incident knowing very well what he was going to do, it would stop the pain he sees everywhere, but above all in the face of young Ryan Pollard. Almost immediately he realizes that he has made a mistake, that perhaps playing God is not a job he was put on Earth to do. Whether this is true or not will soon be debated as the murder begins a chain of events, which finally bring meaning to the lives of many people as they awaken to the tangential fragility of life. This boy opened his eyes to sadness and rebirth. With haunted ballads sung by former Sunny Day Real Estate vocalist Jeremy Enigk, the film goes through a journey of little vignettes from the lives of two families in the aftermath of the tragedy. The performance is excellent in all aspects, with special mention to some. For someone who plays the naive in most movies, Chris Klein really gets along with the same stuff here, but also with an evolution for a man on purpose. His indifference is effective when used on the right side, similar to his success in the election, and I'm interested to see if the directors will allow him to expand his talents and sink his teeth into something more substantial. Jena Malone is effective in the same effect, playing the role of young troublesome, as she did in Donnie Darko and Life as a House; Don Cheadle is a robust professionalism that gives us a different view of the compassionate therapist than the one he did at Manic; and Martin Donovan is brilliant as the grieving father trying to stay calm and eventually realize that he should prevent his family from falling apart. Also, it's great to see the beautiful Sherilyn Fenn in a small but important role. <br /> <br /> When the tragedy comes, people come together to get through it all. As Leland cunningly points at one point, you see men and women helping others out and hugging each other when they see the pain and suffering around them, but after a few days everything returns to normal. Cheadle's character extrapolates the optimistic view that at least we have a glimpse of the true nature of people wanting to help and being good to each other, only to be shot with the retort "well at least we do during the tragedy." Maybe we do not want to think we're good-natured because it makes us feel that we should be good all the time, and that, when bad, it must have been so. Being flawed we allow ourselves to recover and try again. Leland's mistake allows him to see the love he had for those close to him, as well as open the eyes of others to wake up and not let their loved ones move away from them. One can not focus on the sadness of others when they first need to become familiar with their own. Hoge has created a parable for this and a truly effective piece of film production, with the hope that many more will come.
