Adorable Candace Bergen as the widow Perdicaris are abducted and held hostage by Sheikh Raisuli, played by Sean Connery. The incident occurs in 1904, when Theodore Roosevelt competes for the presidential election in his own right. Needing a good example to show United States foreign policy, Brian Keith as Roosevelt issues an impressive statement to the Sultan of Morocco, "Perdicaris alive or dead Raisuli." <br /> <br /> But in this adaptation of this incident the famous statement is the only true thing about this story. The Perdicaris in question was in fact an Ion Perdicaris who was an immigrant playboy and Greek dilettante. In fact, Perdicaris gave up his American citizenship years ago and was back as a Greek citizen. No matter what, however, his situation was useful enough at the time. <br /> <br /> The damsel in distress makes better canvas material, so it is a widowed woman and her two children who are in danger here. Of course, as presented here, the incident is also used by some of our European powers to get their presence in Morocco. The intrigues go far beyond the demand to rescue a thug. <br /> <br /> The Wind and the Lion are hardly history. But it's a nice movie and Sean Connery is always fun to watch. Brian Keith also fits my conception of Theodore Roosevelt and the scenes in the White House of Roosevelt are true for all the stories told. John Huston plays the always patient secretary of state, John Hay, whom Roosevelt inherited from his predecessor, William McKinley. <br /> <br /> But the children do not use this film to not read a story about Theodore Roosevelt era.
