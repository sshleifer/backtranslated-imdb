For a long time, I, a fan of the TV series "The Monkees," refused to watch "Head" because it was not about the characters on the TV show, who were warm and wonderful. "Head", instead, was said to be a cynical and somber movie. Finally, curiosity made me relent. I did not find, of course, a new episode for the TV show, but a fascinating movie that appeals to my sombre side. <br /> <br /> I've always been fascinated. by dreams, and "Head" was very much like someone else's dream, with incomplete innuendoes of stories, and a small detail at the end of a scene causing the movie to move in a new direction, of consciousness. The unfinished stories really make my imagination run wild, and again! <br /> <br /> The film also features a beautiful and impressive cinematography, the epitome being the appearance of black on white, white on black. "Daddy's Song". The music is haunting, especially the lush arrangement of "The Porpoise Song". ("The Porpoise Song" is the favorite song on my dark side, while my bright side prefers "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah"). <br /> <br /> In the end, I think the TV series might have used some drama, intrigue and intensity of "Head." But "Head" could have used the warmth, humor and friendship of some TV shows.
