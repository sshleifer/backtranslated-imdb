One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No big stars, but Ben Johnson shines on almost everything that appears, and here he gets a rare lead as a title character. Pairing with him is Ward Bond as the hard-headed Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provides ample support, as does James Arness, a member of the Clegg bandit clan joining the wagon. The Mormon Trail in Utah was one of the most arduous and demanding companies ever undertaken. We can not really have the impression of this, but we see trials that had to be overcome by the pioneers on the way west; crossings of rivers, long stretches of dry desert and without water, meetings with Indians and the like, all ready for the glorious song of the Sons of the Pioneers. Mormons actually dug stretches of the trail with shovels and picks, as shown in the film. My main regret is that it was not made in color, but I believe there is a color version. By the way, these steep rocks highlighted in various scenes are called the Fisher Towers, located near Moab. Preview highly recommended.
