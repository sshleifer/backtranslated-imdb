Hellraiser's Clive Barker has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is both funny and exciting. <br /> <br /> The makeup done by Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portass was fantastic. It took a lot of imagination to reach out to these mutants who lived underground. It was really a pleasure to see the quality of the work. <br /> <br /> It was not particularly horrible, since the worst creature was actually a serial human killer. <br /> I just saw Craig Sheffer in Shadow of Doubt the other day and he did a good job in this movie as well. Nothing spectacular, but fair. This was just the third Anne Bobby movie, and she was also good. <br /> <br /> The finale was spectacular and the country boys won their desserts, as did David Cronenberg. There is!
