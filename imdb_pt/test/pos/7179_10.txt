The second film about the adventures of Gaulois Asterix & Obelix is ​​10 times better than the first. The humor is great (and irreverent) and the script is well executed, taken from the original 1965 comic book by Goscinny & Uderzo. I fell asleep with the first film (although I'm a big fan of Asterix) and I was reluctant to see this sequel, but I'm glad that this movie has proven me wrong. Excellent comedy for everyone. Highly recommended!
