Hmmm, ... OTHER comedy Keystone in the park !!! It seems like the number one location spot to shoot was at this same local park, as many of the Chaplin and Arbuckle movies are there! And while this is another one, it's different and well done that I still liked. <br /> <br /> Fatty is interested in a younger than usual look and act Mabel Normand. I think she should be a little younger, even though in her mother's eyes she's too young to be interested in men. Well, Fatty does not share her feelings and soon he and Mabel flee for innocent amusement. Things get complicated when the mother's watch is stolen. Fatty finds and gives Mabel as a gift, ... and MANY problems result. <br /> <br /> The decent pace and the fact that this movie did not depend much on cheap slapstick, but a reasonable storyline did it. a little fun movie.
