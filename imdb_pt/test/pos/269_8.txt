"Prime Suspect 4" continues the prowess of the inscrutable and obstinate seeker of truth and justice, detective superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4, PS5 and PS6) with the notable absence of founding writer Lynda La Plante of the credits. Imbued with the same reality as the first three series, the second of three series puts Tennison against the forces of evil while facing middle age, loneliness, indiscretions, a series of personal and professional problems and resolutions that are sometimes less than ideal . The PS4 evokes two stories, while PS5 and PS6 are unique episodes, each of which finds Tennison seeking justice in the name of the brutally wronged while at war with institutions that are willing to sacrifice the interests of their victims to those of a greater good. In other words, in order to prevail, Tennison needs to overcome the forces of evil and good, something that makes the ever-gray PS series even grayer and Tennison's wars as much a matter of principle as finding killers. Very good material that only gets better from series to series. (B +)
