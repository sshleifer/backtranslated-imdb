Is this a good movie? It's hard to say - but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective, suspenseful, scary movie and then, surprisingly, playing when "the old gentleman" finds his unlucky death at the end of the movie. /> <br /> Yes, what is hidden in the labyrinth turns out to be a surprise and, for a lot of people, hilarious. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was very real at the time the book was written, and has some basis in fact. Not that this will result in what we see in the film, of course. <br /> <br /> But working on what must have been a very low budget, one of the greatest production designers - and the person for whom the term "production designer" was invented - creates a very strange climate that was strangely attractive. Sometimes, of course, the movie is very silly, but it has its moments.
