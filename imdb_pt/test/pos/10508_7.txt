It would be so easy to dispense with an alien abduction movie before you even saw it - as I did - but it's worth a look. If you think about it, it is not an easy subject to deal with, but this movie manages to suspend disbelief, which in itself is a feat for such an off topic. Releasing the main character as a physician was a sensible move that lends credence to his willingness to believe in the possibility of alien abduction. Vosloo plays very sensuously engaging us in his pain and confusion at the strange events that happen to him and his wife. Special effects are used in moderation, but with shocking effect and sometimes the film is totally thrilling, but unfortunately there are some points where the plot goes astray and leaves some confusion. Moreover, after reaching a tense climax, the ending is somewhat disheartening. The supporting characters were unnecessarily weak (the alien hunter) or menacing (the psychiatrist), who also served to harm. <br /> <br /> But, in spite of everything, they raised some interesting questions, among which the following stood out: "How to think animals feel when we experience them". <br /> <br /> The concept of "lost time" has also been instigated.
