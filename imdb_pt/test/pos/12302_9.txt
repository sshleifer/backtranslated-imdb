John Huston, actor and director best known for being more robust as "The Misfits" and "African Queen", directs his daughter, Angelica Huston, in what would be his last film. In fact, the film was released after Huston's death. Based on James Joyce's novel of the same name, "The Dead" tells the quiet story of a New Year celebration in Dublin in 1904. Huston, his cast and scriptwriters, including his son Tony, have created a movie gem. The novel is among the best works of Joyce (besides being the only one that can be filmed). The film is an homage to Huston's genius. He got a lovely little story and made a cute little movie. Donal McCann and Angelica Huston shine (although "glow" is very flashy, a flashy word to describe their discreet and discreet performances). "The Dead" reflects the love of the Huston family for Ireland and is, in its quiet way, a fitting finale for a legend.
