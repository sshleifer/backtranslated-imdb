After a long time, the Marathi cinema came with a good movie. This movie is one of the best Marathi films of all time. It shows how an old grandfather tries to save the eye of his grandchildren. He tries everything he can in his hands to save the child's eye. Doctor and a relative of him tries to help you in your attempt. <br /> <br /> The performance of the grandfather, the boy and the doctor is simply superb. They showed the true image of a typical Marathi life. Each piece of action has some meaning in it. I would recommend watching this movie because initially I thought this would be the documentary type, but this was above my expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie will really touch your hearts. I would expect more Marathi movies to come up with performances like this.
