This show has to be my favorite of all the horror TV shows of the '80s. Like Tales from the Darkside, also from the same creators, this show is a rare gem. If you agree with me, PLEASE, sign this petition that I started, to publicize the monsters and release them on DVD. Here is the petition address: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episodes would have to be Glim Glim and Rain Dance. I also loved the introduction of opening with the family of monsters. That used to scare me! One of the things I would have to ask the creators of the DVD to include would be the organ sound heard before, where the commercial break would be. I do not know if any of you remember that part, but that's one of the main things that bring me memories. I mean, come on! War of the Worlds TV series has already been released on DVD, so I say Monsters, and also Tales from the Darkside, and Friday the 13th the series should be released as well! We, the fans, need to talk our minds! We need this incredible show on DVD, so please spread the word !!!
