I was fortunate to see the Prime Minister of London in this film. Although I am not at all a fan of British drama, I was deeply moved by the characters and the BAD CHOICES that they did. I was crying at the end of the movie. Each dinner was mesmerizing. The attention to detail and the excellent acting were quite impressive. <br /> <br /> I would have to agree with some of the other comments here that question why all these women were playing with such a despicable character. <BR> SPIKE ALERT ******** I was also hoping that Dylan would have been killed by William when he had the chance! ************************************************** ** Keira Knightley did a great job and radiated the beauty and innocence of the screen, but it was the performance of Sienna Miller who really deserved the Oscar. <br /> <br /> I am sure that this production will be indicated for other prizes.
