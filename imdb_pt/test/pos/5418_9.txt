Dude, I'm happy to be able to leave feedback for this 10-minute game. I love it. <br /> <br /> After not seeing him in years, I came across him the other day and watched him over and over. <br /> <br /> 'Stop shaking your eyes' and 'shake up a rock and roll band' and 'stop sawing the table' are classic lines. <br /> <br /> The art is deliciously raw. The dialogue is sparse and wonderful. Just find and love. I can not recommend this enough. <br /> <br /> Thank you high school art teacher Sra Kogan for showing us this over and over. Thanks NFB for letting this be done. Thanks MTS for showing it (for free at the moment, at least). <br /> <br /> I want a Big Snit T-shirt now. I would love a cell animation, but at 440.00 a pop, this will not happen. <br /> <br /> Find this movie, and watch.
