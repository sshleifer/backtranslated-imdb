This is a beloved movie from my childhood !! I can still hum the theme song at the drop of a hat !! I remember staying up late to watch this movie with my dad, usually two to three times a year. We always refer to it as "Giant Robot". Although the effects of this film are gross compared to today's standards, they were perfect for the genre of this film. I'm also a big fan of the Japanese "Monster" movies, so this movie fell to the side of others. It's been years since I've seen this movie and I'd love to put my hands on a copy of it to share with my 8-year-old daughter.
