Feisty Dianna Jackson (a successful performance of former playmate "Jeanne Bell") goes to Hong Kong to eliminate the evil ring of heroin that killed her brother. Dianna is aided by friendly karate master Joe (kindly Chiquito), faces the opposition of drug dealer Elaine (lovely and chubby Pat Anderson), and adores Charlie, an ambitious and ruthlessly ambitious (played with arrogant haughtiness by Stan Shaw) while planning his revenge against the nefarious drug kingpin Sid (an effectively viscous Ken Metcalfe). Director Cirio H. Santiago, working from a jovial script and co-written by none other than Dick Miller (!), Fills the bustling and busy 72-minute time with a plethora of free nudity and martial arts fighting scenes poorly staged (Bell is clearly duplicated by a crouched guy wearing a giant afro wig!). The definite and contemptible enhancement occurs when a topless bell alone attacks a band of thugs in your hotel room. Felipe Sacdalan's raw, grainy and scratchy cinematography, the awkward use of strenuous slow-motion, soundtrack, ridiculously inept fight choreography, and the surprisingly macabre conclusion contribute immensely to the utter and sinister amusement of this deliciously extravagant grindhouse exploration
