Beautiful movie feel good movie I had never heard of this movie but ran for it while looking for something to rent. I had high hopes for this movie based purely on Flex being in this movie. I've never seen him do anything worthwhile. It's true to form this film delivered to me. I liked the story. The movie is full of great actors and actresses. The hilarious Tasha Smith, Essence Atkins and, of course, Tangi Miller. I really enjoyed this movie. I did not give five stars because I did not discuss certain subjects that I thought the film should have detailed. The issue has apparently been resolved, but I would have enjoyed a discussion resolving the issues. I enjoyed the movie so much that I am now buying the movie after I have already rented and watched.
