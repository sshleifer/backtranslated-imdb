The first time I saw the Brotherhood of Satan, I was 12 years old, I saw in a small town in Washington state, who played before Tales of the Crypt that we left early because my sisters were already afraid of the Brotherhood of Satan. After all, I thought it was a really good movie. The beginning was good that we had just sat down and that tank made a number in that truck. <br /> <br /> What impressed me about the film was the scenery around the town where it was filmed, it looked almost like the area around Chelan WA where I saw the movie especially when they were driving into town of Hillsboro which is the location of the movie a small town in SW New Mexico. I always liked LQ Jones and Strother Martin and also Charles Bateman, who was in Get Smart, another program I like. I gave the movie a 7 and later, when I got to see Tales from the crypt, I thought the Brotherhood of Satan was better.
