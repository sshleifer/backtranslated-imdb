I was not expecting much from this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be more noteworthy. Its importance is mainly due to the talent and appeal of its star, John Garfield. <br /> <br /> Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is charged with murder. He must run away and end up on the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, but will the past reach you yet? Garfield was an actor in front of his colleagues. Before the term 'Method' was coined and before Brando shouted 'Stella!' it brings "natural" to the screen. His earthly quality and incredible acting talent dominate this production. It's also interesting that his role here as a boxer has the role of "Golden Boy" that he desperately wanted to covet on the screen. Garfield looks like the type and goes the distance as a boxer, proving his acting value. <br /> <br /> Ann Sheridan is here in a small role in the beginning as Goldie. I never thought much about Sheridan, but I liked her here. She plays well outside of Garfield. Dickson's performance is a bit tired and she does not share good chemistry with Garfield. The Dead End Kids are here, and Garfield looks like his natural idol (even more so than Cagney). Claude Rains is a miscast, and he seems uncomfortable on paper in many scenes. Strange, as he has always been such a dependable actor. Also interesting to note is that director-Busby Berkeley, best known for his early musicals with dancers and kaleidoscope images, directs a different genre here with remarkable ease. It maintains a sandy atmosphere along with admirable admiration. <br /> <br /> A very good movie that deserves more attention 8/10.
