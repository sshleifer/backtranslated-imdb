Like many other reviewers here, my memories of this show are universally hot. In fact, dear memories are so much appreciated that I recently bought the set of DVD boxes to revisit that joyous and carefree period of childhood, where I used to sit completely mesmerized, as I watched the continued pursuit of Monkey, Pig, Sandy. , Tripitaka and later Yu Lung, a horse / dragon / man (you really need to watch it to understand), when the much loved show was aired on BBC 2 on Friday nights, if I remember correctly. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm happy to say that even after all these years and now seeing this with adult eyes, more cynical (!), the show has lost none of its inimitable charm. <br /> <br /> Entertainment simply wonderful, from the magical characters and their comic interactions to each other to the perhaps not-so-special effects (which really serve to enhance the fun) and of course not forgetting the memorable title sequence of opening the first season, the passage of time has not in any way, form or form has diminished any fascinating charm of Monkey. <br /> <br /> As the Monkey himself would probably say: 'Hi! You there! Get out and make some nostalgic fun.
