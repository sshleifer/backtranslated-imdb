A full western. As the title character portrayed by Glenn Ford says, "No, I do not want to fight, but I will go if forced to me." This movie is about being smart, strong and fighting for your own beliefs. With courage, never stop striving for what you think is right. Great action and mostly fast. It's good to see Brian Keith in this role and Edward G. Robinson as an older Western man. Glenn Ford lives up to its western image. An extremely nice film includes non-military strategic warfare. Of course it is violent, as the title claims, but not very graphic as in the movies of the computer-generated era. It's mostly about strong personality conflicts.
