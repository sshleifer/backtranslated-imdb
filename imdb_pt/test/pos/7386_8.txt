Some things to play as a response to the previous person's comment. You just have to pay attention to what is happening in the movie. <br /> <br /> (I think they're spoilers) <br /> <br /> The red thing under David's mouth? Poison ivy, the wife says not to scratch, or "it will spread." David gets "insane" because the stranger is telling him to leave the house, which probably proves David's theory of a case going on between his wife and stranger; he runs after the man. <br /> <br /> David does not lose him in the woods, he just hits the stranger a few times and lets his wife pick up the pieces. <br /> <br /> Only the wife eats The Mushroom. <br /> <br /> I must say that after that point with the wife and the stranger, I began to feel disappointed. But the ending made up for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And for that and the last scene ... this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I should have gathered earlier, but I let myself be diverted. I was really surprised, honestly. <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting, to say the least. But if you're not watching this for the performances that the actors give, I'd say you'd better let it go, because that's all that holds that certain movie together.
