Time does extraordinary things. It is the final judge. The time granted "Married To The Mob" an extra dose of freshness. There are no dead moments or cheap shots. It's more delightful now than ever. Michelle Pfeiffer creates a mafia widow who is as far from a caricature as anything else she has ever done. A true original creation playing or hinting at the stereotype just to guide us, but your Angela is quite unique. The legendary Dean Stockwell introduces us to a mob boss who is as threateningly real as he is hilarious. What about Matthew Modine? Why did I think back then that he had no chemistry with Pfeiffer? I was wrong. They are wonderful together. They reminded me, this time from Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray of "Remember The Night," that I am writing this comment now to entice you to visit or revisit this gem of Jonathan Demme.
