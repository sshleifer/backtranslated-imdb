I really like "Random Hearts". It was shocking to see such a low rating on IMDB, but chacun a drop of son and all that. I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I have to admit he was sick in this movie, and the reason I gave 9 instead of 10. Kristin Scott Thomas, it was wonderful. She was believable and beautiful, despite being compensated for half the movie as if she had been crying for days. Could "Random Hearts" have been better? Sure, but it's really worth seeing.
