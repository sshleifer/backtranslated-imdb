I'm not sure what to do with this movie. very strange, very artistic. it's not the kind of movie you watch because it has a compelling storyline or characters. more like the kind of movie you can not stop watching because of the horribly fascinating things that happen on the screen. though the first time my wife watched it, she could not make it to the end ... very upsetting to her. runs a little long but still worth a sight for those interested in very dark films.
