This movie was great from start to finish. I was fascinated by the action, the dark humor and the incredible bad luck that our hero found at every corner. Thomas Jane is a great actor and I hope to see him in many other films to come. Reading other people's comments, I have to admit that I never thought of Tarrantino while watching "Thursday," but now that I think about it, I think there are some similarities. I do not think I spend much time trying to relate everything to everything else. The rape scene between Porizkova and Thomas Jane is one of the record books - the sexiest scene of all.
