This is largely the same creative team behind "Better Off Dead", but not as good as the incredible teen comedy. It's a lot of fun, but it's all over the place and it's not so funny. Curtis Armstrong is used for less effect (he was incredibly funny in "Better off Dead", Bobcat Goldthwaite is hilarious, Cusack is good, Demi Moore is Demi Moore (just with better hair here). Overall it's fun, and as a person of Cape Cod captures the feel of a 1980s Cape Cod summer in a very effective way. For some reason, this movie feels more "mainstream" than "Better off Dead". There is so much absurd left field going on here. you are a fan of John Cusack and Savage Steve Holland is definitely recommended.
