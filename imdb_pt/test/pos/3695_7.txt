Without going into the details of a good ... if a somewhat provocative TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among users that "there is no one to blame here". <br /> <br /> I disagree. Yes, Beverly D'Angelo's young male lover, played by Rob Estes, may be young and excited (and good-looking) because he is not getting as much as he wants from his mother, that does not mean he can climb into bed and to have sex with her daughter. OK, he can use the excuse that he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I do not buy. People have to take responsibility for their actions. Not only did he "cross the line" when having sex with a very vulnerable teenager, when he was supposedly "the responsible adult," he said, "Your mother should never know about that." How responsible was he then? Yeah, it's a good movie, but he got what was coming for him. Do not be fooled that what happened was "no one's fault".
