Age of Steel follows the previous episode, Rise of the Cybermen, which was excellent in some respects, lacking in others. The RotC had some positive elements, the most important being the Doctor's excellent portrait of Tennant. In fact, his kind of foolishness carries to this writer the shadow of Doctor Tom Baker, with his kind of subconscious apart (as when he points out periods of time when Mickey is holding the button on the Tardis), but leaves his own distance superiority to McCoy's doctor while he allows events to gather around him. Some critics and fans whose pieces I've read seem a bit disheartened at having such a young actor portraying someone who must be over a thousand years old, but I disagree. Tennant's Doctor actually "bears the weight of the world on his shoulders," as he points out in this episode, and one can see this in his almost presumptuous characterization, as when he finally confronts Lumic / The Cybercontroller at the climax. His kind of attitude "tired of losing his eye" is refreshing, especially after the excellent class of Eccleston pseudo-workers, bada ** interpretation of the character, plus the man of action than the pseudo-idiot of Tennant. Tennant's best moment may be after the end, when he is restoring the Tardis with his big goofy Baker-esquire smile as Tardis resumes. Here we begin to get an idea of ​​this new Doctor, a character that is little more than the different facets of a person's personality divided into 13 different people; some contradictory, some more pleasant than others, but all forming part of a whole. That aside, these two episodes were passable but weak. The concept of reviving the Cybermen is very welcome, and they look fantastic, but the plot involving a parallel Earth where this action takes place does not seem to work right. It is true that the allegory here of human dependence on technology and its need to serve it, as the doctor points out, is remarkable, but this could easily have been placed on contemporary earth or elsewhere. Some other weaknesses are, as others have pointed out, the ease with which Doctor and Co. comes out of tight spots, viz. the death ray of the Tardis component, the seemingly endless variety of uses of the Sonic Screwdriver (my wife laughed when they were using to burn the rope ladder at the end; she barely looked at the Who, so I had to explain which was traditionally used as a plot device to rid the characters of situations from which there is no other escape! Used here sadly). Some of the actors were wanting, especially Mickey, who really needs their due, and some of the supporting cast. Lumic was frightening, as he needed to be, his voice even sounded hotter than Cyberman. The score was horrible though, with the volume of the song often flooding the scene. Overall, I found Rise of the Cyberman more fun, although the second half was acceptable. The preparation for what we knew was inevitable works well, but the resolution was disappointing. Many improbable escapes, no development of support cast, and Tennant not enough in my opinion. This new show is excellent, and Davies is taking it in a good direction, but the dialogue (besides Doctor's) needs to be reinforced, as illustrated by Mickey's farewells, which were pure ham.
