The joke and humorous rescue scene help make this one of my favorites in the 14-film series. Great acting, great cast. And this movie contains one of the few notable facts about Sean Bean's career. The part where he and Alice Krige fell from the horse into the water was not scripted but was left because the two continued to act after it happened. <br /> <br /> This is a good continuation of the intense end of Sharpe's enemy.
