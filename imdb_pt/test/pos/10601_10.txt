I loved this movie and I watch it every day. I think even though the acting is not so good, it's really just a bunch of guys having fun with a screenplay. I've been looking all over this movie for almost a year, and when I found it for thirty bucks, I had to get it. It is now, by far, my favorite movie of all time. He deals with the failure of the relationship and, at the same time, makes a joke with him. I have loved every part with Don Vito, especially the one where Valo asks him for a grape when they are sitting on the porch, and He tells him to eat what is rolling on the porch. That really portrays him as he really is. The "Making Of" part really touched me, when they approached Brandon Novak's heroin addiction, and how much his friends and family were trying to help him. A new film that is in production, called "Dreamseller", is in production, which is about the story of Novak's dreams, broken by his addiction.
