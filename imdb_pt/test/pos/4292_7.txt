An old man is cycling down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, attacks him and continues driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit and what consequences that murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate lies is a very British film, in fact. I'm not saying that car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson portrays James Manning, a respectable, hardworking citizen with a "tough" approach to tragedy. His wife Anne (Emily Watson), who is twenty years younger than her husband, is more emotional, more impulsive and more prone to drama. The man who truly values ​​life in this quiet village is Playboy millionaire William Bule, played by a delightfully devilish Rupert Everett (most American audiences will forever remember him as Julia Roberts' gay friend who stole completely all the scenes of the wedding of My Best Friend's). In Separate Lies, Everett is cruel, cold and selfish, but it's an absolute blast on the screen. No, it's not as exciting as the title of a movie (Separate Lies?) How did they end up with that weird and weird title, did not they just have a marketing team, do they just care about getting people to see this movie ?), but beyond the title is a poignant drama about the power of forgiveness.
