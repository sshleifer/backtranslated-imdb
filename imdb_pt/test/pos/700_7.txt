This is simply a good ole formed western ... not overly complex or long term. Do not be fooled into thinking it was done, but for entertainment. Still, it's one of those westerns you can watch once and end up without returning. He has ex-partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford, whose friendship is strong, although Ford's Cheyenne Rogers was part of the bank robbery (he even steals Scott Sheriff's horse Steve Upton, unaware that is a good friend). In the red valley, Upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbery that ended with several dead. Claire Trvor portrays Countess Maletta, a friend of Cheyenne's who gives him and her friend "Nitro" (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams) a place to stay for now. Cheyenne wants to go straight, but finds it difficult when Jack Lester (Bernard Nedell) and his bad pack want to rob the Red Valley bank. In fact, it is Jack who is behind the murders, but Cheyenne's troubled past is hard to escape. He and Nitro will be charged with the murders they did not commit (the robbery was one that Cheyenne did not commit) and it will be Upton who must save the day before Lester comes out with the murder. There are subplots that include Cheyenne falling in love with Alison McLeod {Evelyn Keyes, the irony of the story is that Alison's father, Uncle Willie, is actually in collusion with banker Stanley Clanton (Porter Hall) in a planned robbery planned with Lester steal the treasure city of the Red Valley}. Will Upton discover the treacherous scheme of Uncle Willie and the banker Clanton? Will Uncle Willie be able to go through this without his conscience always bothering him? This movie has a great bar fight and a dandy of a climax shootout. Columbia could not have chosen a better genre to begin the coloring process, since this film has some beautiful mountainous shots, such as men chasing horses and such. Do not expect your socks to be torn off, but the film is simple and well paced.
