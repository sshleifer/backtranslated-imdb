I'm speechless to describe the beauty of "The Cranes Are Flying," but I'll try to write about it anyway. It is a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in World War II. It is the classic story of the lovers (Boris & Veronika) separated by war and what happens between them. The images in the film are so beautiful, that you will let yourself go - the technique of the film is in perfect harmony with the emotion. <br /> <br /> There are few scenes that directly portray the war: a bombardment - wind, lightning, explosions - that will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist, Veronika, who awaits the return of Boris; and there is another scene in the front where we will be confronted by an emotional / visual hurricane showing the images played in Boris's mind. Another scene functions as the film's leitmotiv and provides its title - the cranes flying in the sky. This image represents the symbol of nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film: do not lose hope and strive for a better future. <br /> <br /> Kalatozov is a great director, this film is visually stunning and also touched me deeply. It's not just pure technique. <br /> <br /> Tatyana Samojlova is perfect as Veronika. What else can I say? The film transcends the time it was made - the action takes place during World War II. But this could have happened anytime, anywhere. As long as there are wars (large or small), the film and its message will remain relevant.
