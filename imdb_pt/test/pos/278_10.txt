This is a very moving film that gives a new twist somewhere we've all been: a relationship that's about to end. Kristen Thomson's performance as Tessa, desperately trying to maintain her connection to Bobby for just one more day, is extremely compelling and moving and takes you straight to the story. Who was not confronted with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out loud: "Just one more night!" When he gives you another night, the journey these two people share makes you stop and think about how precious each relationship can be, and how each - permanent or otherwise - should be treated with respect, rather than just throwing away.
