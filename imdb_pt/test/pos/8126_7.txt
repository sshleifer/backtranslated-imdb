This movie was a pleasant surprise because I did not expect much. I did not know that some of the actors have become bigger stars in the big pix. Although moving to the Matrix is ​​not an advantage in my book (I hated it), I'm sure it's one more career for Hugo. James Purefoy is great at it and Jennifer Ehle is sweet and wonderful. It sometimes seemed like a joke on Carnaby Street 30 years later, but I liked Janis Joplin's clothes that blended with the modern sexual and gender blur mentality. The real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with your lists is a lot of fun. The meetings of the Iron John mens group are a bit dated, but I still loved them. It's a social satire sex comedy in the best way and reminds me a little of the old "Carry On" movies. The British know how to make sex comedy and it is an old tradition, unlike the United States, which is very prudent to really understand that sex is funny.
