Some would argue that La Antena, by Argentine director Esteban Sapir, is an exercise in anachronistic futility; that although the silent films, to which Sapir pays homage, were at the forefront of the cinema when they were made, are outdated today, leaving La Antena a senseless oddity. <br /> <br /> I would disagree. Fervently. La Antena merges the conventions of silent cinema with the technology of the 21st century, becoming the last exercise of postmodern cinematographic production. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the timeless "The City Without a Voice," so-called because the citizens were left speechless by Mr. TV, a media tycoon / dictator with painted hair. The city resembles the title of Fritz Lang's seminal metropolis (1927), perhaps 100 years before the film. They are all expressionist skyscrapers, television antennas and animated outdoors. <br /> <br /> The citizens of the city are powered by La Voz (the voice), the only person with the gift of speech. Her face perpetually wrapped by a hood (kept even when she is naked), La Voz is forced to sing on Mr. TV's television network. But when Mr. TV devises a plan to steal the written word as well, La Voz and his son without eyes join forces with a renegade family in an attempt to give back freedom of expression to the people. <br /> <br /> Antenna is nothing more than pure cinema. Overloading the conventions of the silent film, Sapir must rely on images to tell his story. There is sound, most notably Leo Sujatovich's almost continuous score. It conjures up the best of silent movie music as well as naively working on the film's diegese, such as the horn of car horns or the rhythmic ra-ta-tat-tat shooting. And, underlying the whole movie is a familiar buzzing, as if it were being shown on an old projector. <br /> <br /> There is a fair amount of dialogue as well. But instead of using the intertitles, Sapir causes the characters' words to appear on the board. They are larger or smaller, filling the screen or hovering docilely in the air, depending on what is being said. Think of a more imaginative version of the Night Watch subtitles (2004). <br /> <br /> Fortunately, words do not distract images. Which is very fortunate, because La Antena has some of the most creative and original images we've seen for a long time, all captured by the sumptuous black and white photograph of Cristian Cottet. There are expressionist urban landscapes. The hooded singer and her son with no eyes. There is the abandoned antenna of the city, which looks like the decaying remains of some colossal spider. And there is the sinister Dr. Y, whose chattering mouth is displayed on a television screen attached to his face. <br /> <br /> La Antena has been criticized for relying too much on its images, while sparing allegorical depth. But again, I would disagree. It is true that the sudden appearance of a mind-control machine in the form of a swastika, or the seemingly crucified-eyeless boy in a Star of David, seems out of place, a bit exaggerated in what is otherwise just a fairy well crafted. tale. <br /> <br /> But the lack of obvious symbols (the two previous examples aside) works in favor of the film. It allows us to decide for ourselves: to decide whether we infer political significance, to see La Antena as an allegory of fascism, the danger of capitalist monopolies, and the power and responsibility of the media; or simply consider the film as being a visually stunning adventure through a simultaneously unique and familiar world. <br /> <br /> The explicit depth sacrifice in favor of unique images may seem like a compromise. But in fact, when a movie looks as good as that, it's hard to care. There is more imagination and art in every picture of La Antena than Hollywood can stir a derivative in. Summing up movies of nearly 100 years may be futile, but in doing so, Sapir may be showing us what's missing in today's movies. He may be telling us it's time for another artistic revolution. And he may be right.
