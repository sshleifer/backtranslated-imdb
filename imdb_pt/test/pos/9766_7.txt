I rushed to the library to check out this miniseries after I had just heard the wonderful "books spoken" full version of the book. The first half of this TV version is actually very good, but it stumbles a lot in the second half. The relationship with the administrator is exaggerated and conflicts are inserted between Jean and Joe that do not exist in the history of Shute, insanely in my opinion, since they greatly diminish the power of their love story. I was disappointed to find that Bryan Brown's wonderful Joe seemed much more arrogant and far less attractive than the man in the book, but Helen Morse's Jean was actually quite good. I think they would have to make it a 10-hour miniseries to develop the story of the outback correctly. But all that said, I watched it at least once and enjoyed its merits, all the while wishing someone else would make a remake less soapy.
