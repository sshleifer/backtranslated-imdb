One of the best. Direction, photography, an exciting and dramatic story, wonderful soundtrack and, above all, the incredible credibility of Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn, the best and most underrated actor of the "under-40 generation." After watching this movie I think if there is someone who could not have any doubt about the death of another man despite the ugly things he could have done?
