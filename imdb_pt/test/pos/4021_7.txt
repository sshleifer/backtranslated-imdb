Of the two Slaughter films, this is the best and even though it's hardly a list of Schindlers in complexity, it's very funny. All men are treats or villains and women are all just Hos and emotionally needy, for example, Slaughters Girl. It's also very funny and The Pro has to be the funniest pimp ever, you can not have enough of these hats, purple suits, gold chains and jive patois forever. The best part is where he has the Harem around him "DOUBE UNNASTAN". Everything about him is bigger than life and is reminiscent of Morris Day in Purple Rain. Jim Brown also proves that he is a particular idiot for all puppies and again he kicks his white ass in all directions. The car scene is very unrealistic that they survive unharmed, but hey, this is the cinema. Definitely the best film of blax and surpasses Shaft (1971). Even the first movie is very good.
