The Blue Planet series is undoubtedly one of the greatest documentaries ever made in the ocean. For five years, the filmmakers worked tirelessly on the series, getting images never seen by anyone (ie in the title, The Deep). <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend you to watch this series. Seeing the fish angler outside the little figures shown in the textbooks is really a delight, but just a needle in the vast haystack that the Blue Planet covers. From the ocean open to natural pools, coral seas to the deepest and darkest part of the ocean itself, the BBC takes the viewer on an almost magical journey across the ocean. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, one of my first dreams in life was to be a marine biologist, and after seeing this series, the dream was revived. I've studied the oceans of this world for years, and I have seen numerous documentaries about coral reefs and dolphins, whales and crustaceans. But on the whole, no one was able to capture life under the waves as well as this group of people. <br /> <br /> Watch the 'Blue Planet' series in its entirety, I promise you will not regret this.
