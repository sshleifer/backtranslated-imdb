Beginning in 1965 or around 1965, American films shifted to the shocking and iconoclastic that was great for the time - a kind of seed that would pave the way for bolder and daring dramas. However, as the very decade that gave rise to these films was so governed by their own convictions, most of the films released in that period have already dated. CACTUS FLOWER is no exception. Her own title suggests a "sunny" romantic comedy with occasional lapses in laughter. This is not to say that it is a bad thing: on the contrary, films on thematic subjects must begin somewhere and America is a culture rooted in specific traditions, themselves tied in deep hypocrisies, is shocked because of this when it sees a indirect reflection of the customs of the time. Meanwhile, European films approach these same situations, they look like a million dollars and have a longer lifespan, because what we consider scandalous, they shrug, say "Next" and move on. Toni Simmons (Goldie Hawn in her starring role), a very young sixty-year-old, continues with a much older dentist named Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), who has trouble engaging. He can not marry her: he is already married. Toni decides, instead of wilting, he really wants to meet his wife and "straighten things out." In the picture comes his assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (a luminous Ingrid Bergman, returning to American cinema after a 20-year absence), a woman close to her age who acts as if she and he had the perfect marriage and house. There is a reason for this: she has nurtured calm emotions by Julian, emotions he is not aware of, even when he asks her to play the wife to keep Toni from wanting to intensify their relationship. And then it raises the level when Toni's innocent actions divert the action to the unexpected and he introduces Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston) as Stephanie's "lover." By the way, Harvey is also an older gentleman who is having an affair with a much younger woman (Eve Bruce) whom he also lies in a very funny scene. <br /> <br /> It's funny how the person we're looking for is the one who's always been there. What could have been an ungrateful role for Rick Lenz, who plays Igor Sullivan, the neighbor on Toni's side, becomes the man who not only sees true beauty in fellow Stephanie, but the only one who saves Toni at the beginning of killing himself . And it is needless to say Ingrid Bergman's subtle and touching portrait of a woman who somehow lost her chances of love, who became thorny. (It's not a comedy thing, suicide. , who because of the lie told the other that she becomes the real person she was always meant to be. I can not imagine anyone else in this quiet but deep role. <br /> <br /> Movies like these can be enjoyed by face value and seen as an escapist fun - a product of their times - or seen the deep symbolism that, as its title, carries within itself. It's a complicated film, just as Hawn and Bergman's performance are equally complicated because they seem so simple, devoid of flourishes and poses, nor do they come out and proclaim what they are. His acting becomes "not really acting" but playing real people, warts and all. CACTUS FLOWER is a story that never seems to take itself too seriously, but it turns out to be profound and very human, after all.
