I think this is one of Burts' top five movies, along with Deliverance, Smokey and the Bandit, Boogie Nights and City Heat. He also directed this, so he had talent for this as well as his friend Clint Eastwood. I wish he would make more movies like this or even a sequel to Sharkys Machine than the likes of Stroker Ace or Cannonball Run II. This is a tough cop thriller, with Reynolds at the top of his game. Having beautiful Rachel Ward in the fame of Thorn Birds helped as well. Henry Silva is the bad guy and he always does a good job at it. The movie is also a great soundtrack too. I highly recommend this, wish it was on DVD in UK, an audio commentary by Reynolds would be great too. *** 7/10 ***
