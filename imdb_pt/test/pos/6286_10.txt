This was such a funny movie, it was soon forgotten, probably because there are so many comedies for teenagers and young adults like this. The film is not as predictable as you might think. Crawl is a little attractive, but fun and affectionate and, most important, a very devoted friend. Still, an unlikely match for Rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly gentle boyfriend at home. When he helps them feel more at ease in school, showing them around the neighborhood and encouraging them to socialize more, they become friends, but it's completely platonic. When she realizes that her boyfriend can propose, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her laid-back relaxed college life is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility. You kind of learn what a good friend Crawl is when he tells her that he will help her get married. When her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks the Crawl and puts it on the spot. He tells the whole family that he proposes to her, and gives her her diamond ring, which he takes all the time from him (he must have come from money or something.) Well, they never really show a close-up of the ring). The message of the film seemed not to be to judge people by their appearance and not to judge people before they knew it. Rebecca's boyfriend, who her parents love, became evil when we discovered that he drugged his new girlfriend after Rebecca, (Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so Rebecca would have finished with Crawl, thinking they were a couple. Although they were not, Rebecca was angry with him, which, when you think about it, was kind of unfair, since they were not a couple, but I think they were starting to like each other. And I think she thought there was more. The film never showed that they really did become a couple, they left it open for viewers to decide. They never really kissed at any moment, although there was a part where they almost did. This was one of the things most of the audience did not seem to understand. Many people saw and said that it would be a nightmare for parents to see their daughters bringing home or a shock, but they were just friends all the way through to the end. And she did not introduce him as a boyfriend; Still, they never told their parents they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did. Even if he never became her boyfriend, they could still be friends. In the 90's, for some reason femanin men were in, and there was that great type of stereo that the woman liked femanin men (not that there was anything wrong with that), I think it came from the fact that women like sensitive type , which Crawl proved to be, through his friendship with Rebecca. but when I saw the movie, I must admit, if I went for looks, I thought I would have gone to the first boyfriend. Still, it was a creative film, which tried to teach a lesson about friendship and to judge others.
