In the 1960s, this somber study of Joy, a young proletarian wife, was the introduction to the career of Ken Loach, who became one of the most illustrious and respected British filmmakers of all time. By this time I knew very little about Brecht, the politics or the reality of the disadvantaged, and I was quite impressed with the aesthetics of the film, its freestyle, its austere color cinematography, and Joy's monologues in front of the camera. I was also very surprised to find that Terence Stamp (who had become a celebrity, thanks to "Billy Budd", "The Collector" and "Modesty Blaise") had so little time on the screen. Although 20th Century Fox distributed "Poor Cow" in Panama, Loach did not stay in mainstream movies (which this film is hardly) and I lost touch with his films. I just heard from your hits, "Kes," "Family Life," "Black Jack." until I find myself in the 80's. The beautiful title song by Donovan, by the way, is available in his anthology "Troubadour".
