This is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'The Hollow'. It could be argued that the true mystery here is not one of Christie's best, but what makes The Hollow special is the characterization and I discovered that the actors here, more or less without exception, were perfect in their parts. In a uniformly good cast, it is difficult to select outstanding performances, but I must say that Sarah Miles is perfect as Lucy Angkatell. What is extraordinary is that she not only conveys the kindness, the lack of tact and the kinder qualities of Lucy, but also succeeds in getting the underlying truth that, in fact, Lucy is not so pretty! Megan Dodds is also very good, since Henrietta and Claire Price are very affected like Gerda. John Christow really is an enviable character, but Jonathan Cake, however, manages to make us see what his women see in him. <br /> <br /> As I said, the script follows the story very faithfully. The only disconcerting thing I found was that Midge and Edward's relationship really came out of nowhere and I believe some of them must have ended up on the cutting room floor! They have a secondary story and the main story is very well done. The whole thing looks beautiful too, really capturing a perfect English fall. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie in all respects and worth seeing.
