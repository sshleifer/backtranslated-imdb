Rose and the good Doctor meet in a space station that is on a planet that is practically in orbit in orbit just below a black hole. The crew of the station is as perplexed as the two new inhabitants. Appropriately scary in its atmosphere and it gets better when the Doctor and Rose find themselves trapped due to circumstances beyond their control and speaking through Ood's submissive alien race, something very dark comes from beneath the crust of the planet. I have not seen the second part of this par-parter I can not attest that the end is so strong yet. But it makes a hell of a start. <br /> <br /> My Note: A
