And nothing wrong with that! I cordially endorse the comments of Boblipton and Snow Leopard. <br /> <br /> I am very happy to see that this film is available on US DVD - I only saw this once - I convinced the Goethe Institute here in London to show it in its season Conrad Veidt a few years ago - and plenty of time to see you again. Barrymore is resplendent when involved, as in this film, possibly because of the sting of having a renowned German actor as a leaf. And Veidt is such a wonderful scene thief (he does not pick his nose at any given time?) This is one of the seminal movies to connect "Dr Jekyll" to "Twentieth Century", "Grand Hotel" or "Midnight"; and 'The Office of Dr. Caligari' or 'The Student of Prague' with 'The Spy in Bladk', 'Contraband' and 'Casablanca'. <br /> <br /> See!
