It occurred to me as the final scene of the movie froze to reveal the few details of Buddy Holly's death that there are still people alive who were in that spot in Clearlake, Iowa, which he remembered vividly. This has to be an astonishing memory, lent even more pungency to the lyrics of "American Pie," as it pays homage to the day the song died. The world lost a tremendous talent that day, lives reduced before its heyday, and we can only imagine what could have happened if the trio of musicians who perished that day had survived to create an even greater musical legacy. <br /> <I watched the movie today about thirty years after its original release in the movies. Thirty years, I have some trouble wrapping my mind around that. I'd forgotten about that much as I remembered some of the little things, like the cricket on the wall that was immortalized with the band's name. But most of all, I remember the song. It's hard to just sit there and not start playing the beat of "Oh Boy" or "That'll be the day," and we need to know exactly where the threat to our morale may have come from these songs. I'm with Buddy at least, how could they be jungle beats if he came up with them? Funny how each successive decade brought its own threat to the fabric of society - The Beatles, Motown, Disco and a whole host of other musical forms. We're still listening and dancing to the beat so I guess they could not have been so bad. <br /> <br /> There was another conclusion from the movie that I had forgotten. It was here that I learned to tap a phone on the table when the person on the other side was not seeing things my way. I've done this several times over the years, but until now I'd forgotten the source. Well, I should be fine for another thirty years now. <br /> <br /> You certainly have to give Gary Busey credit for his portrayal of Buddy Holly. Seeing him today, no one could picture him as the skinny rocker with the horn-rimmed glasses, but it was a characterization and performance of the tour de force that earned Busey a nod from Oscar. Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith are proficient as members of Buddy's band, although their characters stand behind much of the story. I liked the subtle ways that other musical legends were embedded in the picture, names like Sam Cooke and King Curtis, without ever noticing in their presence. <br /> <br /> I will always be a fan and follower of music of the fifties and sixties - 'oldies', they call them now. I think that makes me a bit of oldie too, but you can not replace the experience of growing up with the history of music that now reaches the big screen. Which only reinforces the idea that I will continue to enjoy the song until the day I die.
