A well-made melodrama that tells the story of Sally, a ballet dancer in the circus, created by performer McGargle (played by WC Fields), he in a top hat, mustache, plaid pants and proficiency as a juggler, Three Card Monte and the Old Shell Game. McGargle has raised Sally, who has worshiped him as his "true father" since Sally's mother (who was expelled from home by her father, a judge when she married a "circus man") died and left Sally an orphan. Sally is quarrelsome and loyal to McGargle, no matter what he does - but McGargle seems to feel some guilt about keeping her at the circus, not her own family all those years. When they end up performing at a carnival in the town where their wealthy grandparents live, McGargle takes the opportunity to "investigate" Sally's royal family with the idea that he can restore it to them. But the grandfather, the judge, takes an immediate dislike to Sally because he does not like a "show girl" - what a stern and narrow-minded man he is, a real job of that guy! Meanwhile, Sally is busy being chased by a handsome and wealthy young man's son who helped his grandfather get his riches. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie, with a few laughs here and there, and a kind of odd edit style (I do not know how to describe it besides showing long range plans so it comes back a few seconds or angle changes suddenly when a close-up is displayed). Carol Dempster, who plays Sally, is wonderful here - very cute and comical in her performance. BATHROOM. Fields, even without his famous voice, is very funny - the way he moves and his funny and comical reactions to things (like a puppy seen in a funny scene), we even see him juggling it. I love the few peeks in the old-fashioned circus and carnival that is shown here. The impression of this highlight on the DVD is very beautiful, dyed with a light sepia tone, and the piano score is really excellent, played by Philip Carli based on the original tips sheets.
