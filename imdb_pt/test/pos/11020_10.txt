I like movies about quirky people. "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is perhaps my all time favorite so you can imagine that I had a blast with this one. Definitely not one to watch if you want to walk smiling. This film is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are downright scary, even after multiple previews (because that sort of thing really can happen). It will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire ride. And after seeing the ending, if you are not deeply disturbed, you really should control yourself by a wrist. <br /> <br /> The acting was phenomenal. Marcy, with her extreme tourette case, switches from quirky-cute to totally terrifying, sometimes looking so out of control that she looks like the undead. Seth was great, too. The film's focus definitely does not fall as much on him as on Marcy, although he is the one who gains the most strength as a character on the rise. <br /> <br /> It's a classic love story. with some unconventional twists, and it's also my favorite love story alongside "True Romance." There are two negative reviews on this here but one of the people who did this review did not have their facts straight and admitted not seeing the whole movie while the other was just looking for some Hollywood thrills without the deep characters. (and maybe he was a little taken aback by the apparent superficiality of the plot, since the ultimate goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store). The point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something "normal" or "light". This is confusing and indie as can be, and will not let you go until the heavy climax.
