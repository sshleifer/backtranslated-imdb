The second episode of the new "Lost" gives you exactly what your fans lacked - a reasonable amount of fascinating action. From the first scene, you continue to see new features you did not expect to find. It is the best proof that the series, which is entering its fourth season, is still alive and kicking strong. <br /> <br /> Although producers do not surprise us with more flash-forwards this time, the return to flashbacks is more than rewarding as it brings some shocking facts. Flashbacks introduce some new characters, and the familiar end up being connected in a surprising way. <br /> <br /> The new characters dominate the whole episode and I can not say it does any harm. Your stage parts and actors perform very well, giving us a stimulating feel - right after the episode, you'll realize that the show really needed such people. And here they are. <br /> <br /> "Dead confirmed" is full of exciting action and very written dialogues. I'm sure I will quote the best scenes of the episode for a long time - they are so good that they stay in the viewer's mind. The episode is fun, smart and cheerful. You like "Lost", you have to watch. My vote is ten.
