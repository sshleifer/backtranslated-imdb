Anyone who likes a good performance and a dialogue will love this movie. Excerpted from Ronald's 'Taking Sides' Harwood, it's a fun and ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between two very 'atorly' types. Albert Finney is sublime as the despotic <br /> <br /> Shakespearean actor who hardly notices the world war around him, so concentrated is he in the fortification of his theater <br /> <br /> company and his own psychological collapse and emotional. <br /> <br /> Tom Courtenay is unmatched as Norman, the title "Dresser," whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but altruistic. <br /> <br /> You really need to see.
