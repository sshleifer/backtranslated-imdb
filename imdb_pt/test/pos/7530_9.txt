I watched this movie and I have to say it surprised me. It was very well done, with good acting and a deep look at Japanese high school students in adolescent love. <br /> <br /> The look and feel are very different from many movies, and you can easily get into the movie. Much of the emphasis seems to be on the story itself, which is extremely subtle. The main theme and relationships with other characters are somewhat complex. But the general sense of realism and dimensions still draws you. <br /> <br /> The main attraction is of course those who like something simple. That is not here. You have to be open to many things, including a new culture, to get more into the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. It's worth watching.
