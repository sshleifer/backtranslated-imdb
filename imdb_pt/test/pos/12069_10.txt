The War at Home is so good that it has become my new favorite show.Me and my neighbors Carly and April see us every Sunday and laugh how real life is.I love how everyone is so sarcastic and so worried and they deal with every little problem. Once someone does something stupid they never live it down and that's just asooo as family is. The father always harps on all three children over every little thing. I love how parents have no idea how to deal with children. It is so true to real family life and the fact that parents are so overwhelmed and have no idea how to solve their teenage problems just puts the show on top. The War At Home is so brutally honest, and so true to the world we live in that it has become a milestone for sitcoms to come. This is not Happy Days or The Brady Bunch this is real life.
