Brain of Blood begins as Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley) the leader of a country named Kahlid is close to death because of cancer, however, if he dies Kahlid will shatter without anyone to take them to the doctor Robert Grant (Niggers) and one. The devotees of Amir, Mohammed (Zandor Vorkov) have devised a plan to take Amir's body to America, where mad scientist Dr. Lloyd Trenton (Kent Taylor) will transplant his brain to a fresh body with a little plastic surgery. I know he was dead. Things do not go according to plan, like when it comes to transplanting the brain of Amir Gor (John Bloom), Trenton's assistant, brings a corpse to someone who fell off a balcony, Trenton needed a strong living body and there is no longer time he decides to use the body of Gor as a temporary interval until another more suitable can be found. Unfortunately when Amir wakes up in his new body he is not very happy with what he sees, I mean, would you stay if you discovered that your brain was inside a severely burned aberration? <br /> <br /> Also known as Brain Damage, The Brain, The Creature's Revenge & The Undying Brain This exploration film was produced and directed by the only Al Adamason and frankly, I am offended by the Pathetic 1.5 of Brain of Blood has about IMDb, personally, I think it's fantastic Fun in a so bad is kind of way. The very entertaining script of Kane W. Lynn and Joe Van Rodgers is as crazy and silly as they come from blood-soaked blood transplants sloppily for crazed mad scientists, from aberrations 7 foot tall acid scars playing with toy cars up 4-foot-tall assistant, from basement dungeons to rooftop chases, from car crashes to murders, kidnappings to screaming semi-naked women, Regina Carrol's hair that should have its own mention during opening credits for teenage girls trapped in the basement of Blood to Laugh - Hilarious ending that includes some deep and meaningful speech! It's all here and Brain of Blood has quality cheese emblazoned everywhere, if your fan of low budget budget flicks with a sense of fun then this movie should be right at the top of your list of movies' must see '. Despite being humbly 1.5, I'm proud to admit that I really enjoyed the Brain of Blood, I thought it was an absolute hoot to watch, it slows down a bit at the end with a few too many photos of people wandering around doing nothing. this point he moved like a rocket, in only 85 minutes is relatively short, it is difficult to guess the barmy plot and I think it is very funny. <br /> <br /> This is the director Adamson's masterpiece, as far as I'm concerned with Dracula Vs. Frankenstein (1971), which he did a year before that. Those who have seen an Adamson movie before will know about non-existent production values, cheap special effects and cardboard sets and all this adds to the fun, this film manages this delicacy between incompetence and seriousness to create a memorable viewing experience. I love the opening photo of Kahlid, which is obviously just a photo of the Taj Mahal in India complete with sculptural people in the foreground! Regina Carrol's hair seems to be a separate entity by itself, it seems to change styles between shots and it's downright awful, do not make me start thinking about your makeup job or what it should apply with an ink spray! There is another hilarious moment when we see Amir's body being transported to America wrapped in what appears to be an ordinary tin foil, because the question I asked myself was: Why? The effects are variable, there is a terrible-looking spider, Gor's burn-in makeup job is very bad, although there is a surprisingly bloody brain removal that is really impressive. <br /> <br /> The budget for Brain of Blood should barely exist, I must admit that I found the Trenton lab to be very good with several computers and medical instruments, although the rest of the film seemed cheap and unpleasant. The production values ​​are low, the song was taken from another film Beast of Blood (1971) and the acting is horrible, but in a very amusing way. Brain of Blood may have the best title for an all-time exploration film, and as far as I'm concerned, it's such fun nonsense that I had so much fun watching and laughing. They simply do not / can not / will not make them that way, impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good movie, but lovers of bad movies should enjoy themselves. I liked it but once again I'm just weird.
