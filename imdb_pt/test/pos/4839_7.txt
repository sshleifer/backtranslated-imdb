Look ... I've come to expect that this level of William Macy's performance ... the guy keeps doing great performances ... but MEAT LOAF? When did Loafness decide to leave Jim Steinman behind and throw his weight decidedly lower in Stanislavsky's wonderful world? Well, what can I say? I'm impressed. To paraphrase an old saying: "It's not meat, it's emotion" ... and Loaf is quietly showing off his acting skills. <br /> <br /> Laura Dern takes the look of the 40's perfectly here ... great work by the hair and clothing departments ... David Paymer is typecast but he's right about the money. Solid camera work throughout the movie. The plot is reminiscent of "Gentleman's Agreement" (post-World War II anti-Semitism). It's worth your time ... especially for Bill Macy's growing legions of acolytes. <br /> <br />
