One of the most lucid statements against the death penalty ever filmed, a frontal assault on the most repugnant way of doing justice. The final sequence, with that parallel between the crimes committed by Poncelet and his execution, is simply superb. <br /> <br /> No, and the work of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon? This leaves you breathless, they are two giants and their performances reach the highest levels of emotion. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins made it clear that he is not only a good actor, he is a good director too. <Br /> <br /> * My fee: 9/10
