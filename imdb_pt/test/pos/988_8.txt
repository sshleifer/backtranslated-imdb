This is a masterful piece of cinematic production, with many themes boiling and occasionally boiling with these warts and the study of the poet's bohemian and self-indulgent war years covering London's aerial bombardments and the external tranquility of a Welsh coastal retreat . - the boundaries between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and selfishness versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more. A subtle and mature writing that suggests and occasionally brings to the dramatic focus the underlying tensions are well served by perfect performances (in addition to Keira Knightley's oddly inappropriate smile, though perhaps under the direction this time, as the other characters often mention) . But above all, the exquisite visual composition of every moment, with the inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including scenes from fake home movies, is a wonder and joy to behold. It is as beautiful looking as a Bertolucci, but the relations here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than part of the master's work. A very rare kind of film nowadays - it catches the eye and stirs the emotions without abandoning artistic integrity and succumbing to manipulative and superficial shortcuts.
