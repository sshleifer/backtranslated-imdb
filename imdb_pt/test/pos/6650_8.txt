I really enjoyed this epic Minghella, I thought not so much as "The English Patient" (a modern classic). The first 20 minutes or so feel like strangers, but as Inman (Jude Law) embarks on the journey back to his love Ava (Nicole Kidman), the film begins by leaps and bounds and becomes a very memorable and thoughtful romantic drama. Apparently, it's fashionable to hate Kidman right now, but I do not agree, and she's right here. I really think that the romance between Inman and Ada is poorly developed in the script (they really do not get much time on the screen together to develop a relationship), but Law and Kidman give it their all and convince. Ada's journey is the crux of the film - she becomes a strong woman who can handle almost anything. Zellweger at first seems to be all wrong like Ruby, but she grows up in you after all and shines in many of her later scenes. The film has a beautiful photograph and scenography, but never really captures the true feel of a period piece. Jack White, in particular, has long, disheveled hair and the complexion of a pale rocker that looks completely out of place with the scenery. Cillian Murphy fans will love to see the talented Irish actor in a small part, and Natalie Portman really proves she can probably act in the most remarkable sequence of the film. It's a shame that in "The Other Boleyn Girl" she is so inadequate.
