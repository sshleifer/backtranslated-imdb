The first Disney animated film without the strong involvement of Disney itself, this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (I believe it is the only Disney animated film since 1940 that is NOT based on one previous film). book or other work, but it is an original story). As others have noted, the plot is essentially a cross between the novel in Lady and the Tramp and the story of the abduction / travel in 101 Dalmatians. <br /> <br /> But to overcome this flaw, filmmakers have successfully used many of the best features of most Disney animated films of the past 10-15 years: Phil Harris (of The Jungle Book) dubbing one of main characters, follows his duet with Louis Prima in the previous film with another here with Scatman Crothers. The visual quality aspect of this film is virtually inherited from the "Dalmatians" (with some nods pleasing to French impressionism, it seems), and the villain here (the butler) is very reminiscent of the film's henchmen too. (This is probably one of Disney's least memorable villains.) The main story goes back and forth between cats, and the butler's continuing difficulties with two rural hunting dogs (with great voice work by Pat Buttram and George "Goober Lindsey.) The various animal characters are similarly familiar to those who have seen "vagabonds" and "Dalmatians." The cat owner, though having a striking visual resemblance to Sleeping Beauty's evil stepmother, has none of the unpleasant traits of the character and appears as very warm and generous. <br /> <br /> The real strength of the film is the voice work, after going first to the use of familiar actors in The Jungle Book, the tactic is continued strongly here with Disney veterans Harris and Sterling Holloway from The Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor (who would make a very similar character in The Rescuers) as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp, all excellent here, particularly Harris and Gabor on the slopes.The idea is as excellent as one might expect, showing a variety of emotions. <br /> <br /> Smaller children may get upset with a few brief episodes (a high-speed train escape, a near-drowning one of the children), but these are not presented in a particularly frightening or somber way and end up very fast. Overall, there is very little of the kind of scary scenes found in many other Disney classics. <br /> <br /> A little oddity is the way some visual aspects of the 1960s culture are portrayed among jazz musicians in 1910. Paris; one can not help but wonder why history was not solidly established in the present, except for the great amount that Paris changed much of its appearance in the intervening period. It really would have made more sense this way. <br /> <br /> The songs, while enjoyable and sometimes very well performed, are not particularly memorable. However, the general energy applied here, the excellent voice work and the good animation contribute to overcoming the few small weaknesses. Far from the grandeur of the "10" classics, such as Pinocchio or Aladdin, and not exactly the "9" that can be given to the Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians, this is probably a marginal 8 of 10; maybe a 7.
