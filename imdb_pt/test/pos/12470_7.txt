Does this start a series (which I hopefully will continue every weekend) of movies that came out during my childhood? in this case, it's one that I've only been able to capture now. It was clearly the intention of the last word on the subject, which had basically been lowered to the hokum level over the years; however, in his uncompromising struggle for a serious approach (a sure measure that the protagonist is never referred to by the name he is known all the time around the world!), the filmmakers have lost the notion of the fact that the thing was mainly intended as entertainment! Consequently, do we have a decidedly subtle representation of events? more carefully for the reconstruction of the meticulous period than to provide a functional thematic environment for its mythical jungle hero! Still, Christopher Lambert has risen to stardom? as did another debutante, Andie McDowell, playing her love interest (called Jane, of course) ?? with the title role, with which he deals with sufficient credibility under the circumstances. However, Ralph Richardson (for whom the film is dedicated, this being his swan song) steals all scenes in which he is Tarzan's natural grandfather who, despite showing obvious affection for his long-lost relatives, can not forget tradition in an effort to understand their situation; the hero actually becomes much more comfortable interacting with the primates (even after he has returned home to save his foster "father" from captivity). Is the film very good to see (with Stanley Kubrick's cinematography as regular John Alcott, not less), presents a suitably grand score as well as notable makeup effects (by Rick Baker)? and although essentially disappointing as a walk in Tarzan, it still holds considerable value as a prestigious portrait of his era.
