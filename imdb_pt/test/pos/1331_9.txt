The film certainly can be a narrative medium, but it is by no means the ideal medium. Better literature carries a plot because the reader can provide the imagination needed to complete the structure. The film is most appreciated when seen for what it is: a series of grouped images. What Soderbergh does at Ocean's Twelve is to combine impeccable filmmaking technique with the flowing form of American films from the 1970s. From looking at the recently posted comments, most people expected a thief film, the Entrapment; it seems people really miss the grueling clich√©s of the novel disguised as tension between the leads and ridiculous twists, designed to keep the audience awake. Soderbergh's driving prowess is only the reason to see this movie, but close-ups of Pitt and Zeta-Jones, forty feet high on the screen, are not bad either. A real treat for those who love the flicker of lights on the silver screen, and a disappointment to those trying to make some movie is not.
