If you had a mother who described you like this, you might be wanting to hit her alone. It's how Danny DeVito feels about Anne Ramsey, it's just like putting the plan into action. <br /> <br /> And his creative writing class taught by Professor Billy Crystal gives you the idea. This is a vision of Alfred Hitchcock's classic Strangers On A Train, which gives DeVito the idea of ​​swapping murders with Crystal, who hates his wife, Kate Mulgrew, who is not only fooling him about an idea he wanted to write, but also continues with the handsome Tony Ciccone. Momma From The Train is a kind of Strangers On A Train, since DeVito seems to have fulfilled his assassination plan. But Crystal is having a problem putting Ramsey on the floor even with Danny's help. This woman may need to kill, but she's going to take a lot of it. The Academy's only recognition that Throw Momma From The Train received was an Oscar nomination for Anne Ramsey as Best Supporting Actress. Ramsey lost to Olympia Dukakis for Moonstruck, but the movie turned out to be his best moment. Ramsey already had throat cancer that would eventually kill her the following year, but look at the list of credits she managed to accumulate even after Throw Momma From The Train, she worked through to the end. I saw interviews with the two stars of Throw Momma From The Train, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, and both admitted that the performance of Anne Ramsey as the mother of hell made the film the success that was and stole from under them. Recognition of Ramsey's talent and performance is the best possible tribute. If Marion Lorne from Strangers On A Train resembled Anne Ramsey, Farley Granger would have joined Robert Walker to get rid of her. Throw Momma From The Train is one of the best black comedies out there, not to be missed.
