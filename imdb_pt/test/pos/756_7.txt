You will love or hate movies like this thriller inside a solitary asylum in a distant and lonely land. It's not so much a horror show, but a mix of scary images and wackozoid mental patients. "Scream" is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular classic drive-in, known for some strange and perverse behaviors. Notice the "judge" who is about to put the ax behind the doctor! Brr-r-r-r !!! There is not much to describe here other than some tasty and bloody goodness, but when you have a chance, remember the old lady's old familiar saying, "Get out, get out, and never come back!" Do not you wish you did not look in the basement?
