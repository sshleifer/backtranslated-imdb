I have not seen "Hardware Wars" in years, but I remember it as one of the most hilarious events of human experience, and it was soon. Every aspect of this movie was hilarious and was even better than "Star Wars". I laughed. I cried. After watching him, I asked a family member for a moment with three dollars so I could say goodbye (I'm kidding about the last one). I love it when Ham Salad's helper / co-pilot tries to eat Princess Anne Droid's cinnamon buns, and Darph Nader's character is simply hilarious! This movie would be great to watch back with "Thumb Wars", and I sincerely wish there could have been a "Hardware Wars, Episode II: The Referee Attacks". Was he there?
