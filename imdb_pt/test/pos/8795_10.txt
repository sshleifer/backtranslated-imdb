The only way to really understand and relate to the characters in this movie is to have experienced the situations in yourself. For many people, this film is almost a biographical simulation, a sort of snapshot of a weekend in our lives. (I did about 85 percent of the things in this movie and I witnessed the other 15 percent, usually all on the same weekend.) For me and others I know it's good to have this movie to remember, people we remember and nights that are blemishes and smudges, this film is from our generations "Studio 54", a piece to add to our scrapbooks to look back and smile. Personally, I'm glad these days are past, but it's great to watch this movie and say, "I remember when ........." Thank you Justin for doing this simulated biography of a weekend in my life.
