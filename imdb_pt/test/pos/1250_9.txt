Truly a wonderful movie. Bruce Willis gives his always brilliant power of comic and romantic acting to this movie-message and the movie brings hope to the losers that many of us know we are. A gift for everyone in middle age whose time seems full and still empty: there is more at the next curve and can be great, enriching and romantic. Leave the recent past and return to the lessons of the distant past and then take off on a favorite flight for your better future. If we could relive our youthful experiences, if we really remembered the events that shaped us, would we not find a special kind of freedom? Watch the movie, open the present.
