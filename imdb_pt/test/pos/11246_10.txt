The fact that the reviewers feel very strongly negative about the program is an interesting fact in itself. If you do not like it so much, do not watch it. <br /> <br /> Certain critics claim that you have to be a stupid, stupid or simpleton primitive to enjoy this program. Au contracire, my friends. I'm not saying that all competitors are smart. There are the smart ones and the donkeys. But I'd say they probably have an average IQ higher than the average reviewer on this site. That's right, I said that. There is much to be said about the science of seducing girls. I'm sorry, but please remove all the pieces of their asses, and realize that the reason you hate these guys is that they threaten you. <br /> <br /> Those alien to the social sciences, and more specifically, the science behind It is evident that the mating will completely lose the boat. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear: clubs are not the only places to meet girls. I personally think women who are worth neither go to clubs, lest they fall victim to men like the ones we see on the show. But what are men like that? Besides those whose games stink, they are the epitome of men. They are men who meet women in difficult situations. They are men who appropriate their own sexuality. These men do not beg their girlfriends not to break up with them, and these men do not say "OK" to the phrase "let's just be friends." <br /> <br /> Look familiar? In fact, these are the guys you are afraid of when you take your longtime special girlfriend to the club. We all are. These guys know what women like. (again, only those who have "game") <br /> <br /> And even those who are bad ... are worth laughing at! <br /> <br /> If you go to a club and really interact with the people around you, you should find this show fun. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm at a loss as to why there is so much hatred for this show. My best guess is that it aggravates insecurity in men who have had bad experiences in clubs, or threatens men who believe that women are beautiful creatures without resources who just want a cool guy to buy their attention. <br /> <br /> I personally love this show. It's pure entertainment and, best of all, it's REAL. It is a very insightful view of the latest state of sexual psychology. Sexual roles have never been so different from before, and this show provides a very real insight into this, <br /> <br /> I think it takes some intelligence to get something positive out of that show. <br /> <br /> This show attracts a certain target market, and if you're out of it, then I do not think you should get in tune with the show. We could say that about any other program, could not we? <br /> <br /> Grow, <br /> <br /> ApolloHelios
