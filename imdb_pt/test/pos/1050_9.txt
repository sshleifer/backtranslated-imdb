This is a delicious, non-type-like kind of movie. Well executed by all and populated by interesting actors. A clever witty script acted with the right mix of broad comedy and low-key humor. Keeps for repeated (annual?) Views. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** The re-make of this movie with the same name, directed by Arnold Whatwashethinking, is an unbearable mess - painful to watch - without a twinkle of the charm and wit of the original.
