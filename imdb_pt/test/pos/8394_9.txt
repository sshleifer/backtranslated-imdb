I'm a big Gone With The Wind nut, but I was disappointed that both Gone With The Wind and Scarlett's mini-series are so different from the books. Gone With The Wind left so many things in the movie that were in the book and did the same with Scarlett. Both were good movies, but I really enjoyed the two books. There were so many characters left out of Scarlett, and the ages of some characters did not seem to match the book. The timelines do not match either. Scarlett realizes that she is pregnant on the ship for Ireland in the book, but she notices when she is vomiting while she is in Savahanna. Sally is also considered an ugly woman as a woman in the book and the film plays Jean Smart to play her, who obviously is not an ugly woman. Above all, Scarlett is a good movie, and it helps anyone who has been disappointed by the way Gone With The Wind is gone, to see what might have happened if Margaret Mitchell had lived to write a sequel.
