This movie was definitely scripted with FF VII fans in mind. I am someone who has never played the original game and watched it with a friend who was a fan of the series. From a visual and technical point of view, this movie is as good as "The Spirits Within" if not better, but from the point of view of history, I was quite lost. A great weakness of the plot that stood out to me was the scene in which "all" children dying of geostigma were brought to the "meeting" of healing by the three Jenovites. Everyone said there were about 15 kids at all ... Hmmmm ... I thought this Geostigma was a disease of pandemic proportions ... I understand why they did it that way (time, budget, CPU), but it seemed tacky after of all the explanation about how the thugs needed to collect all those who had Jenova cells so that Jenova could reincarnate. The caption version we had (some internet fans) was a pretty straightforward translation and therefore probably added to my confusion. <br /> <br /> He made my interest in FF VII, however, and spent a few hours on the FF VII wiki reading about the main characters and the plot. After reading the Advent Children wiki, things made a lot more sense. If you are a video game or science fiction fan, this movie is a very good movie, but as a previous reviewer said, it looks like a 90 minute fight scene. You never get to know any of the characters, and the story seems to simply jump from scene to scene without much explanation, even though some explanation may be necessary. Thank God for wikipedia.
