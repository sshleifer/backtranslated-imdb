Ten years before "The Matrix" and hot in the cure for "They Live" came this brilliant piece of low-budget science fiction film. If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, David Lynch knows the style of making movies from John Carpenter that you will love "Split." There are moments of true genius in framing and cinematography. Look closely at a sequence filmed through wine glasses at an art opening party and soon thereafter a scene involving suggestion cards. The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society and wants to wake us from the dream. Similar to "They Live," "1984," and "The Matrix," it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by Big Brother agents who know everything about us and have invisible robot probes constantly patrolling the city. All this is revealed early in the plot. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker invented a drug that, when placed in the water supply, will awaken everyone from the illusion of reality. Along with the cinematography and ingenious ways the director makes with his tight budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues. I challenge anyone other than rewind, memorize, and quote the classic quotes from this movie for years to come.
