NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and woman starving for something more in their lives than they have in the present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene of the movie to the last embrace. The sites, the beauty of their attraction to each other when it unfolds when they meet for the first time, and the story that follows, and when they begin to get acquainted with the attraction they feel for each other is real, is the romance that is designed for an affectionate audience. James Franco, in another micro role, is the right cast, and the elegance of Lane in combination with the beach house is a true autumn movie of 2008 to remember forever, just like the NOTEBOOK.
