Warning: Herzog is a filmaker and as such tends to be a bit overly dramatic. Thus, obsessions about slamming doors may or may not be a real part of the character's life, but the dramatic embellishment of a filmaker - or both agreed to the San Francisco premiere. But Herzog's usual fascination with character, dreams, and perseverance is well suited to this story first published in Soldier of Fortune, and now a complete autobiographical book. (The Soldier of Fortune comment brought loud boos from the politically correct public of FS, and both the filmmaker and the main character had to assure the public that they had just seen the film, that SOF's interest was out of place - , this is not Rambo, just survival.)
