For cheese from the late 80's, this really is not so bad. There's a lot of fun and fun one-liners ("That was grand theft!" - "Thank you!") And Madonna does a good job; nothing worthy of a prize here, but that goes for both the Razzies and the Oscars. I am curious to know if the film would have been better received had it used its regular spoken voice (pre-British influencer) instead of the hyper-Bronxy accent used. Oh well. As a side note, I was able to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops for my work; he said it was a fun movie to work on, but it gave me the sad news that the actor who played Buck's delivery boy died about a year after Who's That Girl
