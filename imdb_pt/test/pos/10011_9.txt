I must say that every time I see this film, I am deeply moved not only by the four most painful years of Hongsheng's life, but also by the way his family handles drug addiction. It is also true that getting addicted to anything, such as drugs, alcohol or pornography, can not only hurt you, but also harm your most important people in the world: your family. As the family is the number one priority in Asian culture, it takes courage for the circle to come together and show a person how much the family loves him. This is really the first Chinese movie I really like, not for the fun, but the elements that surround it (excellent acting, moving story, great direction) make this movie worth seeing. What stands out most is that Hongsheng and his family represent the story itself instead of having some B movie actor trying to imitate the real person. Shows the genuineness of the film.
