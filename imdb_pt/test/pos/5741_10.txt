My partner and I sat down to watch this movie about a bottle of wine last Saturday and although we initially had our reservations once the story began to go it was actually quite exciting. The scene in which one of the characters brutally murdered by knitting needles was particularly shocking and echoed the work of new Korean wave author Park Chan Wook. The chosen weapon was a particular masterstroke and allowed us to see the psyche of "Grandma", greatly altering the connotations of a loving and warm grandmother in a murderous witch. The dialogue was incredibly moving and lyrical in expressing the protagonist's most intimate paranoia. Pavlosky's mise en scene selections further enhance the enervating and manic atmosphere of nightly events, matching Oscar-winning performances to create a thought-provoking and thought-provoking masterpiece. The finale, which I will not ruin for you here, reminded me and my partner of the institutional masterpiece of M Night Shyamalan, The Sixth Sense, for his mental shift that made me think weeks after seeing. Definitely one to watch, over and over again!
