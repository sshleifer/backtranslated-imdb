I served as a Corpsman on Parris Island in the late 60's, a little over 10 years after "The D. I." was shot. I was in some of the barracks where they filmed some of the inner scenes. I knew many instructors and many recruits. I think the film is as close as any movie to show the life of a recruit and a training instructor. Undoubtedly, I think it's the best thing Jack Webb has ever done. If you've been in the army, you need to see this movie. That's how it was. It shows how important it is to get a bunch of recruits and turn them into men ready to defend our country. One feature I find fascinating is that most of the characters are played by real marines, not by actors.
