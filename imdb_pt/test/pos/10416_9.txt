I fell in love with Niami's debut. I hope we will see more of your work soon. I was lucky enough to catch the film during her brief tour in New York and it seemed like a worthy successor to films in the mid-1980s as Desperately Seeking Susan and After Hours but with a gentle European condescension that made it all cool and fun . A strong cast playing mainly against the type was a pleasure. And I thought the complex inter-segmented plots were right. Sandra Bernhard does her best performance since King of Comedy, while Peter Stormare is hilarious and Ling Bai plays. Look.
