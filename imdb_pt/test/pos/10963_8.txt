In the final credits of "Shadows", after reading "directed by John Cassavetes", some white letters can be seen on the screen: "The movie you just saw is improvised," they say. I'm always looking for the fact that words are so important in the movies since the filmmakers started using them because basically there is no film without script and many other reasons. Cassavetes pursued the same goal, and he believed in the freedom of words; "Shadows" is the perfect example. It's a movie with no real main characters, no real real plots; is mainly people in different situations, talking. Yes, some of the situations are connected, but Cassavetes, apparently always in a hurry to talk, uses a fast-forward technique when the characters are going somewhere or escaping from someone and are not talking. <br /> <br /> Appearances are everything in this movie. For example, there is a brilliant track, full of jazz influences and many fantastic solos, and there is a character who says he is a jazz musician and plays trumpet (Ben, all the names of the characters have the same names as the actors) . However, we never see him playing trumpet or improvising with a band; he does not even talk about music and just walks with his friends around town. They talk a lot and about anything that is in their minds; going from how clever each of them is to the hilarious analysis of a sculpture. <br /> <br /> "Shadows" is funny in its intellectual references in parts like the one above, because these friends are not cults. The only significant female character in the film (Lelia), however, wants to be an intellectual. But again, she has a very interesting conversation with an older man at a party, about a book she's trying to write, and about how to confront reality; but nothing to do with being intellectual. At the same party, a woman is making an intellectual statement, full of complexity, and asks a guy next to her, "Do you agree?" "Yes," he says, but you can tell he does not know what she's talking about. <br /> <br /> Another character, a singer (Hugh), talks about his glory days on occasions, and we see him. perform only once; but there are no references to the music industry there. Cassavetes' focus is on the singer's relationship with his manager (Rupert), who most often involves conversations about trivial things rather than actual 'musical' conversations. Thus, the trumpeter's important business in "Shadows" is the time he spends with his friends; the intellectual pretender is his way of dealing with romantic relationships (one of the strengths of the film) and that of the singer is the bond with his manager ??? Apparitions. <br /> <br /> The reason why performances are not important in this movie is simple. Cassavetes needed people who could master improvisation, regardless of whether they were really good. I believe some of them are not, but they certainly know how to improvise in a scene, and you can realize how well they do it. "Shadows" is not about artists; is a way of making movies, based on the magic of conversation; and then you could say that the performances mean something. That's why in all the conversations the camera is like a stalker, constantly in the eyes of all the characters, constantly looking for the expressions that come with natural speech. There is a scene where the trumpeter and his friends are trying to catch some girls. They are three, so each of them sits next to a girl (the girls are three and two) at three different tables. Everyone talks at the same time and the camera shoots through the table, and sometimes the friends look at each other while they say what they are saying? It's natural.
