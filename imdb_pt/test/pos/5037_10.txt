John Travolta was excellent as "Michael" in the movie of the same name. I do not think a better picture could have been made. The movie was funny, still touching. Michael is a "human angel" (if so). Andie MacDowell is superb in her reporter role, going from disbelief to belief. Bill Hurt and Robert Pastorelli are great as fellow reporters, each bent on tasting the angel's farce on earth. Each of the support castings is wonderful, especially the older woman (I do not know her screen name) who plays Michael's mother! One of the cutest movies I've seen in years ... I've been able to watch this movie dozens of times!
