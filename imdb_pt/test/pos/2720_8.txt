exquisite!! in simple words ... both Aparna Sen and Konkona Sen seem to understand each other very well or maybe both are too good. This may just be his best performance as an actor and the best of Aparna as a director. perhaps better than you and Mrs Iyer. Konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali, the older sister of Mithi (Konkona Sen). Shabana Azmi made the most of Anjali's character because she had to play a strong, responsible and arrogant role of an older sister who had full responsibility for her family. Aparna Sen created the character of Anjali, a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life, her love for her family. <br /> <br /> Mithi's behavior was not youthful, for you can expect this from most people. Indian directors for this role. It seems that much research has been done to understand the role of Mithi, a schizophrenic. When sometimes Mithi is a normal sweet girl, she also frightens you when she is shown sick ... both sides have been beautifully judged and touched ... believe me sometimes you remember the girl in the Exorcist ... not that scary though .. General..Marvellous piece of work by Aparna Sen, Konkona Sen and Shabana Azmi ...
