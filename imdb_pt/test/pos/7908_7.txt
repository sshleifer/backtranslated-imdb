A difficult life becomes more difficult when the three children of a single mother are sent to separate foster homes after her untimely death. To stay together, the older boy plans a bold, high-risk escape to find a distant lost uncle - his only remaining relative. <br /> <br /> Your journey takes the three fearful fugitives into a desert chase in a classic, starvationless, desperate, terrified terrorist beetle and young man to lead, hunted by ever-threatening civilian authorities. <br /> <br /> What the film lacks in acting and entangled realism, makes up for the honest human need to be part of a full and complete family. <br /> <br /> Of course, the ending is forced and overly dramatic for the movie-goer, but each heart beats the same cry of family bonding and belonging. <br /> <br /> With all its weaknesses, I still give this film a strong recommendation.
