As the mother of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I love AristoCats. It's a film that does not contain double vocals, or almost profanity words, or parents who are functional idiots, or jokes about crushing or flatulence that are so common in today's "best" movies. The plot is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable and the various other characters are unique and catch the eye. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. The characters are very well released as well. I love hearing the velvety voice of Eva Gabor, and there are so many others that are familiar from childhood and also fit very well in the characters. It's really a movie about love, tolerance, manners and faithfulness. Who does not want their children exposed to these values? It's a movie that I do not mind watching over and over, unlike Happy Feet where I could not watch the whole thing not once because it was so annoying. I would like the producers to move to make the movies more like this.
