My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's quest for himself through the legacy of his famous father architect, Louis Kahn, who has died since 1974. The film develops slowly but perfectly, and what begins as a seemingly identity crisis lost forty years of age unfolds. beautiful tale with a much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps most importantly, the work of our life. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Louis Kahn before this movie, although I vaguely familiar with some of his works. Through the words (good and bad) of Louis Kahn's classmates, you have a good sense of what Nathaniel must have felt when memories are remembered and stories recounted. At times, it seemed that these people were telling Nathaniel how to feel about his father. As I listened to every memory, my opinion of this man ranged from beautiful to horrible, sometimes within a moment, then you have a good sense of the roller coaster that Nathaniel's emotions must have covered. <br /> <br /> The final sequence in Bangladesh made the movie for me. The reverence that the people of Bangladesh spoke about the work of Louis Kahn tied all the loose ends well for me, and, luckily, for Nathaniel. <br /> <br /> I think Nathaniel Kahn finally found what he was looking for.
