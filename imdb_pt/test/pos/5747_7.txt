This is a very "right" case that delivers everything almost right on your face. I am a Christian and I liked the movie in a way. He had an average performance of the main person, and was a low budget, as you can clearly see. It may be a little wordy, but the movie has some very good cars that rescue it from a lower rating of me. As a Christian movie, it was very good, but maybe a little correct in the message. The movie works best on a big screen. * SPOILERS * The fight scene with the two brothers can remind you of the fight scene between the two brothers in the Christian thriller "Mercy Streets" starring Eric Roberts. * End of Spoiler * I give a 7/10.
