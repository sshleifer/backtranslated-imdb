Though it was dark, depressing and sometimes difficult to watch, You're alone caught my attention and was pleasantly honest in your dialogue. This really captured the anguish of teenage romantic relationships. Also, the soundtrack was amazing. The lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bohl is the best actress I've ever seen. His convincing and credible performance made the film. It made me wonder if she really is a prostitute. Who knows. Anyway, the movie was worth seeing. LOVE, YOUR SISTER! Yes it's right....
