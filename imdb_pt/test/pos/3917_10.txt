This was the biggest movie I've ever seen in my life, the action was great, and I was so scared, there was so much blood. WHICH WAS VERY BIG, I'd see it a thousand more times, and Paris Hilton, D * MN, she's fine in that movie. But anyway, I would recommend it to anyone, even kids (like me). Adults like that. You'd probably have nightmares at night, but next to it, it's crazy, I can not stop thinking about it. ALWAYS BIGGER When I heard about it, I got up and got ready, and at school, I gave the pamphlet that I could see. I have my whole school for this. But anyway, I'd definitely say it's the wax house, be there.
