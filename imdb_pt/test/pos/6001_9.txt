Lemuel Gulliver (Ted Danson) is a doctor who disappears into the sea, leaving the pregnant wife Mary (Mary Steenburgen) behind. Eight years later, he appears disheveled and seemingly mad - talking about his adventures in the lands of the Lilliputian little ones, the gigantic Brobdingnags, the floating island of the intellectual Laputa and the Houyhnhnms, a race of intelligent talented horses who to deal with the Yahoos - a race of bestial humans - among many other adventures. The not-so-good Dr. Bates (James Fox), who has drawings about Lemuel's wife, has Gulliver imprisoned in a mental institution, and Lemuel, Mary and Thomas (Tom Sturridge) must find a way to prove their sanity. <br /> <br /> A splendid adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satirical novel, this film is a magnificent adaptation on many levels: history, satire, characters, the visual, the brilliant cast. It's simply a pleasure to watch, and it's almost incredible considering it was a movie made for TV. <br /> <br /> The film does a brilliant job of capturing the cruel satire of Swift, which cuts like a British hatchet. society of the time, but still resonates today. The wise Brobdingnags and the Houyhnhnms are almost perfect individuals who find it virtually impossible to understand why Gulliver speaks so proudly of the vices and corruptions of his society. The scenes in which Gulliver struggles to prove himself different from the Yahoos are perhaps the best, with a scathing satire in describing how they choose their leaders ("they seem to choose the worst among them ... who rules until they find someone even worse"). , go to war ("We only go to war for a very good reason - how they are weaker than us, or we want all their land"), etc. The scenes surrounding Laputa are also effectively made - the intellectuals are so wrapped up in their specialized fields that they have no time for anything else, and really have little common sense. And the addition of the asylum plot line adds to the story - Dr. Bates is a really nasty character, and when he makes a speech about Gulliver's supposed vices, it's clear he's describing his own shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The film makes use of beautiful CGI effects, and quite convincing, depicting the various scenarios of the novel with great effect. The contrast of sizes is done in a very skillful way, and all the worlds described in the story are convincing in their own way. Cinematography (particularly as it relates to asylum) and costumes are brilliantly done. The present issue with Lemuel Memories is a device that may be clumsy, but it works very well. <br /> <br /> The cast is truly wonderful; a true who is who of the British and American talent. Ted Danson presents an outstanding multi-layered performance as Gulliver, effectively showing his transformation from a person stunned by his strange environment to the lunatic state in which he was when he reappears, his rational and intellectual personality in the end. Best known for his work on sit-com, Danson shows that he is more than just Sam Malone with this wonderful serious-comic. Mary Steenburgen is effective as his wife, and James Fox is absolutely repulsive as Bates. The rest of the cast consists mainly of appearances, with Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Warwick Davis, Kristin Scott Thomas, Geraldine Chaplin, Alfre Woodward, Edward Fox and Sir John Gielgud being the most memorable - but even the smallest parties are very well played. <br /> <br /> Although not 100% true to the book, "Gulliver's Travels" is a triumph of history and images. Not to be missed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
