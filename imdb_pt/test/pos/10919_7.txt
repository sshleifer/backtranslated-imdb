In & Out was a funny comedy with good performances by Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Matt Dillon and Kevin Kline. The thought of Kevin Kline being gay was very funny. If I were him, I'd hate to say that I'm gay at his own marriage to his family, friends, and his wife. Very rarely would that happen. I also loved it when he was dancing when the voice on the radio was talking to him. I'd say In & Out was a silly comedy with lots of laughter and laughter. This is a recommended comedy and Kevin Kline had a great performance as a gay guy. Trust me you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
