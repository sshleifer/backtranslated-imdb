Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is quiet, an example of French transition cinema. A movie between the realism of post-war cinema and full magic and nouvelle vague symbolism. With some excerpts from the classic American films (but not imitating), the director tells us a story about love, crime and the importance of points of view. We can find great actors too (Suzy Delair is flawless). <br /> <br /> It's interesting too, how can we find aspects of this movie nowadays. The heritage of Quai des Orf√®vres is palpable in the tradition of Woody Allen. Plunging a crime scene into a picturesque environment. The naive ending is also typical of the good films of Steven Spielberg. And, finally, I would like to point out the sensation of the leaves during the photography session between Jenny Lamour (Suzy Delair) and Dora Monier (Simone Renant) in which the first confesses that she thinks her husband is being unfaithful and exactly with the woman who is photographing her. This scene is exactly the one between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in Closer (Mike Nichols, 2004).
