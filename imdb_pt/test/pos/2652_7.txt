A movie, in the first place, should be a good narrative. It must be fun - and fun does not necessarily mean "laughter," and that does not necessarily mean "light." It basically means that you are not bored while watching. As bright as it was in 2001, it's a difficult movie to watch, especially for the current generation (video-game-playing / iPod fumbling). Its slow pace and the amount of time, sometimes intolerable, required for an actor to perform a single action (for example, attempting to rescue the crew member floating in space) will increase his patience. On the other hand, the cinematography is brilliant, the film cleverly directed, the thought-provoking ending and the score ... the score is scary, especially when the transporter team approaches the artifact on the moon. Dude, I had shivers, big time. This does not happen when I watch movies and is a proof of Kubrick's directing skills. <br /> <br /> It's considered a classic, and many people consider it the best science fiction movie ever. That alone is a good reason to watch, if you have not already. However, just because everyone thinks it's a brilliant movie, does not mean you have to force yourself to like it. You will either like it or not. Maybe the slow pace is not such a bad thing, after all. Turning your attention to something fairly static and slow-paced for two and a half hours can teach you a lesson. It will certainly be a different experience for all these fast, fast-paced images we are currently facing (whether commercials, video clips or video games). <br /> <br /> I even think it's a "memorable" movie. But I'm not looking forward to watching it again anytime soon (unless I'm in a special mood for slow movies). <br /> <br /> So, 7 stars out of 10 of me.
