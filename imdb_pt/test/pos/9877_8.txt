Halloween 666 (1995) Criticism of the producer! <br /> <br /> Halloween 666 begins with a recap of the horrible ending of Part Five. If you thought the last chapter was dark, this one will really blow your mind. A mysterious "Man in Black" invaded the Haddonfield Police Department, releasing Micheal Myers. In the process, poor Jamie Lloyd was kidnapped by strange cultists. What do they want with her? Who knows, but let's just say that your long suffering will soon be over. Doctor Loomis is back, spending the rest of his years trying to stop Michael Myers from killing more innocent (good luck). A friend of Loomis, Dr. Wynn comes back after a hiatus of four sequels to help the good doctor. Another old face of the party a guest stars as well. <br /> <br /> This dark and sad sequel was dismantled during the post-production edition. For some reason, distributors felt that the end product was not worth the average time of the horror movie watcher. So they decide to dump it. So, after having the film on the shelf for several months, he put an egg at the box office. No matter what they did with the movie, they got worse. They should have done well enough alone. Hey, the movie company knows better than the filmmakers now ... does not it? <br /> <br /> Producer Cutter: Highly recommended <br /> <br /> Released: Not recommended
