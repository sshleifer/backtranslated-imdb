I've been waiting for this movie for so many years! The best part is that it lives up to my visions! This is a must see for any Tenacious D or true Jack Black fan. It's so good to see JB, KG and Lee on the big screen! It's not a true story, but who cares? D is the biggest band on earth! I had the movie soundtrack last week and I've heard it all the time. To see the film was pure happiness for me and my husband. The two of us met up with Jack and Kyle after two different shows of Tenacious D and I also saw them when they toured with Weezer. We left that show after D just played. No one can beat your show! Live the D !!! : D
