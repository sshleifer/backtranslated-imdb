"Murder Over New York" is fun, but not as good as most other Fox Chans. This movie would have better name, "Charlie Chan in New York," the movie's working title. This is Toler's chance to play Chan in the Big Apple. There's a lot to like here, though, including guest star Shemp Howard from the Three Stooges. <br /> <br /> This has one of my favorite sayings of Chan, "Coincidence as an old egg - leaves an unpleasant odor." Toler and Yung are good at this and so is the supporting cast. But there is little or no mysterious atmosphere that I look for in these films. Still, it's good to see.
