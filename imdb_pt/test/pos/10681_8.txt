Journey to the Far Side of the Sun is about the discovery of a planet on the other side of the Sun, which shares the same orbit of the Earth and therefore was not discovered until a space probe on the other side of the sun photographs it. Of course, two astronauts (Roy Thinnes and Ian Hendry) are sent to explore it, but due to a malfunction they fall and find themselves back to Earth only three weeks after six weeks of travel. Of course they are reprimanded (at least Thinnes is, Hendry is seriously injured) and grilled and asked why they returned to their mission but claimed that they did not. Until Thinnes seems to notice some very strange things about being back "at home". This is great if you're a bit talkative at times, and sets and feelings are not far from the territory of the Thunderbirds, but the actors will live at least once. It's not a great "Star Wars" type of production, but rather a quieter science fiction that needs to be thought a little. It is worth seeing and it is criminal that the DVD is exhausted. 8 out of 10.
