Considered to be one of the recent over-the-top dramas brought to us by Hollywood, this film stands out where others have totally failed (especially considering the most underrated performance in Natalie Portman's recent dramatic portrayal of character), this film is almost unanimously conducted by the chemistry that Susan and Natalie share. They seem to be so natural during the movie that you would confuse them with a real family. They go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in the story that it's hard not to understand their acting skills. I feel that the talented performances of these two actresses took where the story was missing and almost too familiar (clich√©d) and really saved the plot of suffering. I would recommend this movie primarily to those who like one of the two actresses or such an exaggerated drama.
