The young and ambitious nurse Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to work in a madhouse in the middle of nowhere. During the course of 3 days, she encounters strange events, even a patient in her room watching her, but she still remains. The mental patients are all with one small eye (especially by the judge), but my favorite was the old crazy biddy (Rhea MacAdams). The plot is good at best, and the acting is surprisingly good, but after a while, it's a bit much. But, it's still fun, quirky, strange and original. <br /> <br /> Note: The thing inside the basement is not horrible, so the title is a bit of bananas.
