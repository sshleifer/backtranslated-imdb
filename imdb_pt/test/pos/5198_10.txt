Stalingrad is a fantastic film, well represented and directed, and quite realistic in its approach to the various bizarre aspects of war and politics. This is along with "Das Boot" one of the best war films (along with the Finnish "Vinterkriget" ("The Winter War", in English, I believe)). It depicts the trials of some of the German soldiers who fought - and died - in Stalingrad and around the Second World War. There are no great heroes, no emotional inaccuracies, only the fear of death every day in the war. The mood of the movie is similar to that of Das Boot, and that should give you some tips on what to expect, I think. So, if you like realistic and non-Hollywood movies: Rent, buy, just watch! Finally, a moviegoer's note: for some of the reviewers' previous information, I just want to add that "Stalingrad" is not directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who did "Das Boot")!
