Do not watch this movie while, or soon after, eat. <br /> <br /> Having said that, Begotten will stay with you for the rest of your life, like it or not. Based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing more than man spreading above ground (to paraphrase the title / intro sequence), it will probably contain the most intense and hideous images you will see in a movie. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue, only image after image describing the cycle of life. The combination of black-and-white photo film composed of some truly chilling background sounds works to bring the creator's message home. <br /> <br /> The film begins with God (pictured as a bandaged and obviously insane man) opening his torso with a razor and subsequently dying in his own filth. After her death, Mother Nature emerges from her corpse to impregnate herself with her blood and semen and gives birth to the Man, represented by a larva of a human convulsing in the earth. <br /> <br /> The landscape is a barren waste populated by hooded humanoids that eventually happen over Mother Nature and Man. After a series of violent scenes portraying the rape of Nature and the destruction of Man, these humanoids continue to bury the remains of the corpses on the ground, and the cycle of life begins again. <br /> <br /> I actually rented this from Blockbuster one night, based on hype cover and content, but this is definitely not a Blockbuster movie. Do not expect narrative, dialogue or any punch. This is an intense image based on an obscure subject. <br /> <br /> I give this film some high notes for film and audio, but I do not think I'll be watching it many times, if again. I like my dark and unique movies, but this is exponentially more than I expected.
