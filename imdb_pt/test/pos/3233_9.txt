I read all of Jane Austen's novels every year since I was 9 years old and received the Modern Library edition of her work as a birthday present. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie because of its romance and music, which was, scarily, in my head. It was an interpretation, of course, not an Emma or a Sense and Sensibility, but something quite different and something that Catherine herself would have loved. And oh to be loved by this passionate Henry! This was the imagination of Catherine's Henry, and she is the romantic heroine she read about in her novels, and we were promised by the Jane Austen practice, which tells us at the outset that the unlikely Catherine will indeed be one. I wonder if Jane was being totally satirical in her novel. Maybe she could just imagine a certain Henry. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the movie for many years, at least a decade. But I've been craving it ever since.
