Despite some acceptable adaptations of the main themes of the books, THE QUEEN OF THE DRAMED / THE VAMPIRE LESTAT did not remain faithful to the complicated story of Anne Rices. The deep layers that make up all the characters were separated only by their surface, if not by a completely different identity. The chronological order of the main events of the film seemed distorted and irregular. <br /> <br /> However, there were some things the film did to deserve my rating of 7. One was that the film strongly captured the effect. which Lestat (among other vampires) had for the public, especially young girls. The film also did a good job focusing on the importance of heredity and the story that vampires were proud of. The scenes of sensuality were also atmosphericly satisfying. <br /> <br /> The performance at QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was moderate, if disappointing. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have an amazing chemistry, though they only show when acting is at its best (not very often). The characters are nothing compared to those set out in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. Also missing the emotional intelligence of THE ALL SAINTS FEAST, which is a shame because Rice's Book of the Damned had that, and more. <br /> <br /> This movie does not give everything it seems to be. The effects are boring and very disappointing. The extravagance required in many scenes is not given, and the dialogue is tiring. The settings for many scenes are not as I imagined them in the book, and I think many of them have not even been taken from the story. There are only a few areas of incoherence near the beginning and middle of the film, but they get very clearly involved, giving the viewer a full story (if they had not read the book). <br /> <br /> Some things I feel like the film needed to include a good original soundtrack (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein) instead of the rock mix; although I have no problem with some of the songs. Another thing that would have made the movie better is better to set the direction. The scenery was boring and uncertain, which is important in a story that circulates quite often. Overall, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was a daunting, if somewhat satisfactory, adaptation of the important novel. With a few simple changes, it may have been a very successful film job. I would recommend this movie to people who have seen the INTERVIEW or read the books so they can give their opinion on the adaptation.
