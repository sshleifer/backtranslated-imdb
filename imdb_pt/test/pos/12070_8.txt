This is not a great movie, as the cast (especially the children) admirably helps to carry on this very sad but artificial plot, full of clichés about clichés. Poor family in the middle of America of the 50's, mother dying, alcoholic father, 10 children (one of whom has epilepsy) and a terrible decision to make. It is very easy to watch and some of the performances of children are moving without being sick or naff. And little Frank and Warrnen steal the show for me with the last scene leaving me crying, no matter how many times I see it. A great rainy afternoon movie that I recommend to everyone. Only those with the hardest heart could no longer be moved by it. Not on par with Sophies Choice but a good equivalent of TV movie !!!
