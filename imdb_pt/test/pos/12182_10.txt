Personally, I loved TRIS MOVIE! My best friend told me about it, so I hired him to watch it. It's incredible! The music, the acting, the story aligns the emotion, everything ...... well, except for a minor fact. Absolutely no loyalty to books. I saw this movie before Interview with the Vampire and before I even knew the books, I was shocked to discover how many people really hated the movie. I quickly realized that the fans of the book were not at all happy with the infidelity, not wanting to be hypocritical (I hate the Harry Potter films because of the lack of loyalty of the books) I was silent. Eventually I got "The Vampire Lestat" and I immediately understood why everyone hated it. It's completely different (the movie Queen of the Damned is a combination of "The Vampire Lestat" and "The Queen of the Damned"). But I still loved the movie when I saw it before reading any of the books. So if you have not seen this movie or read the book, watch the movie first or you will loathe it. If you have read the book then you have every right to hate this movie.
