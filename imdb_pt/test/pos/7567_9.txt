First of all, despite the low rating on this site, I have seen something worthy in this movie and will gladly defend it. And no, I'm not connected to the team anyway ... <br /> <br /> I came across the The Wind DVD by accident, and I had the strong feeling that it would not be as well as the packaging of described. So I took the opportunity and was pleasantly surprised by this strange and different drama. I'm guessing that DVD marketing and summary have been the work of MTI Home Video to link a rental or sale (the slogan "Love comes in many forms" has been changed to "Terror comes in many forms"). Of course, rent and sales of smaller movies depend heavily on catching a person's attention, especially if they have never heard of the movie before (a similar case happened to the movie The ITEM). This is probably what is working against this release, as horror fans read the description of an "old wind" carrying with it "omens of the apocalypse." It's easy to think that this is what this movie is all about and turn some college students from history into savage savages who make a killing. Thus, at the time this review was presented, it is most likely the reason for the lower rating in IMDb. I can understand people getting upset and thinking they've been fooled by this summary, seeing the apocalyptic introduction but then experiencing a bleak drama. I can forgive the choice of marketing since I liked The Wind and thought it was a refreshing change of pace from Hollywood's great deals, it's just that if the target audience was given more attention, it could express a higher rating. The "wind" in this movie is basically just a metaphor for society, and it is the story of four friends who make some bad choices and how their lives quickly turn into desperate self-preservation. After going too far in 'teaching a lesson' to one of them, a death occurs and each person tries to save their own position. Manipulation between them becomes the norm, and in the end we see how self-preservation becomes their main motivation on common sense. Civilized to wild, basically. This is very apparent when realizing that the use of a knife, branches like sticks, fists and kicks are instruments of violence instead of weapons. These characters are, in a way, doing the wrong things for the right reason, just to stay on top of the situation, since they have already taken things too far. Although there are many implied violent images, it is interesting to see that there is an absence of cursing and nudity. <br /> <br /> What works for The Wind are the "unknown" actors. Larger stars were originally planned, but I think it works best when you have lesser known and capable actors. This way, you can get into the story without sometimes thinking "oh, this is Tom Cruise" for example instead of a tormented person dealing with an extraordinary situation. Even unusual conversations (such as between Mic and Billy in a field, and Mic confronting Claire in their bedroom) get along and feel quite natural in the strange universe of Fairview ... which has cozy houses, a forest and open fields. I was thinking of the calm landscapes that hide more obscure secrets in The Reflecting Skin, which director Michael Mongillo mentions as inspiration in his commentary. <br /> <br /> The Wind can pass messages without being heavy with it. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you look carefully, you will see many symbols and dialogues that other directors just hit you in the head with. I even understood the infamous "kissing scene" between Claire, John and Billy within the context of the story without being surprised what happened. I'm still amazed at how some people (guys, mostly) who complain about two men kissing on a scene obviously would not have a problem if the scene were two kissing girls. Everything is well dealt with here, and additional visions will make things clearer without making you moan and say "oh man, how I missed it ..." Things gradually sink and I enjoyed it. Or you could listen to the DVD's comments too for more revealed things! <br /> <br /> For those of us who "caught" the intentions of this film, the wind is a breath of fresh air (no pun intended) at a time when most movies are made to earn money and be heard beating other films from his "box office competition" standing up when mentioned on Entertainment Tonight or on CNN. Years later, it's always the great little discoveries like The Wind, which remain in my mind, unprocessed by star-driven blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Go beyond the marketing trick of MTI Home Video, and you may find this an engaging story. I strongly recommend it to friends looking for unusual movies like this.
