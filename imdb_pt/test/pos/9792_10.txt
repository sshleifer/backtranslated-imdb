I always feel like I was a kid, I loved this movie. I've always been a fan of Joseph Mazzello. the boy had pure talent both in the film and in Jurassic Park. I've been looking for the DVD or VHS to buy at a store near me I can not find it, I hope it goes on DVD! well anyway great movie. If anyone knows where I can find this, please contact me at wrp24@adelphia.net. Also someone can really explain what happened to bobby. was she real or was he fake and was he an imaginary friend and his escape? lol I'm clueless. my favorite part had to be definitely where they made the monster juice and poured everything on the kitchen is funny but also a sad part too because of what happens to bobby due to the mess .. I would have liked to see the expensive boyfriends because he did his part very well. I think her mother was a great actress. I think her name is Lorraine Bracco or some kind of name like that. Well, that's all, please contact me. <br /> <br /> wrp24
