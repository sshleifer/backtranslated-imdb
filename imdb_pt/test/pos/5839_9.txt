I can not stand people who comment on this program or other HBO programs as "too graphic" or "unnecessarily explicit" or that they contain "free nudity / violence / sodomy etc". <br /> <br /> Guess what? Life in prison is not PG-13. The "free" graphic content is TRUE TO LIFE of this situation. Prison contains rape / murder / drug trafficking and rains. If you do not like it, do not watch the program. I'm certainly no fan of rape in prison, but if I were left out of the program I'd be surprised and lend less credibility to the program. If the prisoners did not curse, it would be just silly. Of course it's a free language, but that's REALISTIC. <br /> <br /> The show is good, some of the viewers ... not so much, I guess.
