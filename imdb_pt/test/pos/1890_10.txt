Filmed entirely on location in Bulgaria, The Man With The Screaming Brain is a hilarious love story between two rich and ugly American types and a killer gypsy hotel employee. <br /> William Cole and his wife Jackie arrive in Bulgaria on a business trip and take a cab driven by Yegor. Things start to go wrong when Tatoya, the maid, murders Yegor and William and a wacky scientist implants a piece of Yegor's brain into William's head. Robots eventually get involved, like gypsies with broken fingers, head injuries, Bruce Campbell riding a pink Vespa with little streamers, and All-Of-Me-style physical comedy by a warring character with a voice in his brain that controls half of your body. <br /> <br /> The man with the screaming brain is an incredibly funny movie. It has the most hilarious tracking catch I've ever seen (when Bruce Campbell's character, fresh out of the lab and with a giant forehead scar and hospital blue pajamas, runs into a square and scares a crowd of people) passes murder scene that had the whole audience of screaming hearing tests laughing. The whole thing is a tumult from beginning to end and I would recommend it to any fan of physical comedy, Bruce Campbell, or B movies in general.
