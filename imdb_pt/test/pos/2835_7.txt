This is a brightly photographed western and rarely written by veteran creator of "Rawhide" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is his main aid in this regard. His strong plot can be told in a few sentences. An obstinate, cavalry officer, captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre in a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent to Tucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner to trial and the patrol is eliminated. That means the leader has escaped, and Lance now must lead a second patrol - and he chooses the men the fort can spare, a company of troubles - to defend the advanced fort that had been destroyed and save the command of another. attack, stopping the bottleneck in this sector. Like Lance, young Gregory Peck is very strong. Another in the big cast of this movie that really shows life in a cavalry post resembling an army establishment of heterogeneous and fighting types includes powerful War Bond as a drinking sergeant, Neville Brand and Steve Brodie as troublemakers, Warner Anderson and Lon Chaney Jr as psychological troublemakers and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Heyes as fellow officers with Nana Bryant as Colonel's wife. Even Barbara Payton, like love interest, has a difficult role to play; Michael Ansara is the captured war chief, and Jeff Corey plays the Fort's beater. There are actually two great scenes in this well-done western - the long section in the fort before the last patrol was sent, and that long patrol to the doomed Ft. Challenger itself. Once in the fort, Peck begins to deliver a great speech in which, at the request of the men he prepared for the orders, he tells each one why he took them. reading their deficiencies one by one; They then tell them why they think he sent their best friend to die in their place to take the Indian instead of going himself - and he proves them wrong for the rest of the movie, winning his solitary battle through intelligence and courage. The music of Franz Waxman is good, the qualities of production admirable; the discussion about what would happen if Lance took the warlord to happen is true; Besides this insoluble error by the central character, this is the great western. has been one of my favorites for fifty years.
