One of Alfred Hitchcock's three greatest films, along with "Psycho" and "The 39 Steps," "Strangers On A Train" is as brilliantly out of control as a carousel in Metcalf, and almost as deadly. It's the kind of movie you both enjoy watching, you can not even feel guilty about it until you have time to catch your breath. <br /> <br /> The best amateur tennis player Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets a strangely strange, strange louche named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train. Thanks to the gossip pages, Bruno knows all about Guy's problems with his not-good wife Miriam, and suggests they do each other a favor: Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Bruno's father, who wants to put Bruno in an institution. . Guy laughs, but Bruno is not joking because Guy discovers his risk. <br /> <br /> It's a great premise for a murder story, and Hitchcock gives "Strangers On A Train" a race for everyone worth, with the help of Walker, perhaps the best performance in any movie Hitchcock, including Anthony Perkins in "Psycho". While Perkins makes his mark restless, Walker as Anthony is a perfect at home, either killing old ladies at an elegant dinner or strangling a young girl at an amusement park. <br /> <br /> What motivates Bruno? Many commentators suggest that his apparent homosexuality finds a handsome pair in the face. Yes, Bruno lights up the old gay-dar, but Guy seems happy enough in the rebound of love with socialite Anne Morton (Ruth Roman). Bruno's interest in Guy could easily be envious, for someone making a mark on the world while he lives at home, letting Mother file her nails. <br /> <br /> "Oh, I certainly admire people who do things," Bruno purrs, looking like a cat staring at a mouse. "You know, it must be very exciting to be so important." Later, Bruno considers himself a "vagabond", quite precise, except for our interest in him, even when he destroys Guy's life. with his homicidal meddling. It is the biggest perverse tale of the underdog. There is a sense of integrity toward Bruno in his stubborn dedication that commands our respect and that Hitchcock plays so brilliantly. When Bruno walks away from the scene of his great crime, am I the only sick person in this world who is really happy for him? I do not think so, but Hitchcock keeps the story on a track that's sure enough to figure out how low we've fallen. We do not want Bruno to win, exactly, but we like his Ã©lan while he tries. <br /> <br /> Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough, to make each shot memorable. Hitchcock has always managed at least 2-3 good sequences of sequences per film; here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone. ("20 Big Shows" the neon side at the entrance says, and they're not joking.) Script, camera work, an exciting tennis match, the jaw-dropping figure of Ruth Roman, it's all too grand for a movie for to contain . Even Granger does his inexperienced kid stuff here with more laughable plausibility than Gregory Peck ever did. <br /> <br /> You can call it a clinic in the movies, but "clinic" sounds very annoying. "Strangers On A Train" is good nasty fun, all the time, leaving you with a stylish sting in the tail as you realize you were cheering on the wrong stranger all the time. Heck, I'm going to take this tour again in a second!
