Fans of apocalyptic films will savor this well-made low-budget thriller that is essentially a remake of the 1951 classic George Pal "When Worlds Collide." A comet is about to collide with Earth, and when his fellow scientists disregard his warnings of doom, eccentric scientist Peter Crawford (Dennis Hopper) gathers a group of private investors to secretly build an underground sanctuary. The story unfolds through the eyes of veteran Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) who inadvertently discovers the hidden sanctuary of Crawford and decides that Crawford is wrong to keep his project hidden from the rest of humanity. As the comet approaches, the theme of who should live and who should die makes an interesting drama. <br /> <br /> Although the special effects are not in the same league, I enjoyed the story more than the Spielberg War. the Worlds, because I feel that this script is better. Some suspension of scientific reality is necessary, but worth it for the development of a good story. I highly recommend this movie to fans of the genre.
