** SPOILERS ** Beautifully photographed from the love story of World War II with paintings by Norman Rockwell at the beginning and end of the film about how a "war hero" is not just someone who kills for his country but is also someone who thinks for himself and is not corrupted by the propaganda of war that is constantly drummed in his head. Marion "Hedg" Hedgepeth, Jan Michael-Vincent, is expelled from training camp after five weeks, and forced to wear a Navy Blue uniform that shows that he simply did not have him make the body. Humbled and despised wherever he went, when he went home in St. Louis and terrorized what his family, his father, was in the Marine Corps in World War I, he thought of him because he could not "cut the mustard" as a Marine naval service. . <br /> <br /> Hedg stopping at a bar and finds sitting next to him is a member of the Navy of the fearless and deadly Raiders Richard Gere, who a Hedge admirer buys a beer. Talking to Richard Hedge is shocked to discover that not only is he being sent back to the Pacific Theater after all the battles in which he fought, and combat medals that he achieved but his hair totally gray and half-thirty looking for Richard will be 21 next month! That's what being in the Marine Corps and WWII did with it! Buying Hedge with a number of drinks Richard grabs the drunken blue baby from the outside and ejects him from his Baby Blues and leaves his impressive US Navy uniform with some money for Hedge. <br /> <br /> As soon as Hedge puts on Richard's uniform, which fits him perfectly, he is confronted by this great drunken American paratrooper called Cement-Head wanting to have a fight with the Marine Raider. Hedge doing everything he can to avoid problems is forced by Cement-Head to gird him, after he himself breaks two bottles of beer on the cement head, to heat up for the big dispute between Marine, Hedge, and Paratrooper, Cement- Head. Hedge incredibly floors the big jester of cement head knocking him cold with a punch! "I think the trick is not to hit him on top of his head," Hedge told his, Cement-Heads, G.I's colleagues. Hitch-hiking to this small town of Bidwell Hedge warnings this camp from US military internment to Japanese-Americans who are there because they are considered a threat to US security. It is later in the movie that Hedge shows everyone that he is a true hero, not who the people in town think he is, risking his life to save one of the hated "Japanese" who, without thinking along with two of his friends, escaped the burial ground, where the hell did they think they were going anyway? Hedge risked his life by saving the fear-of-death Americans from drowning in the dangerous rapids outside the city. Hedge in his actions taught the people of Bidwell that not all "Japanese", even those who are American citizens, are evil and treacherous banzai shouting suicidal kamikazes as they thought in the newspaper magazines and movies at the time to think they were. <br /> <br /> Hedge starts a conversation with the very cute and beautiful waitress at the local Rose Hudkins diner, Glynnis O'Connor, who is crazy about him, who even Hedge thinks is not his uniform that he impressed she. Later, when Hedge admits to Rose that he is not what she and her parents think, an American Marine Raider, that he is Rose, then got to know so well the sweet and caring Marine that it did not matter to her. everything he was supposed to be, a Marine or a postman was what was inside his heart that really counted. <br /> <br /> The film has a series of touching and beautiful scenes between it. Hedge and Rose, which shows how movies used to be made years ago, without all the sex and swearing we see and hear in today's movies, involving two people in love with each other. The way the film is accurate, not false bullshit, shows the true feelings of ordinary Americans at that time in 1943 about war in general, and the Japanese in particular could not have been made with a I like more authentic and precise, as well as good. "Baby Blur Marine" does the best not to be politically correct not to show the actors and actresses of the film the same feelings and ideas in the time of World War II, as most people have now, which might seem false. as a three-dollar bill, to those people watching the movie they lived through during those momentous and momentous moments in which the film was about to take place.
