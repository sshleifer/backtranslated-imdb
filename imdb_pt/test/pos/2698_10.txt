Here in Germany, "King of Queens" has a great cult status! Almost all teenagers (and adults) watch the sitcom. It's really amazing !! Better than the other horrible American sitcoms like "Full House" or "Set by Step" (the only series, which is still good, is "Al Bundy"). There has not been an American sitcom in Europe that was just as effective as this really funny show !! Kevin James and Leah Remini as Doug & Carrie Haffernan are the craziest couple I know, Jerry Stiller as Arthur is the funniest "grandpa" I know, and Victor Williams and (especially) Patton Oswalt as Deacon & Spence are the most different but funny guys that I know. I watch as often as I can, and I still have not enough good humor!
