Not knowing much about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look upon it as a play of entertainment. I started watching it too late (recorded from BBC2 earlier in the year), but once I started, I had to watch it to the end. <br /> <br /> The downside is that it is effectively a court drama. - never my favorite genre - but is incredibly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well represented. Like a good novel, I could not stop. All the time, I would like to be watching in a cinema to do the justice of music and photography. What happened to your release in theaters? I've been an admirer of Chiwetel Ejiofor since I saw him in Dirty Pretty Things, and Hilary Swank looks wonderful in that - very feminine and sexy for a change (possibly out of place, but it increases the visual attractiveness of the movie). <br /> <br /> This image deserves a wider audience than it appears to be receiving.
