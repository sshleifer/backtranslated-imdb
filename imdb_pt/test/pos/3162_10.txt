A lot about USA The film can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between this country's attitudes toward war and a sort of Hollywood falsehood that glorifies things that should not be glorified. I'm not sure if I agree with the filmmaker's view of recent events (although I honestly can not always tell you exactly where he is), but I admire the unusual and artistic way of conveying the point. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry, etc. play a role as big as the visual here. Most of the time, the visuals of the story are accompanied by these audio elements with good effect. I'm sort of a radio fan, so it was gratifying to hear how the radio was integrated to the rhythm of the movie. In fact, most of the dialogue takes place over the story rather than the characters talking to each other. This does not mean that there are no "characters" (real people), but with the exception of "Jim", the protagonist (a kind of "60s", others come and go quickly.) Some make a very powerful impression, a taxi driver resembling a guru who seems to be the very voice of wisdom.When he starts a spontaneous prayer song while directing Jim to the subway, it is a very powerful moment.In the cover of the DVD, the quote "The danger is clear "from President Bush's speech that paved the way for our incursion into Iraq. In retrospect, hearing this speech at a climactic moment in the film showed how we live in a historically charged moment that will always be remembered.
