This is one of my all time favorite movies, if not ur in cars, then forget it! This film features 1 of Australia's largest muscle cars, the XYGTHO. Yes, then the performance is not the greatest - it was never made to win an Oscar. The action of the car will keep you coming back for more and more. There's a cool collection of muscle cars from the 70's and an Awesome '57 Chev - with a very cool driving cat! There is also a very cool song sung by Terry Serio, the lead actor. The performance is pretty funny when taken lightly, but the smokin tire and drag racing is the main focus of this film. Big fast cars with pure steel (NO PLASTIC CAR) and some cool street drag. I recommend it only for people who are in cars and not for those looking for a great performance.
