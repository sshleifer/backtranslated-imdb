This is a great Valentine's Day gift. A gorgeous guy and a beautiful girl fall in love as they try to win the competition in a baking contest. Very romantic. I have been a true fan of Costas Mandylor since his days at Picket Fences and he has not lost his appeal. Lauren Holly is still lovely and adorable and the two still have great chemistry together. The support cast was also good. Seeing all those wonderful desserts being made was a delightful sight in itself. I loved that Costas and Lauren came together to win in the cooking competition and in love. This is the type of movie that satisfies all palates, whether romantic or not. Hallmark always shows excellence in its programming and this is no exception. The whole family can see this movie. It also shows that sometimes love triumphs over any adversity. I saw myself sighing and wishing more for this movie and also yearning for those wonderful desserts. I highly recommend this movie for all ages. A great pleasure for all.
