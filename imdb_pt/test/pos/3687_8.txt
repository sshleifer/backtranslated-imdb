In Chicago, Grace Beasley (Kathy Bates) is a housewife who has a marriage of twenty-five years with lawyer Max Beasley (Dan Aykroyd) and a hysterical and psychotic daughter-in-law, Maudey (Meredith Eaton). Grace stars Victor Fox (Jonathan Price), who will perform a TV show in Chicago and give five spots in the front row on a TV promotion. Kate calls the show and wins a ticket when Max simultaneously asks for the divorce, claiming that their lives are very monotonous. Grace gets depressed, and when she goes to the show, the public is informed that a serial killer from Chicago, who uses a beast, has killed Victor Fox. With a broken heart, she decides to fly to England for the funeral of Victor Fox. , she realizes he was gay, and befriends his former teammate Dirk Simpson (Rupert Everett). They fly back to Chicago, trying to find the killer. This film is a delightful, original and strange dramatic comedy, having bizarre characters. It has tremendous potential to be a cult film with the presence of Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow and a joke with Nicolas Roeg's masterpiece "Do not Look Now," when Maudey wears a red raincoat on the side Chicago city underground. . The beginning of the film, with Jonathan Price singing 'Hitchcock Railway', is wonderful. I repeated four consecutive times. The cast has a magnificent performance, highlighting Kathy Bates, Jonathan Price, Rupert Everett and the unknown Meredith Eaton. In fact, this movie is an excellent entertainment. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Love to All Proof' ('Love to Proof')
