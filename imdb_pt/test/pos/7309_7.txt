The film begins with a sloppy housewife (Norma Shearer) discovering that her husband (Rod La Rocque) was betraying her. Three years have passed and apparently they have divorced during these years due to infidelity. Strangely, during this period, La Rocque did not see Shearer or her two sons while Shearer took them to Paris. Marie Dressler is a wealthy lady of society and she invited a new and improved Norma to come home for the weekend - supposedly to help Marie break a romance between her daughter and La Rocque! Apparently, Norma is now a super vampire and with her magical sex appeal, she can break the romance - and no one seems to realize that she and La Rocque were married. Several others are there for the weekend and immediately Norma is a success with her gay and carefree ways - and almost all men (including La Rocque) are captivated by her. Neither of them says they were married, but it's obvious she wants the new and improved Norma back! This film is a sophisticated comedy of manners among the upper layers - similar, to a certain extent, to THE RULES OF THE GAME, by Jean Renoir. Oddly enough, despite the gravity of the Depression, these films about very rich people were very popular, though many today find them a little too fun. However, fortunately, in LET US BE GAY, there are many funny and cute moments (particularly at the end, when Marie Dressler shows her true colors). Although not a great movie, it certainly is good and more than just another time-passer. My only regret is that I did not love the ending. You just have to see for yourself - maybe you agree with the ending, maybe you do not go, but I'm sure you'll like this clever movie.
