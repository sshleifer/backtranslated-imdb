Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I start? Years of hard work paid off in what is undoubtedly one of the best documentaries ever created. <br /> <br /> The images and sounds featured on the Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough label, are rare and not even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type that "wants to know." <br /> <br /> Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, though. It gets a bit repetitive after the third episode. In how many different sea creatures can swim, kill, poop, mate and lay eggs, and all these ways really need to be explored? But if you have a deep interest in marine life, this repetition should not become a problem for you.
