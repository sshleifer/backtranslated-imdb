Little Vera is the story of a Russian teenager, her family and her attempts to find meaning and value in an increasingly decadent life. In her quest for meaning, she falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious Sergei, whose hatred for her deeply flawed parents quickly gets out of control. <br /> <br /> Little Vera is shocking and disturbing in almost every respect. The father's drinking, the mother's lack of understanding and lack of understanding, her brother's casual lies and misdirection, and Vera herself, forgiving them of all their faults, are shocking and slightly disturbing to behold. However, the raw honesty of the movie somehow manages to become even more shocking than the plot or the characters. Set in tight spaces and vast urban decay, Little Vera presented a very different vision of Soviet life than had ever been seen before. In fact, Little Vera is a picture of the collapse of Soviet society painted in shades of pain, despair and rust. It is the implosion of a familiar set against the implosion of an entire social order. <br /> <br /> Although painful and desperately unsatisfactory, the film itself is definitely worth seeing, even if it is to understand the feelings and cultures that still reshape Russia. today.
