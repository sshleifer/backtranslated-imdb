This is the latest film from a trilogy by the brilliant Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose latest film, Mayis Sikintisi - which was very Cehovian - was shown at prestigious film festivals. Unlike his previous films, Uzak's story is set in Istanbul, one of the most populous cities in the world. However, in Ceylan's film, we see only small traces of that huge crowd. Instead, he chooses to focus on two characters, a photographer and one of his relatives who comes from his small village to find a job on transatlantic ships. The photographer, whom we understand has also immigrated to the city, seems to be inhabited by the customs of city life, not just in the material sense. In his relationship with his relative, we see him first as caring and tolerant, yet when he can not find a job, our suburban character begins to be disturbed by sharing his private 'space' with someone whose departure date becomes ambiguous . I will not reveal the tactics he develops to take his kin out of his life to avoid any harm to his viewing pleasure, but suffice it to say that Ceylan shows us the tactics we have acquired within the routine of suburban life; "tactics" to keep our own private space, "tactics" from communicating with other people, "tactics" to prevent our relationships from taking on a complex nature (since our own experience, we believe is complex enough). Ceylan's film presents a clear picture of what a human being becomes within the boundaries of the modern (or postmodern?) City, describing the two characters in different ways. But he does not condemn either of the two characters for doing so; on the contrary, he uses the power of cinematic language to underline this difference. For example, in search of new opportunities, we always see the character coming from the village in open spaces. Even inside the house, he prefers the balcony as his favorite space. On the other hand, we see the photographer always inside the enclosed spaces and usually in his house. Although there are more than 10 million people out there, and lots of adventures, lots of interesting things to discover (or is there any?), He prefers to sit at home, watching TV, etc. His house is like his temple, a kind of sacred place. <br /> <br /> All those who live in a large city, and aware of the experience they are living, will find something belonging to themselves in Uzak. If you like this movie, I'm sure you'll like the other two films of Ceylan, Mayis Sikintisi (The Clouds of May) and Kasaba (The City). Go and find them!
