I originally saw this in his debut in the UK. I was hypnotized by it, and it made me cry for the whole of its duration. I recorded it on TV for safety, but over the years, it's worn. And TV never seems to show it. So it was a joy to discover that True Movies owns the copyright and was showing it on their channels. This time I recorded it on a DVD, so I can enjoy it again. <br /> <br /> Lucile Fray (played magnificently by Ann-Margret) discovers that she has cancer, and that it is terminal. The husband has arthritis and although he is loving, he is an alcoholic and would be unable to care for his children after he has left. Therefore, she has to find new homes for each of her children before she dies. <br /> <br /> The acting is top notch, the music is beautiful, and it has stood the test of time wonderfully (it still makes me cry!) If you have the chance, it would be silly to miss it. It's a wonderful movie! Must do for everyone !!!
