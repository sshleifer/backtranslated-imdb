What can I say about this movie except that it's a lot of fun! <br /> <br /> John Cusack plays Hoops McCann, a recent high school graduate who has two options, learn to deal with the family business of sweeping the street or spend summer in Nantucket with his friend George Calamari (played by fun way by Joel Murray) and his idiot friends. <br /> <br /> When I say zany, believe me, you can not get much angrier than the Stork brothers, Egg (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Clay (Tom Villard) and Ack Ack Raymond (Curtis Armstrong). Put a little girl named Squid and her freaky mutt and a great Demi Moore performance and you'll get the result of a fracture from your sides laughing, movie. <br /> <br /> Laughter flows freely in this movie and story line, although the typical good versus bad and good achievement, is great with the turnaround of a regatta like the showdown. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes loads of laughs and a good time. If you like to enjoy your movies, then you can not miss One Crazy Summer!
