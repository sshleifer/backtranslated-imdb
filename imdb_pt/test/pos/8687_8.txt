This is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. For starters, there are featured performances from the lovely Debra Paget as a princess / dancer, Michael Rennie as the villain, the handsome young Jeffrey Hunter investigating the crime in his / her city / state and others. The film is an extraordinarily colorful adventure, and we even see the princess rehearsing the dance she later performs (at least once). She can hunt Hunter before finding out he's on her side; also photography, Travilla costumes, Lionel Newman's music and the style of the film are extraordinarily good. Add to this stimulating action, clever characterization and excellent direction by veteran Harmon Jones from the script of Gerald Drayson Adams, set in 1249 AD, and you'll have the ingredients of a pleasant Near-Eastern Grecianized. But there is much to commend about the unusual and well-developed plot here, as there is much more to be commended beyond the accelerated pace of the film, well-managed physical action sequences and superior technicalities. Actors with a classical background, such as Michael Ansara, Edgar Barrier, Wally Cassell, Jack Elam and Dona Drake, are not commonly found in a "B" movie together; nor are there fascinating sets, a variety of locations and a mystery of quality that is provided here. One way to evaluate a movie is, "If I had the assurance of living the experience, would I choose to submit to these events and perform those actions?" Since my answer is a resounding "yes" in this case, this film remains one of my choices as a favorite and very underrated film work. Did the frequent disdain of American critics for women as warriors and thinkers, as in so many other cases, have closed minds misinterpreted the obvious anti-tyranny and pro-entertainment qualities of this stimulating film?
