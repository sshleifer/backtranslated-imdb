This is a great Italian shark movie is probably not a kind of action-packed shark movie, but it has a great story about a Native American in the form of a killer shark attacking a small beach community. The film has real scenes of real sharks and some not, but as they did this is very good the cast is not so brilliant acting in this shark movie, but it shows better acting in some other Italian shark films as (eg, cruel jaws, last shark) they show a bit of bad acting, but most of the Italian shark movies are good, which means that he is the best Italian shark film of all time, some scenes in this film show violence / violence which makes this movie good, let's just say this is the best movie for all shark movie fans.
