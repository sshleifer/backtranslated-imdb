A brilliant animated piece that was way ahead of its time, and certainly far ahead of anything being launched in mass production at the same point in history. The influence of this work on Tim Burton's "Nightmare Before Christmas" is readily apparent. One can only imagine how Starewicz went over every beautifully detailed picture of this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> There have been very few animated films of this caliber. It's a shame more people have not seen this jewel. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the IMdB now requires comments to be at least ten lines long, so this is the tenth line. This must be something new - but I really do not have anything else to say!
