After the success of the first two "Godfather" films in 1972 and 1974, respectively, did Francis Ford Coppola embark on an ambitious attempt to show the reality of the war in Vietnam, which ended with the fall of Saigon in the Vietcongue in 1975? ? The plot was loosely based on the book "Heart of Darkness," a story by Joseph Conrad about Kurtz, an agent in the African jungle trading company who acquired mysterious powers over the natives - Coppola retains much of that, including details such as the severed heads of the outside Kurtz's thirst and his last words, "The horror, the horror?" In the film, Sheen plays an army captain, given the mission to penetrate Cambodia, and eliminate, with "extreme prejudice," a decorated officer who became an embarrassment to the authorities? On his journey down the river to the renegade camp, does he experience the demoralization of US forces, drugged or drunk on power? Although, as a result of forced cuts at Coppola, the film was accused of incoherence when first released, was it the more serious attempt to familiarize itself with the Vietnam experience and a successful reinvention of the war film genre? In 1980, the film won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Sound? <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse Now" was re-released in 2001 with fifty minutes restored ?? As a result, the movie can now be seen as the epic masterpiece that it is?
