If you get the movie for what it's worth, you will not be disappointed. If you think Murray should win an Oscar for his performance and that's the kind of movie you're hoping for, do not bother. It was funny when I saw it in 1979 and it did not lose its charm. Good clean fun for kids and stupid entertainment for older people. The plot is simple and easy to follow. Murray did better, but this is his first movie. The movie reminds me of a time when we did not need the blood and the courage to have fun. Morty is the dumb boss and plays the perfect role. The other counselors are typical of teenagers looking to have fun during the summer. A cool thing about this movie, it has a message.
