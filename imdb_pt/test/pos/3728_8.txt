I still can not describe what I feel when I received this from the fnac site. A film so rare, so little spoken and known, is hard to find, even for fans, but the contrast between past and present is devastating: now I have a DVD of the movie, with the best quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought on the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights on my dvd and tv turned off, and I was amazed by the experience. I did not know what to expect. Evil, I always looked for some kind of disappointment when I saw a Luc Besson movie I had never seen before. But that never happened. This movie was no exception. From the beginning, I understood that the person who makes a movie like this as a first feature is bound to be great in the future. And so it happened. This has won several awards (including the biggest prize at a film festival in my country, which makes me proud) and shows that this film is preparing many bigger things. This may be the most original post-war film I have ever seen, beating Mad Max in originality and artistic sensation. No problem with this film: its cinematography is cool, as well as the performance of the actors. I'm also proud to say that I've finally seen all of my favorite director's films, and I have a copy of almost all of them (Joan of Arc is still waiting for me to buy the DVD). This film is, above all, a work of style and dedication, which makes it clear why Luc Besson is a director of my choice: good taste, beautiful framing, excellent use of music (I was also amazed by the first feature film of Eric Serra) and the promise of great achievements. Gaumont did well to bet on his genius-boy, the man who would later change the face of the relationship between France and Europe between the films and their audience. Let's hope Besson starts working on a new direction project. I'll be the first to cheer him up. Until then, I recommend this movie to anyone who needs to learn a lesson in how good movies are made with little money. I loved the atmosphere of the film, which, by its black and white cinematography, suggests an even more depressed view of the world after the holocaust. This movie works by the pure magic of the movies: showing in photos what we can not explain in words. And I'm with all the people who wrote comments for this movie and liked it: good choice! A big hug for everyone who sees this and feel that some of their lives have been changed.
