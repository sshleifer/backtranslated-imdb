An event worthy of royal rumble <br /> <br /> 1. Edge Vs Shawn Michaels <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 A very strong opener ... the performance of the edge heel was sublime as it was during the rumble event. Full ID says EDGES NIGHT .... 2. Undertaker vs Heidenreich CASKET MATCH 7/10 Many people hated this rivalry, although I liked it, I thought heidenreich really played his character well. the game was not amazing in emotion it was up to kane and snitcky to get involved. It gets better as it continues. 3. Kurt Angle Vs Big Show Vs JBL (WWE CAMPETA) WWE TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 a surprisingly good game, as there was only 1 really exciting on the doorbell inside. clear course .... very good title fight .. good rhythm .. although a predictable end. but are not all the royal rumble title predictable matches. <br /> <br /> 4. Triple H (TITLE OF THE WORLD) Vs Randy Orton WORLD TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 actually not so good for the guys involved, it was in many Dried patches, Orton sold his concussion surprisingly, ending although it was a bit of an anti climax. <br /> <br /> 5. ROAD EVENT REAL ... by chance, during the other games there were some segments ... two that were really cool ... rap scene about Christian and warrior stealing flairs number 30 entry ticket . the event was good 7/10 would have a 9 if scene won but unfortunately my biggest enemy batista wins (although I understand why) .. vince descends and takes a fall and the whole arena cracks in laughter.
