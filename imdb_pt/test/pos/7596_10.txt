No matter if drawn or leelee are total babies, but there are many girls who are so beautiful and warm but they seem to be so nerds. This film is not a kind of Oscar-type film, but it has at least a good view of what life is like for young people or for "real" people. This made us laugh and learn to accept others as they really are. this movie represents the real world and what really matters.
