Being a fan of time travel stories I was surprised that there was no 'device' that sent Russell Johnson's character over time. He only appeared in 1865. It was a disappointing part of the episode. I liked the premise of the dangers of "changing" the future, changing the past. Other Twilight Zone episodes about time travel, such as "No Time Like The Past," "Once Upon A Time," etc., were more to my liking because of the uses of time travel 'devices'. Maybe if Russell Johnson's character were the same character he played in "Running," it would have been more acceptable to fans like me. As science fiction fans know, no character really has to 'die' in time travel episodes. All types of frames can be applied to these types of stories. That was the only flaw I could comment on for this episode.
