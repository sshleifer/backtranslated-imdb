This film is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. It is a story told in a constant rhythm, told mainly not by words, but by cinematographic means of expression. The perfect combination of spectacular special effects and classical music brings to life creations of the human imagination in a realistic and poetic way. The story itself is rather simple at first glance. As the title indicates, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. This motif was always used not only to describe a journey in space and time and beyond, but also had a rich philosophical meaning. The film is a poetic contemplation of the most exciting eternal issues. It is not just a person's odyssey; it's an odyssey of our kind. The movie is great by itself, but in my case, the impression of this will always be mixed with that of the book. I read this at age 10, really not thinking about problems like "what is the relationship between the evolution of humanity and the development of human morality." But the impression was big enough to make me fall in love with every genre of science fiction. <br /> <br /> The day I learned '2001' only has special effects Oscar and was not even nominated for Best Picture was the day that 'Academy Award' became completely two words that mean nothing for me.
