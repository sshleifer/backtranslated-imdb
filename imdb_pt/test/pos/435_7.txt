This was a nice musical about setting up the Moulin Rouge dance hall. In many ways, it reminds me of Hollywood musicals of the 1940s and 1950s, where there are many clich√©s that lead to the inevitable conclusion ("is the show still going on?"). While of course none of this is new, it was enjoyable and well done. The musical numbers at the end are frantic and beautiful to watch. In many ways, it reminds me of a sexier version of BIG ZIEGFELD. In real life, Ziegfeld was a great player, but this was sanitized in the American movie. But in the FRENCH CANCAN, the characters have libido in full operation - but nothing is actually shown, so the movie is good for children. <br /> <br /> Nothing new, but well done, though.
