This was easily one of the weirdest of Ernest's films, especially with regard to production design. What happened to the pink guard uniforms? Unfortunately, this movie probably destroyed the Ernest series, turning the series into a series of direct videos. However, Jim Varney gave one of his best performances while playing Nash, his criminal alter ego. A misstep in the series, but it was not so bad in many ways (the Electro Man routine was classic)
