Ross's musical remake of 1937, based on James Hilton's long-standing bestseller, was rejected by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding a reaction against musicals in general that have given the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. A group of different British and American individuals ends up on an emergency flight from a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes into a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue group arrives and takes the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are young and happy. Some of the class cast's performances are not so elegant (the effervescent mood of the play, Burt Bacharach-Hal David's harmonious melodies, as well as the lightweight direction conspire to make the artists look a bit foolish). Peter Finch is the international peacekeeper who engages in a somewhat constipated romance with resident Liv Ullmann; Sally Kellerman is a malcontent who spits out phrases such as, "I got tired of taking pictures of people with their heads pulled out, so people with heads STILL attached - and usually under hair dryers - could take one last kick before they turn around for the most recent revenue "; John Gieguld "as Chang", an Asian who learned to speak English while studying at Oxford, is humorous (but why are there no songs for Chang?). Hal David's dopey lyrics are sometimes jaw-dropping ("On the Good Ship Lollipop / How does Christopher Columbus navigate across the sea?") And the rhythm is mired in all that talk about the outside world and how nothing is most regrettable today. However, the production is exuberant and the general handling affects strangely. The two-dimensional characters are so serious that they become catchy, and the film's nonsense is contagious. This turns out to be a lot of fun. *** in ****
