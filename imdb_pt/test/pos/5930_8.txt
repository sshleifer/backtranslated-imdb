This year's Royal Rumble was not too bad, but last year was definitely much better. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH SHAWN MICHAELS VS. EDGE Even though this game took a little too long, it was still okay. Edge wins after using the ropes to arrest Shawn Michaels. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND MATCH- UNDERTAKER VS. HEIDENREICH IN A CASKET MATCH Now I really do not like Casket games, this game was boring and sloppy, but in the end he picked up the pace as Undertaker nailed the Tombstone, then rolled Heidenreich into the coffin for the win. 4/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD MATCH- JBL VS. KURT ANGLE VS. GREAT SHOW IN A TRIP-THREAT MATCH FOR THE WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP It's not a bad triple-threat game. Too bad JBL wins again to maintain his title after taking the Clothesline From Hell on Angle to victory. 5/10 <br /> <br /> QUARTO MATCH- RANDY ORTON VS. TRIPLE H FOR THE HEAVY WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP Great game for these two men, the game was a bit sloppy, but it was still good and it took a lot to the end. Even Orton lost the game was fast and great in the end. HHH nails the pedigree in Orton for the win to maintain his world title. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH-ROYAL RUMBLE This was a cool Royal Rumble {Every Royal Rumble is good}. After 30 men entered, the last four Rumble superstars were Cena, Edge, Mysterio and Batista. Edge was able to launch Mysterio, after Batista and Cena razed Edge together. Now it was up to Cena & Batista. First, after reversing an F-U, Batista went to Batista's bomb, but suddenly the two men collapsed outside at the same time. After a controversial decision and Mr. McMahon making his way to the ring to settle the matter. The game was restarted again when Batista & Cena fought, but Batista took the best of Cena, hit a thorn and played Cena to win the 2005 Royal Rumble and go to Wrestlemania 21 to face the champion in the mainevent. 10/10 This was a very good Royal Rumble, but last year would always outperform all the Royal Rumble in history. <br /> <br /> General: I will give 8/10 & B +
