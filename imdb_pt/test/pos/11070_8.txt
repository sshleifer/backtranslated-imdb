I thought that Nick Gomez's look on the streets of New Jersey, where car thefts are on the rise, was both intriguing and entertaining. This is as good as movies like Boyz n the Hood or Menace II Society or Above the Rim. I thought the actors and scenarios were appropriate, had a realistic and very atmospheric air, either on purpose or by pure coincidence. I really enjoyed this movie, an understated gem that I found on TV and glad I picked it up. Go watch this movie if you get a photo. If they do not have a DVD, they should release one. Well done Nick Gomez. Mobile International Sites: IMDb Germany | My Account |
