I got this movie on location t.v. around 4:30 in the morning I had no expectations for that, but after the opening credits I knew I was on to something good. <br /> <br /> There are situations that are left to your interpretation to "find out" what actually happened, so your attention is a key factor. <br /> <br /> The whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and with the way things are performed by the main character. <br /> <br /> -consciousness also plays an important role because through a series of events and dialogues you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are very good. Very good indeed. Kelly Overtone is extremely sexy and she is sweet to the eyes even though she is most of the time in her white clothes. <br /> <br /> The fear factor is almost nonexistent, but there is a lot of mystery and tension to dig. <BR> I would recommend to anyone who likes supernatural and psychological thrillers.
