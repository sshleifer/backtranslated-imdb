then you will be a big fan of this movie. It's almost the same basic concept, a good mix of music, soul and drama. I admit, I was a bit apprehensive to see this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I'm a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I liked Hustle & Flow so I thought I'd give it a try. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I did it. It turned out to be more than just the superficial story of a southern nymphomaniac girl being imprisoned by a black man of 60 years. The story had a heart, and was very influential. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie also added a nice touch. Craig Brewer mixed his Hustle & Flow style in this film, except that he took a new turn and used the Blues. His musical scenes are still at the top of the charts when it comes to performance scenes. It also has very interesting flashback scenes and gives you a crazy feeling during some of the most controversial scenes. <br /> <br /> No doubt, if you liked Hustle & Flow, you'll love this movie, and if you're a fan of the blues you should definitely go see this. I give a 9 out of 10, very interesting movie, and it is extremely below average. shame. <br /> <br /> Get out and rent this movie.
