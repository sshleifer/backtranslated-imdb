I liked two of the three films in the trilogy "Sarah, Plain & Tall". This, the end of the three, was definitely one of the "good" ones. It is an excellent family film with wonderful acting by three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but well told. The only below-average performance was from one of the children. It was interesting to see how children have grown since the first film. <br /> <br /> Of the three, the initial "Sarah" was the best filmed with a beautiful cinematography. This movie did not have this, but it had the best story. He had some genuinely tearful sentimental moments and a very cool ending. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
