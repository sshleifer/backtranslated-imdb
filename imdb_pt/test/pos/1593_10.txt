Death in Venice is a movie that I need to see once every ten years. It's always different because I'm always at a different stage of life. <br /> <br /> The film is about art, beauty, longing, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others simply annoying to watch, especially if you've seen them before. However, I do not want to miss a single frame. Music is repetitive, the main theme of Mahler's fifth adagietto is used over and over again. However, I would not want to miss a single note. When the last image disappears, the last note dies, I become numb and exhausted. <br /> <br /> This movie is a monument to the cinema. As with most really good movies, the Saturday night crowd should stay away from it. And this is simply the best movie ever.
