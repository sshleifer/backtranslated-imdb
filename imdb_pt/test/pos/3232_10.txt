A film is beyond all expectations, an excellent insight into the human condition. What exactly leads Mila to have her ass painted. What could push a human so far away that there is only way to escape is to have the back passage painted repeatedly by strangers. <br /> <br /> This movie is not afraid to step on the square in the face of the painting of donkey. Simply breathtaking. Roll in the sequel or what comes next of the geniuses who did it.
