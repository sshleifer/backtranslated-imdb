A lecture on the life of the tormented wizard named Ray Charles. His piano wrists made music of fire and his nostalgic voice created exciting and cool songs. Each barrier that Ray was facing never stopped him, and he found his way through all the conflicts. A real lesson. A great team of producers helps to recreate the season and, with great costumes, hair and scenery, will follow the story of Ray believing his true direct shoots! Frosty music freezes and chills the audience with an intelligent sound editing. But the most important part of the film is Jamie Foxx. His performance is truly superb, the most polished performance of diamonds ever seen. He lives his role. He is the ray of light.
