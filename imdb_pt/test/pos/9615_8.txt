The skeleton of the story is that the main character needs to win a public kung fu tournament with high stakes. The meat of the story consists of Lots of fighting, a love triangle, betrayals, rivalries and revenge. <br /> <br /> There is much to this story. The main character is very nice as a field boy temperate, gentle and very resilient. A good movie against bad is as good as bad guys and the main villains are tough and smart, not to mention ugly, dishonest and complicated. <br /> <br /> If there is a weakness, it is the scene where the fiance The main character is imagining her and the protagonist running towards each other in a flowery field and hugging each other when they meet.
