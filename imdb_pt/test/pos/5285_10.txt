Even from the beginning of the movie, I really love the artwork and the screen layout of one of Japan's national islands. We see some large rolling green hills and some eastern houses of a coastal city. We are instantly looking at the beauty of the Pacific on the wide screen of the theater. And to prove how great this film is, I must say that Charles Darwin would be proud. Teachers of evolutionary and school science classes, such as biology, would fantastically favor Hayao Miyazaki's new film titled "Ponyo." The title character, as you will see, can be the perfect animation icon for the media to be represented in all classrooms and auditoriums. <br /> <br /> In addition to the scientific aspect of it all, let's dive into the blue waters of this exciting story. We have a lean, old and powerful wizard named Fujimoto who lives in a submersible and is cynical of the urban sprawl of mankind and its pollution from industrial waste. He wants to have complete control of the seas and peaceful aquatic life that looks cute, including fish and organisms. Fujimoto, whose blood is composed of being half human and half amphibian, resembles both an anti-hero and antagonist in love with the ocean; similar to the James Bond villain, Stromberg in The Spy Who Loved Me, who operates an underwater city dubbed by Atlantis. <br /> <br /> His daughter, whom he treats as a super-careful pet, is called Ponyo. She is a big goldfish that already looks like a pretty redheaded girl. The father bans her from the real human world, claiming it is dangerous and too much for her to deal with. But frankly, Ponyo's exploratory curiosity is as strong as his love nature. Eventually, with building strength, resembling wonderful scenes from Nick Park's "Chicken Run," she frees herself from her father's rocky, fossilized aquatic city and swims to the surface of Japan, and for her luck and joy falls into tender hands of a young tanker captain named Sosuke. Living in a beachfront home on a beautiful beach (or beach boulder), Sosuke has two overworked parents, a senior mother who works from home, Lisa, and the first companion of a Koichi oil barge. Lisa seems to be angry with his wife for being on a ship and leaving her with all the housework. Moreover, Ponyo's black magic causes an apocalyptic chain of events to occur: the Moon approaches the Earth and the waves emerge from the imbalance of the tidal interacting forces and the gigantic waves of the tsunami invade the peaceful but evacuated city. . However, what seems to underestimate this curse and seem literally more powerful than supernatural power is love and firmly embrace the friendship between childish Captain Sosuke and the lovely redhead Ponyo, who wants to be a sensitive human than just a preserved fish. Much like the hobbits of beaded, free-spirited hair in The Lord of the Rings, Ponyo gives me a faint reminder of this. <br /> <br /> I could write about this amazing animated movie, the best ever. Coraline, "which was in theaters in February, and now Hayao Miyazaki, feast your eyes on 10 more stars of your animation fan, Graham Abraham.Year of 2009 can be filled with dozens of animated films, however, Ponyo is the highest film of many environmental beauties and should be dedicated as a new wonder of the world.
