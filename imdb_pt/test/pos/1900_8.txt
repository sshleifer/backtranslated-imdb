The various Law & Order and CSI franchises should be glad that the Dolomite does not pass. Police women, ADA and coroners would all be delighted and males would be subject to soul-shivers, melting distinctive distorted-speed kicks (would not you love to see David Caruso's Horatio and who knows all about CSI getting the Hush puppies from Dolomite? T could start crying and return to the Playa Trail. <br /> <br /> Low budget, poor but enthusiastic performance, and a glimpse of what Gutbucket nightclubs offered to their customers; traces of the cheerleaders of Chitlin Circuit (James Brown), Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, and a host of others came from these clubs to glory while their colleagues worked in local or regional stardom.Rudy Ray Moore came from that background and the character of Dolomite is a mixture of the black black badasses who strutted. He should not have gone to the board, the pig did not have a warrant, as his middle-aged and stout man kept a loyal stable of kung fu prostitutes is a mystery that only a student of cults can explain, but all this is beside the point. It is a glorious home movie of a legendary performer who, compared to the mirrors of actors ranging from Established Hollywood to indie snoring movies, hits his mark. A fun silent movie!
