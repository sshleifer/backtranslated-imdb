Because it's late and I'm short on vocabulary, I'm going to describe this movie as "beautiful and moving," begging the forgiveness of those who get angry at these clich√©s. Robin Tunney does an incredible job portraying a young girl in the grip of Tourette's syndrome - her character was absolutely sincere and convincing, and I'm going to pursue her career wherever she goes because of this movie.
