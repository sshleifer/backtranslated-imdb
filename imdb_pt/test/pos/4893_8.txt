The best British comedy movie of all time! For years, English comedy programs have turned into movies and failed, "Are you being served?" 'Dads Army', the list goes on. However, the BBC's popular black television humor program; 'The League of Gentlemen' managed not only to create a film that failed to be a failure, but also managed to be the best British comedy film of all time! With its dark and terrible twists and turns The League of the Apocalypse of the Gentlemen is the British Talent at its best! His intriguing demonic plot written by the Gentlemen's League (Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson) combines with the Gents (and the special guests) performing superbly! I hope this is not the end of Royston Vasey, not after this great success! Do not think that if you have not seen the Gentlemen's League on television, you will not understand what is happening. It's all well explained and at the end of the movie you'll be happy with the result, but you're still hungry for more ... Mmmm, Special Stuff.
