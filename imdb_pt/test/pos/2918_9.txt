Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a DVD copy for 99p. I liked the movie, the plot twists and that the file was mostly about the main character Sinuhe makes more of a "family saga" rather than an action movie. The costumes and attention to details were notable for their time (1955). The rear projection during the carriage ride now seems awkward. My main interest was the character of Akhenaten and his monotheistic religion. In this film he was portrayed as "Jesus" as in his refusal to go to war with the Hittites, even through invasions of Egypt and in his closing speech on the futility of materiality and political power. Initially, one makes a connection between Sinuhe, who was cast adrift on the Nile River in a reed basket, and the Moses of the Old Testament. But this connection is not taken, no doubt this will be fully explored in a new film in which a character like Moses takes the monotheistic religion of Akhenaten to the wider world if such a film is politically feasible to do. It is universally accepted that if women were concerned about the fact that man is a stupid creature, but the relationship or lack of one between Sinuhe and Merit, the character played by Jean Simmons is difficult to accept. And that Sinuhe, an educated physician, would be so wounded by Nefer, the Babylonian "fatal woman", to the point of giving him the house of his adoptive parents, and the Tomb is not really believable, nor that his parents even had a grave. In real life, Nefer (Nefertitti) was the wife of Akhenaten. And though Horemheb had become Pharaoh, it was after a few others, including Tutankhamen, who was the son of Akhenaten. <br /> <br /> But of course this is just a choice and the film is enjoyable to watch and that is about Akhenaten and his monotheistic religion are a great bonus. Perhaps following the book and the film "The Code De Vinci" this film is redone with the central secret being the basis of our current monotheism! I hope in great anticipation of such a film, there are already numerous books on the subject.
