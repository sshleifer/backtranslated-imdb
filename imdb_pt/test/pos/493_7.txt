Not being at all familiar with the characters in the comic book series, I hoped this movie merely fulfilled the basics: introducing myself to the characters and their inherent characteristics, presenting a plot and ending with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps suggesting the possibility of a sequel. And that's exactly what this movie makes happen. <br /> <br /> However, unlike most other comic books, I felt that this movie did it with a bit of class. Risking a more limited audience with strong language and fighting scenes, "Blade" presents a very modern, believable and shadowy world whose small nuances have effectively managed to provoke a sense of fear - however small - from a viewer who rarely gets involved in a story, unless it is an emotional (ie, honeyed) aspect. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film has lots of absurdly unrealistic pamphlets and situations, like a standard doctor being cunning enough to invent what no one else has gotten for thousands of years. But when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie, and fight scenes with engaging and exciting camera cuts and special effects like that, what matters most? It may take a while, but for what it purports to do, "Blade" stands out prominently among most other films of this genre.
