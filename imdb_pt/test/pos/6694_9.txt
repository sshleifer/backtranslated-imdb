K-Pax is a very intriguing film. Is Prot (Kevin Spacey) really an alien, or is he a mentally disturbed human who just thinks he's an alien? That is the question that Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) must answer before the self-proclaimed term that Prot sets for his departure from Earth. <br /> <br /> As the film unfolds and more evidence is revealed, both theories grow credibility. His ability to map memory to the area of ​​the galaxy where his planet is located indicates a knowledge that no human being could possess. However, hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality aberration. The ending seems to give the answer, but it's just ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know. Normally, I do not like girl or tiger finals, but this is tempting. I have my own theory that fits all the clues, but I do not know if my theory is more correct than anyone else's. <br /> <br /> Director Iain Softley (`Wings of the Dove ') spends the tale. delicately, with great skill. This is a rare example of the director staying in the shadows and inducing extraordinary performances from talented actors to let history dominate. This is not to say that the steering is technically inferior because it is excellent. However, Softley remains discreet, offering great power through the use of subtlety, a pleasant change from the current avant-garde directors who visually grab and shook the viewer as if they wanted to shout, "Look how brilliant I am!" <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey once again delivers a wonderful performance like Prot. This is a part that is extraordinarily demanding, requiring Spacey to make Prot legal and logical in a minute, and then shift gears to conjure up his tormented alter ego under hypnosis in the next. Spacey is as believable as alien and human, which makes the task of the spectator much more difficult. Jeff Bridges is also fantastic as the relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about Prot. <br /> <br /> This is inspired by the narrative for the attentive observer. I rated a 9/10. If you must have the closure at the end of a movie, this movie will be very frustrating. However, if you enjoy a fascinating mystery that keeps you thinking long after the credits, you will not be disappointed.
