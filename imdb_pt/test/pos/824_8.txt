I have not seen a Van Damme movie for a while, pleasantly surprised, it still has, looking older, but harder, like Sly, gets more robust with age. This is a good movie and it took me to take a look at all the Van Damme movies I've lost in the last ten years. I would like to see a good director put Van Damme on the big screen with a good plot. Van Damme still has the moves to surprise audiences, the last film seen with Van Damme was Legionnaire, which was a good movie as well. In addition, I looked at Van Damme's initial fighting story, I also my astonishment realized that he is the real deal, very talented martial artist in his youth.
