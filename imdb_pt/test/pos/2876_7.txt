A dangerous psychopathic killer, Jacob Goodnight, is hiding in the abandoned and rotting Blackwell Hotel, alone with his nightmares, until eight delinquent teens appear for community service along with the policeman who injured Jacob four years ago. When one of them is kidnapped by the killer and his fate uncertain, the remaining insignificant criminals must fight for their lives ... "See No Evil" was directed by pornographer Gregory Dark and stars WWE star Kane as an unrepentant psychopath. The support cast is terrible and there are no surprises to be found here but there is plenty of extreme violence and gore for slasher fans to enjoy. Overall I enjoyed this movie and you should as well if you are into foolish slasher movies . Of course, it's clich√©, but who cares.
