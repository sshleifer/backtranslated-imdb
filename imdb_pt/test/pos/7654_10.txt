This film is a tapestry, a series of portraits of rom communities woven by music. It is a musician's film, due to the scarcity of spoken dialogues - and what dialogue exists, not important to the structure of the narrative. Some may expect a National Geographic tale of "customs, clothing and music" or a plot line orbiting some central characters - do not look at it here. <br /> <br /> This is because you paint a picture of a family of people, rather than telling a story of individuals. The plot is the story through space (India for Andalusia) and / or / hour (we can not say) of a people. There is no need for narration. You have a sense of joyous people, strongly connected in small communities where social interaction is very important. And a great sense of sadness in parts, in his rejection by society at large. <br /> <br /> So it's a well-filmed Rom anthem with a wide spectrum of Rom music and a tail bite that is the oppression these people have faced and still face.
