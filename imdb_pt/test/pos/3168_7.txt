I thought this was very "different" compared to Shakespeare's more modern interpretations and I really enjoyed it. It would not be useful to those who study at school, etc., as it does not show the traditional interpretations of Shakespeare (ie, Miranda is portrayed as punk in comparison to his traditional lady of Shakespeare), but for the understanding of the play and the basis of interpretation of Shakespeare. story is a very strong and fantastic piece to watch. It does not also include the correct format as in the layout of acts and scenes as I'm currently playing Miranda in a production and most of its lines have been cut and some scenes split and mixed but it is very useful and I will definitely recommend it as a must see, even if only to say you've seen it! Shakespeare fans would love this!
