Having watched this movie years ago, it never disappeared from my memory. I always thought this was Michelle Pfeiffer's best performance I've ever seen. But, I'm impressed by the number of negative reviews that this movie received. After seeing it again today, I still think it is powerful, moving and could not care less if it is "loosely based on King Lear". <br /> <br /> Now I realize that this is Jessica Lange's greatest performance I have ever seen - and she has been praised for much shorter efforts. <br /> <br /> Thousand Acres is complex, human, vibrant, and immensely moving, but it certainly does not feature any of the primaries. feminine leads with any touch of glamor or "sensuality". I do not think this is well received in these times. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one reason for the answer below the film lies in the fact that the writer (Jane Smiley (script by Laura Jones) and director (Jocelhyn Moorehouse) are all women. I know that in my youth , I would not have read a book written by a woman. I did not focus on that fact until years later. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie or given a chance in the past, try watching it again. Maybe you're ready for it.
