I must say that one big reason why I found AristoCats was so great because I love cats !!!! I love cats, which probably gave this movie a great track of me, but not just this, it was definitely a good movie as well, and I love where they make the movie scenario happen. This is one of my favorite movies of animals, although it is lively, and I really love how the actors / actresses did not sound so unprofessional behind the animal's voice. For me, this movie looks like a classic, but I think for IMDb it is not, because it has, yes, I find it very low rating. You take a look at all the other Disney "ORIGINAL" movies and they have a much higher rating. than that, but even so AristoCats is one of the best animated films out there and I could enjoy it again and again !!
