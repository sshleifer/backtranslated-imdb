The Alter Egos are no more entertaining than the creation of Ali G. by Sacha Baron Cohen. Completely misled by his illusory and nonexistent sense of the suburban suburb of Middle England in which his social background consists. He persists in living the style of a Los Angeles Gansta. While still living with his grandmother in the London suburb of Staines, he maintains the rigid control of his Possession, the "Massiv" of West Staines. <br /> <br /> Spending her free time between Me Julie, her girl, the Possession, and teaching local eight-year Scouts in "Keep It Real (advanced)" lessons at the government-funded John Nike Leisure Center. <br /> <br /> It is here that history takes off, being informed that government funding has stopped, Ali G then proceeds on a one-man quest "In the fight for justice, I am willing to give myself life as well as Martin Luther Van Dross did. " Being his response to the local media team when interviewing him on hunger strike while chained to a fence. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance here plays David Carlton, the sinister and dishonest Vice Prime Minster, who is "even more eviller than Skeletor." Using Ali G unknowingly lose the prime minister 18,000 votes three weeks before the general election. Seeing Ali G as a fumbling idiot, his plan backfires. Ali G suddenly becomes a night sensation and a savior of the people, working directly with the prime minister. The story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences. <br /> <br /> Ali G Indahouse is a great British film that brings the extremely talented attributes of writing, along with Dan Mazer, executive production and acting by Sacha Baron Cohen. Charles Dance and Michael Gambon as the PM play their parts with great seriousness between the jokes and the hilarity that is Ali G. Ironically, watching the parodies doing their parts in a world that is really real, and who are continually preaching "Keep it Real" from their own little world which is the West Staines "Massiv" is the true comic paradox. Directed by Mark Mylod, his first feature since directing television shows such as Shameless, Shooting Stars, Reeves and Mortimer's The Fast Show and the Smell, to name a few. Very Real and very funny.
