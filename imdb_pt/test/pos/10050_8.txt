The legend of Custer, the Warner Brothers Epic. There is no casting against the type here, with the flamboyant Flynn as the extravagant Custer in this exciting tribute, not just to Custer, but to the men of the 7th Cavalry. The story traces the life of the famous "Boy General" from his turbulent days at West Point until his last fight at the Little Big Horn. Great freedoms are taken with facts here, and we are gifted with a Custer who is much more sympathetic to the situation of the redman than the story relates. But this is done on such a large scale, the battle scenes only provided employment for every extra in Hollywood. Downstairs and all, this is so much fun!
