This series when the dinosaur lived 65 million years ago. The dinosaur looks very real and is very realistic when it moves. It is also very interesting as the climate changes. <br /> <br /> I am very interesting in how the dinosaurs lived and died. I'm also interesting in how the dinosaurs behaved. <br /> <br /> The color of dinosaurs is also interesting to see and discover. They think what color they had. <br /> <br /> The most interesting is why the dinosaurs died and what happened after that. <br /> <br /> The BBC made a brilliant series as the dinosaurs lived and died!
