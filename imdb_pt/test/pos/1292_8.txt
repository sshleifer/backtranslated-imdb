Humphrey Bogart, in his first leading role, seems very young, acts well, but has a strong pronunciation only suggested later in his career. Still, he is very good and very attractive as the young idealistic inventor of a new airplane engine. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Mackaill is the true star here, playing a once rich woman who is torn between her true love for Bogart (he is broken too) and the comfort and security of marrying an older man (Hale Hamilton). Along the journey are Astrid Allwyn as Bogart's troubled sister, Bradley Page as her purported producer, Barbara Leonard as Cosmetologist, Jack Kennedy as Gilligan and Halliwell Hobbes as the faithful (and wise) steward, . <br /> <br /> Both Mackaill (who had been a star in the silent films) and Bogart were trying to gain support. on talkies in 1932. Bogart was a slow-rising actor on the Broadway stage; Mackaill was slipping and would soon appear in a production of rows like PICTURE BRIDES. However, both are very good here. Mackaill was not even 30 when he appeared in this movie!
