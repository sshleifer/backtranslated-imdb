This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I liked stories of mountain men and the desert. Books like "Call of the Wild", "White Fang", "The Frontiersman" and "My Side of the Mountain", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be like "Trapper." However, when I got older, I discovered that I was too domesticated to live like this. However, I still romanticize about living this kind of life. I agree with some other reviews of this movie that the plot has the simplicity that is quite prevalent in "Disneyisque" movies, but if you can look beyond the mechanics in which it was made and see the heart of the story, the real themes, then I I think you find yourself pleasantly touched. I make sure to watch this movie once a year. After thirty-one years, I still feel a shiver as I see a stream of snow coming down the mountainside and I hear the hunter's frightening and haunting chuckle. <br /> <br /> - Good luck.
