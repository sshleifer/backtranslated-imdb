Now this is the kind of movie we use to get weekly. Nowadays, it is rare to see a drama that depends on the cast talking to one another. <br /> <br /> There are no blasts, car chases or any chase, there are implied sexual situations. film for the younger audience, It is for those who appreciate people talking to each other, They discuss a lot as we have couple having middle age problems. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson are seemingly very happy middle aged loving man and woman. Now living in this same small, handsome London suburb, Rupert Everett returns home to visit his rich dad. <br /> <br /> He, of course, meets Emily Watson, it would be easy for anyone to be in love with Emily. I do not say anything else except that when the credits start there is a fatal accident, the rest of the movie is about the repercussions of this accident and all the lies that the various characters tell. <br /> <br /> The performance of this trio and the others are excellent. <br /> <br /> Julien Fellows wrote the screenplay based on a novel by Nigel Balchin. He also drove, this was his first attempt at steering and he did very well. All production is top notch. <br /> <br /> The film had a theatrical performance of a few months at the end of 2005, it is below the 80 cinemas. This to me is a shame, stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens, but great albums like this and many others open in just a few. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are some very funny phrases about certain situations.
