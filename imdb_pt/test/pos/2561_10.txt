I chose to watch this movie for a reason and a single reason ... Samuel L. Jackson. I like him a lot. I had not seen previews or trailers for this neglected film, so I walked in with no real expectations. <br /> <br /> Jackson did not disappoint as Lazarus, a low-of-his-luck blues man in Deep South, and delivered perhaps his most powerful performance ever, including playing and singing several great blues songs . But the real surprise here was Christina Ricci, at best an insipid head in real life, who took on the role of the sexually abused prostitute Rae, and made her a verisimilar, almost likable character. Watching the decidedly non-sexual relationship evolve between Lazarus and Rae was simply incredible. Justin Timberlake, pop star who turned actor, should return to cause "problems of wardrobe" and if cram into a pop stage. His mostly forced performance was distraction, at best, from the real story here. <br /> <br /> This movie is raw, brave and sometimes quite "in your face". Not everyone will like it. Those who do, however, will be moving it quickly to the top of their favorites list.
