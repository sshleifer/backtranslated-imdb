Black Snake Moan is noisy. It is excessively rich, fantastically orchestrated, strange and awkward, unique and visionary. In the continuation of Hustle & Flow, Brewer paints his portrait of the American South almost as a mythological land that one would expect to see in an epic of Fantasia or Ancient Greece. And yet, right above us, their films hover, they are still ingrained; rooted in the deepest, darkest soil there is. <br /> <br /> As in traditional fairy tales, Brewer paints his portrait in Black Snake Moan using extremes and exaggerations. Sharp and austere character traits, when combined with extreme acts like chaining a half-naked girl to a radiator, in an attempt to redeem her from her sins, exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor in the same way that extreme visual techniques like some characters have. color in Pleasantville reinforced the metaphor in the fairy tale movie. But Brewer does not start his film with "once upon a time"; in this film and also in Hustle & Flow, Brewer presents us with a different fairy tale; an obscure gothic fable of sex, prostitution and, finally, redemption. These themes run through the veins of the film as blood and snore and bloom in its dark and gloomy surroundings. <br /> <br /> But despite these extremes, Brewer treats his characters as human beings and creates three extremely well-executed passages. dimensional characterizations in Lazarus and Rae, particularly emphasized in their relationships with Lazerus's friend in the pharmacy, Angela and Rae's mother. <br /> <br /> The acting is perfect. One has the feeling that both Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson were born to play these roles. His characterizations are so intense and so severe; it's even more of a challenge for the actors to keep their heads and create realistic characters. And they do it admirably. Samuel L. Jackson in particular disappears completely in his character, which serves as a polar opposite to most of the characters he has played before. With films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shaft and others, he has created himself an ultimate bad-ass typecast. In Black Snake, Moan Jackson plays an old, broken, defeated and grounded character, unlike anything he has ever done before. And frankly, it's just fantastic. What comes as a surprise, however, is the cast of Justin Timberlake, and more specifically, the fact that he seems well tolerable. Of course he does not have much time on the screen, but like what Brewer did with Ludicrous in Hustle & Flow, he really does Timberlake act and do what he should do, and not seem totally disconcerting and annoying. <BR> <BR> <BR> But what's really amazing about the movie is the atmosphere Brewer creates. Southern rural locations work to their advantage by creating a kind of dark, dirty, grimy, crunchy and rough texture for the entire film, which fits more with the film's thematic and metaphorical aspects. And using all sorts of elements, such as the rising sound of cicadas when Rae causes him itchiness, or a violent storm that intensifies and intensifies when Lazarus plays his blues number "Black Snake Moan" to Rae, Brewer really manages to create almost one fantasy world, a mythology weakened to the rural backdrop of the South. And it works so extraordinarily to create Brewer's unique vision. <br /> <br /> And you can not talk about a Craig Brewer movie without mentioning the song. In Hustle & Flow, he used a down-and-dirty street hip-hop soundtrack to emphasize the atmosphere and the vision. In this film, the music works even better in polishing and fully representing the unique atmosphere. It's a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, dirtiest, dirtiest blues you've ever heard. And it looks absolutely fantastic. Overall, one could say that this film was a simple tale of an old black blues singer solitary, broken, lonely, rescuing a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from nymphomania , there may not have been much writing. But this movie is not about the plot, and not even about the characters, just as they are created in the movie regardless. No, is this movie about vision? and what a unique vision that is! It's about the atmosphere, the mythology, the scenery. It's about anger, fear, redemption and, most importantly, the blues. And it's all wrapped up in a unique, fun, stylish and flawless ribbon. Brewer has secured a spot on the most promising roster of directors, and with such solid follow-up to a great debut film, Hustle & Flow, it will definitely be on my radar for future projects. <BR> It should also be mentioned that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles I have ever heard.
