Human Trafficking is a vision of a common weekend for a group of friends, it's a vision of a fly in their lives (and minds) that will show you how this group of friends relates. There are many times when each one can relate, such as being out of your skull at parties and talking full trash to strangers. The characters are all people you can relate to and are compelling in the roles they play in the movie. The situations they are in are all the situations where we all meet, and that's where this movie succeeds. Sex and drug topics are treated in a superb way so as not to interfere with the characters' relationships with each other. The story of the movie is not all that, but this is not a criticism. This is a movie about people. This is a well written movie with a soundtrack to die for. DJ Pete Tong has put together an excellent selection of tracks for this file, which makes it one of the best movies I've ever seen in 1999. After watching this movie, I felt that I had left to celebrate the end of week. Fantastic movie! Jo Brand as the voice of reality - need I say more! <br /> <br />
