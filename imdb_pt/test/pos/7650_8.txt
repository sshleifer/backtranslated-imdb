This definitely would not have been my kind of movie, but my husband saw it on TV and said it was very good. So, on his recommendation, I bought a copy, since I did not know if it would be back on TV. I had never heard of anyone except Armand Assante. At first I had difficulty getting into the story, because the first part of the movie is a mess of pictures - and does not make much sense. It is only at the end of the movie that everything comes together. The cut-scene - if that's the way it's called, is a bit shocking - sometimes it looks like some frames have been cut from each scene, and the scenes are jerky - but I think this was done to increase the word). The story goes on here and there, and almost when you discover everything, everything is upside down and you have to readjust your thinking about who is the bad guy and who is not. Or bad woman. The acting is very good - I kept thinking about how much Norman Reedus looks like Leo Decaprio. The ending was a real, totally unexpected turnaround, which I liked. A good show.
