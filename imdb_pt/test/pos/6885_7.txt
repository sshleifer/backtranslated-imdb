I joined Blockbuster with a friend the other night, having decided that we were too broke and too lazy to keep ourselves active. She decided she wanted to watch Closer, which seemed such a repulsive idea that I had to rent another movie for the first time she went to bed. Looking around, I did not see much that interested me, but I saw The Doll Master in the new releases section. Only based on the cover (A woman with a doll face crying tears of blood) I thought this would be interesting enough to rent. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, watching it in an almost empty house, with all the lights off, was pretty scary. I must admit that I've always had a little phobia of dolls since I was a kid (and I watched a horrible movie called Asylum, one of the stories involved a mental patient creating a doll that killed people. the first three quarters of this movie really hit the spot for me. The first half hour in particular was amazing. The frightening atmosphere of foreboding really set the scene well and, without moving the dolls, seemed genuinely menacing. But unfortunately, as soon as they started to move, I was kind of disappointed when moments that could have been genuinely scary made me laugh because of the way they were filmed. <br /> <br /> For the characters, it's a horror movie, you're not really expecting something memorable. I found that I remembered better names and faces than most of the Asian horror movies I saw, suggesting that there must have been some hidden character development that I did not consciously realize. The typical stereotypes are in effect in this film, each having some sort of character quirk that sets them apart from others, from shy and quiet Yeong-ha and his doll Damien, to the outgoing silly Seon-yeong. The plot itself was pretty cool, even though the ending, which bought along many of the plot lines, seemed a bit confusing and really did not do anything to me, despite having a really cool pair twists that I will not ruin here. The basic plot is a lot of children are invited to be modeled as dolls by a famous manufacturer of old recluse dolls, they have to stay in the scary house (adorned with scary dolls, some big ones some small) and things start to happen like the our heroine Hae-mi begins to explore areas of the house and things begin to happen to the other inhabitants. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would definitely recommend the movie, not to watch with many people, since some of the moments will probably make you laugh if surrounded by friends, but as something you watch yourself in the dark with the windows and doors open a bit, in case any puppet feels like watching with you. This really makes you guess most of the movie, allowing you to use wild conspiracy theories only to destroy them completely later. If you really take an interest in it and ignore your tackiness in places I assure you that you will check under your bed before going to sleep and maybe even leave the lights on. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it's just me: P As for Closer, it was okay, but I preferred it.
