This is definitely the most intimate and thought-provoking part of Nolan. Not to say that Memento or Insomnia are bad, but they definitely lived up to more Hollywood standards ... while Follow is more of an indie movie. The story is very bright and very well developed. Overall ... note this if you're a fan of any of Nolan's work, I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy it more.
