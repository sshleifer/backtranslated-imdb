If you're looking for an erotic masterpiece, that's not it. If you're looking for a comic work of art, that's not it. If you're looking for something hardcore, that's not it. <br /> <br /> That being said, if you are looking for an example of the art of European erotic comedy from the early 70's, that's it <br /> <br /> I see many people complaining about quality, please understand that it was made in 1974. Yes, women do not conform to the modern ideal of attractiveness. They are not ugly women, but they do not look the same idealized in our silicon culture. Yes, the dubbing is not good, but they speak German and anyone who speaks German knows that it is very difficult to dub a word with 12 syllables. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the DVD before the most recent, launch is marketed with 2 covers of 80 and recently 90 adult stars. The movie is an R movie, so those who complain about hardcore should have noticed that, the movie is edited from the original, but it was also edited before being shown on the drive-ins in the late 70's. <br /> I saw this movie for the first time as a young man and, judging by some comments, there are many in the same boat who had a glimpse of Cinemax. Many people get annoyed when, later in life, they do not match their previous memories. It is understandable considering the nudity and nudity packed in today's erotic. <br /> <br /> If you compare 2069 to a modern soft-core erotic comedy you may be disappointed. The movie while stranger is actually very fluid and the jokes, while generally hints and double meanings still stand and can still get a chuckle. If you compare it to a hardcore movie you will be even more disappointed compared to today you see very little. <br /> <br /> It is still one of the best examples along with Bottoms Up and The Other Cinderella of European Erotic / Comic Cinema of the 70's.
