This film is a tour de force by Julie Taymor, who directs and does the stage design and masks. No one comes close to combining their imagination on the modern operatic stage. Since the creation of this film, in 1992, she has been very successful in the production of films and in the direction of musicals. We can only hope she can be persuaded to return to the opera one day. I would love to see a ring cycle run by her. The current Rheingold in Covent Garden has giants with big hands like the characters in this movie. The current Butterfly on ENO uses Japanese puppets. Coincidence, perhaps, or evidence that Taymor's influence is widespread. Taymar wears fantastic costumes, masks, puppets and origami birds to recreate the story of Oedipus on a stage on stakes on a lake. Red ribbons are a recurring theme. They are used as an umbilical cord when Oedipus is born, they hang from the eyes of Oedipus after he has blinded himself, in a breathtaking effect they are used to make a crossroads when his father's Oedipus murder is reencountered by puppets. <br /> <br /> This neo-classical Stravinsky opera-ballet enjoyed a justified obscurity until this film brought him to life. The music is uninspiring, but harmless and Philip Langridge, Jesse Norman and a young Bryn Terfel make the most of it. The singers are relatively still, according to Stravinsky's wishes. Min Tanaka is the Oedipus dance for the song of Oedipus, of Langridge. This creates a slight confusion over the end when dancing Oedipus puts out the eyes of Oedipus singing. <br /> <br /> The libretto is in Latin, but do not worry if your school's Latin is a bit rusty. There is a helpful narrator who presents and describes each scene in Japanese.
