I always wanted to see this movie, and when I finally arrived I knew I had a good surprise when John Boorman's name appeared on the screen. Known primarily for his epic films (he directed the first Conan and wrote Apocalypse Now) together in the classic Hollywood structure, this fits very well with his catalog. <br /> <br /> I also can not express how the Myanmar (Burma) is once again experiencing a revolt of monks and students against the military junta that governs the government, which is the same a change of leadership ever since, but essentially the same) portrayed in the 1988 film. Now more than ever, this film needs to be screened on television (picked up by IFC) because of recent events.
