I loved this movie! Yes it is quite cheap and I'm sure many comments will be snobby about it. But my God that much they pack for the money involved. I remembered Sam Raimi's early work. Yes, it's difficult, but it has good energy and lots of fun. The acting ranges from the very good in Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser, to the not-so-good in some of the smaller parts. Is it a cult movie? Well, it grew in me. The first time I liked it, but by the third preview I was loving it. The movie is probably a 7 out of 10, but I'm giving 8 for pure cheek. Anyone who can do that for 8,000 is worth watching. It almost makes me want to visit Scotland!
