Although not the first movie I bought for me, this is almost certainly what I watched the most. The animation is well crafted by the Tokyo Movie Shinsa experts, and animators often used clever techniques such as making the sun "lens reflexes", soaking the camera (and having the "camera operator's hand" lens!) Etc. . While the film avoided becoming an "animator's fest-gadget," the judicious but generous application of such techniques gave the film a much more "realistic" feel than the typical cartoon. <br /> <br /> History has many intertwined plots that do not seem to have much to do with each other until everything comes together in the end, in a way that even writers discreetly admit to being invented. Each of the main plot lines has its own musical theme, from "Pop goes the weasel" [Hamton and Plucky], to the love theme of "Romeo and Juliet" [Fifi & Johnny]. The transitions between plots are slightly varied, but consistent. <br /> <br /> Truly a wonderful movie; there is not much original music, although the new lyrics of "Spinning Song" are smart and enjoyable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
