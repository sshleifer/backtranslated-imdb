I was kind of surprised by the PG rating on the back of the DVD. I certainly would not want my kids to attend this one. I think that would scare the 10-year-old. <br /> <br /> Plot: A girl trying to fit into the clique is blurred and plagued by the "crowd." They convince her to spend the night in this scary mausoleum (which reminds me of Phantasm ...) and they continue to torment her at night. Little do they know, a recently deceased clairvoyant is coming back to life and raising the dead around them! It seems absurdly tacky, but given the age and budget, which was undoubtedly very small, this movie is fun on many levels. <br /> <br /> Watch an Early EG Daily as one of the brats of the crowd. I liked it and it scared my girlfriend. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, kids.
