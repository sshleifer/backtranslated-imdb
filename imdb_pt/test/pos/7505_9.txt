Being a medical / health field retired "toiler in the vinyard" I never get tired of watching this movie. Paddy Chayefsky was a friend of my university professor and visited him and us during several classes in 1958. His ability to write stood the test of time and the "Hospital" is as fresh as it was in 1971. I can watch every week and still find Something new. Many of the supporting cast members went to bigger and better roles on TV and in the movies. George Scott made only a few comedies, but his timing and hunch are as good as Jackie Gleason and Steve Msrtin. Mental humor, instead of the physical / slapstick, wins in my book every time. And still a family movie with only 1, four-letter word throughout the movie
