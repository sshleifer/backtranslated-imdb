With a cast like that, I knew the acting would be awesome. Still, I was cautious, as I always am after sequels. Would it sustain the feel of the first movie? Could they replicate the tension and the thrill of Ocean's masterful steal of 11? We will never know because they have not tried. At least, not the way I expected. Instead, they made a light and truly funny parody of the assault genre. If you want a logical and exciting assault, do not watch it. If you want a good laugh, with witty dialogues, quirky characters and an absolutely brilliant scene where Julia Roberts has to pretend to be you, then you'll love Ocean's 12.
