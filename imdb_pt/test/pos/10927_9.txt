I watched this short on PlanetOut Movies. <br /> <br /> Starcrossed was a very sweet, sad movie about two brothers who are in love. There is a great and subtle acting of both male leads. Often movies with this subject seem to get too caught up in the controversy and the clash of the plot that they forget there is a real story. Fortunately, scriptwriter James Burkhammer does not do that and instead lets the story unfold with honesty. The sequences of the two boys falling in love are very sweet.
