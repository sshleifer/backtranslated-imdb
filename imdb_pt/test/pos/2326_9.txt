"Down Periscope" has been in our library ever since it arrived on VHS. Since then, we have acquired the DVD and a digital from Cinema Now. <br /> <br /> It is a peculiar movie that is not militarily exaggerated as pro or con. It is primarily a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, I am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered. <br /> <br /> The film has won followers bordering on a cult obsession, even among the very young. I learned of this while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama, in 2002. A group of Boy Scouts, my grandson among them, took over all the roles of the film and planned to revive it during the crossing of the ship. /> <br /> It's a fun joke that makes you so proud of our Navy and Hollywood ... it's a rare undertaking. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider for doing what could have been a film not so remarkable, so great entertainment!
