One Night at McCool's is a very funny movie that is smarter than it should be. His form is more sophisticated than I expected, and his randomness was superb. The thoughts behind the movie (mysogenesis, sadism, stupid men) are childish. That's what I have to say about this movie, which not only hates women but hates men. He has no sympathy for any of the men, actually. It seems so because of form, but the end says it all. Nobody cares. <br /> <br /> The form has the first 2/3 of the movie counted in flashback by three characters: Dillon, the stupid bartender; Reiser, the stupid mysogenistic lawyer; and Goodman, the stupid and holier cop than you. History is therefore always perverted by its own altered images and realities. Reiser's BBQ fancy is a great touch. In the end, we never know the truth and nothing is what it seems. Dillon has never been so innocent, etc. <br /> <br /> In fact, the rest of the movie is funny as well. From the randomness of the last 5 seconds of the film to the excessive truism of Tyler's manipulations, the film seems to have its own energy. Everything is just out of nowhere, and nothing seems to make sense. Do we really care if that happens? No. <br /> <br /> It's also a very dark comedy, but it has a shallow presentation. Think Nurse Betty or Jawbreaker. Very sweet coated outside, dark chewable inside. Whether you like your random, dark films, or just purely say, watch this movie. This will satisfy your desires for the strangeness that is One Night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> 8/10
