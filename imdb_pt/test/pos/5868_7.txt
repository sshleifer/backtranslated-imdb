Having become familiar with Hartley's "The Go-Between" for a long time, both in his original book form and in his disappointing Pinter-Losey film adaptation, this was interesting. "The mercenary" proves almost a mirror image at times; defined in a period a little less distant to the main part, with British class system exposure, and containing a definite play sports (boxing takes the place of cricket) which reveals quite a bit about. <br /> <br /> This is updated in its small-scale character focus. You can not exactly "know" Lady Franklin and Leadbitter in the novelistic sense, but this distance is properly explained in saying body language and the inflection of the actors. His distance from always sympathizing with any true character mirrors the dormant "difference" that both condemns the core relationship. Miles and Shaw are wonderfully subtle and we see more in their "less"; never once are these bold and showy performances. They are appropriately Stanislavskian interpretations that create the impression that these characters have life outside the limits of the film. All other parts are very satisfactorily dealt with, although they are much smaller in this film than I presume in the novel and in fact compare "The Go-Between," an impressive work on disillusionment. The disillusionment at the center of this film is so sadly and movingly conveyed in the final scenes where Shaw kisses Miles and is rejected, and then where a drunken Leadbitter confronts Cantrip and Lady Franklin. It's a shameful shame that what would have been an incredibly pungent ending of spoiled and desolate lives on both sides of the screen, is 'embellished' with a decidedly odd little coda. Someone is totally baffled by the tone of voice, as Shaw's Leadbitter goes to the asphalt and ironically sings "Rule Britannia" and "God Save the Queen" as he crashes his car into things. The political point is heavily overloaded by this bombastic and rather melancholic finale. The whole sense of subtlety, so effectively transmitted up to now, is lost, since the implicit point is made heavily and loudly. Agit-prop certainly has no place in this kind of delicate period drama. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, one can not be too harsh. While this absurd final piece is a major flaw, the rest of the film should be praised as a sensitive and evocative film of sadness and detailed observation about how British society was in the past. Hartley's languid but crystalline touch is very much in evidence everywhere. Too bad we did not end the conclusion of Shaw's drunken scene. The tragic and deluded figure of Lady Franklin by Sarah Miles is abruptly denied her place at the epicenter of the film, when the fine human drama enters the realm of political scoring. Shaw too - that drier and deeper feeling of the actors - is betrayed by the excess of character that ends the film. Therefore; a beautiful little triumph is sabotaged; but we must remember the many good points. <br /> <br /> Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
