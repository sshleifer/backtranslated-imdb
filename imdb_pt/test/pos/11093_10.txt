"The Falcon & the Snowman" offers some of the best performances from its two tracks. Hutton, in a brilliantly discreet paper, quietly portrays the confusion and anguish of a man who apparently becomes a traitor for no other reason than as rebellion against his father. Penn, as the co-conspirator basically just for the ride and drug money, explosively turns into one of the strongest performances of his multi-talented career.
