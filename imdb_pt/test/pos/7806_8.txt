It's a parody, it's a clever comedy, it has a pathetic action and choreography (and remember, it's intentional), good humble songs, good performances from the entire cast, brilliant by Amir, Salman and Paresh and throughout a screenplay which is so rare in Indian cinema that also in comedy (see David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra etc). The story is of two wastrels whose sole purpose is to get rich and famous anyway. They come across one of these ways when they discover that a wealthy NRI is coming to India to get married. The rest of the story is about a person's ability and how these partridges tried to show each other. The entire cast is executed correctly from Deven Verma to Viju Khote. The songs are placed correctly and are funny. The surprise package is Salman, who acts with a perfect timing and this particular act gave him his comedy style. <br /> <br /> All this is a movie that you should not ignore if you like and watch Indian Cinema.
