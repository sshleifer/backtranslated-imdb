If you liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, chances are you'll enjoy it too. Although I suppose some of the British inner jokes (like calling two London characters from Dixon and Winterburn, after Arsenal footballers) may be lost on some, this is still breaking the entertainment, which really bombards with vitality. <br /> <br /> Carlyle, Miller and Tyler are all excellent, bringing depth to their characters, and the interaction between the two protagonists is always well evaluated. In fact, Scott's direction is very guaranteed, considering that this is his first feature film, and proves that he has the talent of his father to make us comfortable in an unfamiliar environment. <br /> <br /> Hell, I was convinced. I'll see it again!
