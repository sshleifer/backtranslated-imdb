Hey, you're not alone! I remember Nichols! I was only 17 when I was connected. I remember that James Garner was one of the coolest actors, and Nichols was a great show. I could not believe it was in such a short time, I would like to remember the last episode, I probably did not see it ... there was no VCR so then when I was in you saw, and if you missed an episode that is gone forever , unless he returned to summer reruns. Anyway, it would certainly be great if it were released on DVD, but I do not think many people even knew it. What a shame. <br /> <br /> Garner would hit success a few years later with Rockford Files, and he brought his friend Stuart Margolin to Nichols to play his partner, Angel.
