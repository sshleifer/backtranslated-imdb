Oh, my God, this is funny. Yes, it's childish in the extreme, but also witty ("Here's the page with all the wines." "It's a little early for us, I'm scared." "Well, what are you doing then?") of fighting are second to none. Despite what you may have heard, the laughter continues to come, and at a surprisingly generous pace. The comedic skills of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson help keep him wildly funny. twisting every drop of script comedy. I can only compare it to "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" - or do you find this movie hysterical altogether or not; the same applies here. It's probably the funniest British film since "Withnail and I", but to say it's an acquired taste is a kind of gross underestimation (sic).
