The "silver screen" is polished with this beautiful film about happy aging and the rainbow of life. There's plenty of silver hair on this silver screen, but the film's namesake is more like 85-going on 25 with his energy, mood and desire for life. The story of the extraordinary Uncle Frank, his devoted wife, Aunt Tillie, and the zippy residents of the local area rest homes inspire us to "live each day as if it were the last" and bring a glimmer of hope to those golden years. A great movie for young audiences!
