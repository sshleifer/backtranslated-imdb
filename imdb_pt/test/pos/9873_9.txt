This movie is very good, but the unprecedented Producer Cut is my favorite movie in the series after the original. Jamie's story is treated differently, the death scenes are made 10 times better, there are more scenes of ritual-like things that give more stories about Micheal, Jamie and her baby. There is also an alternate ending that is also better. Why they did not release that version, I have no idea. If you can find this version, see.
