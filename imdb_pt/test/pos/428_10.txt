"Hey, I did not ask for a cab!" "Yes, well you have one ..." What can I say about Hack ... what a man among men. He was an excited former police officer turned cab driver with a heart of gold. If you were able (and fortunately for American viewers ... one person a week) to penetrate the cold and hard surface of Hack's exterior, you would have to see an attentive man dedicated to vigilant justice. The show was great, I laughed, I cried, I smiled ... all in the same episode. My arms cracked in shivers as our dear friend Hack left his taxi in another dark alley ... with nothing but his fists ... ready to avenge a civilian wronged. A smile erupted in my face as the screen showed me a criminal in facial expressions of a dark alley when the headlights of the Taxi of Justice lit up his face. Week after week, I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association to take advantage of the heat of Hack's brilliance. I've never seen a better show, and I mourned the loss of one of America's greatest treasures when the show was canceled. In other Hack-related news, I'd like to announce to the world that my wife and I are expecting Hack Koen to come to the world in about three weeks.
