I saw Jimmy Stewart in all the regular roles, but the "St. Louis Spirit" was reported to be one of his favorites. A poor box office performer when it was released, this movie was largely forgotten today. Telling the well-known story of Lindberg's famous 1927 flight, Stewart seems to have been very poorly launched at first, and his well-known voice never lets you forget who's watching; looks like George Baily again. But Stewart obviously worked hard on paper and he does everything right, so before long you do not care that Stewart is 20 years older than the man he's portraying. Lindberg, from Stewart, is such a sullen and American apple pie that you get caught up in the story, and you realize that Stewart intended to portray Lindberg with all the shucks, Yankee-know-how he could muster up. Lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the US, and Stewart seems determined to keep up appearances. <br /> <br /> Flash backs are cleverly used to keep what is actually a rather monotonous moving story, and I was impressed with the story. subtle references to faith that were scattered throughout the film; Lindberg trying to teach a desperate priest to fly, only to be confronted by the priest in his beliefs, or Lindberg refusing to carry a St. Christopher medal offered to save weight on the plane, only to find the medal hidden in his backpack. after he crossed the Atlantic. To me, this is a film not about the epic journey of a man into the unknown, but his perception that this life is much greater than the things we can see and feel.
