Chan-wook Park, you have to hand it to the guy. To my eyes, he is not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn a hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing but still satisfying. <br /> <br /> Thirst is essentially a vampire tale, but one. who plays fast and loose with some of the "rules" of the subgenre. Kang-ho Song plays the father Sang-hyeon, a man who gives himself unselfishly to a research program and then, altruistically, picks up the illness that is trying to heal, dies and returns. All thanks to the blood he was transfused. Being the only one in five hundred to survive, he becomes a celebrity to those who know him and all he wants is to get back to normal. Normal, however, now involves being able to jump great distances without wounds, wanting to drink blood and get seriously hot under the collar when sun rays enter your skin. It does not take long for him to live with a dysfunctional family unit that he met in his childhood and while he hides his new strange lifestyle, he finds himself drawn by a complex love triangle, becoming more accepting of darker thoughts and sliding by a slippery slope could turn it from man to animal to monster. Divinely blending various genres, Park's film seemed much fresher and more original to me than letting the right person in (to use a recent example) and genuinely impressed me with his approach to material that could easily have felt as worn and rewritten as any other vampire movie we have seen over the years. It is a mixture of horror, melodrama and comedy, while pondering ideas such as strength of faith, power over life and death, the disadvantage of immortality, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Some people complained that this genre This approach weakens the film, but I personally discovered that it was an animated, fun and always enjoyable film, aided by a great central performance of Song as the tortured priest and the transformations of a support cast without weak links. Many characters move through a series of emotions and all do so with skill and credibility, especially the young woman (played by OK-vin Kim) who becomes the object of the priest's love, lust, and affection. Fans of Asian cinema (and Park in particular) and also fans of "The Tell-Tale Heart" (watch and learn) should take advantage of this, it's more a class movie than a man who seems to lead all in its rhythm and always manages to put nothing less than solid entertainment. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: Cronos, Near Dark, Dellamorte Dellamore Man AKA Cemetery.
