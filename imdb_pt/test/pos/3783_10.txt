I described Woody Allen's Manhattan as perfect for someone else the other day, and she thought it was a weird way of describing a movie ... <br /> <br /> I saw only a handful of movies that I would call perfect. Manhattan is one, McCabe & Ms. Miller by Robert Altman is another and Once Upon a Time in the West by Sergio Leone is also another movie that I think reaches perfection. There are a few others, but besides the fact that I do not find fault with the three I mentioned, I must also admit that all three directors are acquired tastes. <br /> <br /> If there is a movie that I can stand behind and bet on the house that anyone I show would find it flawless, it's Shoulder Arms. <br /> <br /> City lights, The Great Dictator, The Gold Rush and even the Pawnshop are 10's, but it's not just Chaplin doing everything right in this movie, all he did is hilarious and touching a level beyond explanation.
