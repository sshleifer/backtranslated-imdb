Having been a Marine, I can tell you that D.I. is a picture so accurate to this day that it portrays Marine Corp's training camp and how boys are transformed into men. Jack Webb is excellent as Sgt.Jim Moore, a hard but fair training instructor on Paris Island, North Carolina. The film focuses on a recruit who does not seem to "stick with the show." A more recent movie, Full Metal Jacket, also shows life in basic training and is worth to be seen.
