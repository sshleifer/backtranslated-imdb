Dr. Bock teaches in the hospital and he's very good at it. The thing about him is that he's depressed. Dr. Bock and his wife have separated, their children are deviant, he can not perform in the room and feels that he is not doing a good job of healing people. He becomes suicidal, but he knows Barbara, who changes his ideas for the better. All around this story is a murder mystery and a group of angry protesters outside. <br /> <br /> The film is well done and the character of Dr. Bock is well interpreted. It's a bit sad, a little funny and a little drama. It was good to see some stories around the hospital, even if they were not related to what Dr. Bock was doing. Great movie.
