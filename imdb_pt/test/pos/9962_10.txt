My guide to the quality of the film is if I'm still thinking about it after leaving the theater. I'm still thinking about it the next day, which does not happen often. <br /> <br /> The setting (a reasonable guess for 16th century Italy), costumes, lighting, cinematography are all excellent. It's a beautiful movie visually. <br /> <br /> Characters can never rise above the script they should recite, but these actors have made the most of their material, which is great. This is one of Shakespeare's best plays, which people will still enjoy for over 400 years on the road. All the directors were interesting and pleasant. <br /> <br /> Those who say this is anti-Semitic must be deaf and blind. If anything, it is anti-Venitian-Catholic of the sixteenth century. While Shylock plays a man controlled and tortured by the sorrows he suffered, it is clear that the society in which he lives is largely to blame. The script clearly places your personal responsibility as well. <br /> <br /> A great movie.
