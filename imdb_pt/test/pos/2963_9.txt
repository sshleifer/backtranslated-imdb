A talented high school graduate with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state game of American football. When he meets and falls in love with an attractive local girl, she helps him realize that he has a chance to study if he plays well. <br /> <br /> Often these dramas fall into traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teenager. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface there is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre. Matt is the center of the action and he is a realistic teenager, both confident and vulnerable, optimistic and cynical in turns. Influenced by Amy, Matt grows into a man of character and heart. He, in turn, forms friendships with his teammates, which influences his growth as an athlete and as a team player. <br /> <br /> The FULL RIDE has all the elements we love to see in a movie - great acting, admirable characters, thrilling sports scenes, moving drama and a love story. Still, while one may have seen these elements in other films, the FULL RIDE is assisted by performances that are sincere and occasionally even touching. Perhaps the most impressive about FULL RIDE is your sense of reality. Although the author of the previous comment seems to disagree, (clearly an unsatisfied student who, for obvious reasons, received a low grade in his film class), director Mark Hoeger bases the film in a credible location and location and does a great job . from descending to the courage of what life is like in a small town. These characters are real people rooted in realistic situations, which often create the most attractive entertainment. On one level is a love story, on another is a character study, and yet another is a simple football movie. All these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle.
