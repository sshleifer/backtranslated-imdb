Bud Abbott and Lou Costello have always had a good following among the kids, but in their careers I guess you could say they only made a movie that could be designated for kids. Jack and the Beanstalk was this movie. <br /> <br /> He was part of an independent contract for two Warner Brothers films, being the second film Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd. These were the only two movies the boys made in color. <br /> <br /> The two, unemployed as usual, accept a very precocious and obnoxious young man, David Stollery, as a nanny. Although it begins with Costello wanting to read the boy, Jack and the Beanstalk as a bedtime story, the young boy ends up reading for Costello. Lou falls asleep and in his dreams he fantasizes that he is indeed Jack the Giant Killer. <br /> <br /> Buddy Baer that threatened the boys in Africa. Screams plays the giant and he has a giant Dorothy Ford as his housekeeper. Dorothy was a big girl, 6'2 ", and you can imagine that she had some difficulty in being thrown except when her height was used as a joke. One of the only players who ever looked at her was John Wayne in Three Godfathers at 6 '4 ". Henry Fonda and James Stewart in On Our Merry Way also stayed a little above it, but again their height was part of a joke. <br /> <br /> Shaye Cogan and James Alexander were the princess and the prince of fantasy and they sang beautifully, but could not act for anything. This was the last film by William Farnum, whose career dates from the early days of silent film and until the turn of the last century on stage. He played the father of Princess Shaye, the king. <br /> <br /> Some non-memorable musical numbers came from Jack and the Beanstalk, except for the title song. I remember well as a kid, having the record of Bud and Lou singing the song and reciting the story. I was in my first digit of years, but I've become a long-time fan because of it and its TV series. Jack and the Beanstalk is still a good picture for very young children, though I warn parents advise their little kids not to imitate young master Stollery.
