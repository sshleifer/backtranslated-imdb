First of all, I must say that I really enjoy watching this movie. The way we follow different people at the same time works perfectly, and it's one of those movies that really makes you think. <br /> <br /> Spoiler !!!! <br /> <br /> The fact that the girls who kill each other is the one you do not notice. That fact made me think a little bit, since that's why she commits suicide in the movie. The director impressed me with this by making a movie that shows the plot for the film. and also deliver the message that many people would not have realized it. Some people may start talking about why nobody did anything to stop it before it did, but no one noticed it, just like no one who watched the movie too ... I do not know about you, but I did not imagine it would be her Who committed suicide .. You ?? Greetings Jan
