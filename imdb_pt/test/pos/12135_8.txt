So you think you've seen all the Mafia movies ever made! Here is one that no one has heard of. It's a fast, low-budget B movie - filmed in the Jersey marshes. For us fans of Mafia movies, it had a little bit of everything - sex, violence, swearing and bullshit acting like "gafones". While the violence dominated the film, I found myself laughing at some familiar scenes I've seen in The Sopranos and Goodfellas. Look for a 1977 version of "Badabing Girls" at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> All our favorite mobster stereotypes have been featured here. And as for realism, "fugettaboutit"! Joe Pesci was superb, portraying the classic wise character as we've seen him do so many times over the years. This was probably his first shot, and it was a gem. Pesci fans should go to the store to check out this movie. You have to look carefully at it as it goes through different names. My copy called "The Family Enforcer". Here is known as "The Death Collector". But whatever the name, it must be called - A winner.
