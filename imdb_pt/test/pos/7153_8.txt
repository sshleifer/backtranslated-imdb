It is always a pleasure to see characters in a movie who are totally kind and well-intentioned, even when they are surrounded by people who are neither one nor the other. The moderately silly premise of the film is that the Conservative religious family Franklin (mother, father, teenage boy and girl) is involved in an accident in which parents and brother have a near-death experience during which they find Jesus somewhat exasperated. soul that removes from them the burden of 'original sin'. When they return to their lives, many of their opinions and attitudes have changed, much to the dismay of their daughter, who did not share the experience. The religious side is, I think, presented with a good balance, from the good (Jesus) to the terribly awful (those of his 'followers' who are obsessed with the sins of others and totally alien to their own). It's a movie to make you think, give you some good laughs along the way and leave you with the nice feeling that the world could be a better place than you think it is.
