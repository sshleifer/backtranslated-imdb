While in a country, Spain, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali combined forces to create the reference short film, cinematic surrealism, Un Chien Andalou, Walt Disney and his collaborator Ub Iwerks in America worked on Steamboat Willie, the most prominent of the early synchronized sound designs (it was revealed that this was not the first, unlike other reports). It is also one of the most simplistic and fun of Mickey Mouse shorts (still in silent movie mode - the only sounds are Mickey and animal beepers). He also quickly passes by his execution of less than ten minutes. But in those minutes, you get the immediate feel of how Disney has fun with your characters, and how the new use of sound changes the way your creation uses animals as musical instruments. There is no story to speak of, just random things that happen and occur because of Mickey (err, Steamboat Willie) in this boat on a river. And like the best Mickey Mouse shorts, your lack of talking acts as an advantage. It's a must see if you have not seen it when you were a kid, but if you have it, it might be worth taking another look.
