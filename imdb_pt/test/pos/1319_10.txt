This is my favorite movie and I think it's perfect. Unlike just about any other movie I can name, I never watch this movie and I think it would have been better if they had changed this or that or whatever. Is that the definition of a work of art? I think so. Every brushstroke in Mishima is perfect and everything flows from Schrader's script. I've always kind of enjoyed the work of Paul Schrader (you can not argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper is an incredible movie), but while his writing often seems to border on the bombastic, his steering style is usually nonexistent. This is deliberate, I think, because their films usually deal with a quest for redemption and are placed in the real world; ugly and hard. His style fits his themes as he presents his characters in a simple and realistic way, and lets them show the public the truth of the situation. Imagine if Schrader had driven Taxi Driver or Bringing Out The Dead instead of Scorsese. But as the protagonists of these two films, while Mishima man was ideal Schrader material, right, in vain and in disagreement with society, his works were subtle and beautiful. In fact, he has had a secondary writer's career as a women writer, producing what can reasonably be described as romantic potbillers. So you would not necessarily have imagined that Schrader was the ideal man to capture that subtlety and beauty in the film. I think the movie shows that he was. The script he helped to form Mishima divides the man into three parts; your life, your death and your mind. His life is represented in black and white, still camera, formal compositions. His death, for which he will always be remembered, is a portable documentary style. And his mind is represented by the dramatized extracts of his novels, each revealing the thought processes of this complex man, who almost never wrote a character that was not a reflection of himself. These dramatizations are beautiful to see, thanks to Eiko Ishioka's remarkable production design and Schrader's imaginative imagination. Everywhere, the performance is superb, especially Ken Ogata as Mishima, who captures man's essential charm, arrogance and narcissism. The photograph is excellent and contains images that the viewer will retain forever. Finally, the song is simply superb, blending perfectly with the footage, although written and recorded before shooting, adjusted during the editorial and re-writing process. How much the music influenced the filming I do not know, but it attaches perfectly to the image. I have seen many ideas of what various people think the theme of the film is, what Schrader is trying to say. You know, the great things about life, death, etc. But I do not think the movie is saying anything. Mishima already said that, the movie simply repeats itself.
