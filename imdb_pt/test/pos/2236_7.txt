This was a very good movie that was done very well overall. The idea about Mercy (not to spoil) was also original. I think Angelina did a good job as one of her first movies. The only things I disapproved were some of the tacky fight scenes (not going to spoil it either). I liked the first movie and I enjoyed this too. 7/10
