I first saw Love in Limbo playing late on TV about five years ago, and since then it's a movie that I will always remember warmly as one of those movies that you see and are influenced forever. For the uninitiated, the Australian movie has a long history of making off-beat comedies about kind losers, and Love in Limbo is a prime example of this. While Russel Crowe is the only actor by name (although he is currently a movie he needs), the rest of the Australian cast is good - he still steals the series as a pervert, nerd and virginal. <br /> <The general premise is very similar to American Pie. A group of friends wanting to fuck and become men. Unsurprisingly, the entire film focuses on this (with a sub-plot about the leader's mother and several other incidents), and is full of funny situations that inevitably lead to the sweet end. <br /> <br /> If you liked the American Pie, do not expect it to be the same - but expect the same conventions to make appearances. Love in Limbo is not a rude romantic comedy - but it definitely has its share of laughter, clenched fisting moments when the good guy wins and the situations with which all types, Australian or not, can relate. <br /> /> See if you liked it: American Pie, almost famous. Strengths: Good Australian cast, easy to relate, good value pervades. Weaknesses: Predictable in points. My Rating: 8 out of 10
