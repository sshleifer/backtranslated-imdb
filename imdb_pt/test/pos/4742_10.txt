Rules of Engagement is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It is well built, superbly mounted and provides excellent footage to back up the assertions it assumes. The best quality of the film is that it is not based on being supportive of the Dividians as much as it enlightens the public to the blunders and glaring government lies that surrounded the whole situation. I get feelings of disturbing anxiety and extreme anger about how the government dealt with and then covered up a tragedy of this magnitude. The cover-up is what really left me fuming. It is one thing to make a mistake in one operation and admit guilt, but another is to look at the American people directly in the eyes and lie to them. I think I should not be surprised by the history of our beloved country that saw the assassination of JFK, the Vietnam War, and other significant events that smell so badly that you have to hold your nose every time you drive Washington DC Filming of an airplane with special heat detection technology and the autopsies on some of the bodies clearly show that the FBI is lying to the public. One of the things I try to get aware of when I watch a documentary like this is that I'm usually just getting testimony from one point of view. But again, this is undoubtedly one of the brilliant successes of the rules of engagement. He presents his evidence in such a conclusive way that even if you received statements from the FBI, how could you really believe them? I clearly remember when the impasse was occurring in the way the media presented the Dividians as this crazed group of rebel cults with David Koresh, the self-professed Renascer Jesus Christ, as their leader. None of this was really factual, but rather a history of fragments of facts. They simply defended the rights to bear arms and practice their religion as American citizens. If you were the ATF and wanted to search the complex, would you be attacking the building with a unit of men armed with rifles and bulletproof clothing, how to do it? If you're FBI's, why engage in psychological warfare and offer little in the real bargain to help solve the situation? Why pour liters of harmful gas if you want to save the kids? Why open large holes in the structure of the compound when you know of the possibility of starting a fire? Why lie about not firing guns when they can be clearly shown on video? Unless. Unless you wanted to see the situation end up the way it happened. The scene at the end, when the Star of David flag exploded on the mast and the ATF was soon lifted, was an emotional climatic scene that made my head shake in disgust and my stomach rolled uncontrollably. Filmmaker William Gazecki deserves one of my biggest congratulations. It takes a lot of courage to make such a film and I'm sure there have been a lot of repercussions from the government as well. Because of people like him, the public can be shown the real truth instead of crap that is filtered through a media that presents information that can hardly be considered genuine. When I think about how I felt at the time about the Dividians because of David Koresh's media portrayal and how I felt after seeing this movie, it's really incredible. It reminds me of the Bible line of a man who was healed by Jesus and asked the elders how it happened "before I was blind, but now I can see," he went on to tell them. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You may have to look, but it's really something special.
