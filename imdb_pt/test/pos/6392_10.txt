My wife and kids was and still is the best comedy series on TV ever made.I really enjoyed it and everyone at u.k still see the recaps.The Wayans bros. Everyone should somehow be together at a comedy show. My wife and kids were a comedy that the whole family could watch and you do not understand it very often. Is there nothing we can do to make this happen again? do anything for the comedy to show again! 1 Damon Wayans should come back! I really wish Damon Wayans would star or do another comedy like this, of course, with the help of the entire Wayans family. I was very sad when it ended this way and I hope they are more to come in the future. Brilliant comedy great thing! Sincerely, DezMo
