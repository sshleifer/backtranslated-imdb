Meryl Streep as Kate, a woman dying of cancer, plays her role admirably. No wonder she made an Oscar. In part, she proves that caring for and nurturing housewives is as important as her sisters in business. And the lesson she teaches about the expectations of life and her lack of achievement as the relationship grows, that's the most important thing she teaches. We can expect a lot from our partners. Realize that there are many glitches and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a happy life. This is a dark movie and the ending, although sad, shows the reconciliation between father and daughter. I give this one a ten.
