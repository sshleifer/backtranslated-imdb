This is a great documentary and the above comments give a brief summary of how great it was, so I will not repeat the same compliments. But Faith, being a Turkish-oriented subject who probably knows this country more than a common European, falls into the trap of Orientalism that other Western artists often fall into. But come on, man, you're of Turkish blood and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond Beyoglu's old town. It's a missed opportunity for Akin for that reason. Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are a peek of the film and Ceza (a very talented and evil Turkish rapper) makes a small talk about American gangster rappers that I totally agree with. I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
