I caught this little gem totally by accident in 1980 or 81. I was in a renaissance theater to see two old science fiction films. The theater was packed and (without warning) they showed a lot of short sci-fi spoofs (to leave us in the mood). Most of it was a bit of fun, but that came, and within seconds the crowd was in hysterics! The biggest chuckle came when they showed "Princess Laia" with huge cinnamon rolls instead of hair on her head. She looks at the camera, smiles grimly and nods. That made it even more fun! You have to see "Chewabacca" interpreted by what appears to be a Muppet! It was extremely silly and stupid ... but I could not stop laughing. Most of the dialogue was muffled by all the laughter. Also if you know "Star Wars" very well, it's even funnier - they deliberately mock some of the dialogues. This really works with an audience! A definite 10!
