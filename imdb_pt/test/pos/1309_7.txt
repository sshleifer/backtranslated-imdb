I just saw this with my three children - 12 years (boy), 10 years (boy) and 8 years (girl) and this movie was a good family action adventure. Although definitely aimed at the children's market (I would say from 5 to 13) it was certainly watchable and as a parent it is a pleasure to find a movie that appeals to a wide range of ages although it is still suitable for the whole family to watch - especially children younger. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Ricky, a nerd with a vivid imagination (this can be seen in his sound sequences) that frustrates a kidnapping and a great art theft while in - Boarding a flight to Washington for a school trip. Ricky's father is an aircraft mechanic, so Ricky not only knows the structure of the aircraft from the inside out, but is also the best weapon in his flight simulator. This comes in handy when the pilot and co-pilot leave cold through a series of misadventures and there is no one else to fly the plane. I do not want to give more of the plot.
