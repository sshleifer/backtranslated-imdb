Worth it: If it were not for the work of Mick Molloy, then for Judith Lucy. She brings her usual classic style of rampant and filthy to the role, and steals the show in parts. IMHO: I'm not much of an autograph hunter, but I collected 3. The first is from Samuel L. Jackson, the other 2 are in this movie: Tony Martin and Mick Molloy. Altho Martin only makes an appearance, Molloy not only stars, but co-wrote and co-produced this movie. I've been a fan of them for years (apparently, I was the one laughing during micturition on the set in the first episode of The Mick Molloy Show), so I came up with high expectations. I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. With Mick doing a lot of work on this thing, there are many of his usual brands. Phrases such as "blow up the ass" and "these bowls are s *** house" are all over the place as well as plenty of Winnie the Blues being sucked down. It's also the kind of stupid, original story you'd expect from someone like him. This is like one of those American comedies and sports where they do a prisoner baseball team or something. But instead of trying to make a tedious American sport like baseball or the interesting field grid, this movie focuses on a sport usually left to the gray army: Lawn Bowls. But the main difference between this and other sports-type comedies is that it's really, really funny. What's even better is that even though the subject of this movie is a young lout joining an old people's game, it's never an insult to the elderly, and it never gets disgustingly nauseating or anything. It's just good laughs with genuine prices from 1972. Mick is great at the first acting role I've ever seen, as well as Judith Lucy and the rest of the cast, but most of them have a lot of practice ... This is the best Australian comedy that I ve seen in a long time. Go see it and learn the joys of lawn bowls! <br /> <br /> It's a bit like: Major League? SCORE: 8/10
