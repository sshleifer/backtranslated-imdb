I do not understand why everyone is hating Barney. If you hate the program so much, then DO NOT WATCH! It's stupid how everyone is changing the "I love you" son to "I hate you". If you do not like it, fine. Anyway, that's your opinion. But it's no use degrading the show when it's not so bad. OK, so it's cheesy, and yes, it has its flaws, but it's a children's show. Children do not want to be sad and unhappy, they want to be happy. And Barney helps that. And even at the show, there are times of sadness and anger and so on. And yes, Barney uses magic. But children see Barney as an invention of imagination. Children need a place to get away to express themselves. The world is a miserable and difficult place. We all need a place to express ourselves and be happier. Barney does it for us. This show is great. I watched Barney when I was younger. Yes, some people think it's stupid. But I watched and I'm at the top of my class. It may not necessarily make you smarter, but that's not the point. I believe that Barney's point is to provide a place where children can be children and the spirit of childhood can be expressed. Where the imagination lives. So many teenagers are now unimaginative and are afraid to express themselves. Barney helps to encourage this. Barney helped me not to be afraid and just show me who I am. I am in second year of high school now, an AP student with a 4.0, a student of theater with a love for theater and art, and with a new cousin who loves Barney. I watch with him and enjoy and sing along with him. Yeah, it's cheesy and silly, and whatever, but it's great for kids. Who wants to be an adult who does not have the time to have fun? I am a child of heart and I love Barney. It is great for children and those who are a child at heart. <br /> <br /> It's a great show for babies and kids. So stop hating. Let's say you do not like it, but stop with the "dumbest show of all time" or "Barneys, a lot of bull" or whatever. Keep to yourself. Take a cold pill or something else. Here's one thing: I never liked Sesame Street. But you do not see me going: "Grover is a bull burden" or "Cookie Monster should die" or whatever. I hate all the BULLSS ** T people say about books or movies like Barney or Twilight. If you hate it, fine. Nobody cares. Do not go saying hateful things about it because you can just offend someone.
