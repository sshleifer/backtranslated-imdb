This film broke a lot of ground and generally receives much less credit than it should. It addresses a theme that is always present in our everyday life, but which is seen as a phenomenon so common that it does not merit discussion. This phenomenon is that of caregivers (be they doctors or, as in Broken Promise, a senior social worker) who abuse their position in order to harm those they have been accused of protecting. <br /> <br /> Promise, Patty Clawson and her family are abandoned by their parents; but are soon picked up by local police. Faced with a certain perspective of social assistance, Patty begs a young social worker to keep her and her brothers and sisters together. This social worker approaches a senior member of another department, but your request is denied. <br /> <br /> Children are separated into separate houses, following the prevailing views of the day and ensuring a "clean break". But it is this event, the "broken promise" that names the film, which causes the dramatic tension that must continue throughout the film. Angered by the apparent betrayal of the Young Social Worker, Patty Clawson flees from the foster home to which she was sent. <br /> <br /> Faced with the difficult task of finding your family in a climate where the ideal is seen as a complete separation from the past; she does the only thing she can to ascertain her whereabouts and invades the Senior Social Worker's office to steal the case. <br /> <br /> Seized soon after she discovered that she had become a dangerous enemy. Furious at the embarrassment this little girl has caused him and his department, the Senior Social Worker decides to use his power and authority to destroy her; something that he is legally capable of doing. <br /> <br /> --------------- <br /> <br /> This topic, from the harm of caregivers to clients, is relatively taboo. Certainly it has been played very little in films, because few directors want to tread the path that would imply that the caregivers cause damages. <br /> <br /> I think this movie has a very important role in making the public more aware. that sort of thing. The case portrayed is not only plausible but has probably happened many times before for many other children around the world. This movie is critical to changing public opinion in order to get rid of laws that protect harmful people like the Senior Social Worker in "Broken Promise." <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend the Broken Promise. It is an especially appropriate view for social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors and other care professions. It is an avoidance lesson that must be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> ----------- <br /> <br /> In terms of acting in "Promessa Quebrada". "Melissa Michaelsen plays a superb role as Patty Clawson, especially in films such as this credibility, and if the viewer did not identify with Patty's character, the whole message of the film would be at stake. movies today, since her performance in "Broken Promise" shows that she has exceptional talent.
