When you look at the best movies in Mexico, it is more than likely that Photography was performed by Gabriel Figueroa. It is recognized in the world as one of the best that ever existed. His master control of the cameras gave an additional advantage to the films of which he was a part. If added to your participation, we added the direction of Luis Bunuel, you will never find such a pair of aces anywhere else in the world. This story, Nazarin, was written by the greatest writer in Spain, as well as Miguel de Cervantes (Don Quixote de la Mancha). The story itself is superb: Nazarin, a priest who lives from his beliefs, tries to live a very Christian life, but as always there are people who do not accept it. He wanders in many places preaching his Christianity, but most of the time finding people who do not accept him. But beyond the splendid story, it is always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that Bunuel sends us throughout the picture in scenes that make you tremble.
