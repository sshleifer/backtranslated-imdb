Is it a perfect movie? No. It's a strange adaptation of a science fiction book and features space vampires, bare beauties, and the efficiency of the British army. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie, I was very young and all I could remember is the feeling of admiration for the movie and Mathilda May. Actually, if it were not for this beautiful lady to be naked throughout the film, I probably would not have rated it that high, but given its magnificence, now I'm really thinking about voting! <br /> <br /> Lucky me I remembered the movie and watched again now. Imagine the Raiders of the Lost Ark or Poltergeist's special effects scattered in a fairly decent science fiction story, but with completely superior performances. I still enjoyed the film tremendously (as did Mathilda May), but it was a mix of nostalgia, comparing it to the bad movies they make today and really wanting more when it's over. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: if you are a fan of science fiction you can not miss this movie. Oh, and did I mention that Mathilda May is young, beautiful and naked?
