This heated love story (for Cassavetes) is pleasantly conveyed by two wonderful performances by Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassell. Rowlands was never prettier as a repressed woman, bruised in the mid-1930s, who finds her departure on Seymour. Cassell is a pole of energy and romantic notions (on your terms). <br /> <br /> There is a great supporting performance of Val Avery as Zelmo Swift and an unusual (as always) Timothy Carey that is worth the price of admission. Made between Husbands and a Woman Under Influence, this is Cass's most accessible film, which must touch anyone's heart (especially those who hate Cassavetes), who claim that their films are very long and heavily heavy at times . I made my Top Ten that year and did not see enough people. An 8 out of 10.
