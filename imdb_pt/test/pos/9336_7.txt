In 1983, Michael Jackson's popularity was such that if he wanted to make a $ 1 million horror video clip with the "American Werewolf" team and the voice of Vincent Price, then that was exactly what he would do. And never before has a videoclip created such a sensation, sooner or later ... when it was released on VHS, this 13-minute short became the biggest selling musical in the world of all time. But chances are you already know all about it, as whenever there is a list of the best music videos of all time, this almost invariably ranks first. <br /> <br /> It starts with Michael Jackson walking on a dark street with his date after their car broke. He explains to her that he "is not like other men" (cursed on the right), and then the full moon appears behind the clouds. His girlfriend stays there and screams, and screams, and then screams a little more, during a lavishly transforming sequence as Michael Jackson becomes a werewolf. He chases her through the forest, picks her up, and we ... cut to a movie. Oh, all this is taking place in a horror movie that Michael Jackson and his escort are watching. <br /> <br /> So, we're five minutes away from the song "Thriller." Extravagant, a lot? Anyway, you should know how it goes from here ... dancing, singing ... cemetery ... Vincent Price ... zombies ... "What's the problem?" ... then finish credits. Final credits for a damn music video. "Thriller" is not one of Michael Jackon's most memorable songs, but even by today's standards, it's certainly a visual experience. If you have not seen it in its entirety, then you definitely should soon.
