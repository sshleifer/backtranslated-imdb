To be frank, this is probably the best version of my book as a film version of Jazz Singer. The 1927 version is actually a silent film, despite its development as the first talkie. <br /> <br /> Danny Thomas is a great comedian and sings very well. He does Jewish things with feeling. Peggy Lee is great and any movie she has is always fun. Allan Joslyn is not much fun and we could have done without him. One question: since when do singers live in such luxurious homes?
