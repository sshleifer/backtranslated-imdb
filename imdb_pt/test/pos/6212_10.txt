Supercarrier was my favorite movie in the late 80's when it came out. My father recorded for me and I watched it all the time until my stepmother recorded Oprah on it and my heart was torn. I'd love to know if or where I can get it. I've been looking for it. I believe they even came out w / a Supercarrier 2. It was not as big as the first, but I'd like to have them all if I could find them. I do not think @ everything was a bad movie. It was a very interesting movie, with lots of action, but it had a love story plot. The actors / actors in the movie were great. It also helped me to understand that this is not just a man's world but it is also the world of a woman and many women can do the same things if not more than a man can do and women deserve a lot of respect for their duties also.
