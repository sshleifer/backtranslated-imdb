<br /> <br /> I first saw this movie shortly after it was released on video in 1995, I dismissed it offhand, saying that Julie was not Daniel, never really giving it a chance and saying it was horrible. /> <br /> But here it is, 5 years later, it's at Disney and I'm watching it again. And I'm thinking it's not as bad as I got to be. Miyagi is still Miyagi, as well as kool as always, the musical score is still there more enjoyable than ever. And Swank's character is not so bad, his acting is very good considering the script. He beats the third installment by a wide margin. So my original rating of 4 was increased to 7.
