...This one. What immediately came to my mind was Loving Annabelle, for she has this same kind of mature humor and gets away from it. We simply observe how the story unfolds, without taking sides, or having to face any "moral" issues (or, of course, we are, but we do not feed them with spoon). Of course, there were some difficult facts to be faced and choices to make, but it just flowed. Basically, it was like any other love story, any other life, any other sex. <br /> <br /> I personally found the girls having good chemistry, and I had fun with them on their night out. The only thing I could really identify as a problem would be just to feel kind of ... retained. Withheld. It's not about the sex scenes (or the ones that are missing), but given that I felt the movie more excited during the times when they were having fun together, sort of contrasting with the rest. Lowkey is good, but he never chuckled like Loving Annabelle, nor touched me so much. <br /> <br /> That being said, I strongly recommend, it is not a waste of precious time otherwise ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
