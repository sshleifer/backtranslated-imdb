Uzumaki has a formidable reputation within Lovecraftian circles and now I know why. <br /> <br /> Uzumaki is based on a Manga title (which is unbelievably supposed to be better than the movie) and follows the bizarre events that preceded a typhoon in an isolated Japanese city. I will not tell you anything about what happens in this movie because it is an absolute must-see movie. I watched it for the first time last night and was impressed. It was filmed in my best films of all time and was the best fantastic film (literally and photographically) that was released in the last decade. <br /> <br /> This movie is very Lovecraftian in nature. without formally having any direct connection with the Cthulhu Mythos. It was done in the same way that Lovecraft composed his stories; it exudes power as an aura of "something is not right here" intensifies through an early stage to fear and finally horror through subtle progressive changes in soundtrack and in cinematography. This is, in fact, a "strange tale" par excellence. <br /> <br /> Simply stunning.
