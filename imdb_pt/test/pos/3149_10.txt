The Reader is an exceptionally well made and very sweet shorts. Each element of the play helps elucidate a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, filmed and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before filming, not even a reading. The performances are a testament to a good instinctive performance in response to a well-written script. The work of the actresses was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case. This film is an excellent example of how these low-budget contracts benefit actors and filmmakers.
