Do not let any comments (critics, IMDb users or mine) influence you to see this movie. I just read the premise of the plot and was intrigued. After watching, this movie, in my opinion, is definitely worth seeing. It gives a perspective on life that many probably did not contemplate. It's not, however, as Leland himself says, a movie that "can be wrapped in a sleek package with a bow and all." Other user reviews on this site claim to have a psychological background and imply that the story is not viable. Obviously they missed the whole point of the movie, which is disappointing. to say the least. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a well-directed and well-directed film. The story is not good, but I feel that if you do not leave the movie feeling good, you may have missed something. To characterize it as "house of art" is unfair, in my opinion, but as our society likes labels, this is probably what fits. If you think you know everything there is to know about the world ... I suggest you skip this one. If you think movies should be a way to escape "the world" ... you will not find it here. But if you watch, you can find something in yourself.
