I found this little gem as an extra feature on my Vampyr-Der Traum Des Allen Gray DVD, and did not expect too much of it. It looked like it might be a little interesting, so I called. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I did. It was really amazing! Although it was made more than 70 years ago, the animation was, in my opinion, better than some of the ones that are made today with all the effects and experiences available on the computer. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple - newly-mounted toy dog ​​hears his owner's moans about not being able to afford an orange and goes on a quest to find it. In the process, he comes across the underworld of a toy with all sorts of nefarious creatures and toys supervised by none other than the devil himself, who all want the dog's orange for them as well. <br /> <br /> This movie precedes, but reminds me a lot of Mad Monster Party? (1969, Jules Bass) - a film I have always liked - and to a lesser extent some of Tim Burton's animated works - The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993, Henry Selick) and Corpse Bride (2005, Tim Burton). Fans of any of these movies, I'm sure, also love the Mascot. <br /> <br /> Overall, an amazing piece of short animation that is worth watching.
