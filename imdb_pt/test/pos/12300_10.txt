I first saw this film in Austria when it was first released and I was delighted with it. It is a passionately and deeply moving work that must be experienced by all connoisseurs of the cinematographic art. Too bad it has never been released in DVD format. Maybe one of these days will be rectified, because it would be a shame if one of the best films of all time was forgotten and left to disappear in some movie leap forever. <br /> <br /> Why do 'B' films like 'American Wedding' and 'Eurotrip' win widescreen and fullscreen versions, and often a special edition with several comments and extras, while great works of art such as' The Dead 'are forgotten?
