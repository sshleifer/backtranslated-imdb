SEPARATE LIES is such a sleek, clever and thought-provoking film that I could have seen Tom Wilkinson forever on the screen. The sites within England, London's beautiful places, interiors, elegant wardrobes and, of course, writing and dialogue have made SEPARATE LIES an exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> That said, and maybe it's just an American point of view, as the British are far more sophisticated in dealing with sexual adventures, I found it difficult to see Tom Wilkinson just waiting while his wife happily follows on a sexual journey that really brings you little joy, creates much desperation for her husband, with the cad who is Rupert Everett. Yes, I saw the flaws of Wilkinson's character - his goal of perfection, the desire for everything in his place - but in Emily Watson, she should have looked deeper into her true character and solid goodness, to realize what she threw away . Tom Wilkinson does SEPARATE LIES in a powerful film, watching him feel all the pain, embarrassment and despair on the screen while his wife falls in love with another man. And he himself makes the journey in SEPARATE MENTS, understanding his faults, embracing his wife, despite everything that has happened, and taking her back to London. Bravo, Tom!
