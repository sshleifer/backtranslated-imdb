Simply gorgeous. One of the best minds - umm ... screws - in existence. Rickman and Stowe play their full roles in this tale of a children's book writer who - perhaps? - wrote a subversive treatise. Moscow could learn some things from the torture techniques in this film. They could also do worse than hire Alan Rickman. Five of five stars, and in the present (1-20-2000) # 2 in my top 100 films of all time.
