This is not a walk in the park. I saw it when it came out, and I did not dare to see it again. You'll never see a movie more terribly devastating or depressing. I felt as if I had been severely beaten. In what kind of world are we living when we have children who are treated worse than trash? This is our world, what we create, what we allow to happen. And I would hesitate to say that I-ME-WE is not responsible for that. Babenco made this movie to wake us up, to shake us to our core and he did it. How can we be cruel, self-indulgent, or careless with our children when we see the graphic results of such behavior? He is pointing a finger of accusation to all of us for doing this to the humblest and least powerful of our society. And if you are not doing something every day to avoid it, then you are part of the problem. I'm not a religious fanatic, but this movie made me think about the state of my soul.
