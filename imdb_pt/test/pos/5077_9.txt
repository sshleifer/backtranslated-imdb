"I'm afraid you're talking about the rack, where forced men talk about anything." This Shakespearean line from The Merchant of Venice is repeated again in the new film Rendition, which introduces the viewer to "advanced interrogation methods," which began in the Clinton administration and have become more common since the September 11 terrorist attacks. 2001. The film features a cast of stars, with Oscar winners Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Reese Witherspoon, as well as Peter Sarsgaard, Jake Gyllenhaal and Omar Metwally. Supporting roles filled by unknown actors also do so by sucking the audience into the plot and showing how many people may be affected by terrorist attacks abroad and our means of investigating them. <br /> <br /> The surrender follows an Egyptian born suspected of terrorism (Metwally), who is taken by US officials after his flight from South Africa to Washington DC to an undisclosed prison abroad. His pregnant wife (Witherspoon) ventures into Washington DC to discover his disappearance through a family friend and senator's (Sarsgaard) employee. Gyllenhaal plays a young CIA analyst at the overseas detention center that monitors the violent interrogation. <br /> <br /> This film follows the emotional difficulties of the victim of torture (Metwally) and those involved in obtaining his supposed information. Some, such as the CIA analyst (Gyllenhaal), are visibly shaken and appalled by their methods, while others, the stern senator (Streep) and the foreign interrogator (Yigal Naor), find it necessary and effective. <br /> The film may be described by some as a political piece, but it is ultimately emotional. Metwally's performance as a tortured prisoner is worthy of the Oscars. The film does not intend to preach, but to question and inform the public about a subject that often has no human face. Surrender is known to work, but it is also known to produce false information of innocent prisoners. The film simply portrays the emotional struggles of those involved in such serious business, and does so in a way that will affect each viewer differently. The film will keep your interest, and you get involved in each of the character's difficulties.
