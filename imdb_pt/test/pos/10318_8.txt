Three Stooges short, this one with Shemp. Of all those involving Shemp I've seen, this is my favorite performance of him in a short Stooges. The basic plot is that Shemp should get married at 6 o'clock that night if he inherits the half-million dollars a rich uncle left in his will. So Shemp leaves to get a bride, but he thinks it's a harder road than expected, that is, until they know the money of their inheritance. The best parts here involve shaving Shemp, Shemp and Moe in a telephone booth and Larry on piano as a follow-up to Shemp's voice training session. Also the sequence in which Shemp is confused with Basil Cousin and its result is hilarious.
