While most of the films that put humans against terrible aliens end up being cheap imitations of the 'Aliens' series, Pitch Black is an excellent science fiction movie and a great movie all over the world. Maybe my favorite aspect of the movie is lighting. This film beautifully employs many different colors, shades and intensities of light, which define the mood and give a unique sensation to the film itself, something different from the "normal" cinema lighting to which we are usually subject. Vin Diesel brings your character to life in an excellent way, skilfully avoiding the routine picture of the hardened criminal. After all, the movie is about Riddick's personal journey (Diesel's character), so luckily Vin does not drop the ball. The rest of the cast (apart from the talented and beautiful Claudia Black) was unknown to me, but they all did wonderful performances, animating the various characters with quirks and mannerisms. Pitch Black is a perfect example of making a great movie without the resources of an excessive budget. Special effects are more than adequate, but at the same time they are not the only focus, as in many high-budget blockbusters. It's a great movie because it uses science fiction as a means to tell a compelling and engaging story rather than telling a mediocre story to use the sci-fi flash.
