Well, unfortunately, I can not help but feel a bit disappointed after my very, very anticipated vision of "Just Before Dawn". Jeff Lieberman is a great filmmaker and he can undoubtedly do great things on a small budget, but I've nevertheless hoped to see a much more sadistic and somber slasher of the '80s. But actually, I'm beginning to think that Lieberman is not the culprit for this, but we are the gorehounds! It is more than obvious that Lieberman intended to make his view of the backland look like "Deliverance" and absolutely NOT like "Friday the 13th," which immensely popularized the subgenre a year earlier. The horror and constant sense of threat comes not from insane maniacs with their machetes, but from the genuinely sinister, isolated forests of Oregon where this movie was filmed. If the film seems slow and uneventful, this is only because Lieberman takes the time to present the dark forests and scary mountains as extra characters in his film. We almost never see the killers in person, but there always seems to be somebody drawing behind the trees or under the mountain lakes. Keeping this in mind, "Just Before Dawn" becomes a highly admirable effort of terror and, in fact, far better than his contemporaries bloodied colleagues. Amidst an almost endless selection of bloody and sickly slashers, Lieberman successfully places emphasis on tension and character development. The plot revolves around five twenty-something friends who are heading for a camping vacation in the woods of Oregon, where one of them owns a small piece of land. Forests are deserted and, of course, campers ignore the ranger Roy (George Kennedy!) To return to civilization. Shortly after, they brutally encounter an innate family, of which the twin sons have killer tendencies. All five main characters are amazingly pleasing and compelling! There are no annoying stereotypes you do not like, such as naughty girls or soccer players. As a result of this "natural" character, you automatically root for them, even when they end up turning into savages. The sublime camera provides the film with an unbearable level of tension, and the electronic punctuation of Brad Fiedel only adds to this effect. "Just Before Dawn" is a good slice of the horror of the '80s, as long as you do not want blood dripping from your TV set.
