Two hours ago, I watched this brilliant film that impressed me with its imprisoning photograph. It is understandable how he won the Best Camera award at Cannes 2000. The closes prevailed. Close ups of walls, humans and many other things. The warm colored lighting (which is also usually done by the director) gave the film a warm atmosphere. Only two people are mostly seen in most of them. An interesting song and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie almost all the time. Each of these themes represented a certain atmosphere throughout the film. Silence and slow movements characterize the film. Some scenes were long or serious moments of close-ups. Not only does Tony Leung deserve a prize for his outstanding performance, since Maggie Cheung was also so brilliant. I wonder how many dresses she wore in different scenes. The story was also connected in some way with the history of Hong Kong and the region in the 1960s. This prevented me from understanding some details about it, especially in the end. In short, I would recommend to fans of artistic films to watch in the movies.
