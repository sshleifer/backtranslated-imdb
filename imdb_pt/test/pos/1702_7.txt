I just finished an An American Werewolf movie night in London and Paris. Let me start by saying "London" still holds after all those years and the transformation sequence is of any quite impressive standard, the film was funny, and scary, also a bit bloody .... Now we go to "Paris" It's nice, a few scars, a lot of gore not as exciting or scary as the original, but it has some laughter in what has become quite fashionable these days in movies, so maybe in that sense it was ahead of its time, transformations' CGI while good for the technology of its time is by no means as impressive as the original. I gave this movie a 7 because I have to admit it was nice, I laughed a lot and found Tom Everett Scott so silly that at first I wanted to dislike his performance just to end up liking it ... will understand .. Julie Delpy was competent, as well as the direction of the script that lacked brilliance and delicacy. I read here that John Landis should aim for evil, he was not sure it would have been a completely different movie. I also noticed some discussion about a "What If" Sequel well no one noticed the obvious should be in American and here is my title "An American Werewolf Comes" or in DC that would be fun all those political dogs need a good scare. You should simply see the original on your new DVD transfer with Dolby 5.1 sound and watch both on an HDTV with upconvert turned on ... good !!!!
