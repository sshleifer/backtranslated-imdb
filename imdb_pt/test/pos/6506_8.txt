Being a big fan of hip-hop and turntablism, I always knew I'd like this movie. However, I was not prepared for how good the documentary really is. It covers almost every important aspect of the single element of hip-hop that exists from the beginning. "History" begins in the early 1970s, and follows the evolution of turntablism as an art from the beginning of 2000 (turntablism aficionados will point to this as meaningful). <br /> <br /> The issue is almost perfect throughout the film. In addition to the excellent visual "scratch" techniques they used, the quick cut between the interviews and the shoot is great, giving the movie rhythm when needed. The sound editing is also very good, with some radical sounds being used to help with the transitions. <br /> <br /> The absence of a narrator was also welcome. We are not carried by the hand through history and as a result, the audience is able to make their own assumptions easier. Each DJ adds another side of the story, and it's very interesting to hear about the unknown stars of hip-hop, especially those who were there when hip-hop was being sidelined, right and center, by the music industry. While there are many excellent things about this movie, I have some complaints. The biggest of these is the absence of several notable DJs, such as Ca $ hMoney and Jazzy Jeff, as well as DJs from outside of America such as Scratch Perverts and DJ Noise. However, if you watch the commentary on the DVD (something I recommend), the producer and director go into great depth about how they regret not being able to present them. The deleted scenes contain many interviews with Ca $ hMoney, Jazzy Jeff and the Scratch Perverts. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best documentary I have ever seen in hip hop culture and music. It fails to show the true potential of turntablism; So I highly recommend the videos of the DMC and the ITF. However, this is a small complaint. I highly recommend this movie, not least for the cool soundtrack, with great music everywhere. (9/10)
