Well, it might be a kid movie ... maybe, but I will not let my 9-year-old kids watch! So, the one who says it's a kid movie hmm?!, It's a teenage movie I agree .., so but coming back to the movie is about a kid who can lie very well .., so good that in the end no one's true nows or In addition, it's a good movie to see the nice screen I vote at 8 for the screen game and story ... I think they write a little lesson with that ... "the truth is never exaggerated."
