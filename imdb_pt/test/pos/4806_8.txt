Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan are superb in the thriller directed by Johnny To, who shames most Western efforts. Think of it as the 'Heat' of Hong Kong, only better! Everything about the movie screams class; from performances to soundtrack, from cinematography to screenplay. The tone remains serious throughout, but the film has a cool line in black humor, friendship and romance in its heart. Of course, it gets a bit absurd later, but it would be a hard-hearted viewer who did not find something to love about this movie. Thank God, Hollywood has not yet (remade) and ruined a classic. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
