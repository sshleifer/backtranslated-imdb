In Spain, former sailor Ramón Sampedro (Javier Bardem) has been a tetraplegic for twenty-eight years and is fighting in court for his right to practice euthanasia through an association that defends freedom of choice and is led by his friend Géne (Clara Safe). Ramón is presented to the lawyer who defends his cause, Julia (Belén Rueda), who has a fatal degenerative disease; and meets Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a solitary worker who has been abused by men. Their relationship changes the behavior and point of view of the life of Rosa and Julia. <br /> <br /> The Chilean Alejandro Amenábar is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary directors. His filmography released in Brazil consists of excellent and original films: "Abre Los Ojos", "Theses", "The Others" and "Mar Adentro". Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain these days. His association produced this sensitive drama on a very controversial subject, the right to commit euthanasia. This drama is never cheesy or depressing, since the script uses humor as a relief valve in the most dramatic situations. The performances of the cast are perfect, with characters having and defending different positions in relation to this unpleasant subject. The dialogues and the lines are very solid and intelligent. I noticed in the IMDb plot line that this movie is based on the real life story of Ramón Sampedro. Unfortunately, neither the film nor the DVD gives this important information. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sea Inside" ("Inner Sea")
