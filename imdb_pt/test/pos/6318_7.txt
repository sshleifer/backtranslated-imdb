One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced in the middle of the protagonist, the Mafia man-half Titta Di Girolamo, a physically non-descriptive middle-aged man from Salerno in southern Italy. When we are introduced to him at the beginning of the film, he has lived a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the canton of Italian-speaking Switzerland for the past ten years, conducting a business that we are only gradually introducing. While this crucial, though seemingly normal, scene takes place, Swiss bank officials, who normally count Di Girolamo's money, tell him that $ 10,000 is missing from his ever-packed bag of stacked bills. On the news, he quietly but coldly threatens his bank manager to want to close his account. Meanwhile, it tells us, the viewers, that when you bluff, you have to bluff to the end without fear of being taken aback or seem ridiculous. He says: you can not bluff for a while and then in half, tell the truth. Having done so - bluffed only halfway and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and finally love - is exactly the reason behind the onset of Titta Di Girolamo's problems. <br /> <br /> This initially unfriendly character, a sullen, taciturn, brusque man on the verge of 50, a man who does not even respond in kind to maids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at some point Someone the viewer cares deeply about. At one point in her unlived life, Titta decides to be concerned about appearing "ridiculous." The first half of the movie can be described as "slow" by some. He really reveals the days and nights of Di Girolamo at that hotel in a deliberately strange rhythm, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the unimaginative man, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you end up unexpectedly loving and feeling when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music. theme of the Scottish band Boards of Canada stood out especially). <br /> <br /> There has never been a contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way the film used the protagonist's insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist (and much more explicitly, the film Al Pacino Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolize a deeper emotional malaise that has been so deep in the obscurity of the unconscious, it is almost impossible pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). The young, friendly waitress at the Sofia hotel (played by Olivia Magnani, granddaughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man he has not seen for 20 years, unexpectedly provides a small window into the life that Titta eventually (though tentatively at the beginning) agrees to look again. Although it is never explicitly stated, the viewer KNOWS that for a man like Titta to accept The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and does not grant anything to the expectations of the viewer, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is an excellent representative of this small, discreet and discreet Renaissance that has been happening in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecitt√† during the second half of the 70's. The world expects Italy to produce more Il Postino-like dishes, more La Vita and Bella films ... failing to explore beautiful creations such as Le Conseguenze dell ' Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss, world.
