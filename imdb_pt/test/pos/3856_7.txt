There are some cartoon movies where animals or something "non-human" is portraying humans and I think this movie is one of them. In addition to some plot points and characters - this movie could be changed with all people instead of mostly animals. Although - it's good that someone does not - I feel like cats are very good in this movie that portrays humans! :-) <br /> <br /> This film also focuses on many adult issues - which is rather strange for a Disney movie. He mentions alcohol *, shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack human "trespassantes" and shows a male cat named "Abraham Delacy Gieuseppe Almost Thomas" O 'Malley, imagining a cat, in a surprisingly human and adult way. Like a cartoon movie - or just a movie in general, I feel this is very good - the plot and the characters are especially good. The film (in general) is set in France and you meet a family of cats - the mother Duchess and her kittens Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz. You also meet the old (rich) gentleman who loves cats, butler Edgar and an old man (who CLEARLY lost his balls) named George. The old gentlewoman discusses her will with George and Edgar hears what he receives from the will that he will have after the cats have him. He's INCREDELY crossed with this - and has a evil scheme in mind ... <br /> <br /> A very cute movie for all ages - enjoy "Aristocats"! <br /> <br /> * Not including "Basil the Great Mouse Detective" and a few others, perhaps, that I can not think of at the moment.
