Hardware Wars is a hilarious short 12-minute parody of the original Star Wars movie that was released just a few months after Star Wars in 1977. This movie uses home appliances like spaceships and Star Wars-like actors to send you rolling on the floor in lurid laughter uncontrollable. This movie won many awards at film festivals and was the movie that inspired Mel Brooks to write his Star Wars parody movie called "Spaceballs." <br /> <br /> This is my favorite parody movie and I recommend it to anyone who is familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humor. <br /> <br />
