Stan as a bullfighter and a good one, is a big surprise. Usually overshadowed by Oliver Hardy, this silent short allows him to take the lead, and the center of attention. <br /> <br /> We can only draw the conclusion that his character "Rhubarb Vaseline" was a parody of the many films of Rudolph Valentino. of this time. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to laugh at yourself like an idiot in some dialogues, and keep an eye on the special effects. <br /> <br /> I saw this on DVD in one volume. 1 & 2 collection.
