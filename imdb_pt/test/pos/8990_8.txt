Like most sports movies, it's no surprise that people who know something about the sport can find flaws in it. As a football referee, I have not yet seen a movie or TV show hit when I described a game. "Forever" has good actors, but I found Sean Astin a bit young to be an administrator in a juvenile jail. I was very grateful that the plot did not involve the protagonist who turned his colleagues into rugby players and faced Flagstaff and Highland. What comes to credulity: a police patrol car only stops at the exact time when the bad guys from Flagstaff clog Rick Penning. Even though rugby is not a sanctioned sport at the national level, the team is a school-based club sport - much like rodeo. That said, I find it hard to believe that high school officials allow students to play with open wounds: this is not done on this day of AIDS and hepatitis. I do not care about tradition and the macho image. Despite this, it was a cool movie in which teens should act like adults (and sometimes actually did). Unfortunately, many trainers are like Flagstaff - or worse.
