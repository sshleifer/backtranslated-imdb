Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a translator who lives in Italy, discovers that she has a loss of memory and can not remember the last two days. She begins to follow a trail of fragments of memory, which leads her to the small town of Garma. The people in the city seem to recognize her and she's beginning to suspect that the recurring nightmares of astronauts conducting horrific experiments have something to do with her own amnesia. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting and the plot is good, but it is a bit slow and artistic for my liking. The plot has some nice twists and turns and it's very hard to figure out where you're going. Florinda Bolkan is good in her role (but still better in "Flavia the Heretic") and it is always good to see the child actor "star" Nocoletta Elmi. The role of Klaus Kinski is too small. This is not a movie for the stubborn dog or exploitation addict, but still a mystery of a very nice hour and a half.
