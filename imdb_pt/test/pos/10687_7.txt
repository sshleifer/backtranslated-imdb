This is the question that astronauts Roy Thinnes and Ian Hendry wonder when they discover a parallel world of the Earth always hidden from the other side of the sun in this cult science-fiction melodrama of 1969, released here in America as JOURNEY ON THE SIDE OF THE DOM. The plot of the film was conceived by the British writers Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, creators of TV programs like "UFO", "The Thunderbirds" and "Space 1999". It is extremely strange at times, betraying the influence of "The Twilight Zone" and even the Stanley Kubrick classic, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Derek Meddings' visual effects work, which would also later work on SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, stood out surprisingly well in the last three decades of advancement in special effects; and while they're not really on the same exalted level of Kubrick's film, they're very superb. If you do not anticipate a STAR WARS movie and can overcome the occasionally banal dialogue, DOPPELGANGER is a good movie; was good enough for me to rate a '7' and consider it an unknown science fiction gem.
