The only conceivable flaw in this movie is the title !! Please stop comparing it to the first one! I did in my previous review just to separate it from the first. If you have not seen the movie yet and are curious, TOTALLY forget the first one and invent a different name for it. There is nothing like it and it has a humor of its own. This is a great exponent of the mid-80s comedy. I seriously doubt that big names in this cast made the film because they were bankrupt or even wanted to redo the first one. Anyone who wanted to kick the snobby aristocracy should love this little work. I maintain, the only reason this is at the bottom of the IMDB 100 is because of its title. I usually hate movies like these (ie adam sandler, farrell, farrelly bros ...), but this movie only makes me laugh hysterically. I do not know, maybe it's like a bad relationship that I can not leave or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. Anyway, this is the most underrated movie of the 80's behind 'The Stunt Man'. <br /> <br /> Robert Stack - WE LOVE YOU !!! (1919-2003)
