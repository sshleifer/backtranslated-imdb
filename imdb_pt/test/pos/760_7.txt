I had never heard of this movie before meeting it while I was flipping through the shelves at a local rental store. Having just watched the last part of Harry Potter, I was intrigued by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. Reading the description of "an overzealous evangelical caretaker," and identifying myself as an evangelical Christian, I thought, "Oooh ... that should be interesting." And so it was. I found Mr. Brock's story beautiful in words and images; and, unfortunately, very familiar. The contrast he made between the interpretations of Ben's parents about what it means to be a Christian was a poignant comment about how Christians see each other and the impact that perception has on those around them. On the one hand, we have Ben's mother saying, "Whatever happens behind those walls, Ben, we are ambassadors of God. We show the world a smiling face." On the other hand, Ben's father discusses the truth in his sermon earlier in the film. At the end of his monologue he states, "The more a person parades his or her Christianity for the benefit of others, the less I am inclined to trust in the Christianity they claim." God tells us that true faith is the freedom to choose truth. Now, as you express it, the way, the way, the means at your disposal, these things are of no consequence, whether you are a Christian or an atheist, unless in your heart you are true. " If only our churches were full of Christians who attributed to this latter definition of what it means to be a follower of Jesus, rather than the first. What difference would that make! As a Christian and a psychologist, I would like to have an imperfect and authentic faith about a perfectly polished image at any time. What a tragedy ?? feel that I always need to play a role when, in fact, I just need to rest in the freedom to be wholly whom God made me to be. I think Mr. Brock provides a refreshing glimpse of what that freedom in Christ looks like. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a new look for faith.
