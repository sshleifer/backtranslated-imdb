Send them to the freezer. This is the solution that two butchers find after discovering the popularity of selling human flesh. An incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it so much more than a horror movie. Complex characters challenge superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worth it - if you can handle it. Definitely a somber movie, but also a bit redeeming.
