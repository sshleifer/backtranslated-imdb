Some time ago, we read about the results of a survey by some Newspapers Sports Writers. The questions asked were only two, and were brief and correct. Question number one asked the interviewee to tell who his most beloved college football team was. Question number 2 asked the supporter to name his most hated football team. The answer to both questions was simply, Notre Dame! ND is tops on both lists! Yes, love them or hate them, but you certainly do not ignore them. <br /> <br /> The roots of this unique position of this Indepent University Soccer Powerhouse are found in one's life and career. , grown up, little Norweigen immigrant boy from Chicago named Knute Rockne. Like a biopic, the production of KNUTE ROCKNE, ALL-AMERICAN (1940), came out relatively close to the death of Coach Rockne. in a plane crash of 1930. It was about 10 years after the film was released. That would mean that preliminary work on the project began about 8 years after our country's great Rockne loss. <br /> <br /> His image and voice were well known from newspapers, radio and Motion Picture News Reels. Both Knute's widow, Bonnie Skiles Rockne, and the University of Notre Dame had the right to approve the actor's choice to interpret the leader and approve the script. We thought they could not have done the job better. Pat O'Brien really looks like the role and was himself a football player in college. Ronald Reagan is cast for the crucial role of George Gipp **, a free-spirited student going to Notre Dame on a baseball bag! He was a walk-on soccer player. <br /> <br /> The cast is full of talented players. We have veteran Griffith, Donald Crisp as Fr. Callaghan, C.S.C., President of Notre Dame. Albert Basserman is Fr. Newland, Professor of Chemistry Prof. and Rockne. Gail Page appears as Mrs. Bonnie Skiles Rockne. Owen Davis, Jr. is Rockne's cohort, Gus Dorais (the transmitter of this historic ND against the ARMY Game at West Point). <br /> <br /> The cast is completed by Kane Richmond, Nick Lukats, William Marshall and William Byrne as the Four. In real life, Howard Jones, the 'Pop' Warner, Bill Spaulding and Amos Alonzo Stagg appear as themselves in Probe Congress scenes at College Sports and add an authentic twist. <br /> <br /> As for the biopic, KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-American! all you can say is that it reaches the starting point and does not slow down from start to finish. There is no time lost either. All screen time is used to move the story. <br /> <br /> The use of the Notre Dame Choir, the Campus itself and the whole rock band leads to the music and the feeling of being really there. On this day, although her basketball team and other sports teams compete in the Big East conference, Notre Dame remains an independent in NCAA football. What this means, that in fact, The Fighting Irish has a national timeline. <br /> <br /> There was no such deal with the George Gipp Family. There was a process a few years ago about the scene depicting the young Mr. Gipp giving the famous "Win Onr For The Gipper Speech". Television impressions of this KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-AMEICAN were less the talk on the death-bed scene. <br /> <br /> Other Notre Dame films have been made over the years. THE SPIRIT OF NOTRE DAME (Universal 1931) introduced J. Farrell McDonald as a trainer resembling Rockne. He also featured Lew Ayers, Andy Devine Nat Pendleton as well as members of the Real Notre Dame Championship Teams with the actual Four Horsemen. So, of course, we have RUDY (Tri-Star, 1993), with Sean Astin, Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty and Charles Dutton, among others, in an excellent cast. There was also talk of an unauthorized film, a critic of Notre Dame called GLORY OF GOLD, but nothing materialized, did it? (Tell me, dear reader, THANX !!) <br /> <br /> Warner The brothers always had great songs, both in opening themes and in incidental music. In this Rockne movie, they incorporated NOTRE DAME FIGHT SONG into the score. Along with him were STEP NOTRE DAME and NOTRE DAME ALMA MATER, which premiered at Rockne Funeral in 1930 in the Basilica of Notre Dame.
