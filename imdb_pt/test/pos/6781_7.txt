I found a copy on a sale of bin bargain of this old classic. I played with DOSBox on a Vista machine without any problems. It's graphically dated heavily, but what do you expect from a 12-year game! The game is a hybrid of FPS / Adventure game. It's what I call pseudo 3D, you can not look up or down, just turn on 360 (think Wolf3D). The game can be complicated with a very limited supply of healthy pots and a somewhat median interface (Hint: Press I), but overall it is acceptable. <br /> <br /> One of the main forces of the game is the weather. . The game uses a lot of video in motion, and while the acting is b-grade and the plot is very unstable, the game as a whole seems genuinely scary. It also does a good job of getting you to question the 'good guys'. Are they really helping, or are they just waiting to stab you in the back? The other big selling point is the size of the games. There are 18 memory chapters, ranging in game time from 10 minutes to potentially hours. My first game took me a week with a serious devotion of time. <br /> <br /> Dating, yes, but if you lost years ago and can find it for $ 5, take a look. Cheaper than a movie and more fun than most movies.
