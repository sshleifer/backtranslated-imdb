That succinctly sums up ... cheesy. MacDowell's inability to act at times is painful, and Hurt needs money to take on those silenced roles, but I still liked that. <br /> <br /> Why? In a single word, Travolta. He's great in this movie. Still, I can not give the movie a very high score, but it certainly deserves better than it seems to be getting.
