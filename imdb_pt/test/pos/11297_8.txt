One of the great tragedies of life is that Disney is so successful at everything it does. If they were not, we could have little unique jewelry of animation, like "The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird". The story is that an evil king usurped the throne from a place called Up-And-Down-Land (I could have the wrong name). He is hated by all. His favorite hobby is to shoot birds, and at some point in the past, he presumably killed Wonderbird's wife (a bird that played with Peter Ustinov's typical style), leaving him with four kittens to raise. Meanwhile, we see that another of the evil king's hobbies is painting. He has done three paintings in particular: a self-portrait, a painting of a shepherdess (for which he fell in love), and a chimney-sweeping painting (of which he is jealous). One night, the shepherdess and the chimney sweeper come down from their paintings and run away together. The king's self-portrait descends from his body too, and ends with the real king (You think I'm making this up? It's the real plot) and sends the real police force after the young lovers. Mr. Wonderbird then helps the lovers try to escape the King's forces. <br /> <br /> The plot is wonderfully surreal, and the Up-and-Down-Land installation is an incredibly imagined place, full of imposing accessible buildings. only by elevators. It is an equal mixture of the worlds of "Metropolis" and "1984" and the drawings of Dr. Seuss. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to a unique visual experience that does not fit the standard formula for most cartoons. features.
