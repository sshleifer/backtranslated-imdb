An example of great footage. The epic story of three great stages of the life of a boy counted on raw eloquence and fearlessness. Rarely comes a movie that makes me say it out loud for most of the show, "this is really a good movie ..." over and over again. That's exactly what happened when I watched this movie. I really do not understand how anyone could not like it. I found myself crying and laughing at the same moment, unable to control how I felt about the scene. The acting is excellent. Eric Mabius - Why is not he on all the movie screens? It was truly extraordinary. His seemingly effortless onscreen attempt struck me in deep, visceral ways. I thank you. In my opinion, Eric Schaeffer is one of the best filmmakers, and I hope he continues to face the challenges he faces in trying to give us art in the face of fierce commercial filming. <br /> <br />
