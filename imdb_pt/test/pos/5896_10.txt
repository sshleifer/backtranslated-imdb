One of the great things about The Best Years of Our Lives is that, although it was firmly established in the post World War II period, the issues we are talking about are as real today as on VE or VJ day of 1945. The problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet. <br /> <br /> And while we may not know the story often, we may be grateful that, at least once, the United States of America has learned from what happened to its veterans after the previous World War. The GI Bill of Rights is mentioned in passing in The Best Years of Our Lives was arguably the greatest piece of social legislation of the last century. Many veterans have taken advantage of this, as do veterans like Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell, whom you see here. <br /> <br /> All three of these actors played archetypal veterans, characters that every corner of the US can identify with. Everyone finds themselves in an Army transport plane flying to their hometown, Boone City, Iowa. <br /> <br /> War is a great leveler of class and distinction. Bank employee in March, soda idiot Andrews and football star Russell would probably never get to know each other in real life, even in a small town like Boone City. But they meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken. <br /> <br /> March is the eldest, a man with two children and the perfect Hollywood wife Myrna Loy. It installs on the first and the best. He has some wonderful scenes, getting drunk drunk on his return and then having a little drink in it, tells the bankers at a banquet in no uncertain terms. <br /> <br /> I also love his scene where another veteran who returns, a partner wants to get a bank loan for his own piece of land. Watch the expressions of March while listening to the man's speech for money. You can feel it reading the soul of man. It's what earned him his second Best Actor Oscar for this movie. <br /> <br /> Harold Russell was a true veteran who lost both hands during service in the Pacific. He won an Oscar for special recognition for his performance. Because of this, it was probably unfair to nominate him in the category of Supporting Actor, in which he also won. His performance, especially his scenes with Cathy O'Donnell as his girlfriend who loves him with or without his hands, is beyond anything that can be described as acting. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is the only officer of the three, an Army Air Corps bomber. From the group of them, maybe he should have stayed. He also comes from the poorest pool in the group and was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform. That uniform and the monthly allotment checks were what made Virginia Mayo interested enough to marry him. The problem is that he is considerably less in her eyes as a civilian. <br /> <br /> While Mayo is playing with Steve Cochran, Andrews is fortunate to have March's daughter, Teresa Wright, interested in him. They are the main story of the film, adapting Andrews to civilian life and adapting to the fact that he marries the wrong woman. Not all veteran problems were solved with GI Bill. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy receives little recognition for the Best Years of Our Life. My guess is that it is because her role as a wife was very much like the stereotyped roles of the women she had patented at MGM. Still as wife to March and mother to Wright, she really is the glue that keeps the family together. <br /> <br /> The Best Years of Our Lives won Best Picture for Sam Goldwyn, Best Director for William Wyler and a few others besides the two Oscars in action. It was a critical and popular success, possibly the best film Sam Goldwyn ever produced. It remains to this day a captivating and enduring classic and will be so for centuries. It's almost three hours long, but your interest will never diminish. <br /> <br /> The best tribute this movie received came from Frank Capra, who had his own movie in the Oscar draw that year in several categories. In his memoirs, he said he was disappointed to have been beaten at the Oscars that year, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created a masterpiece that deserved all the awards it could get for it. <br /> <br /> The way, the movie that Capra hoped was that it's a wonderful life. The Beat Years of Our Lives can not be praised more than that.
