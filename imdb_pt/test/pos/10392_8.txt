I was shocked by this movie. I've been renting Antonioni's movies / rediscovering them, and this film has shown me the climax and fruits of its 50 years of driving. What eye for the setting, color and detail! I've never seen such visual beauty and poetry filmed before. I had to stop after the first story and hold back the tears. Yes, beauty moves me, as if Keats moved to write Ode in a Greek urn. This film is made for mature audiences, emotionally and intellectually. Those who expect to see physical action and soap opera will be disappointed. I will have to see this movie several times before I can enjoy it and judge it. This film must be seen for all filmmakers and directors. <br /> <br /> Possibly a truly great film, of the order of Kurosawa's Dreams.
