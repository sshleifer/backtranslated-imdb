The rarest of cult filmmaker Spaghetti Westerns filmmakers, Corbucci (of whom I only stayed with WHAT I'M DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REVOLUTION [1972]) is one I only recently noticed via Stracult by Marco Giusti. "is a jewel of the atypically dark genre in the style of the director's masterpiece, THE GREAT SILENCE (1968), complete with desolate snowy landscapes. <br /> <br /> Johnny Hallyday, the Frenchman Elvis Presley, who saw for the first time in Jean-Luc Godard's DETECTIVE (1985) is a curious but highly effective choice to play the lone anti-hero Hud (who, like Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name, the famous Dollars Trilogy, Sergio Leone, is equipped with steel plate armor for protection), and I met Hallyday's stunning daughter Laura Smet at the 2004 Venice Film Festival, but I was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director, Claude Chabrol! Moschin is another curious addition to the fold (which serves basically the same function as Frank Wolff did in THE GREAT SILENCE), but it benefits well and is playfully clumsy in the presence of a bather Fran√ßoise Fabian, the second then plays a greedy nymphomaniac saw of a banker who seduces everyone in pursuit of their goals. Sylvie Fennec has another important female role as a farm girl cared for by Hallyday and who, at one point, is invited to free love by 'apache Gabriella Tavernese' hippie (with that in mind, it is important to note that the film presents surprising , but welcome nudity attacks from both Fabian and Tavernese)! By the way, the anachronistic addition of a bunch of long-haired youth (who also engage in revolutionary conversations and anti-smoking) is a somewhat daring attempt at contemporary relevance? but all this ends up contributing to the fun (in addition, even the black waitress uses an Afro hairstyle!). <br /> <br /> Mario Adorf also has tremendous fun with the small role of a Mexican greater than life. bandit nicknamed "The Devil"? who keeps a young biographer constantly at his side (an element that may have influenced UNFORGIVEN by Clint Eastwood [1992]) and, at a certain point, challenges the captive Moschin to a duel of halters! Having mentioned this, does the film also contain a very unusual 'death weapon'? as Hallyday has an opponent kicking the cash register of the hall in his face! As always, fun and false fistfights are accompanied by overly emphatic sound effects; Equally typically for the genre, however, the melancholic note of Angelo Francesco Lavagnino emerges as a more significant asset. In fact, is the ambiguous ending entirely in keeping with the generally somber tone of the film? after Fabian fell into the hands of the locals, the hippies (who once idolized Hud) suddenly turn on him when they are injured and terrorize the city (forcing everyone on the street and without clothes), but the undisturbed sniper manages to stand up face your challenge (they, however, run away with the prospect of facing it!) and then leave town, leaving Fennec behind. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I bought this through a good quality widescreen printing. in Italian though with French credits and the occasional lapse ?? about a minute of screen time at all ?? in the French language (where, apparently, the original soundtrack was not available).
