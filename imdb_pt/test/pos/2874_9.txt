See No Evil is the first movie from the WWE movies. Yes WWE, Word Wrestling Entertainment, pro wrestling. Of course, being a WWE movie, a wrestler has to star, being the fighter Glenn Jacobs, also known as Kane. Which is not really important, as if you did not know Kane or what WWE represented to you, you would never know it had anything to do with the crazy word of wrestling, since the movie has nothing to do with wrestling. See No Evil is a rough horror movie, there are some moments when some people can jump, but most of the time just say, look how rough we can get! Not that there is anything wrong with that. Jacob Goodnight (played by Kane) is a kind of character of the type Jason, his mother tortured him as a child with rigid Christian beliefs (undervaluations) and distorted his mind. Now he's a big, scary killing machine. 90% of the movie takes place in an abandoned hotel where Jacob chases six teenagers (surprised?) And a handful of adults. I could explain why they are in a scary old hotel, but uh, who cares? Despite the lack of originality, See No Evil is well done, it should be. Kane plays an incredible killer and needs little makeup to be scary. A flaw in the movie is the most annoying possibility that people survive, I really look forward to seeing them being horribly dead, but unfortunately, that does not happen. I wish the film did not have the stigma of wrestling attached to it, although as I said the movie has nothing to do with wrestling, people are still closed enough not to want to see it because of course they are wrestling Hate. So again, the movie can also make money because Wrestling fans will want to see it. Anyway, See No Evil has top quality effects and little CGI, and like I said, it's pretty brutal, so like I say it's a good thing ... if you like that sort of thing.
