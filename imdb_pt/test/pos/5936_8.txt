The 2005 edition of the Royal Rumble came live from the Save Mart Center in Fresno, California. The two major WWE championships were being championed, The Undertaker was battling Heidenreich in a coffin game, Shawn Michaels was taking Edge on a grudge that had been built since October last year and of course every man by himself Rope Royal Rumble itself. Who would get the price this year? Chris Benoit? Border? Eddie Guerrero? Border? John Cena? Baptist? Border? Shawn Michaels? There was no shortage of candidates. <br /> <br /> It was Batista who won the popular victory in the main battle of the event, but not without controversy, or should I say, a bad end. Batista and John Cena were the last two men in the ring. Batista should drop the young Smackdown! star on top rope, but it all went wrong and both were falling to the ground. The umpires acted as we had a collection dispute similar to that of Bret Hart and Lex Luger in 1994. That took the chairman out of the board. Vinnie Mac walked into the ring in the way that only he could, but was badly injured in the ring. It was unusual to see Vince McMahon sitting upside down, telling the two men to restart the game. Batista then did what he should do the first time and played Cena on the floor, sealing his own future with a Championship match at WrestleMania 21. <br /> <br /> The undercard for this year's Royal Rumble had a very solid line with many of the biggest WWE stars competing in the games. Each brand had two great games each. <br /> <br /> Raw opened the night with the game between Shawn Michaels and Edge. This was a good technical contest. Back and forth until the Edge picks up the pinfall. This was a smart reserve decision and kept Edge as a contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. <br /> <br /> The second game of the night was the fight between Casket and The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The game was not a classic, but again, has it been some classic Casket? It was fun. Especially when Snitsky got involved, and then Kane came out of the coffin for a big pop. The Undertaker did not surprise anyone when he got the win, beating the lid on Heidenreich and this mediocre feud. <br /> <br /> The first of the two Championship games of the night was John Bradshaw Layfields defense of the WWE Championship in a Triple Threat match against Kurt Angle and the Big Show. This game was very good. Again, it's not a classic, but fun, though. JBL took the win after pinning Kurt Angle. His celebration was short, however, when backstage teddy Long informed him on No Way Out, he would defend the WWE Championship in a barbed wire cage fight against Big Show. Not a very nice way to spend a Sunday night. <br /> <br /> And of course there is no show without Punch. Punch of course being the Triple H Heavyweight Champion. His 2004 Unforgiven rematch with Randy Orton was far better than the original encounter. It's a shame because they just do not seem to click well in the ring and that would be a great feud if they did. Orton played the role of concussion very well and was defeated by the game. <br /> <br /> So, the first big one of 2005 was good. Reached your goals. Fiefs have ended and new ones have begun. We were now officially on the way to WrestleMania 21.
