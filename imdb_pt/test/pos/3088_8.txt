After seeing this movie, I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs to the top 250 of all time, but in the genre is a great movie. I know, a lot of people do not find it fun to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things should not be ridiculed ... they are wrong. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks did a great job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights. I've seen the original Robin Hood movies too, but I've never had such good time watching them as I did with this movie. It's just a continuation of hilarious moments and parodies about famous people and movies (Winston Churchil, The Godfather ...). <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone who wants to have a good laugh to watch this movie. For those who think Robin Hood should not be confused, you are wrong, but it is best not to watch because you will probably be offended by it. I give this movie an 8/10.
