I watched this movie at a local festival, the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival of Florida. What a beautiful movie. A simple and uncomplicated tale of morality about a carefree youth having to take responsibility for their actions. Neither pretentious nor flashy my two teenage daughters loved and for a change I was not embarrassed by any content or language of the film. A real family film and the best British comedy film I've seen since Billy Elliot. The film has not surprisingly won Best Film and Best Director awards. Ten out of ten.
