What a pleasure. This is really a parody. Only the French can do this kind of thing without being rude. And as a result, you spend a lot of time watching Jean Dujardin playing the idiot. Most of the film is on his shoulders, and he has them wide enough to make this movie a good movie. He has the perfect way to overdo the James Bond type that he is no match for Mike Meyers in Austin Powers for example. The dialogues are also good enough to hold the viewer's attention with lots of stupid jokes, this is really perfect. Both women who have the main parts of the movie carry the comparison to the main character, and that was a challenge. There's really no plot in this movie, but it's not what you'd expect in this kind of movie. You just want to laugh an hour and 40 minutes, and that's exactly what the movie can do. It deserves the success it has in France
