This movie is totally mindblowing. He can be thought-provoking, funny, tragic and cinematic, but claustrophobic. <br /> <br /> Although the flashbacks are unnecessary, the film keeps a strong footprint and the performances are excellent, particularly Alec Baldwin, and mesmerizing Eric Bogosian as the movie's anti-hero Barry Champlain.
