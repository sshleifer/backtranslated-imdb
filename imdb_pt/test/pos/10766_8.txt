I thought this was a very good movie. Someone said he was "sick," so they could not watch. I think if you realize that it's rated R, you'll be prepared for nudity and drug use. It's a good story and the acting is incredible. Just can not be a prude to enjoy it! It's basically about a mother who uses drugs and wants to stay clean, so she calls a very rich old friend and he moves them to his property and crazy things happen. I think it's a drama. I'm so full of people who do not like movies because of curse or nudity. This is the world we live in. You obviously are not comfortable with yourself if you can not see things like this movie. And it is classified as R. So, this should say from the beginning that not all are beautiful rainbows. I liked. I think you will too!
