I just saw this movie today (November 5, 2005) for the first time. I wanted to watch because I watched the basketball diaries (Leonardo Di Caprio) and I loved it, but that was a lot heavier. I think I had a good representation of drugs to some extent. I mostly sympathize with Nick Stahls's character, probably because if I was someone I was crazy about, I would want to help them out of it. A promising student and athlete who spends all his time training and studying - well, it's understandable that he wants to experience teenage life (the crazy side of it) and in his efforts, what starts is helping his friend, he ends up addicted because he wanted to see what it is all about and because of his horrible family situation that results in his most tragic death. A really sad movie, but one flaw I've noticed is that you can not get a good enough view of the damage it causes to families, but in addition, great performances in a truly moving film.
