I heard about this documentary for so long that I knew I needed to have time to watch it. As a documentary, it is very well done as it requires a neutral view of your experience. There are no voice-overs or interviews. You're honest. It is true. It's also humiliating. Two comments really stayed with me after the movie was made. One of them was how boys are told not to become like American boys who wear wide pants, and like in Africa there is time, but there is no money, but in America there is money, but there is no time. The biggest impact was how the boys craved education and how one of the boys relocated to school. I watched this movie with a sophomore who said it annoyed him to see how the boys were brought into their new life without any real orientation to America. He also said he knew so many American teenagers that they just can not appreciate how blessed their lives are in America. I would agree with him on both accounts. A strong movie that will leave a person thinking about many things.
