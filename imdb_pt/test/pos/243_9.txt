A fantastic musical starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. He owns a nightclub where she dances. She is not a star yet, but she has a great chance when she is chosen as a cover girl for Vanity whose owner was really in love with her grandmother. When he sees the resemblance, he immediately picks it up for a contest that his maganzine is performing. Hayworth's newfound fame at first works wonders for Kelly's club, but his star rises so quickly and so high that his hold on her begins to falter. This is not the most original of the plots, but the two leads really do work. It also helps make the script great. Kelly is still not at his peak, especially his peak as an actor. Their dancing, however, wow. Hayworth is the star, but Kelly affirms the most memorable moment of the film as he dances passionately with his own reflection. It's obviously a takeoff from Fred Astaire's shadow dancing in Swing Time, but I think Kelly does it, which is hardly believable. In fact, this has to be the most incredible dance sequence in movie history, except perhaps the end of An American in Paris several years later. The rest of the songs are also great, and the musical numbers are even better. Too bad Rita did not sing her own songs (well, she may have some of them, since her voice seemed to be different at times). Your dance is wonderful, as is the rest of your performance. It's hard not to love her at all. She is truly one of the few truly beautiful women of the Classical era. It is not plastic like many of them; No, you can actually see the warmth of this woman. Your smile is so disarming. Phil Silvers has the role of Kelly's best friend and is also very funny. The Kelly-Hayworth-Silvers trio is obviously the nucleus that became the Kelly-Reynolds-O'Connor trio in Singin 'in the Rain eight years later. One of the biggest musical numbers in the movie seems almost completely stolen with the number of "Good Morning" in Singin '. I think Singin 'in the Rain is the best film, since Cover Girl is a bit rough on the edges. This roughness, however, only enhances the charm. There are aspects of this film that won Singin 'in the Rain and even An American in Paris. For example, the core relationship is more emotionally engaging. Instead of the dominant older man chasing after the girl (Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds were just teenagers, after all), we have a very good relationship with two people who look more equal. There's no way to get behind - an aspect that unfortunately makes a lot of melodic the best musicals you have to admit. Kelly and Hayworth are a couple from the start, and when it starts to wear out, I really did feel it. 9/10
