Instead of watching the recycled history of "Pearl Harbor," with nothing new to reveal except for some real events involving some individuals, then the creators of the film could say that they contributed to the spread of the story along with nothing but CGI. explosions filling a romantic triangle. A must go see Dark Blue World. <br /> <br /> This film takes place during historical time in World War II, that the Czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the RAF instead of deposing the arms and yielding to the Nazis. It was a part of the story that should at least be told once to the outside world. A love triangle occurs among the main characters, but one does not die conveniently as in Pearl Harbor, but through sacrifice for true friendship. The film is a tragedy after the tragedy, not even a bittersweet finale, with our hero not enjoying the glory of taking his country back, the return of love by his current lover, the return of love by his gathered lover or even the unconditional return love for your pet throughout life. He is totally inconsolable and does not feel worse in the Russian labor camp. This kind of ending is something that Hollywood would probably change if it were their script. <br /> <br /> The movie touches the sentimental sometimes, but it also shows the humanity of the people. Overall, a worthwhile movie.
