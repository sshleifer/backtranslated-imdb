It is the best film ever released in Bollywood. The best comedy, the best acting and the best direction so far! Writing and directing Rajkumar Santoshi proved that he is one of the best directors in the industry. Aamir Khan was absolutely amazing, Salman Khan looked fine the way he acted. Shakti Kapoor was good, but Jagdeep acted as always! This comedy is still copied by people and no other writer and director has managed to do it again! Even Rajkumar Santoshi failed to make this cult classic again! This movie was a failure when it was released, but it has been a cult classic since it was released and loved by all sorts of people. <br /> <br /> STAR. <br /> <br /> ACTING 10/10. <br /> DIALOGUES 10/10. <br /> <br /> ROTARY 10/10. DIRECTION 10/10. <br /> <br /> MUSIC 9/10. <br /> <br /> LETRA 9/10. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is highly recommended. If you have not watched so far, you've missed something great! It's a riot of laughter and the best comedy I've seen to date! Classic movies like Hera Pheri, Golmaal and Jaane Bhi Do Jaaro are not at all funny like this. <br /> <br /> GREAT MOVIE, HAT !!!
