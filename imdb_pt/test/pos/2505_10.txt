This is one of the best feel-good movies of 1999, with Kate Capshaw leading a cast of stars about a small town and a love letter. First, the scenery is beautiful, and anyone who sees this movie and does not want to move to this place is crazy! For the cast, Capshaw is stunning as the lead actress who captivates the role of emotional roller coaster. Tom Everett Scott is charming as the "author" of the note throughout the film, and the always delicious Ellen Degeneres is hilarious! Blythe Danner and the actress who plays the bookstore seller are great too. Although not successful, the film is great, both short and sweet and also very romantic. 10/10
