I picked it up recently after realizing the name of James Earl Jones in the title. It was better than I expected. Of course, it's quite old-made during the early 1970s, but it's actually a decent drama. The race lasts about 90 minutes and features good performances by James Earl Jones and Diahann Caroll. The plot is conventional in general, but told by the perspective of a single black woman who has 6 children and tries to deal with all the problems that persist. This contributes to an interesting vision ... also in the fact that the script was not very sentimental or superdramatic - it's almost like looking at a slice of the past. All styles of the 70's are in abundance. The ending is kind of weird though ... probably would have done better without theatricality.
