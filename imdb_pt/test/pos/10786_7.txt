Barry Champlain is a talk-show host in Dallas, whose unbounded ideas about a myriad of social problems disrupt and offend many of his listeners and listeners. Is Barry a media messiah in search of truth, or a social malpractice to assault his audience? <br /> <br /> This is an intense and provocative piece about a man with almost no redeeming feature that at the same time seems to be in some really deep philosophy. Although co-written and directed by Stone, this is really Bogosian's work all the way and he gives an incredibly hard and pervasive performance that there is no escape. Barry is sometimes one of the most disgusting characters imaginable, vomiting bilious misanthropy on everyone around him, particularly those who care about him. But at the same time he is also strangely empathetic, hypnotic, wise, even kind. The hawkish Bogosian features burn in the chalkboard, with his green eyes constantly moving around as if they remained seeking an answer for some enigma. The film is essentially an ironic and hypocritical discourse against all the intolerance, injustice and banality of the world, culminating in a scene of three and a half minutes in which Barry makes the definitive speech "I hate everything". But the boy punches him. The support cast is great, especially Greene as the ex-wife and Baldwin as the boss. Robert Richardson's keen photography manages to keep the single radio studio looking interesting and there is a tense count of Stewart Copeland with a moving coda that features The Captive Cafe's engaging phone piece, Telephone And Rubber Band. If you are not familiar with Bogosian, check out his incredible talent in this film - like his contemporaries, Bill Hicks and Denis Leary, he is someone who rarely appears in the media, purely because his writing is so out there. I find the Stone movies variable; I do not care much about his great successes, but when he's more orderly and objective, as with that (or Savior and Nixon), he's much more incisive and sweeping. A great primitive cry of an image, based on a Bogosian play, inspired by the true story of Alan Berg, a Denver radio talk show host who was murdered by neo-Nazis in 1984.
