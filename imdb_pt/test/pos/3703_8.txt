"Caribbean" is not a masterpiece in any of its narrative aspects. However, it offers a perfectly nice story along with magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is defined around two narrative axes, one of them inserting the other, each with elements that relate and coexist in excellent harmony. The story never misses the right pace, and shows a very good blend of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The performance is great, so we owe credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ram√≠rez. In addition, the characters are very well written and masterfully complex; then once you become familiar with them, you will be able to perceive their feelings without them even saying anything. I can not say that I liked this photo because of all the hype that it has generated (in Costa Rica), but because of the way it really shows an interesting picture of what happens when you interfere with the balance of people's lives. The Caribbean is expected to establish a reference for future projects in Costa Rica, as it is a good example of good film production.
