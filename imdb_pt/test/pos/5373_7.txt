A family is traveling through the Midwest. There is the widower Ben (Charles Bateman), his girlfriend Nicky (Ahna Capri) and the daughter of Ben K.T. (Geri Reischl). He then hit a town called Hillsboro, where everyone acts more than a little strangely. Their car breaks down and they are forced to stay. They soon discover that a coven witch has a spell on the city and is up to incredible evil. <br /> <br /> The story is not so good. People just figure things out and find out where the witches are at the end. There are also many loopholes left hanging at the end. The acting is very poor too. Bateman and Capri are bland and everyone is the same. Only the old pros Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones does good performances. Still this movie works. He renounces blood and blood (there are some, but that's PG) and manges to work with some very scary visuals and atmosphere. The acting makes it difficult, but it still works. Martin especially chews the stage in his role. I can not explain exactly why I like this movie, but it worked for me. It is a kind of quiet terror that is no longer made. Hardly a masterpiece, but it deserves to be rediscovered. A 7.
