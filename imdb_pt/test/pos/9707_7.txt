Johnny Knoxville went crazy. <br /> <br /> In the first Jackass did he delight in jokes more than in physical things? his opening car rental gag and the last piece that involved an air horn on a golf course were more like some kind of extreme Candida chamber ?? but in Jackass: Number Two, he's really out of his mind. <br /> Beginning with a sequence in which he is pursued by a bull, or later, when he rides a rocket (a blow that almost cost him dearly). his life due to an unexpected explosion on the side of the rocket), and especially when he gets intentionally in front of a defense mechanism and takes a spray of pellets to the stomach, Knoxville is crazy. In the first movie Bam Margera and Steve-O ?? notorious party animals ?? were the most daring, but you know it's too bad when you see Knoxville enticing them to do a trick. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a series of acrobatics made by guys consumed by testosterone, constantly trying each other out. Will he end up dead by one of the cast members? in Jackass 2 Steve-O almost loses a leg to a shark, Knoxville (as mentioned above) is almost impaled with a blast from a rocket, and so on. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed due to the success of 2, and frankly I can not imagine any stunt double running the bullfight in the opening scene of this movie? This is incredible footage. It's almost unbelievable, and I wondered if it had been faked, but apparently it was 100% genuine. (Which is actually kind of scary.) And in extreme terms, does Jackass 2 far outweigh its predecessor? also seems more cinematic than the first film, with fewer titles preceding the acrobatics that became famous on the original MTV show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the boys have been given a lot of freedom here, and a good number of gags are simply crunched dexterous exercises ?? I can enjoy the occasional poop gag, but seeing a man relieve himself in a miniature bathroom, or see Steve-O drinking beer in the ass (yes, honestly), gets annoyed after a while. Even the frat boys in the sorting I attended? who was thrilled when Wee Man took a deck card in the rear and was zapped by a manipulated chair? were disgusted with some of the scenes in this movie. Is not it a matter of getting away as much as possible ?? it's a matter of saying, "Is this fun or funny?" Many times, unfortunately, it really is not. <br /> <br /> But for every lame trick involving fecal matter and farts on people's faces, there are some bright pieces of hidden camera. Wacky director Spike Jonze ("Adaptation") dresses up as an old woman and hits the bare streets with flabby, unashamed breasts. And my favorite satire involved Knoxville as an irresponsible old man, away to lunch with his grandson, letting him drink alcohol and smoking and cursing and insulting people. This is classic comedy taken to new extremes with the freedoms of an R-rating. Is it a shame that they had to ruin all the good things ?? including a final segment involving elaborate terrorist jibe? Still, there is enough spirit and craziness in this movie to deserve a performance, and it really has taken the concept of film end to new heights.
