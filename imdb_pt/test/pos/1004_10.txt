Can you capture the moment? When you first hear the rain on a roof? Some things are beyond the sum of its parts, expressing the poetry of life. The things that matter. <br /> <br /> The poet Dylan Thomas captured the seemingly inexpressible "A good poem helps ... extend the knowledge of everyone, of himself and the world around him." (Bob Dylan named himself after him). So why did it take so long to make a movie of the great Dylan Thomas? A simple biopic could have missed the point. The writer Sharman Macdonald took a different and better approach. <br /> <br /> On the edge of love, it creates the world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so we can swim in them. The life of four friends. Dylan, who wants and loves the most. Caitlin's wife (Sienna Miller), his resolute support. War hero William (Cillian Murphy), who saves him from a street fight. And then there's your childhood love. Will see. Dear Vera. Take your breath away from Vera. She is Caitlin's closest friend. Wife of William. And, like a muse, the 'star' in Dylan's dark sky. <br /> <br /> It all starts at the London Blitz of 1940, with bomb shelters in the basement. Enter Vera (an impressive Keira Knightley) under makeshift spotlight. She meets Dylan for the first time again in years, her heart is red. His eyes shimmer through the smoke of the room. The purity of his old passion. Dylan (Welsh native speaker, Matthew Rhys) is not a hallowed and sanitized poet. Master of his vices, he must fully experience them. He introduces his beloved wife, then continues to conquer Vera. <br /> <br /> The Edge of Love is a visual delight. The soundtrack leaves you wanting more. Performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers. Such a lush love story is very good. As an insight into Dylan Thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives, nothing bad at all. And as a tribute to a great, inspiring man. <br /> <br /> Production has struggled to project the spirit of Dylan Thomas without compromising historical accuracy too much. Dramatic tension involves an attraction between artistic freedom and conventional morality. Audiences looking for an experience based on the latter may be disappointed. And it will play less for the audience whose borders are those of Albert Square. <br /> <br /> Sharman Macdonald seemed aware of the stubborn nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer Rebekah Gilbertson (granddaughter of the real). William and Vera). "Think of all the things you do not want me to write," she said, "because I have to have carte blanche." For Macdonald, the limits were whether she should offend Dylan's memory. But for many artists, especially men, the limits are those that the wife and the family could establish in them. A woman will not let high ideals interfere with pragmatic common sense issues, and even put the interests of her children before her. (Occasionally the reverse is true, as when the imposing genie Virginia Woolf refused to let Leonard take her to land - hours). Despite the tension between Caitlin and Vera, these two women become closer. It is one of the main (and very beautiful) themes of the film. <br /> <br /> The colors of the film tell a story in itself. In a monotonous England and in wartime, Caitlin and Vera are vivid highlights in an ocean of gray. Shortly after finding the illuminated stage persona of Vera, we found Caitlin through her blue eyes, shining in a dark carriage. His dramatic red coat crosses streets of colorless homogeneity, triumphing on a beautiful staircase as he meets Dylan. But the red glow of Vera's lipstick is less long-lasting. For her, marriage is the second best, even when she became the possessor of genuine love for her husband. Exceptional cinematography extends to the use of montage to juxtapose images, in a manner similar to the juxtaposition of unrelated poetry words. to create more meaning. Horrific war scenes in Thessaly are interspersed with cries of Vera during pregnancy. Give birth or is it abortion? We are not warned immediately. Pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present day. The echoes of Dylan's poetry throughout the film take us beyond the terrestrial opposites. It reminds me of Marlon Brando reading TS Eliot in Apocalypse Now. A light beyond the horrors of the world. A different way of seeing things. "I'll take you back to a time when no bomb fell from the sky and no one ever died," Dylan tells Vera as they walk down the beach. Elsewhere, Caitlin recalls her childhood with Vera: "We're still innocent in Dylan," she says. <br /> <br /> There is a time to leave your panties at home or share a universal cigarette. (Not literally, maybe.) A time to be inspired. Enjoy what is arguably the best British film of the year.
