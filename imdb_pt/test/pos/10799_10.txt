From the compensation, I knew this would be a fantastic film, the rhythm, the cinematography, indigenous personalities of the Dallas region, the diversification of characters, not to mention the director Oliver Stone and of course Eric Bogasian ... The movie begins on a Friday (suggestively hidden first) and begins with a radio station in Dallas that is hosting his number one talk show, The Barry Champlain Show (Based on Talk Talk Presenter Alan Berg) ... Barry (Eric Bogasian) is the radio talk show host and his job is such that it is imperative to pontificate all the sensational nuances of the radio audience being broadcast on his show ... He tries to pity a lot of social drifts made lonely and vulnerable. , obscene telephone operators who have the masochistic desire to be publicly defamed, Barry Champlain is effective in dealing with this precarious laia, degrading them socially rather than simply subjugating them to mere reprimand ... New techno logies serve a stigmatic purpose to the Dallas radio audience, and the primordial concepts are left behind, to perversion, talk about "Baseball Scores, Orgasms and People's Pets !!" <br /> <br /> The whole thing is a cacophony of induced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia !! This high profile cannon bush is something that Barry Champlain thrives !!! The pathetically complicated, the disturbed tendencies that come from the inanities and the diffusers of pornography and the woes of pop culture as a whole serve as volatile ammunition for the affected battlefield of Barry Champlain. <br /> <br /> The setting for this movie is perfect. a fall of two thousand feet in terms of ideology .. In downtown Dallas there is a sense of cosmopolitan consciousness, where 20 miles away lies a significant chapter of the Ku Klux Klan !! ... The play is based in Denver. , that's where the story goes, other small plays depict the cities of Louisville, Atlanta and Cleveland. Dallas is the city where the movie happens, I thought it was a great choice !! ... This film illustrates how people have a misconception, horrible, erroneous and deadly of the Jewish people in America, where they control the banks, their agenda is different from everyone else and their intellectual literature leads to perversion !! These preconceived notions make up the general dilemma of Barry Champlain !!! Barry Champlain's personal misfortune is that he is irascible and unresponsive to his alcoholism, and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate ultimate, that is what makes the film so believable! <br /> <br /> The characters in the film were well portrayed, Dan, the middle-management male tailor (played by Alec Baldwin) who was constantly monitoring all of Barry Champlain's moves !! .. Laura, his girlfriend, also his producer, constantly feels that Barry is someone who is always misunderstood !! Ellen, his ex-wife, is a recipient of Barry's anguish and selfishness, but he can not give up his feelings for Barry, regardless of the path of personal destruction he ends up resorting to !! The Dallas radio audience is a cauldron of socially misplaced retro-bats that are fucking insane with their own real shortcomings !!! ... In part, all the problems, including the problems of Barry Champlain, are what Barry Champlain does! ! His audience proclaims depravity, calls for improvements, and finally becomes the pet project of Barry Champlain for the prescribed sinners !! The conflicts of social culture become the fall of Barry Champlain !! <br /> <br /> This movie is superb !! In my opinion, the best photo of Oliver Stone, including Platoon and Natural Born Killers ... This statement in itself says how magnificent a film is Talk Radio ... The history of consulting and acting and co-production of Eric Bogosian is simply convincing !! Camera angles, dialogue, haunting character pictures, any top notch. The cinematography of the Dallas skyline at the end of the movie is great !! Dallas has the dubious distinction of being considered a mega metropolis ... So now, just like Los Angeles and New York, there are cases of crack babies too numerous to tell, low-cost housing districts of Hell and budget cuts that will mean that there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this time next year !!!! ... Dallas states that it is the status of an important metropolitan area in the precarious manner in which human debauchery prevails !! The city has its lynching radio listeners who have given a pejorative turn to the national airwave communication wonder! These are the culprits in the movie !! The macabre abandoned tabloid who wants to meet the big bad wolf, and his decadent curiosity, morally obliterated "The Last Quarter of America"
