"Broadcast News" is directed by James L. Brooks (Terms of Endearment, As Good As It Gets) and has a great cast, including William Hurt, Albert Brooks and Holly Hunter. Everyone does a good job, but they're all too unpleasant to care about. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the film are really brilliant, like the prologue, and the short scenes with Jack Nicholson. The main reason this does not work entirely is that it's a movie that features the characters being fun rather than entertaining the things that happen to them. <br /> <br /> You could consider this nothing more than a drama, but it is often too silly to be successful there either. Still, the script makes it worth watching. Certainly not for everyone. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
