I do not understand why everyone hates this movie, other than the fact that they are jealous that their musical careers never took off like mega pop star Aaron Carter. Like it or not Aaron saw more success in his young life than most people could ever dream of having, so it seemed natural for him to make a movie. Lou Pearlman and company have been known to explore their pop prototypes, do you remember Justin Timberlake's foray into the TV Model Behavior movie? Granted this movie is not large scale and impressive, but it is not supposed to be. Not trying to impress people or be an Emmy winner, was released directly to the DVD. It's just a little movie about a clumsy teenager who dreams of being with his favorite Popstar; I know many of you have had this dream at some point or another about you favorite singer, do not deny it. It's sweet and gentle and I applaud this for not entering the world of sex, violence and vulgar language that seems to be creeping into our movies today. Where is the decency? Where's the queue? Teen dramas come in dozens nowadays because teens are a big market for business, at least this one is more tolerable to me than Bratz (aka Slutz) with all the fake girls running around "Oh Mah Gawd! " in tops and mini skirts and is better fights than those gore fest movies like Saw. I feel for the main character's girl because I was a high school nerd girl who loved Aaron Carter and NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys and other pop songs and still do; and as Aaron's character, would be overwhelming "testophobia," especially in mathematics. If you judge this movie based solely on the fact that you do not like or are jealous of Aaron Carter and his fame then of course you will hate him and talk about junk in the comments. The only reason why the dribble Crossroads from Britney Spears got a higher score is because she has breasts. Accept this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be. I think this happy stereotypical teen movie ends on a high note and makes you want to sing.
