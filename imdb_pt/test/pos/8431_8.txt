It was distressingly close, but China's Syndrome received the worst kind of publicity, when the film was released in the theater, the accident occurred at Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant. I still remember all the attention of the country was pasted on hourly bulletins leaving from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. And you do not know, a scientist in China Syndrome describes the worst case scenario, making an area as large as the state of Pennsylvania uninhabitable. <br /> <br /> Less than a decade later, in Ukraine, in Chernobyl. The Soviet Union, in its last days, dealt with a crisis that was not settled in the nick of time. The Syndrome of China once again became a relevant film. <br /> <br /> The film is more about cutting corners for safety than about being anti-nuclear. Jack Lemmon is a man who has lived with nuclear energy all his life as the captain of an atomic energy submarine. What irritates him and drives him to create the clash that reaches the climax of the film is the stupidity and greed of the managers of energy companies. Stupidity and greed, however, are commodities encountered every day. The problem with them is that there are places where they can be tolerated less in human society. <br /> <br /> Lemmon shares the bill with two famous Hollywood children, Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. Jane is a TV reporter who is constantly being assigned to blow reporting and only happens to be in a nuclear power plant when an accident occurs. The cover-up by his own station and his later encounter with Lemmon unleashed the chain of events shown in the Syndrome of China. The best Fonda scene I thought of, however, was with Peter Donat, a news executive with his station. . Take a look at her facial expressions when Donat peels the importance of the story and tells her that her beauty demands that she be left with pieces of puff. Fonda knows she has something and stays with him. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays his iconoclastic cameraman, this was a typical part of him in the past. In his tribute to his father Kirk Douglas, Michael said he chose roles showing sensitivity. Still, I might have seen a young Kirk Douglas in that part. <br /> <br /> What to do with energy for industrial and postindustrial nations, a troubling problem that will plague our government for generations to come. This film shows what can happen to the dependence on nuclear energy. Our current geopolitical problems in the world stem, in part, from dependence on fossil fuel, specifically oil. Everything we use has unpredictable consequences. <br /> <br /> The real hero of the film, in my opinion, is Wilford Brimley, Lemmon's colleague at the nuclear power plant. In the end, Brimley actually goes to the plate. <br /> <br /> See China Syndrome to know what I'm talking about.
