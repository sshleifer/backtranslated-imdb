This movie appears from time to time on ABC, Australia, around 3 in the morning. <br /> <br /> It starts with the scene of a London bus crash. <br /> <br /> Movies have flashbacks of each character as the movie progresses, plus the fading photograph of Big Ben receding, to symbolize what events occurred 13 hours ago, until the bus crash. It took me a while to understand it, but it was enjoyable, though. <br /> <br /> If Sean Cunningham and Quentin Tarrantino got together and made a movie, this may be the result - due to flashbacks and short stories, and deaths. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure of the main characters, as it's been a while since I've seen it, but a rare gem indeed.
