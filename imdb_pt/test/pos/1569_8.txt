While I can understand some of the points made regarding cinematography (I thought a more purposeful approach would have better supported the home movie sensation), I must say I thought the script and acting of ALICE FOUND were great! Dean Bell has created a real jewel that Judith Ivey delights with the joy of the character. Her performance of Sandra is a pleasure - unfolding, alternately, as devilish and romantic. We are immediately intrigued and repelled by your actions ... and never received more information than necessary. Her efforts and supporting cast find Bell's postmodern fairy tale with open arms. Alice of Emily Grace is infused with a spell of outlined eyes. It seems to mold itself like clay before us, transforming itself into a kind of beautiful and lost beast. In the end, we are at odds with the words, as she is, saying goodbye to her mother. Kudos should also be distributed to Jane Lincoln Taylor - whose mother provides the right amount of tragic historical weight - and Justin Parkinson - whose timid John, Sam, for the first time, offers one of the sweetest, if not the most clumsy, sex scenes in the movie. Bell created a first-rate storyline and put together a myriad of talents to do it.
