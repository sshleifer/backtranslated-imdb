Dir-Jesus Ponce: Simple, sweet story of a homeless couple and their daily adventures surviving in the everyday world without a roof over their heads. The film begins with the woman in the story (played by Isabel Ampudia) being released from prison, but we do not know what she was in or how long she was there. She stumbles upon the antihero of the story and her boyfriend, played by Sebastian Haro, as he is parking cars for change. They huddle under an old ruined building, with nothing but the warmth of each other and a small mattress in their possession. He is a drug addict who just tries to go from one repair to another, but she has a strange and obsessive attraction to him as a person, which we end up accepting. He also has some kind of sexually transmitted disease, so sex for them is out of the question, but this does not seem to be a problem for any of them. She loves this man as he is, without question, and without him having to change, which is a rare find anywhere. She makes a living by carrying a bucket and washing the store windows. They eat a bakery every day and consider it a party. Isabel's character dreams of a normal life, but does not expect that to happen and does not expect to fit into that role, so she does not think much of it. Both characters come from extremely destroyed homes and therefore the public has sympathy for them, despite their imperfections. Without giving up much of the story, Isabel's character continues to persevere as the man gets worse and worse in his obsession with drugs. There is a good melodramatic conclusion to the story that it raises for the masses to enjoy, but overall this is a wonderful independent film about a relationship between non-worldly misfits that keeps you interested to the end.
