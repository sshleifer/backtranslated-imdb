A sign of what to expect in this movie came when I saw that this was the first (and probably the last) movie to have in its credits a "vomit technician". <br /> <br /> In what is a couple of hours of silly jokes, hilarious violence and excellent clown humor. <br /> <br /> This movie was exactly what you'd expect from the Bottom boys, and it's great to see them back in their best form after the life of Rik Mayall. Richie (Mayall) and Eddie (Edmondson) are very similar to the Bottom characters, if we can have some criticism, and Edmondson does a surprisingly good job at directing the film as well. <br /> <br /> This movie has already generated predictable comparisons with Fawlty Towers that simply do not exist, and the Guest House Paradiso itself is hardly Torquay! <br /> <br /> Watch out for some excellent dialogue between all the violence and clutter. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Bottom, you'll probably hate it - but I loved it.
