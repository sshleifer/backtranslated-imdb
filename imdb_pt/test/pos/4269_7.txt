Where do we go from here? this is the primary issue of this film. And make no mistake, "especially ETC." director John Jansen's 2003 effort, asks far more questions than answers, but none as poignant or as powerfully as this. <br /> <br /> Much of The Movie plays as a conversation between you and your college classmates, and I'm sure many of the issues raised by the main characters will recognize you on your own nights of drunken debauchery. However, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer. Questions are raised? everything from the mundane to the deep? but Jansen deftly forces his audience to examine and answer those questions ourselves, with little or no help from the characters. Side 1 opens with an increasingly complex and beautifully orchestrated arrangement of non-linear segments to introduce us to the main characters. Did we find them on the morning of April 8, 1994? the day kurt cobain committed suicide. And it is the death of the guinea pig, and the journey to his awakening, two days later, in Seattle, which serves as the backdrop for the film. In exploring cobain's life, music and death, the characters try - with varying degrees of success - to understand and accept their own lives. <br /> <br /> There are some aspects of the movie that are what you would expect from a low budget independent film: performances range from decidedly mediocre to remarkable, with the strongest performances coming from jessica scott (holly) and noel wood (daniel); some of the dialogues are admittedly somewhat rigid, but never completely lost in the unreal; and there are some small sound problems, particularly when we hit the road, which sometimes make it difficult to see the action on the screen. <br /> <br /> despite its shortcomings, "mainly ETC". is a solid and profoundly affected film work. amid moments of haunting poignancy, laughing humor and intimate agitation, jansen cleverly intertwines every line of the character and illuminates his own struggles, while making them accessible and engaging for us. and because we can see reflections of ourselves in one or more of these characters, we can identify with the issues and problems with which they are struggling, and we can look back and remember where we were on that day in 1994 when many people changed the world . <br /> <br /> While jansen takes credit for writing, editing and directing the film, compliments should be given to his photography as well. With a strange eye and incredible ability to capture and attract us in each of the worlds of the characters, jansen managed to produce shot after shot after the shot that stayed with me long after the credits rolled. <br /> <br /> And no review of this movie would be complete without a nod to the incredible soundtrack. the music in this movie is used for an incredible effect; sometimes subtly highlighting the action, at other times taking center stage but never disturbing or deteriorating into kitsch video clips. the soundtrack plays like the biggest hits, although I suspect the label probably would not sit very well with the director. <br /> <br /> The new edition of the double DVD file offers some deleted scenes, trailers, music videos and a documentary of guinea pigs. the deleted scenes offer some tips on how to make the movie through alternate opening and closing sequences, and it is certainly a pleasure to have Raining Kind's rare and beautiful video. the cobain documentary is fine, if a little worse for wear, and certainly more extensive documentaries are available to hardcore fans. notoriously absent is a comment from the director, and I can not help but wonder if jansen has plans to relaunch this at some point with that tasty treat attached. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that the next time you are looking for a strong work from a talented filmmaker, I recommend that you embark.
