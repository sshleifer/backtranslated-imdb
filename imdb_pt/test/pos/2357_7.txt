"The Charge at Feather River" is a Western routine on US cavalry against the Cheyenne Indians ... The film carried increasing tension with enjoyable fun ... Guy Madison and Frank Lovejoy plays the officers who rescue Helen Westcott and Vera Miles from the Indians ... <br /> <br /> The outdoor scenes are well photographed, especially the thrilling Indian cargo on the Feather River at the climax of the film with the spear rain , the death struggle between Madison and Thunderhawk, the Guard Brigade sketches, even a mouthful of tobacco juice used against a rattlesnake, and the romantic interludes between our hero and Helen Westcott ... Everyone is here, pictorially amused in 3-D and Technicolor ...
