The movie begins with three people on a joking holiday who decide to first visit a crocodile farm and then go for a slightly lighter activity, a "fishing" tour. <br /> <br /> You get some interesting information about the crocodiles during your visit to the farm and the information adds just enough to boost the suspense later during the movie as you remember what was said earlier. <br /> <br /> The action in the movie is well timed and no longer done. Suspense is constructed through the "what is done," the "unknown," and the harrowing decisions that the characters make in the film. <br /> <br /> I caught myself wondering what I would do if I were in the same boat, no pun intended. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film was very good and the effects were realistic, believable and not exaggerated or cartoonish and out of place, the way you sometimes get CGI. As a fan of horror movies, I watch almost every horror movie I get in almost every genre, and this is one of the best "crocodile" horror films, if not the best I have seen. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you will not be disappointed.
