Peter O'Toole, one of our best actors, is magnificent as a dedicated teacher dedicated to teaching boys. He knows a girl and falls in love. The story is one of love and devotion. Petula Clark adds spirit and sensitivity, not to mention a remarkable voice. You will enjoy this movie even if the ending is not happy. I liked.
