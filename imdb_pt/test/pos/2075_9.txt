If you want to see Shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this version of the BBC. In fact, it's too much at four-thirty, but Jacoby's performance as Claudius and Hamlet and Patrick Stewart are worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Never surprises me like "Hamlet" of course when you see him. in its length and order as established by the bard. All the cinematographic versions of "Hamlet" moved with its structure. Olivier focused on Hamlet's indecision, Gibson on his passions. Jacoby is able to pull all these aspects of Hamlet's character along with the help of Shakespeare's complete script. <br /> <br /> Why does not Hamlet kill Claudius immediately? Hamlet says "I am very proud, vindictive, ambitious ..." Hamlet is extremely upset, not only at the death of his father (and suspected murder), or at his mother's marriage to his uncle, but also, and mainly, because Claudio usurped. the throne belonging to Hamlet. He is furious with his mother for marrying Claudius (marriages between royal relatives are not unknown, made for political reasons), but that his marriage solidified Claudius' claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it for himself same. He is therefore powerless to do anything about it. And this is true even after he hears the ghost of his father crying for revenge. He can not simply kill the king or lose the throne in doing so. He must "get out" of the king's secret and here is the tragedy! By the time Hamlet is successful in displaying Claudius's guilt in public, he has the opportunity to kill him and does not. BECAUSE? He wants it all! He wants revenge, the throne and the damnation of the soul of Claudius in hell. Hamlet OVERREACHES itself in classic tragic form. Your own HUBRIS is your downfall. He kills Polonius thinking that it is Claudius and the rest of the spirals to the final deaths of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius, and Hamlet himself.
