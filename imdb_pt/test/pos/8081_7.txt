I like the phrase "Postwar Suburban British Paranoia" that one of the reviewers used. He describes the kind of films John Mills ("The Man of October" (1947), "The Long Memoir" (1952)) highlighted between "great" paintings ("Scott of the Antartic" 1948) and "War peace "(1956)). <br /> <br /> This distinctly "Eric Ambler" plot had John Mills playing Dr. Howard Latimer, who promises his friend, Charles, (unseen) to meet a visiting German actress, Frieda Veldon (Lisa Daniely) in the airport. A scary reporter Jeffrey Windsor (Lionel Jeffries) is in his consulting rooms at the time and offers to give him a lift, but while he is tracing the actress down Windsor informs her that she is already in the car waiting !!! (Something dubious is happening !!!). Howard is left to meet you and does not think about it anymore. <br /> <br /> The next night, he finds her body when he comes home from work, more so, he thinks his friend Charles could not have called him as he is still in New York and Windsor does not seem to exist. Earlier in a patient, Mrs. Ambler (Rene Ray), who was referred to him by Dr. George Kimber (Mervyn Johns), tells of his recurring dream of finding a dead body and a brass chandelier with a square base. It is a nightmare that is coming true for Howard, but of course when Detective Dane (Roland Culver) interviews it, she denies all the knowledge of the conversation - the chandelier is later found in Howard's Daimler boot. <br /> <br /> When Howard is lying down, Robert Brady (Wilfred Hyde-White) visits him. He calls himself a "friend" - he has a photo of Windsor that he wants to exchange for a box of matches that Frieda gave to Howard at the airport. Howard returns to the apartment, Charles touches and while Howard is on the phone, an unknown burglar knocks him down and steals the matches !!! Who can he trust - who has nothing to hide? <br /> <br /> This is a top thriller - not exactly in the same class as "The October Man", but with John Mills doing what he does best - throwing ordinary men caught up in impossible mysteries !!! <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
