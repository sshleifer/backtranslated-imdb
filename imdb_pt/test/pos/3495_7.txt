Anyone who has seen Ali G before should be well prepared for the full movie that is 'Ali G Indahouse' <br /> <br /> Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand completely The comedy definitely also entertains from start to finish on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous storyline, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script that make this movie a riot for Ali G. fans. <br /> <br /> If you saw it and did not like it, avoid this one. film as the plague, because it is definitely more of the same; for everyone - watch Aiiii! 7/10
