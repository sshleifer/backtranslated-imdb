I do not like many "assault" comedies, and maybe I do not mind this one if it was not for the actors, when it was made, and when I first saw it (a few years later). It's almost like "The Happening" (although it's obviously a far less serious comedy than that) - the mafia figure takes on his own kidnapping, or rather, turns it in a completely different direction. Of course, Raquel Welch did not play the kind of sharp character Faye Dunaway did in The Happening, but that does not make him a sexist movie either - she was practically playing an action character, almost her version of a moll! But I'm completely partial - it's one of the first movies I've seen with her, and by the time I saw it, you could not turn around without seeing a poster of it (luckily). I think Robert Wagner was really right as the group leader neither totally lovable and unpleasant, like Edward G. Robinson (of course) and Vittoria De Sica. And Godfrey Cambridge, an actor who always managed to be funny.
