In this tale of a stricken Christian family that has three of its four "born again" members after a car crash caused by a cake, what really stands out is how much of it is where there is so much potential to go through top of the top, and how truly inspired most of the acting is. Where most of the film's moments, particularly its frank and "innocent" discussions about sexuality after three of the four family members have their guilt and shame removed, is hilarious, it's also thought-provoking and the characters stay with you. <Br /> <br /> How often, for example, does a character in a comedy turn from a close cartoon to a full-blown emotional state in the course of a scene? How often do we see a cast that can step back from showboating in the middle of the sentence in order to show a little of humanity under the character's skin? Even many of the "bad guys" in this movie have moments of honesty to break the heart even while so much of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and creepy. There is truth and history behind even the most questionable acts in this film, which is a difficult task in satire. <br /> <br /> How refreshing to see a dark comedy that might dare to be humanistic. It's good to see actors so committed to character that they can dare to make them ridiculous and sublime. <br /> <br /> And as a homosexual, I think I've never been so touched by a heterosexual. sex scene as I was by the first sexual encounter between the parents of this family after the accident. Bravo. Angry. One of my favorites at this year's Outfest.
