I knew little about this movie when I entered the theater for an early screening. I joined the ads which was a thriller. <br /> <br /> What we have is like "Compulsion" and "Matlock". Two teenagers decide to commit a perfect murder. A victim is randomly selected and then carefully executed so that no traces of the actual killers are found. Then a lot of fake clues are planted that point to an innocent bystander. (Innocent of murder anyway) <br /> <br /> Enter Sondra Bullock as the investigating officer. (IMDB says she's from the FBI, but I do not remember that.I thought she was a regular cop) She's frustrated with the inconsistency of the profile of the killers ("The profile does not fit the profile!") And by power and influence of the father of one of the boys. She also has her own demons, who figure prominently in her decision to become a police officer. But this is the only character that is actually more than one-dimensional. Everyone else is pretty boring. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, there are no great emotions. It's mostly a cat-and-mouse game like an episode of "Matlock" (which she's watching at one point in the movie). The difference is that there are two involved in the murder. Who is the real killer, Justin or Richard? It will cost you eight dollars to find out.
