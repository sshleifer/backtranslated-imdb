The producer, Matt Mochary, stumbled on the subject of the film, Anderson Sa (leader of the musical movement AfroReggae), while on a trip from the Hewlett Foundation to Rio de Janeiro. Mochary was so moved by Sa's story that he called his friend, Jim Zimbalist, who quit his job and joined Mochary in Brazil to work on a documentary about Sa, Rio's favelas and culture of violence. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film shows the culture of violence in the slums of Rio de Janeiro (shantytowns where the poor live) through images of police raids and assaults on the residents. The footage is graphic and shocking. <br /> <br /> Rising from the negativity of the favelas is the charismatic Anderson Sa, who overcame a possible career in drug trafficking to start the AfroReggae movement, which combines elements of Afro-Brazilian culture. , Reggae, ska and other elements in a fast-paced, heavy-style percussion of music that has since spread to other parts of the world. You can not help but be carried away by the music, especially when you see the local kids get involved in the Sa school, which he founded to keep kids out of drug gangs. The rest of the film follows Sa's meteoric rise and its positivity changes many of the children's lives to pursue a life beyond drug trafficking. SPOILER: Only when the filmmakers thought they had involved filming did an unbelievable life-changing event occur, from which resolution must be seen to be believed. The movie continues and you're stuck in its place until the end. <br /> <br /> This film is a response to the "City of God", and worthy of it. The somber situation portrayed in this film is counterbalanced by a real example of how slum dwellers can overcome their terrible situation and use their resources for constructive purposes. You can not help but like and cheer for Anderson Sa to succeed. <br /> <br /> This film is terribly filmed, fast and quite absorbing. Judging by the overwhelming response from the audience at the SilverDocs screening last night, the film should be distributed in the US and the soundtrack should be released as well. Keep an eye out for this superlative documentary - it's great!
