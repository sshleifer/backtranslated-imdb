It seems that some previous reviewers may have their expectations set a little too high for this movie. I found it scanning the satellite channels for something (not knowing what) and it happened upon it. I thought the title may be one of the countless soft-core porn movies that appear regularly on movie channels, but I was pleasantly surprised. Although there was some male frontal nudity (actually, more than your typical soft-core title - go ahead!), That was not the focus of the movie. It was fun. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by my tastes: my recent exhibits included Before Night Falls and Europe, Europe (both IMHO). But I also take advantage of total mental withdrawal when I watch a movie. Virtual sexuality did it for me and this is not a bad thing!
