**** SPOILERS THROUGHOUT **** This is a very strange movie - particularly for your time - in all aspects. For six years, American films showed that American soldiers were everyone's son, brother and father. <br /> <br /> In movies like The Best Years of Our Lives and the End of Time, our hearts are drawn by the difficulty that the returning sweet soldiers have in adjusting to peace and their families. Still this same year, this movie shows soldiers as a mix of people a little worse than the viewer - a message from this movie is - "lock up your daughters." Even the good soldiers-with plenty of time in their hands-are playing all the time, getting drunk stupidly, and are totally indifferent if they still have wives. And their reaction to the police investigating a murder is - conspiring against them. Mitchum, the most sympathetic soldier, says things like, "I do not know if my wife wants to do this." now after the War. I have not seen her in two years. I care? Not really. Maybe we should, maybe not. <br /> <br /> Another soldier is shown as extraordinarily sensitive, because after years away, he would like to see his wife again. Later, when this soldier says at the police station that he spent the night at a prostitute's house - not knowing that his wife is sitting right behind him, there seems to be no doubt that his wife will be good. In fact, it is - I think it's "Hey, soldiers will be soldiers." The detective interpreted by Robert Young, who is trying to decipher a murder case, says convincingly and with an infinite weariness about someone else's bill on the night in question, "Do I care? No. I really do not care about anything else. I did it for a long time, I guess. " <br /> <br /> A man appears in the apartment of the prostitute. He says "I'm just a man like you, interested in" the prostitute. Then he says, "No, that's a lie, I'm her husband. I wish I was in the army, I was rejected before." When he says, "No, that's a lie, why would I want to be a soldier?" He goes through another series of lies when the police ask who he is. By the end of the movie, we have no idea who he is or why he's there! He's one of the strangest characters in movie history! <br /> <br /> A man is with his girlfriend in a bar talking to four soldiers, when a clumsy soldier hits a drink on his girlfriend. She goes out to change her dress - and she's back using another, no problem. However, the man does not go out with his girlfriend - who simply disappears - but instead follows one of the soldiers as he leaves to go to another area of ​​the bar! The man then extrapolates from the minimal information he has learned about the soldier - to philosophize greatly about the problems of returning soldiers - and immediately invites the soldier home because he is drunk and feels sick. This is a strange thing. <br /> <br /> Similarly, a girl in the dance hall is angry with the sentimental soldier who would like to take her to "a real dance - and maybe dinner." However, she dances with him - and immediately gives him the key to his house! Did people in the late 1940s always urge soldiers to go home after they had just met them? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan kills his host, a stranger, when he is enraged that the Jewish host tries to get drunk Ryan out of his house. The reason for the murder? "No Jew tells me how to drink." "How to drink?" There is? What does that mean? <br /> <br /> This movie is always out of order, very deliberately - the soldiers consistently act with total challenge to the law, and all the characters are as cold and hard as any movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> And yet the film is totally exciting! You simply have no idea how these people will act - or what new bizarre character will come up - without anyone thinking that the person's actions are strange - for example, the wife's behavior. <br /> <br /> The acting is about the best I've ever seen - from Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Gloria Grahame (who earned an Oscar nomination), Paul Kelly and other actors that I had never heard of. <br /> <br /> I've never heard of this movie - and it's a complete treat that I discovered one that I want to see again and again and again. It's really strange, but impossible to look away because you have no idea what these creatures will do next.
