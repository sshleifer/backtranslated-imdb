My wife is a mental health therapist and we watch from start to finish. I'm the typical man and I can not stand girls' movies, but this movie is unbelievable. If you want to see what it's like for someone who's going through this kind of fight, this is the movie for you. As I watched, I felt sorry for him and others like him. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** In addition to the fact that all the individuals in the movie, including the people in the mental institution, were the real people in real life that made it more real. <br /> <br /> A must see for someone in the mental health profession!
