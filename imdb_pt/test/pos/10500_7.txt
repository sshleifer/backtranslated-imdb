Thank you The FilmZone for showing this sleazy soft core sex movie at 01:00. I really liked. To be honest, I expected a lot more from a sexy cast with McKayla, Dru Berrymore and, of course, the talented Chloe Nicholle (as Rebecca Carter). <br /> <br /> The production figures are really bad mainly because of the low budget, but a little more effort would not hurt. For example, cinematography makes it look like a hardcore porn movie. There is absolutely no effort in the thunderbolt. But let's ignore this fact, because let's be honest, we watch "Pleasures of Sin" because of the high amount of sex. <br /> <br /> The sex factor is very good and offers explicit and steamy scenes. Chole Nicholle offers the best female cast performance. <br /> <br /> So, my advice is, watch this movie if you're in the mood for good sex explicit or just watch it if you're a fan of Mrs. Nicholle. Recommended only for sex scenes; Do not expect anything else.
