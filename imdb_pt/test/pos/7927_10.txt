Tom Clancy uses "Alesandr Nevsky" in his book "Red Storm Rising". In the book, Nevksy was shown in theaters in Russia as a prelude to the Soviet invasion of West Germany. I felt I had to take a look. It was excellent! The cinematography was magnificent and the plot incredible. I do not regret watching this movie and adding it to my collection.
