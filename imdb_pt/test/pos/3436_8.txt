In December 1945, a train leaves from the central station from Stockholm to Berlin. Not much is left when it arrives. Not the train, not some passengers. <br /> <br /> This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted as it used to in the 40's and also photographed (in b / w) as they used to. During the period. The actors must have had so much fun doing it. They are not very characters, as if they were not in the 40's, but the story is well told and everyone has time. <br /> <br /> A deadly black and deadly film. See if you do not think the Swedes are capable of humor.
