I do not know how I would feel if I lived in the USA. I watched a few preview scenes, announcements, I knew, Sidney Pollack drove, Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas starring. I watched this movie as fast as possible without reading any bad reviews. Would I be disappointed? <br /> <br /> I read a lot of review that is said how bad this movie was: This is a boring, long movie with no thrills of passion and is not interesting. Harrison is wooden, cold. The sublots should be cut. Very serious, especially for Harrison Ford. I'm interested in the subject and I like Harrison Ford in movies that are not stock. I also like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas. So by reading the comments on IMDB's website then on other websites then in February in the Hungarian film magazines I was amazed and wonder what the movie was. Anyway, there are movies, directors, stars that / what I want to see, despite any comments. <br /> <br /> I can understand people who think that this movie is boring and cold and has no passion, but I feel different. It's true that I liked Sliding Doors, The Forbidden Woman (this is a French movie, I do not know which title in English, or French). Basic of these films is the development of a love. <br /> <br /> I think Random Heart is an interesting and interesting movie in its own way. <br /> <br /> It may be true that the sublots - congressional election and police investigation after a corrupt police officer - are not well written, are not worked out in detail, but add something to the main character woman and man. After the death of his wife and emotion betrayal, the Dutchman's anger comes to the fore during his work. He will become suspicious and almost lost his best friend (then the woman too). The film shows two ways to survive the tragedy: the death and cheating of our wife / husband. One is the woman's: this is a tragedy, but life goes on. She does not want to mourn forever. What she wants to know-what her husband's lover-the cop's wife-thought about her, she will never learn. She is forced to behave this way. Elections arrive and anything about her husband can become scandal. She wants her daughter not to be disappointed with her father. The man is a cop. He suffers from the fact that he lives in lies. He wants to know - perhaps all men would like to know in this situation - when his wife began to deceive him. How long has she had a lover? He needs the woman's help, but she does not want to, but the guy is stubborn and firm / persistent. The woman can not stand him because he always comes into her life and she can not forget. Their relationship is tense at first and then slowly develops a kind of silent sympathy that prefers an alliance against the outside world, the tragedy. (I said that despite this, they made love in bed) However, the police, can not stop with the investigation, can not stop close and can not allow the woman near him, but he begins the "love", and the woman wants her relationship to continue. But you can not. The woman realizes this. The ending is a bit sad, but logical and enjoyable at the same time. <br /> <br /> It was nice for me to see Peter Coyote again - I like the face of this man - Sidney Pollack. I barely knew Bonnie Hunt, but she was good. <br /> <br /> I think Harrison Ford did a good job. Her eardrop is unusual, but at the beginning, so finally I believed that the woman liked to be in his company despite her temper. It was a shame he had not made a joke. But Ford has a good sense of humor. One reviewer noted (in Hungary), "Ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic remark." But Dr. Jones is not smiling at us ".. But he smiles at the end and it's soooo good. With the rest I agree. I really like him in this role- He's good at acting this a little rough, cool, but somewhere in his smart police soul .. The character of Kristin Scott Thomas is a woman who is determined, self confident but she is closed inside an ivory tower and she keeps away from her emotions. But she really is a woman who becomes indecisive and finds support in the police officer. The two legal and reserved people meet. <br /> <br /> Maybe the script is not good. It is full of ordinary banal phrases, but there are some funny phrases of the woman and the movement, in particular of the man. It's a good movie, but not for everyone, not for the general public. I've watched women under 18 and males over 45 liked this movie the most. About the latter, maybe Sidney Pollack has made this film for his age group that does not go to the multiplex. Anyway, I would advise people who like energetic scenarios with action scenes, which, like Ford action movies, only miss this movie.
