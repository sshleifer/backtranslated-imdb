Despite the reviews, I liked this movie. In fact, I enjoyed it more than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) more than Cruise's attempt. All major players in the series were present: Talbot, Lestat, Armand, Maharet, Khayman, Pandora, Mael, Marius and a half dozen others (though most of them in attendance). Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main players (and Jesse of the Talamasca). Also, despite other reviews, I think this movie and the song was true to the portrait and ethos of Anne Rice, at least as I realize. Aailiyah was very good as Akasha in attractive places (her first entrance and mini dance scene). The film did not capture the breadth of the book series, but I thought it was a good supplement. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of this series mainly due to the style of Anne Rice, sensitivities and treatments. And I find this film a faithful and often superlative representation of the author's vision.
