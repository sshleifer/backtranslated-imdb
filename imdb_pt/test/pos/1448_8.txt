Frank Sinatra took on this role, chewed on the rest of the scene and - spit his way. The TMWTGA is stage, the end is banal, some scenes need a little more cutting, but that's all. It's great entertainment from start to finish and as you watch, you realize that Sinatra, that long-dead MOR singer, had addicts, gangster card games and all the American urban bustle in his blood - he did not learn from that. interim coach There are all sorts of driving touches to keep you entertained, and the soundtrack (undated) kitchen all the way. The marathon card game beat the Goodfellas, Sopranos, etc. for forty years! So you were not faithful to the book? Which movie is it? And I can not imagine being reminded if Brando had let go; the cold turkey scenes would have been embarrassing, rather than nervous, compelling, and moving with Sinatra. No one else mentioned the sullen, lazy, cynical cops-absolutely obvious! And Eleanor Parker would have taken me to kiss.
