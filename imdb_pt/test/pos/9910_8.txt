Hey, it's just TV. Of course, it's STAR TREK, the most appreciated bla bla, and that's great, but it's all relative.

The suspense is really suspense. The danger really seems dangerous. As a child, I think I cried when Spock told me that this hideous creature was as sad, frightened, and horrified as the people who ate. This was one of my first lessons of empathy, a lesson reinforced by the EMPATH episode that was, though less exciting, even more melancholy. <br /> <br /> What bothered me when I was five was that this thing, which looks like deer meat and tomato, somehow in fact consists of more or less rock. Now that kind of choice may seem visionary, the idea of ​​a hippie stylist single-minded through the looking glass, but it may also be just a bit of the drug era.
