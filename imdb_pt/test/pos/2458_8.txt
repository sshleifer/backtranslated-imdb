An underestimated and invisible preciousness. Estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in a poignant and painful way the tension that arises between a son who has been in hell and back, and his parents, who can not begin to understand the emotional scars left behind. He is no different from Born in Fourth of July, dealing with the emotional and mental collapse of a soldier after serving in Vietnam, but while he focused more on post-Vietnam policy (anti-war speeches, etc.) this is about a much more personal topic: Family. A man's struggle to return to normality after a life-changing experience, and the failure of his parents to see the change that has taken place. <br /> <br /> Estevez features latent performance as Jeremy Collier. You may feel the pain and frustration bubbling beneath the surface. There, to match him, inch by inch, is his real-life father, Martin Sheen. It's a trip seeing these two act against each other, since you have the feeling that they are constantly trying to unite with each other. It's like the presence of each other that inspired the duo to do their best, and their performances triumph because of that. <br /> <br /> Recommended for anyone who enjoys solid acting, writing and directing. And for any fan of the Vietnam War. (8/10)
