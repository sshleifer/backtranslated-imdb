I recently visited the Magic Kingdom as an adult with my mother, her best friend and my adult sister. Disney World is often mistakenly seen as a place for kids, but when you see quality shows like Mickey's Philharmagic, you realize that the magic of Disney is for everyone! It was such a good show that we got out of the theater and turned around and got in line again. And then a third time. It was absolutely stunning. I would encourage anyone going to Disney World to check out this show, which is not just a show but a fun-filled world tour with Donald while he once again lets his temper put him in trouble!
