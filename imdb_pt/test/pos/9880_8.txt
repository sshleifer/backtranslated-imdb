I loved this movie when I was younger, and I've really been looking for it again !! I would love to watch it again !! The information is correct, but the cover does not seem to match - I can not say for sure. As far as I can remember, the movie was about these kids (Alyssa Milano, Tina Yothers, etc.) in a driving class, and also shows the evil they get out of class. Edie McClurg was the mother of Alyssa Milano in the film. I remember I really enjoyed it, so if anyone knows where I can get a copy (preferably DVD) of the movie listed above (with those stars in it) I'd love to know. Thank you :)
