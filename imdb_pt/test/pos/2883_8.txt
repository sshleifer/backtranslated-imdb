I liked this movie and after it finished it still makes you think about it. I believe Jeremy Brett is brilliant in this role, although his acting as "death" was a little overdone, but like Jeremy Brett I did not care. <br /> <br /> This is a good drama and closely follows Oscar Wildes' novel. If you like this movie then I recommend you also watch "An Ideal Husband" with Jeremy Brett as Lord Goring. <br /> <br /> This film gives a great insight into Oscar Wildes' way of thinking. is reminded of how, in a way, Dorian Gray is Lord Alfred 'bosie' Douglas and Basil Halward is Oscar Wilde.
