Imagine that you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a child. Now think about what would happen if you had the chance to talk to your younger self, or even change it. Would you try to influence or try to change the beliefs of your younger self in the light of your future experience? Or maybe the encounter would change the perception of the life and reality of your older self? The boy from Walt Disney tries to engage this complex thinking by putting Bruce Willis "me older" on a collision course with Spenser Breslin (from The Santa Clause 2 and The Cat in the Hat "fame"). The result is a sometimes funny and sometimes touching encounter, what makes you reflect on your own past, present and future? and truly believe that it is never too late to change course.
