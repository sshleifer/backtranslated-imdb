Jean Paget, Joe Harman and Noel Strachan - all are unlikely heroes and survivors. Jean, small but strong, whose strength and determination help save lives, marching hundreds of miles and with calm self-discipline and persuasive powers, Joe Harman ("oh my word"), who took risks for Jean and the other prisoners, only to suffer worse. pain imaginable, and Noel Strahan, who trusted Jean, regardless of the odds. Her good humor and rusticity inspire everyone around her, and those with the courage to go with her are rewarded. The beautiful scenery and the soundtrack contribute to the adventure. Despite the duration, it was never annoying to me. These ordinary people have done extraordinary things and are based on a true story. Someone loaned me my VHS a few years ago and I never saw him again. I have learned my lesson, comrades, and I will buy another copy when it can be found. It's a pity that the miniseries is not on DVD.
