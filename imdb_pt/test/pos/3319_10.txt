If this is not my all time favorite movie, it's definitely in the top five. I love this. Everything about it is perfect - the clothes, the set, the lines - yes, they are not like normal people talk, but ... Even in the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office, the girls changing their shoes, choosing a wedgie , watering the ivy plan of the office, putting lunch in the refrigerator ... identical to what we office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the secondary characters are wonderful. If someone like Joan Crawford is exaggerated, it's all part of the package. If you choose many things in the film, it is very evident that this was the early sixties as women were beginning to not "lie down," at least not if they did not want to. As for the characters being contradictory, for example, the character of Suzy Parker acting as if she was just for fun, but then getting too attached to the character of Louis Jourdan, is not this how many people are - contradictory? They mix real things with scenes like Diane Baker's character finding the love of her life after aborting her illegitimate baby in an accident - lying in the hospital with a big old bandage around her head. That's part of the package too, it's charm - brilliant escapism. I like the mix of real stories pertinent today (the stereotypical career woman who only has affairs with married men, so she does not have a family when she is older) with the ones that make you wish, "ah, if I could fall in love with a doctor and he will love me, even though he knows my nasty past, and saw me all messed up after the scandalous accident !! "Also, I only have the DVD, widescreen, it is even more beautiful than the full screen. .. Yay!
