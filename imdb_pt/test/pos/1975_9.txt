This was a great movie, I would compare it to the movie The Game. You reach the end of the movement and do not move ... your brain has been removed and shaken (not scrambled) and placed back in your head. Do not plan anything after this movie, you will need time to think about what happened. <br /> <br /> Do not come to this movie expecting the Matrix style to multiply millions in special effects, these special effects of movies come from actors, they keep you involved, no, they suck you up and do not let go all over duration of the movie. Great acting, great plot ... very nice film, I can not say enough. Also very original storyline, many twists and turns that I would have never thought of. The ending is abrupt and leaves you wondering, was this real? Is this really the end? Good ending, not saying it's bad ... just leaves you thinking, and a little exhausted. <br /> <br /> Great movie for anyone who likes action, as a good plot (do not get up for a break in the bathroom in this movie, you will come back lost) and as mind games, because that's exactly what it is.
