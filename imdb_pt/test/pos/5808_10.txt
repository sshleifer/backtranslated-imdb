This is a spectacular production! I saw the live show twice in Chicago and my only problem with the production was the fact that I was able to perceive only fragments of what was happening. The stage consisted of three giant catwalks and the platform, and as the action moves from one part of the stage to the next, you lose track of what is happening, no matter where you are. As always, this is an insightful sensory overload, expertly captured in high definition with 15 cameras! The filming was masterfully edited, one of the best DVDs of all time in my opinion! I just hope and wish they would release this on Blu-Ray HD-DVD so we can relive this extravagance over and over again.
