This is a good movie for Chucky fans. Ok, I'm sure it's not as good as the Child's Play movie, but this can be very funny and fun, Chucky's laughter is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Now not a doll, but two, meaning twice the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the role very well and definitely took the best kill of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen Child's Play movies, be a movie worthy of your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen children's movies before, this will be a new beginning. Of course you will not have a clue as to how Chucky got into its current state (because I'm not telling you), but you'll find out why Chucky is very popular. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a very enjoyable movie.
