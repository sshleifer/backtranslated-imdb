Garlin excels as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughter keeps coming up every minute. It's a rather dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedy writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really enrich the film. Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her role as receptionist, taking you to the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is amazing with some of the great things she does with Jeff. Bonnie Hunt is classically great in her role. I just wish there was more of her in the movie, because I think most will agree. It's certainly refreshing to see her in a tight leather outfit. David Pasquesi was the distant helper and voice of reason. Mina Kolb plays Jeff's mother with whom he lives. There were numerous other cameos, all of them very well made. <br /> <br /> In the premiere Jeff mentioned his inability to do more with Bonnie due to production problems. Still, it's good to leave you wanting more. I think it's this indie thing to keep some ambiguous things to allow the public to think a little about them to fill in the gaps. The title should tell you. <br /> <br /> Jeff said that some of the basic characters were based on their past relationships. This explains why they work so well. Real life people are always extraordinarily colorful and make great characters. It departs somewhat from what you might expect, having seen Curb Your Enthusiasm and some of his other works. It's one of those things where an actor takes some risks to do something he might have wanted to do, but he could not. <br /> <br /> I think it's worth noting that Garlin's background to Second City, and Hunt is for that. matter, define here the style of acting being the focus of history and direction. It is perhaps an innovative new hybrid of improvisation that caters to the production of indie films.
