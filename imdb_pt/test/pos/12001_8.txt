or any stories that remember the case of Leopold and Loeb, you may find this movie amusing. The cast includes Robert Culp, with Stephen Caffrey and Garrison Hershberger as college students. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is his usual, pretending to be fooled by the precocious pupils. Caffrey ("Longtime Companion", "Buried Alive") is excellent, and must do more of these menacing roles. Basically, the two friends of the fraternity tire of their demanding parents, who expect nothing less than academic perfection, attendance at the best schools will only be funded if they are in compliance. There is an excellent scene in which Culp bake Caffrey on the embers after he receives a low grade, threatens to cut his bottoms and Caffrey then tells his friend: "I hate him, I want him to die" ... <br /> <br /> All is not well in Beverly Hills. This is always a great theme. I believe that this movie came out in 1990 shortly after the murders of Menendez. If you watch "Menedez, Kill in Beverly Hills" and compare it to this movie, you may find some interesting parallels.
