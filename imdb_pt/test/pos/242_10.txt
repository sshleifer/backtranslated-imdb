I really like this movie because of all the stars and the dance and the story that goes with it. Rita Hayworth was the most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous. Despite being a musical, I thought Rita Hayworth did a great acting performance dramatically in this movie as well. As far as she dances, I think she was excellent. Even Betty Grable practically endorsed Rita's dance in this film as she commented that Rita danced rings around her own dance and, let's face it, Betty Grable was a great dancer. Cinematography and vivid colors are also noted. Rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine, but she is also in love with her mentor played by Gene Kelly. Does she leave Kelly to fulfill her dream and ignore the love and stardom of Broadway or does she come around to find that one pearl that will change her life forever? You will have to watch the movie to find out!
