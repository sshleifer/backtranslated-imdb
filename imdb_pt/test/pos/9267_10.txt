The Closer She Gets ... is an art documentary that deals with the death of a person I actually knew. It allows you to glimpse the private moments of the family involved in the most difficult moment of their lives. Parents tend to support the work of their children, in this case the subject of the documentary went above and beyond. She was willing to share her experience of death as an act of love for her child. It is a very touching work of art, weaving the serene, serene and light sides of the life of this family. History is one that can make you laugh, but it also weeps when addressing issues that all of us must face. I highly recommend this documentary to those who are not afraid to cry and are willing to deal with the issue of mortality in the most humane way. This movie will touch you.
