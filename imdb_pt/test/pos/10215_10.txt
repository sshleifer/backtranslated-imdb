Nightbreed surprised me the first time I saw it. And that's been pretty good over the years. The sets and effects of monsters work, are some of the best I've ever seen. No one I know seems to have seen this movie, which, I believe, occurred at the box office because of the lack of interest in horror in the early 1990s. It is like a dark and dreadful fairy tale, and it is much deeper, so you would think, with a strong message against fanaticism, presented by a rich mystical past, which Clive Barker created. What is bad is that the movie ends on a very cool note, which we will probably never see. My only complaint is that Craig Sheffer is only an acceptable actor at best, and the project may have benefited from a better actor in the play. Only one small complaint though as Sheffer is not right. I had a similar problem with Scott Bakula in Barker's Lord Of Illusions, it was not really a terrible performance, but I just did not like him in the role as much as I would have other people.
