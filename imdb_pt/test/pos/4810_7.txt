This movie is a refreshing change of pace from the Hong Kong triad movies, of which I got so tired. There are no spectacular weapons fights. No car chases. And practically minimal action to speak. The public is kept in suspense most of the time, although certain aspects of Andy Lau's so-called "maneuver" are quite obvious. <br /> <br /> The film was hailed as a deviation from the violent triad genre. movies, and as a "smart" crime film. To a degree, it is. But to some extent, it still fails the "credibility" test. Hardly anyone can imagine that any member of the triad is dumb enough not to see through Andy Lau's feminine disguise in a second. It also seemed to have fallen to "if someone was seriously ill, the said someone will be coughing copious amounts of blood regularly" thing that Chinese movies seem to go on for all the time. <br /> <br /> The subtle relationship between the two main characters is a refreshing change. <br /> <br /> Everything is a nice movie, even if the concept is not new and there are few surprises. >
