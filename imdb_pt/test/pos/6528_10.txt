I love Aaron Carter, but even I expected to pop star to be predictable, but I was so wrong! Aaron Carter was very funny about it and a great actor! Also the actress who played Jane was a brilliant actress! Each one I did not watch, I loved it! <br /> <br /> The music was also very good! My favorite lines in the movie are "You can not send me to a public school mom! I'm a CELEBRITY!" And "Take your time, it will come to you!" <br /> <br /> Although the finals are kind of cheesy, all good girls' movies do! This movie is great, and a good Chick movie, which I can watch again and again!
