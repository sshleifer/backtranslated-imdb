The problem with the film is simply that, Conrad's prose is powerfully detailed and can not be adapted to a movie. Marlow's narration in the novel captivates you from the first sentence and you only "see" what Conrad writes. In the movies, it's different, you see the visual, but the description and the reflection that really make the novel are tremendously absent. But as far as a non-adaptable book has been adapted, it is of good standard. There are exactly the same scenes, which are identified with great genius, but never have the same effect as in the novel. The movie plot has been enhanced and works great to make it more interesting. The references to Ancient Egypt were carefully inserted. My tip, read the book, and keep it up, there are better movies out there.
