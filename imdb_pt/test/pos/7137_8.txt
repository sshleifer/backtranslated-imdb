Based on a true story. . The premise of this film is to illustrate that, through fairly normal events, it is possible for a seemingly "decent" mother to be drawn into heroin addiction. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler *** Some of the scenes are quite inaccurate - while others almost make you want to get the 'fix' yourself. <br /> <br /> Computer technician / graphic artist woman with good relationship with her young teenager spirals into vice after co-worker, who is a 'picador' (-one who can take + enjoy it from time to time when -) Then it turns into an addiction that leads her to stop street smugglers after losing contact with her stable smuggler. The scenes that show her coming down and getting 'sick' are often VERY real - especially the first 'night sweating'. Before all these events she started a relationship with a guy who happened to have lost his wife to the bottle, and insists he has an internal radar so he does not get addicted to such women. Some radar! However, after some late changes and strange behaviors, the boyfriend challenges her as "what's happening." Your radar starts to receive more and requires it to empty your bag; she hits the ceiling and fires. Because of the excellent open relationship she developed before this tragedy, he is the first to "find" some real evidence in his purse; he then looks around the hose at her 'hiding place' - apparently his sensitivity is from the school's lessons about drug use - and when he discovers a large stock in the bathroom, he releases it! She is not a happy woman when she takes her next shower and her 'disappears'. <br /> <br /> The boy holds one back and puts it on the table - she then goes into another denial - admits and says no worse than damn. <br /> <br /> The child does the right things and calls the friends and usually puts her in a position where she has to come 'clean' - if you forgive the pun. <br /> <br /> The film takes the viewer through some rather arduous situations, where the danger is not far. <br /> <br /> Make sure she gets help from a professional organization and make a cold turkey - you'll have to watch the movie movie to see what happens next. . . .
