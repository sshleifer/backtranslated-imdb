I remember watching this series eagerly every Saturday night. It was the highlight of the week. I loved everything, the location, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music of Clannad (I still have their Legend album). I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed leaving creating another Robin, this time the Earl of Huntingdon. I believe there were legends of various Robins in medieval times. Another thing I loved was the fact that it was full of young actors, I'm sure Robin and his men would have children, after all people would not live that long in those days. Other Robins always seem too old (Kevin Costner, in his ridiculous accent, looked like Robin's grandfather). The only sad thing was the end, it's a shame they could not at least have made a special to tie all the loose ends and give a happier ending.
