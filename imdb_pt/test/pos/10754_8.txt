As a fan of Harold Lloyd, I agree with the other critic's comments, EXCEPT that I feel that "Movie Crazy" was his best sound film; "Cat's Paw" is a close second. (But, this is just my opinion). <br /> <br /> This movie is a "peep" from beginning to end, and in many scenes George Barbier (the villain who elects him mayor) almost steals the scene. ! (Especially at the end of the movie). <br /> <br /> We hope that the character of Una Merkel is a bit more sympathetic to Harold, especially as the film progresses. Only in the last minutes of the movie did we discover his true feelings for him. (And even then, there is no "romance" - kisses, etc). <br /> <br /> This is a must-see movie!
