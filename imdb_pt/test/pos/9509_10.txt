I've seen movies come and go in my years, and when I watch a disaster movie I keep hoping I will not be disappointed. And with this I was not in the least. The story of an entire country sinking into the ocean was a great concept written by sakyo komatsu, a novelist with intense theories about where this earth is going. The characters were top notch, and although I was not Japanese, I did not need a translator to give the idea of ​​how desperate people were. needs can unite for the common good. The special effects impressed me, I was literally on the edge of my seat watching the tsunami lava flows and earth blasts that must have taken months of work to perfect. As for the acting I thought Yes, this is working at its best, emotions are spreading through the film and I cried in the most severe scenes. For cinema goers, you do not need to speak or understand Japanese to watch this movie, you can get the idea and feeling of each person and character to understand this well and follow how you are there. My hats to Shinji Higuchi to drive, I hope he can overcome his work with another amazing experience. Like I said, .... Fantastic Movie.
