This is probably one of my favorites so far, although I have the first and saw Curse, Legacy and Vs. Demonic Toys. The only better this is the PM vs.. the DT. Curse is the worst of the series, than the first, and then the Legacy. I recommend people to see this and the DT. Those who say it stinks are so wrong, the story is well written and it's a sweet movie. This is a classic movie that even younger children can watch and not be so afraid of when they watch others. Well, this is my comment, you can call me Gipdac, (it's easy to know where it came from: 101 Dalmatian series, you can watch it in Toon Disney at 4:00 in the morning). Oh, and do not laugh, I'm a guy, you'll see more of my comments in a timely manner. If you want to know why I watch? I am 12 years old! Word of advice: Have a mental meal, arrrrroooooooooo! I also agree with you, but because people like others it is because they are more exciting than horror, and because puppets are made to look more frightening. Besides, you can call me Gipdac.
