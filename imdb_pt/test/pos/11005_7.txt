I think Gerard's comments about the doctor hit the nail in the head. Interesting movie, but very long. It is definitely the antithesis of the new school of flamboyant, sexy, Moore-style documentaries. There is no narrator, no fact or lateral information intertwined and no other trick. What you see is what you get - a glimpse into the disappearing world of the Saltmen of Tibet. As a big fan of the doc, I was surprised how much I lost focus with this film, namely due to the duration and lack of dialogue. In the end though, I'd recommend it if the subject sounds interesting to you. He is beautifully filmed, informative and presents a valuable (and final) window into the way of life of Tibetan salmon men (and women :) - all important attributes of a good doctor. But put a big pot of coffee, it will help.
