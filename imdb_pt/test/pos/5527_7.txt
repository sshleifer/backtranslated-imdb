But George and Gracie are not among them. The movie is fun and the pool scene with WC Fields has to be among the funniest I've ever seen, but Gracie and George are more annoying than comic in their roles, partly because of script deficiency and partly by interpretation. I gave a 7 out of 10 for the rest of the cast, Toilet is a treasure trove of comedic time and energy in this one.
