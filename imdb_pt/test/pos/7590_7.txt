This album produced by MGM in 1936 shows the talents of two of their young stars under contract, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin. In a way, these shorts were promotional trailers that featured new talent in front of or behind the cameras. Felix Feist directed this which was a way to promote the two talented stars to the public. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple. The orchestra that entertains in a public park every Sunday does not receive the attention that deserves. Between two music aficionados, Judy and Edna, who love to hear the band being led by one of their grandparents. Two of the town's seniors, feeling that there is no audience for this kind of entertainment, have decided to cancel their Sunday concerts in favor of a more popular orchestra that will appeal to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> The two girls embark on a promotional tour of their own doing what they only know by calling and running errands and being helpful to their neighbors in exchange for a promise that they will attend the next park's concert Sunday. Well, that day comes and, to his surprise, almost nobody comes when the song starts. The two girls decide to take up the subject and ask the conductor to play a song for them to sing. The result is clear, people from all over the park gather to listen to the talented young singers, thus ensuring the existence of the orchestra. <br /> <br /> Of course the only attraction of the short is the inspired singing of the two stars. who are wonderful in their interpretation. Durbin's operatic voice matches well with Garland's natural, creating a lovely duet. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this whenever you show up at TCM!
