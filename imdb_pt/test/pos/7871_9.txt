I saw this short on HBO the other day and I loved it. Eight different characters, eight different perspectives. At first I was confused by the way the story was moving, but then I realized that it was just a scene being shown several times, just to show us the different perspectives of the characters. <br /> <br /> At first you think employees are yelling at the teen for stealing. They speak in their own language, which I (and Chris, the teenager, played convincingly by Eleonore Hendricks) can not understand. The employee perspective dispels this view. I did not realize how wonderful the short is until the last two scenes. <br /> <br /> Excellent short film. I hope that director James Cox can turn the short into a feature film with the same cast, or conquer us with a new movie. <br /> <br />
