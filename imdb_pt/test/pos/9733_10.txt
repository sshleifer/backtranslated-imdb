Firstly, I hate Sci Fi Stuff, and although this movie has a bit of science fiction, sometimes, that's good, because at least it focuses on Andr√© Toulon. In the last three, Andre seemed to have been Mentioned, but Stories never focused on him, which drove me crazy. What also drives me crazy is the amount of 0 that was on the voting chart. Give her a personal rest. If you saw this movie and liked it, please vote for it. Please. What I loved about this movie is that it went back to where it all began. When Andre learned the secret of life. I would recommend Renting this if you've ever seen a Puppet Master movie before and enjoyed it. But do not rent it if this is your first time to see one of the PM collection, mainly because you may think that all masters of dolls are as "dull" as this.
