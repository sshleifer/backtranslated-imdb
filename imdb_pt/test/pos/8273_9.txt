When it aired for the first time at the Masterpiece Theater, it had a profound effect on me. It's beautifully filmed and acted. I immediately read Mary Webb's book, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. Janet McTeer is wonderful as Prue, and I expected her to become regular on the British drama scene. I think she preferred to focus on the British stage. I hoped that with the American success of Janet McTeer years later (with Tumbleweeds), this movie would again be available to us. Unfortunately, it has not yet been released on DVD. If anyone is listening, please make it available again!
