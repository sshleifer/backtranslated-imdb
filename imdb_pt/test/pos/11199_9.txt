Maybe many viewers who get frustrated with this movie live their lives without thinking deeply about their lives. What I want to point out here is that "distant" is not just an art film, but one of the best art films. Of all the art films I've seen, "distant" is what really stands out as a glittering gold piece. It is fair to say that cinematography and the depiction of human emotion surpass Tarkovsky's Nostalgia. One commentator has pointed out, that sex, a common feature among foreign films, is surprisingly lacking in "far" and in a good way. What is most remarkable about "distant" is that it captures the details of life we ​​generally ignore and the rich essence of our existence that is often buried under the noise and visual extravagance of our marketed world. Fortunately "distant" does not have much to spare the public and what we see on the screen is a portrait of humans.
