There was talk in E! Hollywood special about the Making of Dirty Dancing, which is still considered by many women, including a dear friend of mine in their fifties to be one of their favorite movies all time. Maybe the music, the dance or the melodrama around Baby Frances's plot will become a dance sensation with Johnny Castle. Of course this film has established Jennifer Gray, whose biggest role so far was the resentful sister on Ferris Beoller's Day Off. Patrick Swayze is perfectly shaped when the heart beats taking the man who sweeps the baby away, literally. Dirty Dancing has everything to become a Broadway or West End hit. It has the love story, the music and, above all, a lot of dancing. Jennifer and Patrick could relive their roles easily. It's cool to see Jerry Orbach playing a doctor instead of a cop and Kelly Bishop as his mother. It all happened in the Catskills in the sixties, where many Jewish families were vacationing in the area during the summer break. At the end of the movie, it's sad to see hotel owner Kellerman being puzzled by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and travel around Europe than spending the summer in the Catskills. These old big hotels are becoming Indian gambling casinos. Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well. After all, they could do that for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever, that should be a no-brainer! I know this movie is one of the favorites that you do not get tired after watching 800 times. There are people who have probably seen this movie - a thousand times by this time. Somehow watching the make and story behind Dirty Dancing made me anxious for my childhood days when I was thirteen years old. Dirty Dancing may not be the biggest movie ever made in history, but its universal appeal still draws crowds and repeat viewers like the 800 club whose members have watched so many times. I watch now with all the strangeness of the baby's early days and his first true love with Patrick Swayze as heartbeat, Johnny Castle. No one could have imagined this little film as a big hit then with the music of the sixties, two soundtracks and even a tour in the late eighties. I hope they bring Broadway to a musical. It would work for audiences to be part of a movie. No wonder it still draws children and even adults, especially women of all ages, to watch over and over again. Well, Australia and London had Dirty Dancing productions. It looks like it's coming to Broadway in 2007, right on its 20th anniversary.
