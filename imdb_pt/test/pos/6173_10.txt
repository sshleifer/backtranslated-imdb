A beautiful film, skillfully filmed with an eye for the details of the war era, and (considering it is set during World War II) minimal violence. <br /> <br /> A small cast weaves an emotional journey through the occupation of Czechoslovakia, the separation of loved ones as the pilots depart for England (the separation of the spaniel will touch hearts), scenes of spitfire, love, friendship and betrayal. The theme of betrayal goes deep into the film, from betrayal to love, to betrayal to friendship, and finally to the betrayal shown by the communist regime to former post-war RAF pilots. <br /> <br /> A desperately sad movie, all the more so because it's so factually accurate. I would recommend this to everyone.
