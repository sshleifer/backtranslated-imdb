This movie is the funniest Danish movie I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> The plot is funny, surprising and exceptional. Danish humor is different from any other, and that makes you always. The whole audience laughed 90% of the time ... it was amazing. The characters are so well played, and the two actors, Mads Mikkelsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas play their best ever! <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie, you will not regret it, believe me :-)
