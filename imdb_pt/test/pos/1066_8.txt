Forget Jimmy Stewart to relive his life and opt for this clever comedy of mistakes. I suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this film and Stanwyck's other great Christmas story, "Meet John Doe," are not revered with the same level of love as ... well, you know his name. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck plays a culinary writer for a McCall-type rag that has lied years ago to her pompous publisher about the folkloric setting of her recipes. She is an ace b. artist until the day that Morgan's sailor is taken out of the ocean after 18 days afloat and 6 weeks of recovery in a Navy hospital. Launched in the last year of World War II, the film is sprinkled with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia, but never sinks into sentimentality. Stanwyck is sexy and cheeky, as always, and finds her pair in the gorgeous Morgan with whom she is love at first sight. Unfortunately, she has to marry Gardiner's arrogant architect, who has been looking for her hand on her CT farm for years just to fool her boss. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakall adds a great deal of Hungarian malaprop & double-entender humor in support as a true source of culinary talent for Babs & Una O'Connor is hilarious as Gardiner's obnoxious Irish housekeeper.
