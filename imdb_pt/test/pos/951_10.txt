if you have not seen Vijay in "Ghillli", "Gilly" or "Ghillie". go watch Wow. is devastatingly hilarious. I do not know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was serious or not. There are tons of hot guys in this, look for someone who calls Velu "Maacha". The one with the bright, devastatingly hot braids. Your teeth are shiny too. Vijay stones. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It's very deep. Watch out, you will not regret it. There are some great laughs in this one. If you do not speak Tamil, learn. Then you'll have all the inside jokes. It is one for the whole family, except perhaps the violent bits should be ignored. I've seen this movie eleven times ... and counting. <br /> <br /> Wow!
