I saw this movie alone when I was a teenager in my hometown in India, at a time when the only thing that fascinated me other than the girls was the tigers. I came home after watching him, with a glazed eye, wanting to be that guy in the movie that made friends with the Tigers. What movie and what time it was! The theater I saw did not exist and gave way to a shopping mall. I do not know how I would feel about it now after so many years and I do not want to ruin a child memory by finding this movie available on DVD or something similar and not finding it more interesting. I have learned from previous experience that a childhood memory is often tainted when traveling through the rotten roads of life trying occasionally to rediscover its unadulterated past through movies, only to find its innocence gushing completely confused and no longer welcome. And I do not want to throw away the experiences of a remembrance of this movie in the wind. I do not have children, so I'm probably being selfish in leaving this movie in a sepia tone area of ​​my brain, not wanting it on DVD. But if you are at an early age and want to remember in later years memories of a captivating childhood, try watching this movie (if you can). It will be worth it.
