I just got back from the GLBT Film Festival at AMC Loews 34th in NY. A friend told me about this movie. The audience response was very positive! Many good solid laughs as well as some quiet moments of accomplishment. High level in all areas. A movie that makes you think, and then makes you realize how lucky we all would be if we could go back in time and live without shame or guilt. I imagine this will come close, if not win, from the audience's favorite prize! What was more surprising was the fact that the film seems to start off as a satire and then slowly turn into a genuine comment on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the group itself that began to satirize. There is no witty humor at the expense of a group, only a slow realization that we would all be better off if we returned to the gentle innocence with which we all began.
