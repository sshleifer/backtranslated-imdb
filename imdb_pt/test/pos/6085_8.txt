"The English Patient" by Anthony Minghella is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is grandiose and impressive in scale and yet so painfully intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering. In the 1997 Oscar, the film won the night, taking home nine awards of twelve nominations, the most decisive cleanup since Bernardo Bertolucci's "The Last Emperor" in 1988. Based on the book by Jonathan Ondaatje, winner of the Booker Prize The English Patient is a moving meditation on life, love and loss, tracing the story of a man critically burned after World War II. <br /> <br /> During the war, a man (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered in the burnt remains of a crashed plane. With his face scarred beyond recognition, and with the man apparently suffering from amnesia, he is considered an allied soldier, and is simply referred to as "the English patient." After the war, in the hills full of mines of Italy, a gentle nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), who apparently lost everyone close to her, remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying. Over time, she comes to learn more and more about her "English patient," who is actually revealed as a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Almásy. Instead of losing his memory in the plane crash, we learn that this man full of scars may have chosen to forget his past, both to protect himself from persecution and to heal from the tragic memories of his past love. Through numerous flashbacks, we learn of the ancient feats of Almásy in the Sahara Desert, and his romantic connection with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> It is certainly easy to understand why 'The English Patient' was so successful at the Oscars. It's such a beautiful film, mixing the tranquil beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Director of Photography John Seale captures the landscape to perfection; not since David Lean's magnificent "Lawrence of Arabia" has a movie that shows the desert with such beauty and grandeur, making particularly good use of aerial photos of Almásy's plane. Even in the most intimate moments of the film, the excellent use of close-ups and lighting captures the emotion of the scene, accompanied, of course, by the brilliant performances of all the cast members. <br /> <br /> A long time ago my favorite actor, The English Patient, may contain only the best performance of Ralph Fiennes and considering that his story includes films like 'Schindler's List' and 'The Faithful Gardener' ', this is not an adjunct that should be taken lightly. . His Count Laszlo de Almásy is initially a very nice character, but as we slowly learn more about his past, his pleasant qualities are eroded by his less admirable tendencies towards others. "Property" is an important theme of the film. When asked by Katherine what he hates most, Almásy responds with "Property. Being property. When you leave, you must forget me." However, as the relationship progresses, and Katherine may try to distance herself from him, Almásy reveals a hint of arrogance, insisting that her love for her somehow entitles her to have her whenever he likes: "I want to touch you I want the things that are mine, that belong to me. "<br /> <br /> Juliette Binoche, who received an Oscar for her performance here, is excellent as Hana, the lonely nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that always hurt people close to her. After some time taking care of Almásy alone, she is accompanied by a dubious Canadian thief, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who lost his thumbs during the war, and suspects that it was Almásy who betrayed him to the Germans. Hana also creates a temporary romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian bomb diffuser in the British Army. However, because of her past history, Hana is afraid that engaging with Kip will condemn her to death, particularly considering her very dangerous line of work. <br /> <br /> With 160 minutes of duration, The English Patient beautifully evokes memories of classic old romantic epics, successfully finding a balance of mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The ending of the film is painful and painful, but also edifying in its own way. While some romantic relationships are doomed from the start, others have a good chance of bringing happiness. However, in all cases, it is always better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.
