with what they had. John and Carolyn were very private, so the writers had to put together what they could. I really liked Portia de Rossi as Carolyn, but Jacqueline Bisset's voice irritated me. She should have used her normal voice. I would rather the whole movie focus on John and Carolyn instead of reviewing things we already know about John.
