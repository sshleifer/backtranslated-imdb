The characters Ma & Pa Kettle were highly popular and controversial. The films that contained his creations paved the way for television sitcoms that came after and sought to imitate his winning formula. An obvious reference is "The Beverly Hillbillies," where the new house was bought with oil money, not having been beaten in a contest. You could even say that the 1980 sitcom 'Newhart' lends its idea of ​​retrograde characters in the series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington author who created these characters, did no more harm than good. His portrayal of countrymen makes them the subject of many jokes in terms of supposed sloppiness and laziness. (The real-life family on which Macdonald based the Kettles, sued ... claiming that they had been ridiculed and humiliated by these less than flattering references). Of course, it's a comedy and the situations bring us lots of laughs and fun times ... and the politically correct as we know it today did not exist in the 1940s and 1950s. But I think Macdonald could still have written these characters more sensibly and Universal International could have their screenwriters showing them on the screen with more dignity (there's something good about it). The most realistic moments are when the eldest son, Tom, is ashamed of his rural heritage, but learns to accept his parents and siblings as they are. For their part, the Kettles have to realize that they do not exactly fit into a modern world. This is not a joke ... it's sober truth.
