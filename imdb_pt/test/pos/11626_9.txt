Sigrid Thornton (SeaChange) was apparently born to fill the role of Cato's Gordon Gordon in this story that is often compared to Margaret Mitchell's classic Gone With the Wind in the American Civil War. Waters (Heaven Tonight) is arguably his best role as his love interest, and the two leaders lead a wonderful Australian cast in this, arguably the most well-known and beloved Australian miniseries. It's an exceptional production everywhere, though do not try to watch it all in a single hit, and deserves to be remembered as a magnificent portrayal of life in pre-Federation Australia. Rating: 8/10
