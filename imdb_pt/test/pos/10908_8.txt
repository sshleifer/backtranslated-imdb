The first and much better of Kevin Kline's two gay roles. (The second is the somber "De-Lovely" in which he portrayed Cole Porter.) Inspired by Tom Hanks's emotional acceptance speech to "Philadelphia" in which he exposed his theater teacher, the film indicated in this version was obviously more " Forrest Gump "than" Philadelphia ". Here the character Hanks is played by Matt Dillon. The reaction scenes in most of the film are very funny and, as has often been pointed out, are especially effective, as done by Kevin himself, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck (a brave move since he himself was the target of such rumors, which he denied!), Bob Newhart and Joan Cusack as the abandoned future bride. <br /> <br /> The true teacher of Tom Hanks. criticized the graduation scene by saying that people do not act like that in real life. But this is a farce and not real life. That being said, it's not as effective as it could be and the poor guiding of the final "wedding scene", which makes it look like Tom and Kevin are about to get married, I find it somewhat useless, irritating and police. The highlight of the movie for me is, of course, the Kevin scene with the audiotape "how to be a real man" and it's hilarious, but it's certainly not realistic when the tape reacts to Kevin's. actions. <br /> <br /> Overall, a joke!
