You do not have to be a Tamilian to enjoy this gem of a movie. I do not know a word of Tamil and saw this movie just because a friend recommended me. Understanding a movie without knowing the language is very difficult. but I could see the story because the main actors (and actresses) performed well. And the little girl was really cute (she was not annoying as child actors in most Hindi movies). The story is really exciting Mr. Ratnam for trying something different. The relationship between parents and their children is shown quite realistically (I could identify with the characters in the film). It was a movie that will remain in my heart forever and I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends. Also the songs are just out of this world! They were beautifully and significantly imagined. If I could understand the right meaning of the letter :(
