My introduction to a lifelong love of Shakespeare. My brother was 5 years old and I was not 7 when WTTW Chicago broadcast An Age of Kings. It became a familiar ritual to watch, including the reruns. Like an autumn series, my father used to buy us a rare treat for the midwest - pomegranates; and my mother put corn on the stove. Wonderful performance by actors whose names meant nothing to me (though I'll never forget the painfully young Sean Connery as Hotspur), but do it now! And they published the booklet scripts so we could follow and discover the language. I was able to memorize most of Richard III about it. So happy to see you leave on DVD! Highly recommended for all ages and any level of familiarity with the history of Shakespeare or English.
