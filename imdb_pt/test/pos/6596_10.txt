When the bicentenary arrived, I was in Hershey, PA and part of the Middletown Skate Team. We did nothing but skateboard trying to learn what we were reading on the pages of Skateboarder Magazine. A couple of local hills provided all the speed swings you could handle. At the time, Mike Weed was the hottest guy along with Russ Whats-him-name, with the Z-boys in his tail. I had a GT plastic plate (GrenTech) with Power Paw urethane wheels (loose bearings). <br /> <br /> My parents told me that we were going to California later that year and that they were traveling home. Hunting. I was an extremely good son that summer and asked if I could not be rewarded with a REAL California skateboard. They delivered. It was a fiberglass deck with the Surfer Magazine logo displayed. Large trucks and large red wheels (precision bearings, you do not know). They caught on Oak Street, a surf shop in Laguna Beach. <br /> <br /> When I arrived in California (all 13), Anaheim had the Concrete Wave and Carlsbad had a great park too. Soon came the Skate Odyssey in Mission Viejo. A covered park with all the scenarios imaginable. All the time I was reading about Stacy, Shogu, Tony and Jay. This movie was right on the money and a wonderful experience to watch.
