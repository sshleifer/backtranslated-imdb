This film is beautiful in many ways: the plot, the depth of the characters, the impressive photography and acting, the battle scenes of the kolossal type (no computer graphics here, only thousands of people). Someone said that the story has something to do with the Sheakespearian tragedies. I also find some connections with the tradition of Greek tragedy. The emperor, extraordinarily acted, fights between power and love, but he is forced (for the greater good, by the will of his ancestors) to choose the power (and the loneliness, the hatred of his subjects and relatives) as their destination. He, like Creon in Antigone, was a good fellow before he became emperor. Once he has conquered power, he has to be ruthless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, his father, etc.) to defend and expand the empire. Entrapped by power he becomes a monster. Overall, the Qin emperor is a majestic figure of Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> The killer evolves in a different direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality. Even this character is forced to his fate by love and his new ethics. This character is really unforgettable too. <br /> <br /> Lady Zhao, a wonderful Gong Li, is incorruptible morality, not by power, love or hate. It is morality against power, somehow like Antigone. His conspiracies (for and against the emperor) always have a moral logic. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a wonderful film. If you like movies and want to try Chinese movies, you can start here.
