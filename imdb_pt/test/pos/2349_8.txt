Naruto, the Anime TV series, has so far generated two theatrical films, and a third is coming soon. <br /> <br /> The first, which was released in the summer of 2004, was a fun adventure. featuring the main characters of Naruto in an exciting adventure. However, one needs to be a blind, deaf, long-legged chicken to deny the flaws of the film. While the former was definitely more enjoyable, there were many things that could be improved upon. Naruto Movie 2, however, assumes all of these aspects and stands out about them. <br /> <br /> The action was, after all, incredibly cinematic. The lighting, the setting and the style were three times more effective than in the first film. In the first we were given a basic action, animations well animated and choreographed, but nothing stunning, but the cinematography of this film was exceptional, the use of shadows and matching lights to make the action more intense was very effective and was added to the film. strength of the fight. <br /> <br /> The animation was very good. He rivaled Disney, however, as this is a movie about TV characters, there was nothing exceptional about the design or details of the characters, however, the animation was incredibly fluid and realistic. I think they used twice the amount of cels for every second because there was absolutely nothing nervous about the animation, it was incredibly fluid. <br /> <br /> The music ... I think that's where this movie fails. The original composer / conductor for the TV show was used for the movie, and I did not really feel like he did a good job. The song reminded me of many pieces used in old SNES games. The composer is very good, but the synthesizers used for the film could not transmit the song very well. However, they did not fail in the movie, adding as a good accompaniment to the action. But with the exception of a few violin / chord pieces at the end and some choral works, the music did not exceed any limits or acted as something special. <br /> <br /> The story was fun. It was a fairly typical storyline for Naruto and it was very much like the early films, except, once again, that it took everything wrong with the story of the first film and improved on them. The characters were much more interesting and the way the story progressed was what kept me watching throughout the film. It still made you think the movie would end any second now, but then you would move on, but instead of feeling dragged out, the action and characters made it all look fresh and exciting. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a good movie, but no matter how good it is, it's definitely one of the fans. I liked the movie, but it's because ... I'm a fan! But I can see, as with Advent Children from Final Fantasy, it does not stand out as a movie, but it simply acts like a fantastic fan service for a good hour and a half. Although I think this movie acts as a good introduction to the series for the current non-observers, it will not give a complete effect to anyone other than those stuck on the Naruto screens. However, despite all this, it was a fun movie to enjoy during this depressing period of unpleasant fillings.
