"All Abir-r-r-d" by Friz Freleng is one of the best cartoons Sylvester and Tweety. Unlike the many repetitive cartoons in the series that simply transplant the same tired jokes into a new setting, "All Abir-r-d" makes the most of its concept. Tweety and Sylvester are domestic pets being shipped without assistance across the country by train. With a vigilante clerk and a ruthless bulldog to deal with, Sylvester has his work cut out. Cartoons Sylvester and Tweety have always benefited from some extra participants and 'All Abir-r-r' is a good example of how much these extra characters help. Although not especially memorable creations, they throw a few more obstacles in Sylvester's path and contribute to a more interesting battle. This early Sylvester and Tweety short many of the right buttons, and while Tweety is often particularly annoying with his forced cuteness, there are some delightfully violent tricks between Sylvester and the dog, culminating in a surprisingly brutal climax that is unfortunately marked by an unfunny finale -quip by Tweety.
