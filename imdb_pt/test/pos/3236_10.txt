VHS - I watched this several times and LOVED every minute of it so much that now I ordered the DVD. I just wanted the movie to last longer. I never worry about what other people think I prefer to make my own opinion and I totally disagree with the negative comments and will not let others spoil my enjoyment with the movie. Make your own opinion and do not let others challenge you! I have the whole BBC series of Jane Austen, but this is my favorite. I see there is a new Abbey Northanger released in 2007 that I will buy when I leave, but it will not stop me from watching Northanger Abbey released in the 80's.
