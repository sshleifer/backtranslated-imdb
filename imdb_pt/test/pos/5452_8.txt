TV movies generally do not get as much recognition or credit as great movies - and it's usually for good reason, but the 1996 HBO movie, The Late Shift, is easily one of the best TV movies of all time. Based on Bill Carter's revealing book, The Late Shift is about how NBC dealt with talk show host David Letterman and Jay Leno when they took the vacant Tonight Show once occupied by Johnny Carson. We see what happens in front of the camera - author Bill Carter, director Betty Thomas and HBO show us what happened when the cameras were turned off. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we can never know for sure what really happened. when it came time for Johnny Carson to be replaced by Letterman or Leno - but The Late Shift gives us an interesting reality. Although it is simply a very well done film, The Late Shift also does a great job of portraying all sides fairly evenly - although you wonder if the movie makes Letterman and Leno become too good; especially Leno, who seems a bit saintly. <br /> <br /> The performances are also very good. In a Golden Globe-winning performance, Kathy Bates plays Helen Kushnick, the extremely aggressive manager of Leno who, according to Carter and the book / film, was very troublesome for the studio and Leno (the real Kushnick fit for Bill Carter for defamation!) John Michael Higgins interrupts his usual shows of getting quirky little comedy pieces and gives a great performance like David Letterman - giving Letterman an excellent impression, but also creating a dimensional and relatable character. Daniel Roebuck does a good performance as Leno, but does not compare to some of the other talents of the film - Roebuck probably did the best that anyone could have done, it just seems whenever someone tries to make an impression or portrait of Leno. Bob Balaban (Warren Littlefield squirrelly), Treat Williams (a magician-Ovitz Michael Ovitz), and Ed Begley Jr. (a pompous Rod Perth) also give memorable supporting performances. <br /> <br /> Late Shift certainly is one of the best TV movies I've ever seen. I suppose if someone did not watch David Letterman or Jay Leno, The Late Shift might not be for them, but it's an interesting movie for those who enter into the politics of dawn - something that recently resurrected their ugly head with the 2009 -10 Conan disaster / Leno / NBC.
