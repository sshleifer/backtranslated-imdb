Okay, so maybe the imitations of Jay Leno and David Letterman are not visible, but you still have a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen. Bob Balaban and Treat Williams are excellent as Warren Littlefield and Micheal Ovitz. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a joke or a joke, but it's still funny. Kathy Bates, in particular, is amazing as Leno's manager. <br /> <br /> Funny, incredible, interesting, very watchable, this is a good TV movie.
