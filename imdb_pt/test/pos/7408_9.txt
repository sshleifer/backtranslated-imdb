It is characteristic that this film is no longer known. It is obvious that most of the elements that a successful theater movie need are missing: heroes, villains, conflict and resolution, romantic love interest ... <br /> <br /> Everything is confusing here, nothing works as it should, everything world is clumsy sad, angry, wounded and hungry and no one has a solution for anything. In short: it's war and it's hell for everyone involved. People try to do the best, but interests, alliances, and so-called duty interfere. The image transports us back in time to the Civil War with an intensity rarely seen in today's cinema. Frank and honest images of intense beauty. The actors are very well chosen for the story and make the characters really live before our eyes. <br /> <br /> A silver dollar in a pile of coins!
