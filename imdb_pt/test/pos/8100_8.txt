Okay, it's too long and you're very pleased with yourself. Still, "The Great Dictator" is a fascinating film. Chaplin does a great job satirizing Hitler and trying to portray the oppression of the Jews in Nazi Germany (this before the concentration camps are of general knowledge). It's not Chaplin's masterpiece, but it's still worth seeing. <br /> <br />
