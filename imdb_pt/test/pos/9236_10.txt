After watching "The Texas Tale of Treason," you feel a renewed chagrin about the nature of the Hollywood beast. Within the interviews and conversations of everyone involved with the project, there is a common sense of camaraderie and rebellion that encompasses funds, social classifications and even geography. This can be attributed to the hard work in the eternal commitment of all production to design and love the story of the original film, and the complete creation of vacuum that is the creator. The scale of people involved in "Waldo's Hawaiian Holiday" was incredible to me, with no budget, no production of glory. There were no trailers or craft services, no amenities, and yet everyone involved was trapped right there. If nothing comes of this project, Antstuie Productions has established its base to be a serious and honest company that will never settle down, sell or make a movie just for the money. I would like to see any LAA director go through the guerilla process to get a chance. More realistic reality for the cinema of life is missing in this CG time and green screens. The masses can enjoy their entertainment spoon fed to them in nice quiet censored pieces, but there are a large group of people here in the world who share the opinions and perceptions of filmmakers who still make films out of love for the material. or love story telling, not DVD sales or box office. I loved this documentary, and I hope IFC has the cahones to pick it up and air it so maybe just maybe one more person decides to get a camera and shoot some real life so the viewer can have up to one temporary understanding that everyone everywhere is the same and anyone anywhere can be a true storyteller.
