I recently attended Sundance, as I have always done in previous years, and I was aware of the small pleasures of indifferent indies, the excess of somber comedies, and now predictable portrayals of dysfunction. But then I saw Mark and Michael Polish 'Northfork' and I remembered why I fell in love with the movies in the first place. 'Northfork' sweeps the screen with visionary boldness and traces back to Terence Malick's seminal early work and Antonioni's existential landscapes. It's an impossible film to easily explain one of your many strengths. Suffice it to say that it is an adult fairy tale with many levels of meaning carefully arranged in layers. It piqued my imagination and cast a towering shadow over all the other movies I've seen this year. It is a meticulous work of craftsmanship and a sophistication of writing not seen in most American films. I plan to revisit this movie several times when it comes to my theater of neighberhood. For it is a captivating piece of magic and mystery, a haunted work where one can tread the plains of Montana in search of angels and the very nature of heaven and earth. The cast plays this luminescent piece with impressive conviction, particularly James Woods and Nick Nolte, who remind us of the nerve and daring displayed throughout their careers. Maybe "Northfork" will help us find a new wave of American cinema, where excellence in craftsmanship and writing become more of a norm than an exception. Seeing him when he comes his way and take his friends to the questions will be many and the thoughts and feelings stimulated by watching 'Northfork' will awaken memories of great movie once seen in his past and now hopefully may be returning with the advent of Polish Brothers.
