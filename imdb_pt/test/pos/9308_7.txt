It was a fascinating story waiting to be told. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes us into the trials and tribulations of a group of renowned American scientists who took on a high task during World War II: it defeated all others in the atomic bomb. Kidnapped in a heavily guarded New Mexico complex, brainiacs slowly transform the idea of ​​ambitious concept into immense reality. <br /> <br /> THE CAT AND LITTLE BOY is one of those movies that demand a lot of attention. It is the film of a person who really thinks, not only of the scientific aspect of developing a seemingly impossible weapon, but also of the moral implications of contributing to mass killing. The characters are constantly torn between this reality and their duty to war as Americans. The film is never lazy, however, leaving us free to marvel at the enormity of the inner turmoil these men face. The performances deserve special mention as well. Paul Newman makes one of his great and smooth performances as the general patronesco in charge of delivering the last great baton to the Allied Forces. <br /> <br /> Where the FATHER AND THE SMALL MAN lose much of their traction is in the unnecessary romantic component. Dwight Schultz, as leader of the scientific team, struggles with his affection for his family and his relentless obsession with his great project. Director Roland Joffe apparently felt the need to explore the most human angles in this story, but the romantic tones serve primarily as a distraction. Moreover, it is the interaction between scientists and their military hierarchy that gives us the highest insight into the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men. <br /> <br /> Still, it's hard not to recommend FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY. It is a largely forgotten gem that puts a human face in one of the most intriguing stories in the history of mankind.
