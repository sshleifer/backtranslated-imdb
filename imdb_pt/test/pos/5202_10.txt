Such a movie does not show up very often. I'm surprised it took 9 years to finally see this. Politicians and civilian hawks must see this before making decisions about how people's lives destroy, I watched it the day after the TV version of "Revolt" on the Warsaw ghetto was shown. Even with this in mind, I felt sympathy for the German soldier. I felt sympathy everywhere that this tragedy could happen. It will take some time to unfreeze this. I'm surprised they have not made a film based on "The Forgotten Soldier" from Buy Sajer. This movie shares the cold with the book. Both will haunt me for the rest of my life.
