I heard many different opinions about this movie and then find out that Paris Hilton was in it too did not give me the best impression of the movie ... so be dragged to the movies by a group of my friends and sit there waiting for a pile of pants I was shocked to discover that I was scared hard all the way through the movie ... it was predictable yes, but the accumulation of deaths and the whole atmosphere of the movie made it REALLY scary for me ... I was looking through my fingers all the time . So I say, go watch and decide for yourself and if the fact that it's a scary movie does not convince you to watch it, then you also have Chad Michael Murray in it, which can not be bad watching for a few hours Eh?
