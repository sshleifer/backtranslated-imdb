Nothing great here, but a very well played story about an abused deaf wife (Fonda) of a little time bandit (Bochner) who gets involved with one of her husband's plans and her lover. Sutherland and Weber are cops drawn for what turns out to be an investigation of non-mysterious murder and the story just flows together.
