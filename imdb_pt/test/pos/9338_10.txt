Without a doubt, this is the great mother of all music videos !!! Unlike most music videos that are "dance videos", that is, badly recorded and / or badly interrupted, this has been done correctly. Jackson was co-writer and by evidences of heavily choreographed VH1 and directed this masterpiece. In fact, you could say that Thriller is scarier than most horror movies with that last second brilliant eye. For me, this video is what you judge in all other music videos. You can easily see the sinister influence that M.J. had at the beginning of the dance break with the number of zombie marches. Because of dance, comedy, plot and horror. I give a 5 out of 5.
