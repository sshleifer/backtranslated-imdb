For me, "Late Chrysanthemums" was interesting not only because it was my first Naruse film that I thoroughly enjoyed, but because it was technically as modern and groundbreaking as its 30-year work I've seen. This does not mean an innovative edition of the way Godard would present it with "Breathless" in 1959, but just the opposite. <br /> <br /> The issue was as fluent as in the best of the Hollywood movies of the 30s / 40s, but at the same time incredibly appropriate in the way he was telling his story. Unlike them, he never pointedly accented anything or tried to become "invisible," but, along with the cinematography, made me feel as if I were traveling in a gentle stream, constantly feeling the waves beneath me, like a soft hand strike or the barely swinging of a crib. In that sense, the film was comparable to the work of Ozu and Mizoguchi, but somehow even more subtle. <br /> <br /> What was so modern was the fact that the editing seemed almost a character in itself, similar to the remarkable camera. work in Dreyer's Ordet (1954) or Vredens dag (1943), which is revealing a deeper understanding of the film and its characters, rather than simply showing them to us. <br /> <br /> I feel that the editing and cinematography of Naruse are the most interesting aspects of his films, elevating the meaning of stories beyond the obvious. Wonderful scenery and scenery should not be forgotten either! I found the story itself quite conventional. <br /> <br /> The narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way, and I found that the first half of the movie was creating a delicately ingenious spectrum of emotions. and interrelationships. Unfortunately, the second half of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and stereotyped compared to the montage (although, by itself, it fit perfectly into any other film - less complex). Somehow I felt he failed a bit in trying to dissolve the many layers he had woven. Maybe he should have kept them intact. This criticism may seem a little harsh for a viewer of this film, especially since the procedure is again reminiscent of the way Ozu dealt with the plot in his films. Unfortunately, I still do not have the feeling that Naruse was able to elevate the story and its characters in the conclusions of their films in an equally sublime way. The best efforts I have seen to date - Ukigumo (Floating Clouds / 1955) and Midaregumo (Sparse Clouds / 1967) - sustained the energy he had built throughout the narrative, while providing poignant and resonant endings. <br /> <br /> This is already more than most filmmakers are able to do and, in my opinion, the basis for a true mastery of the film medium. In this regard, and considering the resonance of the last two films I've seen for him, he may already have become one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have at the moment is where I'm going to see more of your movies on the big screen.
