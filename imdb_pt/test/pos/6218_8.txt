My favorite story of "Crypt Tales". Brion Jones was born to play the role of the manic woodcutter, the nutcase Steve Dixon. Having seen him before in Tango & Cash, I can state that this actor never received the due credit he deserved. A jealous husband takes offense at his wife by showing interest in a handsome young worker he has just hired. And you know when Dixon finds out there's going to be hell to pay! Young worker Ted (Billy Wirth) receives an all-powerful beating from Dixon leaving him. Now how is a blind woodcutter supposed to work? A tribute to black humor if ever there was one! The co-stars do a good job also supporting Ted when Dixon has his initial suspicions about his wife longing for another man. Dixon's behavior making the bond stronger among colleagues. One stated that he became a changed man when he married. Although Ted should have done what was wise and left when he could!
