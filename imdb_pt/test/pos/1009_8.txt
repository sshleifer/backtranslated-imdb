I hate soccer!! I hate soccer fans! I hate cars! but this movie was the funniest thing I've seen in a while. I was given a great opportunity to watch this movie over the weekend, and all I have to say is that I laugh until I cry and when it will be available in the UK and Denmark. Girls, this is a football movie you need to see, it's hilarious! <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie started as a crazy commercial for a telephone company is incredible, the guys may not be well known. actors, but this is good for real land humor, with real people, and I, on the one hand, applaud them for taking this to the screen. <br /> <br /> Well done!
