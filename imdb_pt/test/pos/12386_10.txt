Okay, I'll say that. This movie made me laugh so hard it hurt. This statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is no more than a waste of film. But what most people do not understand is that this movie was meant to be bad and cheeky. I mean, did people really think that a movie about a killer snowman should be a masterpiece? Just look at the "creepy" hologram on the cover of the movie and you'll find your answer. Instead, like the original Jack Frost (which I found so funny), this movie ended up being a journey divided into the depths of raw dialogues, bad pamphlets and horrible special effects. And everything is done to deliver laughter to us spectators. It certainly worked for me. <br /> <br /> For example: Anne Tiler (for her troublesome husband): What makes you frown so sorrowfully? <br /> <br /> If that piece of dialogue does not make you laugh then you have serious problems. Who in their right mind would express these words in real life? Of course, no one because it was made to look ridiculous! Just have a preview of this movie with an open mind and low expectations, and we hope you see what is so funny in Jack Frost 2.
