I accidentally bumped into this movie on Cinemax while surfing the canal. I must admit that what attracted me was Christopher Walken. And the scenery was the kind I wanted, so I started watching. At first I was expecting a serious drama movie, and it seemed like this for a while ... until I started laughing here and there, and before I knew it, I was laughing so hard all through the movie. I really like how subtle and cheerful it is, but it still has a huge impact on the audience. The plot is very simple, and it's far from too difficult to be funny as many Hollywood "comedies" are, but it almost made me roll on the floor. A must see for a good night's rest, or anytime in that case.
