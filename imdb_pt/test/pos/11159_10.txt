This movie is full of interesting ideas. Some scenes are truly hilarious. The dialogues are witty and colloquial. The tension in the film comes not so much from the plot of the "murder mystery" as from the relationship between the characters. The film tells two stories in parallel. <br /> <br /> The first story involves the characters played by Trintignant and Kassovitz. Trintignant is an aging wanderer, with a somewhat ridiculous machista hardness, who is followed by a naive young man played by Kassovitz with many good-natured smiles. Many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters, for example, when Trintignant tries to teach Kassovitz to be intimidating. <br /> <br /> The second story tells how a salesman, played by Jean Yanne, gives his job and his wife to find the killer of a young friend. Yanne plays the part with a kind of aggressive irony. I wish I could describe it better. <br /> <br /> After a while, the viewer understands how the two stories are connected and they really meet at the end, in an astonishing but also logical ending. The film is a successful mix of the witty but shallow gangster films that the director's father (the celebrated Michel Audiard) used to write, and the "typical French film" with a lot of psychological depth and great care in the display of emotions.
