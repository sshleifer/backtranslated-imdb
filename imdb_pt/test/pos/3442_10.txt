In 1984, Edgar Reitz surprised movie lovers from around the world with his epic Heimat opus: A Chronicle of Germany. Eight years later, he created a sequel, The Second Heimat: Chronicle of a Youth, which is even more amazing than its predecessor. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's not really a continuation. It is more of a "midquel" because it covers events that happened between the ninth and eleventh episodes of the first cycle of Heimat. The Second Heimat begins in 1960, four years after Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold) was separated from his first love, Klarchen, courtesy of his intolerant mother and elder brother (the controversy had to do with he was shorter while she was about 25 years old). Still angry at these events, he promises never to fall in love again (a grandiose, albeit scary, scene) and decides to move to Munich (as the director himself did in about the same time), hoping to become a professional composer. after a few years at the music academy. He remains in Munich for ten years, and the thirteen two-hour episodes of Heimat 2 cover that period of time, each focusing on a different person among Hermann's colleagues, people who, like him, are looking for a "second House". country ", be it music, film or anything else, where they can finally live in peace. Like the first Heimat, this second cycle is a perfect union of cinema and television: the episodic structure and several romantic subplots make it look like a novel, in fact, the Second Heimat needs to be seen in its entirety to be successfully embraced, whereas some chapters of Heimat 1 could be seen as separate stories (in particular, as regards Hermann's adolescence The style and content, however, is pure author cinema, with well-known black and white / color transitions (actually a little more predictable this time) and ambiguous characters, the latter being underlined by the relationship between Hermann and the cellist Clarissa Lichtblau (Salome Kammer): they clearly love each other, but continue to embark on matters with other people, delaying the inevitable until it is too late. Hermann is so disillusioned that "The Beatles are so much better than us!"), Building whole episodes around obscure and controversial themes like abortion and suicide. The decade he is exploring is not suitable for everyone, as some are marked dramatically by the central events of the 1960s (especially the 1968 revolution). <br /> <br /> Reitz also seems to have done it. series specifically for movie aficionados, given the numerous film references (including a brilliant quote from Casablanca) and clever inner jokes (an episode is set in Venice, whose film festival played a major role in the success of the Heimat saga). And since 1992, film lovers have never failed to thank you for delivering 26 of the most attractive hours ever compromised with celluloid.
