The best Batman movie of the 90s, no doubt. This movie takes place in a city full of insecurity and nightmares. <br /> <br /> Although the villains are a bit extravagant, they fit perfectly into the movie tone of the colorful, but nightmarish cinematography. <br /> <br /> The performances are really great and the comedic tone behind them really raises expectations. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cheese clothes, this is a movie in the pure Burton style. This can not be described; Burton is a sui generis director who took the Batman franchise to another obscure level but not forgetting his comic-style past. <br /> <br /> Recommended for action movie fans and best of all, if it deals with super heroes.
