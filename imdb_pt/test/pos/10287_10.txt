from Brian DePalma's Vertigo or Obsession to Peter Chase's score reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's sounds, this little pearl seems to be seen by a few. Remarkable game by Romane Boeringer and Vincent Cassel in a Bohemian Paris portrayed by the famous Thierry Arbogast. A little cult! It's a shame that the only version available on DVD is French and English. Directed by a controversial artist like Gilles Mimouni, could be considered a small homage to the masterpieces of the Cinema. It's a French movie, and like all of them, not for everyone, we could say a cinema d'essai. Even if it is not so widely publicized, it can be remembered for several reasons.
