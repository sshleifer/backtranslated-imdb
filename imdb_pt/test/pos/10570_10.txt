This TV adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel was so lovingly done that I can barely find the words to enjoy it. Not since "Tipping the Velvet" (also highly recommended) I saw a performance of these leading actresses, this time by Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy. They acted with their souls, and this is what reaches the public! The supporting actors were also well chosen, they made a great ensemble. <br /> <br /> For those who think that history is just about a lesbian relationship - no, this is just a part. The other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love. And the plot has a few more twists and turns. So the movie should be interesting to straight guys or guys like me too.
