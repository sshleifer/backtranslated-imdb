No, "Lifeforce" is not a great movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It is, however, a medium movie with some good effects and a compelling story (and of course, Mathilda May). It may actually be one of my favorite horror and science fiction films for the simple reason that they try to reason through the science of space vampires. How many times do you see this? Not even in "Alien" (the horror / science fiction movie of all time) science enters the story. In "Lifeforce" they are trying to create an irrational world. <br /> <br /> Now, I think it's a success? No. I think the film has the issue of a huge cast that Hooper is struggling to keep collected and on track and that viewers have to focus on more of a 'villain' and there are many road trips. <Br/> <br /> To be honest, the film is fun for the eyes and fun to watch. but there is great potential here for a top remake to seize what Hooper was trying to do and actually create a strong and scary SF / horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the remake happens, however, I demand that Mathilda have a special turnout.
