This movie enchanted me tonight. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterruptedly. John Voight, this cast of little-known black actresses and, above all, children, made it a worthy way to spend a Sunday night. How wonderful to see the early works of this experienced actor, as well as the excellent interpretation of Mad Billy by Paul Winfield. I do not see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is wrong in the role of superintendent. Who would they choose? The strident character actor, Charles Lane? Although his career is commendable, an actor like Lane would have cheapened the role. Cronyn was an excellent choice for the role. I will tell this movie as a real treasure to remember.
