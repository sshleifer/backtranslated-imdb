I had never heard of this Australian horror before the enthusiastic review of Michael Elliott; In fact, after reading, I decided to check if the DVD was available at my local rental company and it was (though a German edition ie without the R1 extras), so I opted to check out the movie right away. <br /> <br /> While I would not go so far to give you full marks ?? only a few selected titles take them away from me, let alone a dark and modern movie ?? I have to say that I was quite impressed with BLACK WATER. Instead of looking at previous crocodile films, such as ALLIGATOR (1980) and LAKE PLACID (1999), it evokes the memory of two who have seen a small group of people who travel, get lost and are at the mercy of the elements and creatures that inhabit the place? that is, LONG WEEKEND (1978), itself a little-seen but impressive Australian production, and OPEN WATER (2005). <br /> <br /> The compact and simple film involves a couple and the younger sister of the woman who decides to go fishing in a remote and forbidden part of the Australian desert, known as crocodile territory; very soon (actually, even before 15 minutes passed!), their boat is overturned and the guide is killed by an alligator ?? then our unlucky adventurers take refuge in a tree. Does the DVD reviewer think the movie suffers from spending too much time at this location? with the three discussing what they should do, attempts to retrieve the boat, looking for a way out of the forest through the trees (only to be found with nothing but water) and the occasional monster attack. However, I think the creators take the situation as much as possible without falling into boredom: this is due to palpable suspense and, as Michael said, the credibility of the characters (particularly the two women), but also the fact that the crocodile here makes one of the scariest and most memorable in recent memory (I wonder how they managed to "run")! <br /> <br /> I also agree with Mike that the movie contains some really effective shock moments ?? the alligator jumping out of the water to take a bite of the petrified heroes; her head suddenly emerging in front of the women as they are going to the boat; even if one of them reaches the vehicle, the monster manages to lift its enormous weight and get on the boat with it! in the end, when the same girl can find a weapon (on the mutilated body of her guide), she carries it and waits for the alligator to appear, the latter sneaks behind her (in fact, the creature is graced with the cunning of the shark in JAWS [1975]). With that in mind, the ending is as enjoyable as the crowd (albeit on an obviously smaller scale) like Spielberg's classic blockbuster ?? even if it has a pessimistic accompaniment. Another well defined is the sparse score of the movie? which is usually quite enjoyable, but becoming unnerving at the right times. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, BLACK WATER emerges as a breath of fresh air in the face of the demoralizing fall in which horror movies fell late; for this reason, deserves more exposure to remind us that there is still hope for our beloved genre (without the real need to resort to the device of a CLOVERFIELD [2008] to get attention) ??
