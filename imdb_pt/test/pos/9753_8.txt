Hunt for Justice is about setting up Slobadon Milosevic for his trial in The Hague. Although it was a little too clinical in the presentation, the subject could have got depressing very quickly. A Canadian judge, Louise Arbor, becomes the chief prosecutor for war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the UN in Yugoslavia. She fights with everyone to remove the evidence that sent Milosevic to trial. It is not a bad documentary with direction and production of class A. The 'evidence' was disturbing by the discussion of the facts, luckily they did not go into many details and nor real photos of the tortured ones.
