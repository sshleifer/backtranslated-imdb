Apparently, a film B ... B should represent Better acting and a better message than the big budget images "A" today. Modern films aimed at young women certainly are not designed to encourage depth of character over the superficial behavior of self-service ... or increase the self-esteem of girls who do not fit into "female" standards. (After all, criticizing the fake and flashy, as this movie does, will not help sell more products that depend on girls * * not being satisfied with their natural attributes or inner beauty). <br /> <br /> Laraine Day is kind of like a mechanically inclined brat who "leaps" into quarters and confesses an inability to flirt. She joins Robert Cummings because of similar interests, a shared sense of humor and his honesty, loyalty and good friendship, which he gradually values ​​about the superficial "charms" of his selfish glamorous sister (which only reveals his selfish tendencies and Laraine is also outwardly beautiful, it is refreshing to see the most prized inner beauty and representation of the true friendship that leads to the most satisfying romantic relationship.I wish the girls (and boys) were getting this kind of realistic message today . <br /> <br /> Maybe if Hollywood re-make "B" movies again with modest budgets, and try to settle for modest profits ... what am I saying? Sacrifice the mindset of great success to create something sincere on a smaller scale it would be like waiting for a guy to give up on the superficial hottie of a sweet girl who really cares about him.That's crazy talk. <br /> <br /> Please, somebody invent a time machine already! I belong to the 1940s. <br /> <br /> I would rate this movie higher, but the ending is a bit too abrupt, and perhaps it lacked enough indication of Robert Cummings' change of mind. (I like the fact that B movies are short and swift, not bloated and self-indulgent, but it may have taken more than 70 minutes.) I also found it a little unreal that a widow and small children were not so affected by film. sudden death in your family ... or be so forgiving of the one who caused it. I mean, I think it's * cool *, but a little more mourning or bitterness would have been natural. Perhaps a deliberate choice to make this family carefree about loss, to lessen the impact of tragedy and to ensure that * we * forgive those involved in death - since it is only a plot device, not the actual point of the film. Still strange though.
