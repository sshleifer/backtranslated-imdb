Irene Jacob is mesmerizing in this final stretch of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it manages to put all three films together. I simply admire the amount of talent needed to make one of these stories, let alone the three. Everything seems to fit so precisely, all the elements of cinema so eloquently executed, and the end result is much greater than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic by nature and belongs to any list of great cinematic achievements. Simply brilliant!
