Hey, this Ralf Westhoff seems to know a lot about people! We have nine women and nine men attending a speed dating event, each person has five minutes to talk to each of them. A good idea to make a movie of these conversations. And better yet: it works great! The dialogue is witty, original and authentic, each person is subtly characterized, without falling into the cliché trap, something that is uncommon for German films, remember: All these years, we Germans were plagued with silly comedies like "Workaholic" or " Stadtgespräch ". <br /> <br /> But now is the time for young German directors to do their own thing and run the risk of producing fun, funny, intelligent and sensitive films at the same time. The timing of the "Shoppen" is also good: although it mainly presents dialogues, it maintains the tension and the interest. After a while, you are curious to see how this man and woman would do. Some of the participants meet later for a two-some, it's fun to watch them interacting together in "real life". Of course, the movie has some drawbacks: it's not very cinematic (but can such a movie be?), The musical soundtrack could have been better, but all of that is just marginal. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie: We have some good actors here. Imagine this: they are all still quite unknown, even here in Germany (most were derived from the theater scene in Munich or Bavaria). But I predict that of the top 18 actors, at least 11 will be quickly known in film and TV here. It's great to see so many faces that are both fresh and talented at the same time. Well done! <br /> <br /> For those who want to read more, here is a summary of all 18 actors: (spoilers!) <br /> <br /> Sebastian Weber: The silent waters are deep! Memorize your monologue "Flower Garden", you can win any woman's heart with this. Anna Böger: A hell of a woman! Every time she opens her mouth, you can not help but laugh and feel good. Hear how she pronounces "asshole" and calls the pink shirt guy "Bürscherl"! <br /> <br /> Felix Hellmann: The "Bürscherl" from above is fun to see. The inconvenient truth is that there are a lot of these guys out there. His appearance reminded me a little Flo Weber of "Sportfreunde Stiller". <br /> Katharina Schubert: This woman has everything: love, hope, despair, beauty. His "you want kids" scene is a classic. A great actress of whom we will hear again, no doubt. <br /> <br /> David Baalcke: Now is this guy a loser or not? Almost as authentic as Paul Giamatti in "Sideways". I hope this is NOT a method of acting. <br /> <br /> Julia Koschitz: The "good looking" woman in the circle. Julia used to play theater in my hometown, congratulations! I think she will appear in many upcoming TV shows. <br /> Martin Butzke: The revolutionary guy catches the cutest, most conventional woman in the end. Would you like to share a taxi with this guy? <br /> <br /> Kathrin von Steinburg: She did an impressive performance on "Tatort" last year. His trance performance in this film is not less. SEE your beautiful face and hear your dirty laughter. The best scene in the movie belongs to her. <br /> <br /> Matthias Bundschuh: I know these "write everything" - back from school. I'm not sure if the hot blonde had her allergic reaction because of him or her cat. Matthias' portrait of such chicken is excellent. <br /> <br /> Mediha Cetin: My ex-girlfriend's sister-in-law was the same person as her. The day I met her was the only day of my life when I needed tranquilizers, bad memories here. <br /> Thomas Limpinsel: The "cool and desperate face" in the circle. Limpinsel has a comedic talent that is far better than most so-called "comedians" on TV. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wagner: The victim of Sebastian's "flower garden" metaphor. Lisa's face is funny and full of melancholy, her story made me feel good and sad at the same time, wow! <br /> <br /> Oliver Bürgin: The "good-looking" man in the circle. No wonder he picks up Julia at the end. These two really fit. I think it will appear in many TV series that will come. <br /> <br /> Julia Heinze: The "cute and conventional" woman. I hope she is not underestimated: Julia's face changes from naive to hurt to furious are great! <br /> <br /> Stephan Zinner: Partenkirchen's "nature boy" likes to cook, eat? and good sex. Watch the body language between him and the hot blonde! Zinner usually plays CSU Söder's politician on stage! <br /> <br /> Anja Klawun: The "bargain" has some good times, but, please, loses (like most actors) in playing a drunk on the screen. Br /> Christian Pfeil: plays the arrogant and narcissistic face. I did not believe that this same actor owns two art cinemas in Munich. <br /> <br /> Tanja Schleiff: plays the girl who sleeps with all the men around. I'm sure a lot of male visitors will chase after her. I've heard that she can also play dramatic roles, so I'm curious.
