This is one of my favorite movies. The performances of Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal are excellent and their performances combined with the music, scenery and reality of the film are very interesting. A look at a true, say it as it is, logger, mountain man who refuses to give up his way of life in the name of progress and development. The horses' music is very unique and adds a mysterious quality to some of the scenes. After seeing this movie for the first time, I had to go out and buy the video and the soundtrack. Overall, a quiet kind of movie with panic bursts. Both Torn and Cardinal are very credible in their roles. I put this movie in the same category as Winter People with Kurt Russell and Kelly McGillis, another favorite.
