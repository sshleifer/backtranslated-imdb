The Merchant of the Four Seasons is not what I would call a happy movie, or even one that struck me to the point of praising it to heaven. (There are other Fassbinder films for that, like Veronika Voss and Satan's underrated work.) Brew). But it is certainly no less than a fascinating experiment in taking a look at those in a society that you and I and others we know would possibly know, or really do not want to know. I imagine that in the early 70's in Germany a generation, coming out of WWII, had a stigma to live on but tried its best just to survive. This is a stigma that floats throughout the film, and in many cases in the work of Fassbinder in general, but especially because with Four Seasons he is eyeing the middle class, and in a private couple - the estranged, depressed, angry Hans seller of fruit and his long-suffering wife - this is nothing less than trying the realism disguised as melodrama. If Cassavetes was a crazy German, he could make this movie, maybe even as a joke. The story seems pretty simple, where Hans's drinking gets out of control, it hits the woman (this scene is one of the hardest to endure, maybe in any movie, the way the Fassbinder remains without a cut while his wife is left helpless and her daughter trying to stop him in her frenzy) and then she is ready to leave him. While he stays in the room, her family holds him back, she asks for a divorce, and he gets a heart attack right there. He recovers, his business suddenly begins to grow again with some help from some good (or not so good) employees - and yet this only continues his longing, for another woman, and his general despair. <br /> <br /> And yet it is in this simplicity that Fassbinder tries, and is able, most of the time, to reach a climate of dread, a tense vibration in the kitchen, in the bedroom or on the street, which you can cut with knife and bleed. The weaker part of all this may be the acting ... at least that was my initial impression. Hans, played by Hirschmuller, may be a blistered presence with only the slightest movement in his face and eyes, and for a while he does not seem to be a good actor. The actress who plays her wife, Sister Hermann, and her sister (Fassbinder Hanna Schygulla) do better, but only because they have more to do conventionally, such as crying or looking worried. It takes some time to adjust to what is essentially an emptiness in his subject Hans, something of his own psychological self-torment or self-pity that pervades himself and those around him who just want to follow with some sense of normality. , especially when Hans is successful. <br /> <br /> Not everything fits into the Merchant of Four Seasons, but enough has made me recommend it to those looking for a different slice of life than you can use for more modern American movies. Fassbinder's world here is a fight between the melodrama he loves in cinema and the hard and overwhelming sense of humanism that he personally feels and places in characters that, for good or ill, we identify in some way. Are Epps a family you know? Or could you even be them? Who's to say? It is a methodical study of the tragic emptiness in the human spirit, and its goals are all achieved.
