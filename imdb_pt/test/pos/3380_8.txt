I watched this movie the first night out of curiosity and pure nostalgia. I liked (did not love) "Mork & Mindy" as a child, especially for the energetic performance of Robin William. This movie reminded me why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a painting by chronological numbers recounting the show (which it somehow was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin's journey from the street fool at war to the national football star, and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long-suffering wife. And my hat is starring Chris Diamantopoulos as he portrayed Mr. Williams with integrity, sensitivity and heart; not just a cute print, even though she was dead. (On an unrelated note, I noticed that Robin's struggles were somehow similar to Andy Kaufman, who was underestimated by the TV network and contained creativity, but this is the "Taxi" behind the scenes of the biopic.) < etc. In short, this was a very nice film, in which I felt that I got to know a little more of the man behind the Orkan. The performance was solid by everyone - never melodramatic as I suspected - and the story was progressing well. The performances that were particularly good were those who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene in which Belushi confronts Robin was a joke!). Not a great masterpiece by any means (I would have liked to have seen a little more about Pam Dawber), but definitely watchable, especially for those fans of Robin Williams and "Mork & Mindy" out there. Nanoo, nanoo!
