Recently, I received this film on DVD as a gift and at first I was not sure if it would be attractive (although one of my favorite actors has a leading role). In fact, it's on its way to becoming a favorite. <br /> <br /> First of all: fortunately, it's not the same as the book, the end of which I think is overly melodramatic. Second: It's one of the best movies I've ever seen about World War I. "What?" you can ask. "It's not a war movie!" Truth: we do not see battles or bombings, trenches, or gasoline. But this shows the cost of the war, the damage done to the lives of the men who fought in it, and the impact it has had on the people close to them. <br /> <br /> We saw Helen for the first time (Sarah Miles), the widow of a baron, awaiting his release from a psychiatric hospital. All the women in the film seem to be widows: some from the war, but Helen's much older husband, Sir Thomas (we see him later in a picture) fell ill and died while she was at a party, hence her fault. collapse hit. She is lost and lonely. The wire around the hospital grounds evokes prisoner-of-war camps and trenches: Like many of the men in the outside world, Helen is suffering from a kind of shock. Outside the hospital, she has to find her feet in the outside world again: a world we experience through her bleak, desolate and hostile eyes. Your mother is not able to give you any real support. She herself a widow, she placed her own emotional defenses behind which she hides to avoid dealing with her daughter's suffering. (Like many people, especially at that time, she seems to find the mental illness embarrassing.) Ledbetter, the hired driver, becomes a presence of support and helps Helen begin to adapt to life again , but she does not realize that he is becoming dangerously obsessed with her. This is an excellent performance by Robert Shaw. Ledbetter is a regular ex-soldier, a former sergeant who runs a boxing club and set up his own car rental business. Superficially, he looks strong and strong, trustworthy, but there are cracks below the surface: he did not really conform to civilian life. He invents (for reasons he later explains) a family and family life he does not own; he has brutal blasts with colleagues and unloving sex. Get close to Helen? a woman who, even with the greatest social freedom of the post-war era, could not realistically have expected to marry? it exposes psychological failures that destroy it. Nowadays, PTSD can be diagnosed. <br /> <br /> The same goes for the other man in Helen's life, aspiring politician Captain Hugh Cantrip (Peter Egan). He is ambitious, handsome, but also very young. His girlfriend, Connie (Caroline Mortimer), is said to be his mother, combing his hair and making sure he has a clean handkerchief before leaving. He is known to Ledbetter and Helen: the first served under him during the war, and Helen had met him in political circles and found him a "parrot." However, he and Helen now begin a relationship, with Helen intending to support his career politically, financially and emotionally. Peter Egan, fresh from his stage success as Stanhope in R C Sheriff's "Journey's End," makes Hugh more than an immature idiot. There is a revealing and understated scene in the back of the car between Helen and Hugh, in which they quote "The Old Vicarage at Grantchester" by Brooke. She asks about her war experience: "Was it really bad?" He can not answer. She says, "Well, you're back now." But your soft-spoken response? "I am? Sometimes I wonder?" ??? is the key to your character. As light and shadow glisten in his face, we know that there are some horrors that can not be expressed in words. The disproportionate casualties suffered by junior officers of their kind? Straight out of school or university and expect to lead from the front? are well known. In a nervous speech (during which Helen reassures him) to the local political people at a dinner party, he reveals that he will be an Independent, no longer as a Liberal (the party that led the country to war). His emotional life is as bad as Ledbetter's. He can not easily free himself from Connie, who depends on him emotionally and financially: reading between the lines, she is probably a war widow (maybe an ex-comrade?) With a child whose drawings we see on the wall of her house. *** SPOILERS *** The crisis between the trio builds slowly, with a scary scene between Helen and Ledbetter in the car, and Ledbetter listening to Hugh and Connie when he is driving them, while Hugh tries to persuade Connie that, even if his relationship with Helen develops, they can continue theirs; that he will at least continue to support it. Jealousy, obsession and his belief that he must protect Helen from a misleading gold probe Ledbetter to confront her and Hugh violently in his home. <br /> <br /> The ending is totally different from the novel, and it's better for that: it's dramatic, but less melodramatic, and retains a non-sentimental tone. We begin with a character recovering from a mental collapse; we end up with another suffering. Helen, one of the senses, is now wiser and stronger than the two men, who have been unable to fully adapt to the so-called "land of heroes" to which they have returned from the nightmare of total war. The new ending is open: it feels like it, at least, will deal with whatever is ahead, no illusions. In this, it reflects well the reality of time, in which women (Helen, Connie, and so many others) had to pick up pieces from a world where many men had died or had come home with varying degrees of mental and physical damage. <br /> <br /> "Well, you're back now." ??? "I am? Sometimes I wonder?"
