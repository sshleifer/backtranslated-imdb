I have no idea why everyone hates this movie to call this a garbage trash. An unacceptable sequel is just unfair. I mean what else could they have done for a sequel then. Because seriously I think I should have had a sequel (Rodney Dangerfield) says: Hey everyone was going to have sex and then a little goffer dance and that's the end of Caddyshack even though the movie rating at first was ( R) and the second was (PG) was still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
