Florence Vidor stars as the daughter of a strict father of the Bible who throws her out of the house when gossip blurs her name. In the big city, she meets her own brother's dying wife (the two are secretly married) and rears her son by herself. Years later, she returns home to confront her family. <br /> <br /> This old melodrama is strongly adorned with fascinating feminist themes (circa 1921, but sounding remarkably modern). Part of it is laid with a trowel (like the father, Theodore Roberts gives the eyebrows a real exercise), but is well assembled dramatically and lovingly composed and filmed by director of photography Henry Sharp.
