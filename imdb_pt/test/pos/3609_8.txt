Warning: If the Coen Brothers or David Lynch defines their liking for the film, disregard this criticism and move on. <br /> <br /> Yes, I borrowed the "one-line summary" from the book about President Ronald Reagan, but, among other virtues, this film emphasizes the role the character plays in the lives of honest human beings. This movie is full of honest and decent people, and they have plenty of integrity. In a word, they have "character." <br /> <br /> A small detail: Unless you know the history of World War II, you probably do not know this, since the arrival of Captain Correlli on the island until the fall of Mussolini, 3 and a half years have passed . The average viewer might think the novel was a "whirlwind" type. This is not true. The novel develops slowly, which gives it dignity and meaning. The deliberate pace of the film may be the director's way of timing. <br /> <br /> Some critics criticized Cage's Italian accent. The Italian-speaking members of my family assure me that their accent is very good. <br /> <br /> The story was right on the mark. Yes, the Germans turned against their Italian allies, who for the most part were reluctant allies from the beginning. If you find this shocking, keep in mind that the French Mediterranean fleet was blown up by the British in 1940, shortly after the capitulation of France, not to fall into the hands of the Vichy government, or worse, the Nazis. <br /> <br /> The depiction of Italians as educated and educated was a compliment to an educated and educated civilization. <br /> <br /> This film was beautifully photographed, and its history was lyrical. The script was neither thought-provoking nor intelligent, but there was a situation where confusion and cleverness were not necessary or appropriate. <br /> <br /> The story is tender and the message is uplifting. The characters are honest, brave, sincere, friendly and friendly. It's a cool little movie. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
