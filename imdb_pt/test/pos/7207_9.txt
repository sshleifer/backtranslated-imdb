For those who do not know, Asterix's books are a huge series of comic strips about a village of indomitable Gauls who resist Caesar's invasion thanks to a magic potion that makes them invulnerable supermen. There were several animations (only one of them, The Twelve Tasks of Asterix actually capturing the wit and spirit of the books, despite being an original screen story) before a perfect Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardieu take on the lead roles in two live action adaptations which proved to be colossally successful across Europe, but did not make any impression on the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> The uncut French version is a lot of fun, but unfortunately it does not seem to be available in an English captioned version off of the UK DVD. While there is still no sign of a DVD or a US movie release, the Miramax version of Asterix et Obelix: Cleopatra's Mission is also on the DVD (and has already played on UK TV), and you will never guess edited (at least 21 minutes past) and dubbed English. Maybe Harve was mistaken for a Hong Kong movie - after all, he never saw a foreign film that he thought could not be improved by heavy re-editing and shelving for a few years. <br /> <br /> Asterix and Obelix Contre Cesar was affectionately nicknamed for English from a particularly good translation script done by Terry Jones, but, on the other hand, left unchanged, this kind of thing is not really the style of Miramax. The results are not good. The film was the best attempt to get the mixture of slapstick books, anachronisms and classic humorous beyond the canvas, but many of the classic references have disappeared (such as the great visor of Medusa or the references of Cyrano de Bergerac). Depardieu) next to anything that looks too French or can slow down the image, with the result that the first 20 minutes are now a real task. Several lines of sequences are missing, Depardieu's part was cut (his part was already quite small because of his serious health problems during filming: the American version was partially digitally reclassified to change the sickly pallor of his face in the original! ) and, as always, with dubbing, because literal translations into English do not fit correctly, the lines are too hasty, or the dialogue has been completely altered (some of these changes are admittedly funny, like a character dreaming of a world in which he could move his lips in French and hear the words in English.) <br /> <br /> It's not a total disaster, but very disappointing considering how good the full version is. It would be good to think that Miramax would make a Shaolin Soccer and would release both versions, but since they filed the two films for two years since they paid $ 45 million for them (another classic case of Harvey's famous buyer's remorse: , Disney's wonder was so bad on its overspending) and yet it has no launch plan, which can just be very wishful thinking. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that such an accessible and entertaining movie will now only be available to people who do not speak French in an awkward version. It seems that the brave Gauls may have been able to defeat Caesar's legions, but they are no match for the Miramax boot.
