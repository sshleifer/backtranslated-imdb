I recommend idiocracy to everyone. Luke Wilson is very funny, the movie is insightful and made me laugh so hard that I had tears streaming down my face several times. Until the end, when I took a deep breath and realized how close we are to Mr Judge's vision of tomorrow. Keep an eye out for a special guest appearance from Mac commercials (Justin Long) as Dr. Lexus. I found his performance worthy of the Oscars, especially considering that the Oscar was delivered in the recent past ... besides, he's cute. <br /> <br /> In short, Idiocracy is a fatal glimpse of a possible future. where people get product brand names (the name of the president is Mountain Dew), hospital visits cost $ 5 billion, there are mountains of garbage because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it and nobody cares nothing but money. All because only stupid people are creating. Sounds familiar to me, somehow. Oh yeah; that's what I think when I see professional wrestling ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, watch this movie. It's a good laugh and it'll make you think.
