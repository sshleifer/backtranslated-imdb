This is the episode that most probably relates to the partner's law, "Thou Shalt Not Kill," in that it brings directly the ever-controversial issue, "Why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing is wrong?" This issue is presented in two parts within the episode: before the murder, when the film shows the dichotomy between the promising idealist lawyer and the street thug so involved that his life is merely a representation of what he is. supposedly, followed by the period after the trial and before the execution, when both are led to suffer for the deaths for which they feel responsible and therefore share. <br /> <br /> One of the great things about the way these episode work is in both the small and the big ways in which the story is developed, so we understand the motivations and stories of characters that we can only spend a little less than an hour. Despite all his criminal intentions and scorn, the killer is still very nice, revolving the most important part of his actions around a story of accidental death. His way of killing is more a desire to control death than any desire to actually destroy. Likewise, the lawyer's idealistic naivete shows that someone is not willing to allow death to happen in a world where he can not control it. Your meeting is, in fact, important; both have to give way while they do not propagate it. <br /> <br /> As an aside, it's interesting how much this episode affects the viewing of Rouge, the later completion of the Kieslowski Trois Colors trilogy. One of Kieslowski's greatest influences seems to be the idea of ​​justice, and since the Decalogue is a meditation on something that represents Divine Justice, it seems almost self-conscious. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
