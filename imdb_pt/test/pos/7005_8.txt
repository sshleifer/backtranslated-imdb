The opening scene of this movie is incredible. I saw a number of science fiction films with great special effects, but my roommate and I looked at each other after the opening sequence and he clearly said, "sensory overload." The plot of the film is quite simple, but the interesting thing about this science fiction movie is that it allows the audience to discover most of the technology instead of wasting time to "subtly" explain it. The creatures in this movie are also very interesting. You do not take a good look at them until about two-thirds of the way. Overall a very fun movie.
