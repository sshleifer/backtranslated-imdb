Michael Haneke is known for his disturbing films like "Funny Games". This time he adopted Elfriede Jelineks "Die Klavierspielerin", which is probably her best work so far. Jelinek always writes about abusive behavior in families and especially about the suppression of women in a patriarchal society. <br /> <br /> Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) works as a piano teacher at the Consevatory in Vienna. She still lives with her mother (Annie Giradot), they even sleep in the same bed (already a suggestion of something strange). Erika intimidates her students in the same way that she is intimidated by her mother and secretly watches pornographic movies and plays sadomasochistic games with herself. A student, Walter (Benoit Magimel), falls in love with her, but she refuses to simply sleep with him. She wants to play her games with him, but he's angry. He reluctantly follows his rules, which means a disaster for both of them. <br /> <br /> Haneke has a very clear picture language, everything is filmed in an almost Spartan way, so the complex characters and story are improved. <BR> <BR> <BR> People who do not know Austria very well may not realize how essential the setting for the story is. Jelinek (as well as other great Austrian writers like Thomas Bernhard) suffers with the coldness and descontraci√≥n of the families and of the Austrian society. The Austrians (at least the Viennese) are often unable to articulate their pains, desires, they suppress their emotions, so often there is no true love, affection and closeness in their families. In a society where it is more important to show a perfect facade for society (even if it means protecting crimes within families as Erika and her mother protect Erika's violation of Walters to avoid scandal) than dealing with their emotional problems, probably not. I wonder if Sigmund Freud founded psychoanalysis in Vienna. Erika has a cold and distant relationship with her mother, they only the time they share some emotions is very violent and not at all love. Erika replaces her hidden emotions with desires of violence, so she can finally release some feelings. But she has no one who really wants to talk about her emotions, so in the end she has to stab herself to relieve her inner pain. Isabelle Huppert shows her best performance in her career (as well as most others). actresses). With a face that does not smile often you see only a hint of emotion in the face, a quick smile, a look with the eyes. And in the end, his pain is masterfully exhibited without a single tear. <br /> <br /> Benoit Magimel and Annie Giradot also feature powerful performances, but the film belongs to Huppert.
