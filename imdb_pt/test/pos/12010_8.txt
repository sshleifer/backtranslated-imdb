I was surprised when I watched this movie, how much it 'got' me. No, the actors did not act like typical 'Hollywood' actors, but this is not always bad, as the movie proves. Quite different from the Disney standard, it's a turnaround nonetheless! They also give you a taste of what was probably uninspired. A movie that everyone should see and enjoy. Many people love to argue about 'precisions' in any such film, but only the basic idea has much to offer. Light complaint; East and West Germany, seen on any map, would have West Germany on the left, east of the right. The film sometimes leaves it slightly behind because about half of the scenes have West Germany on the right side of the screen, and sometimes on the left side. Even during the same events, they move back and forth. Perhaps, just a little more consistency, would have avoided this slight distraction. Go and see!
