"Rush in Rio" is undoubtedly one of the most exciting DVDs I've ever bought. Although I've been a braggart fan of nearly 20 years, I found that performance flawless. The music is heavy and sharp (which sounds good on any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the crowd has a constant smile ... it's like they can capture all the shows I've ever been to. For any Rush fan, this DVD is required; at the most, only to see the documentary "Boys in Brazil" (which reveals the trips of this rather isolated and personal band). For any non-Rush fan, this DVD is a nice concert. Rush fans know the talent of these three Canadians. We've been holding them steady for years. I've shown this DVD (or parts of it anyway) to those who have never heard of Rush, or those who think Rush is less than good because they do not appeal to the pessimistic rock masses (ie, sex, drugs , and a drunken frenzy). The bottom line is this DVD is worth every penny and more than it's worth the time to view it.
