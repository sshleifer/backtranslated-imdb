I would like to say that I loved Campfire Tales! For me, it was one of the original horror films with a distorted ending. As if the content of the movie was not scary or strange enough, you have the ending. It's a very amazing movie and I'm so happy it's being released on DVD on August 30th. I will not hesitate to take my copy that day. I do not think the film received all the credit or recognition it should have, because all those other films came out shortly after and it was recognized, but if it were not for my brother telling me about the movie, I would not know. That stinks because in my opinion it's way better than any "Scream", "I know what you did last summer," or any other horror for that time. So I hope you are able to see the movie on your own and at least be able to see the difference. I loved it, and being a horror movie addict, Campfire Tales was like dessert for me!
