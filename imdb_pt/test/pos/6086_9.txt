It's a strangely powerful and exciting experience to see "The English Patient" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of your body of work is dedicated to a breaking point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk in a very fine line. In "The Talented Mr Ripley," Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amorous Tom Ripley to make the killer aware. In "Breaking And Entering," Minghella gives the character of Jude Law the need to confess and the rewards are moving frighteningly. Here, in "The English Patient," passionate characters are never far from their guilty feelings. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They take their characters out of any pretense into a convincing complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is simply spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a sensual innocence "Minghelliana". Anthony Minghella gave us movies that were, in one way or another, that indescribable mixture of art and commerce. He was true to himself, but he thought of his audience. He knew how to squeeze our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and surprising about Minghella's work. I miss him already, but I am grateful for the reflection of his soul that he left behind.
