I just saw it for the first time in 10 or 15 years ... maybe close to 20. In some ways, it was better than I remembered ... in others, it was MUCH worse. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is music. It's just awful. There are only 5 songs in the movie, most of them used more than once. The opening music is shouted by a chorus of annoying children, and the title track-y disc is performed by Rick Dees. It does not get any worse than that. Even the background music is terrible, with much of it repeating the themes of other nauseating songs. We also get a really lame clown, especially in opening credits. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Bill Murray is brilliant as usual ... you have to wonder if he improvised the whole thing. , or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines. Or maybe he's just that big - turning a weak script into comic genius. The best part is your surreal PA ads. ("Crayfish ... get out of here ... you're a threat!") <br /> <br /> You also have a lot more character development than you have the right to expect in a movie like that. At least half of the characters look like real people ... and especially real people you'd like to have around. Even "Spaz" can do more than any other Eddie Deezen character, and when he gets the girl, it's plausible. (She's not absurdly sexy, but he does not automatically associate with one of the nerdy girls - see "Revenge Of The Nerds" as examples of both cinematic phenomena.) <br /> <br /> And when the plot seems cliché ... well, you must wonder if it was still not a cliché when they did it. Although it was not the first summer camp film, you should go back at least to "The Parent Trap" - it's certainly the film that made it its own genre. In fact, I was surprised there was no Talent scene ... "Wet Hot American Summer" imitated the summer camp genre so perfectly, I just assumed everything came straight from the meatballs. (I also sort of expected Jon Cryer to show up in a convertible with a chimp, thanks to the epic "Monk Academy" parody of Mr. Show's olympiad) <br /> <br /> Anyway, this one seems to be disappearing a little until the late 70's / early 80's comedies, it's no longer a cable clamp, and it certainly does not have the cult of Caddyshack or Animal House. I was pleased to see you on Showtime today - and in high definition! Of course, it's pretty bad on some points, but you can do a lot worse in a teenage comedy from the 70s / 80s. And again, Murray is a genius.
