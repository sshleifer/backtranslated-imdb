Black Rain, by Shohei Imamaura, was released in 1989, early in the AIDS epidemic, a fact that gives the film about the slow deterioration of Hiroshima radiation victims an additional pungency. The black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash, radioactive fallout and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion. There were other books and movies about the launch of the atomic bomb, but none as unique and powerful as this. Based on a novel by Masuji Ibuse, which gathered information from interviews and diaries of real life bomb victims, the film shows how a whole family is psychologically and physically affected by the bombing years after the original explosion. It is a horrible sight, but it resonates with deep compassion for humanity. <br /> <br /> The film begins in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, when soldiers and civilians perform their normal daily activities. Suddenly, a blinding light flashes and a thunderous explosion is heard. Almost every building is destroyed or damaged beyond repair. The first atomic bomb that fell in a city is now part of history. Survivors must somehow restart their lives, unaware that the devastating effects of the bomb are devastating. Filmed in high contrast black and white, the story revolves around Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka), a young woman caught in the radioactive rain as her boat returns to the city in search of friends and relatives. In Hiroshima, Imamura shows us indelible images that remain with us: a boy with skin hanging from his body asks his brother to recognize him, an older man is in tears because of his inability to free his son from piles of debris, a mother. is tormented as she swings her son's blackened body. <br /> <br /> When the family returns to their rural home, Yasuko's life is changed forever. She sees her friends dying around her and waits for the inevitable crises of radiation illnesses that have already affected her uncle Shigematsu Shimuza (Kazuo Kitamura) and Aunt Shigeko Shimuza (Etsuko Ichihara). Pretending there is only business as usual, the family denies that the bomb has affected Yasuko. "She forgot how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed, everyone forgot, they forget the hellfire and go to rallies like an annual festival," says a friend Katayama (Akiji Kobayashi). Yasuko internalizes the tragedy, feeling ashamed to be different from others and guilty of being contaminated. <br /> <br /> When aunt and uncle try to find a husband for her, eligible men refuse to marry her because of suspicions about her. Shigematsu copied her diary to prove she was not directly exposed to the bomb. The only suitor with whom he feels at ease is another injured man, Yuichi (Keisuke Ishida), who has a panic attack every time he hears the roar of an engine. In the end, the beauty of life always shows itself so fleetingly when Yasuko goes to the lagoon and sees a vision she longs for all her life, the king carp jumping in the water, playing as if to say that beyond despair there is still joy. Unfortunately, we heard in the radio statements of politicians about the use of the bomb once again in the Korean War. "Humans learn nothing," says Shigematsu. "They are strangled. Unjust peace is better than a war of justice. Why can not they see?" Hopefully the Black Rain of Immamura has allowed all of us to see more clearly.
