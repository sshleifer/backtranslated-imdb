Completely worth checking out. I saw it on the MLK 2006 anniversary and it hit me big time. Sometimes it seems like we're all in a trap and we're doomed to repeat the past, no matter how hard we try to change. All we can do is keep talking and talking. Just keep going. I do not want to be discouraging, because that's not the point, but maybe we have to go down before we see how much we need to work on ourselves. What happens when we keep being informed by the best people like MLK what needs to happen to get us out of our "dead end", but we do not hear. I know some of us listen, but how can we make the rest of the world see things as they really are? Just go on, I guess. This movie made me think even more about all this, so I think he did what he set out to do. This is what I consider to be a good movie or piece or book or poem or speech or anything: something that makes you think and draws attention to moving in an active direction instead of standing still, bored and hopeless .
