I read some reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as previous versions of the Karate Kid. Although my favorite is still the Karate Kid II, I felt that this fourth part of the movie series was consistent with the others and had some important lessons to share. Unlike previous versions, the karate student is a teenager who adopts a slightly different learning path rather than a male adolescent. Maggi finds this a bit more challenging, but rises to the occasion. The plot twists are believable and predictable. I have discovered that bandits are somewhat one-dimensional, but this weakness is present in every plot to varying degrees. The work of the camera is impressive and it crosses some beautiful landscapes from time to time. The Zen monastery is both austere and charming. The Zen monks add a bit of humor and lightness to the narrative flow. I liked the scenes of "Zen Bowling," which are a humorous counterpoint to the more serious archery scene at the beginning. The quality level of the film is like a good TV series. The song chosen for the background is very good, especially with the Little River Band playing "Listen to Your Heart". The lessons of the film are valuable and valuable to learn. They feel loyal to the spirit of karate and take care not to overdo the fight. All in all, I enjoyed it.
