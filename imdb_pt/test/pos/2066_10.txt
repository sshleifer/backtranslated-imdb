Definitely a movie for people who just ask to entertain themselves and who do not think too much about their movies. <br /> <br /> Lots of action, lots of great dialogue (eg, fun to name), a bit of intrigue and things exploding all over the place. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had a great chemistry. Violent, but not bloody. The fact that the female part has been the competent action leader is a nice turnaround. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoyed it enough to put it back in my favorite movies. 3 or 4 months. I initially rented the film because Samuel L Jackson was in the movie, but I got caught up in the events surrounding Samantha's quest to regain her memory and never looked back. <br /> <br /> Everything you have out there - suspend disbelief at once, take yourself a little less seriously - you can really have fun!
