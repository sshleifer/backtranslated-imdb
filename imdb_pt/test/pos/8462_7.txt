I watched this movie when it came out and then a few more years later. I'm watching now 20 years later and it's still a very good story. Does this cause a "lifelong cinematographic network"? Yes, but unfortunately life did not exist at that time, so it was necessary for someone to be on the air. <br /> <br /> The cast was excellent. The story was a bit schmaltzy; two women become intimate friends and, unbeknownst to a friend, he is having an affair with the other husband of friends. She is invited to dinner at home and discovers that her lover is the husband of her best friend. She is horrified and tries to interrupt the case. Shortly afterwards, he is tragically killed in a car accident that is being outdated for the two women. Of course the wife accidentally discovers this case and wants Holly to get out of her life now, but their friendship is able to prevail because they need each other. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good story, great cast and perfomances. I really liked that.
