There is all this theory of horror that some people adhere closely to the fact that monsters and violence should be kept off the screen. Park Chan-Wook throws this concept completely out the window and directly shows what he wants - and what he wants to show is just about anything he can think of. Leaving him to the actors and the dialogue to create subtlety, Park Park seems willing to do almost anything to show his point of view. Whether it involves long scenes set with the camera rotating around a mah-jong table or entire weeks confined to a single scene between two other scenes, dialoguing with scenes before and after bleeding over them, Park does not maintain a style specifically structured but more focused on telling the whole story of a couple's relationship, from virginal removal to total codependency, to total self-destruction - and uses vampirism as the link and priesthood of drama. It's so simple and complex at the same time. <br /> <br /> You have to give credit to it. Many people are ready to compare any modern vampire movie to Twilight, with Twilight almost always being the least of the works, but here the stories are really comparable, but this is more crude and honest. None of this shines through the window at night to talk bullshit, but anything ranging from the dirtiest, most desperate and virginal sex scene to partner abuse while the two clues begin to compete for power over each other. It's the same deal - guy and girl meet, girl discovers that guy is a vampire, decides to join him anyway, but no happy forever, only a limited time while they become forced to stay closer and closer and run out of options. The girl's motives are particularly interesting when someone desperately wants power and attention, a flaw, frustrated by the guy who just wants to live a good life in the best possible way under the circumstances, but is a hypocrite who can not admit that he is just using his vampirism as an excuse to act against their moral training. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect and tends to stretch (there are not three acts, five acts or any structure of act here, only scene after scene of character building and dysfunctional romance), but what is Great thing about it is that Park Chan-Wook is willing to show it all with frankness and honesty, while delighting the horror sensibilities of tension and blood. It also provides a cleverly chosen soundtrack to reach the emotional high notes in a very effective way as well. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
