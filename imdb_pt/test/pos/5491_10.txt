I've seen some action thrillers in my life and this is clearly one of the best ever! There are very few movies that I even consider watching several times and this is one of them. Everything in this movie is just right: Clint as the superb lead actor, Rene Russo as his non-stupid female partner (this is a very rare combination - sad but true!). Of course John Malkowich deserves a lot of praise for his great villain, but let's not forget Eastwood's early friend, played by Dylan Mcdermott, who in my opinion fits the role perfectly. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic - but unfortunately it was never released. an original soundtrack CD (producers' shame!). The plot makes sense and there is no loss of pace, the audience is kept in constant excitement of the outcome of the duel between Eastwood and Malkowich. I give this 10 stars!
