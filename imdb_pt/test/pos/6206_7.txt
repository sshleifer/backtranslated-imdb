A real soap opera here as Spencer Tracy addresses the role of illiterate until the age of 20. He marries the woman who teaches him and his ambition and motivation leads him to success. <br /> <br /> Success, but not happiness here. A n'er-do-well and a hesitant marriage lead to disaster and tragedy. Tracy buys a railroad and can only undergo a disastrous railway strike and the death of 406 workers. <br /> <br /> The movie appeared at first to be uneven but is rejuvenated thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks here. <br /> <br /> A double suicide separated here. We know that wealth can not buy happiness, but that is a bit exaggerated. However, we have fascinating performances by Tracy and Colleen Moore. Vinson, as the second wife, is also quite effective.
