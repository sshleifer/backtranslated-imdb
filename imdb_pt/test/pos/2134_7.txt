This great movie never appeared in my city, so in fact I did not have the opportunity to watch it until the late 80's when I saw it on German television. I was expecting something out of a disaster, and I found a great western with great location work. The tiny tube could not really damage it and there is hardly a moment of boredom in this 4 hour movie, so hope to see you again on the big screen. What a sight that would be! Do not miss it if you have the chance. Sadly, the harsh treatment of "Heaven's Gate" at its opening ruined Michael Cimino's career and he went from passable ("Year of the Dragon") to the absurdly boring ("The Sicilian") and to the brutal mute ("Desperate Hours" ).
