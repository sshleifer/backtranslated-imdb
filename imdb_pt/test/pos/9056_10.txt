I usually avoid movie festivals and I do not like stick-top comedy, but I must say that this picture was great. I immediately recognized David Krumholtz from the TV show "Numbers" and Lorraine Bracco, Roseanne Arquette and Karen Black were at their best. This is comedy on an incredibly high level with visual, spoken, and satirical interludes that kept the audience, and me, laughing along a rather ingrained tangle. Congratulations to Mr. Parness for dealing with a delicate, but real, subject in a way that can be enjoyed, but totally absorbed by his audience on all levels of the intellect. The plot remains intact throughout the film and the comic relief raises the message without being put in so thick as to distort. The segways mix is ​​done beautifully and the overall product is wonderfully tasteful. <br /> <br /> I can definitely say that this movie is a movie that will go a long way and should be seen by audiences of all ages; the problem is real and the same is the powerful impact of this production.
