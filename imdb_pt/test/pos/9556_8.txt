"Best in Show" is an often hilarious documentary that takes us to the world of dog shows and some dog owners preparing for the event. The only thing that separates this movie from the actual dog shows is that the dogs in "Best in Show" act more are than their owners! Funny things from a first-rate cast that includes Eugene Levy (who co-wrote the film), Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch and Christopher Guest (who co-wrote with Levy and directed) . They're all funny, but Fred Willard steals the film with his explosively funny performance as the dog show announcer who says the most scandalous things. Also, dogs are cute too. "Best in Show" is not exactly the laugh I expected but there are laughs and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> *** (of four)
