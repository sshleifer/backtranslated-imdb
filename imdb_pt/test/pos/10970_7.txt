1959 was a landmark in the world of cinema. Several great directors of the classic era were launching career classics that were among the best. Just take a look at the instructional titles, Hitchcock's North By Northwest, Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot, Rio Hawks, Howard Hawks, Imitation of Life, by Douglas Sirk. Join a couple from the previous year, Orson Welles' Touch of Evil, Hitch's Vertigo and Nick Ray's Wind Across the Everglades, and you'll get a good rundown of what was possible within the classic Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> At the same time, two films appeared that suggested a totally new way of making movies. One was Breathless by Jean-Luc Godard, the other was John Cassavetes Shadows. The two films had certain things in common, largely improvised, acting for non-stars, portable cameras, low budgets, and a certain youthful, jazzy elegance. In a way, however, they could not be further apart. Godard still believed in the director as a style referee. He knew more about cinema than most Hollywood producers, and Breathless was filled with the iconography of the classic crime film. Cassavetes, on the other hand, was an actor and a refugee from New York's underground theater. His first film shows him unimpressed with the cinema and a great believer in actors. Godard's film constantly refers to his own artifice, while the Shadows aims at a certain kind of naturalism. <br /> <br /> It does not reach him, mainly because naturalism is a myth, particularly in cinema. But it looks powerful, kinetic, but rhythmic like the cool jazz in the score, certainly the main inspiration for the style of filming on display here. Ultimately, it does not hold, mainly because the actors of Cassavetes here are amateur beatniks, where the Cassavetes style requires strong and imaginative actors. His later works with Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazarra and Peter Falk take it out of the water. Due to the director's technical inexperience, some dialogues had to be reduced later, which negates the freshness of improvisation. It is still fascinating to watch, both for the great moments (like the scene in which Leila Goldoni talks about her disappointment with the loss of her virginity) and to watch an innovative artist finding her way.
