I blow hot and cold on Carnage. It really can be a riddle to me. I think maybe your inspiration left you a little earlier than to other directors of your generation. Certainly, a man who reached maturity in the 1930s with the Popular Front seems uncomfortable in France in the 1950s with his unbridled commercialism and heavy American influence. He is almost thirty years older than his young stars, and it shows. The party scenes last much longer than they should have, as if he's been trying to buy time for the anemic scenario to work. Roland Lesaffre's character - he plays Pascale Petit's older brother - seems to exist only to reassure the director that his old-style ideas are still good. <br /> <br /> At two o'clock this picture is too long. Still, let me praise Pascale Petit for his performance in the game; she was a natural person who should have challenged Brigitte Bardot for sexual supremacy, but somehow got lost. Andrea Parisy is also excellent as the girl who gets pregnant and wants Charrier to marry her and make her baby legitimate (yes, they still thought so in the 50's). Laurent Terzieff is the only French actor who could play an anarchist convincingly: he is great here, rescuing a cat from death, and then notes that it does not support cats. Jacques Charrier only reminds me how mediocre he was as an actor, with that constant smile and those empty eyes.
