A photographer from the small town of Gunsan, South Korea, discovers he has a terminal illness but underestimates the seriousness of his family and friends. We never discovered the nature of the disease, but the main focus of Hur Jin-ho's first poignant movie, Christmas, in August, is not his illness. It is the grace in which he leads his life - his ability to accept what life has kept without remorse. Unfortunately, it was the last film filmed by filmmaker Yoo Young-kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. <br /> <br /> The photographer, Jung-won, is played by Han Suk-kyu, at the same time, Korea's most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with a contagious laugh, he is so hot and full of vitality that it is difficult to imagine him approaching the end of life. Jung-won owns a small photo shop and lives at home with his father (Goo Shin) and his sister (Oh Ji-hye), teaching his father to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he died While Jung-won takes care of day-to-day business in order, Dar-im (Shim Eun-ha), a meter reader, enters his shop with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. <BR> Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain, but then apologizes and she becomes a regular client. Without explicit expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops an increasing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their basis, the place from which they come. To protect Dar-im from suffering, Jung-won does not tell her that he has little time to live, but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably, her growing absence from the store makes her feel betrayed and frustrated to the point of throwing a stone through the store window. Although Jung-won's decision to retain her Dar-im disease is questionable, she seems organic to her character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "live life to the fullest." Playing around. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving sequences in the film is when an old woman returns to her studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung-won makes sure that the image is an exact resemblance, knowing that soon he will be taking away his own image of remembrance. August's Christmas is an unpretentious movie that never resorts to melodrama to show its point of view. It is to take pleasure in common moments: to ride a bicycle, to share a joke, to eat ice cream, to be attentive and considerate and to feel good about what life has to offer. It's a love story where love means having to say you're sorry. Although there have been many films about the dying process, Christmas in August drives the genre in a new direction and in the process offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this movie about death is an experience of the greatest joy.
