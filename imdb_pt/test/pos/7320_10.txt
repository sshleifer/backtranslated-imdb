This is the third short Three Stooges that the team has ever done, and like many of their first, this is absolutely and utterly hysterical! Now, owning it on DVD as part of the Three Stooges Vol. 1 collection, whenever I feel like it, I see it! <br /> <br /> In this short film, Moe, Larry and Curly play these three doctors in a hospital trying to help everyone, but, boy, they end up making a mess of everything! <br /> <br /> This short is another of my three favorites of all Stooges shorts, I'm also a big fan of slapstick comedy, and the Three Stooges are the kings of clowning! <br /> <br /> When I heard that you were nominated for an Oscar for Best Short Film, I was really curious about this, when I learned that I had lost, I was very disappointed! <br /> <br /> This short is one of the three funniest Stooges from afar, I recommend you to see this hysterical tumult! <br /> <br /> 10/10
