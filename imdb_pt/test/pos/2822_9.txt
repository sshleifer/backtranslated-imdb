I'm surprised by some of the reviews on this site because I really enjoyed this movie. If you're looking for something different, this movie is a good choice. It's definitely not your senseless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual movie, you really need to pay attention so some people can be turned off for it. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Notice to parents - there are some pretty graphic sex scenes, so watch them as soon as the kids are in bed. People who like European films will like this one. Adam Sandler fans should ignore it because it will be over their heads and it's definitely NOT your style.
