A movie that deserved to be released in theaters. This film made for television is a cinematic jewel that exemplifies the technique of Michael Mann, with an agitated contemporary music, strongly integrated to the visual images. Always with Mr. Mann, the amplification of the impact of the song is almost as if there was a winner of an invisible academy, added to the cast, writer, director and director of photography. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely one of my all time favorites. While nothing is perfect, this movie comes very, very close. <br /> <br /> Along with an excellent script, great direction and masterful acting by Richard Strauss, there is a star-studded set of character actors at their best: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Geoffrey Lewis; Richard Moll; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You may not recognize the names, but you will recognize all faces. <br /> <br /> If it shows up on TV, sit back with popcorn, raise the sound to an incredible soundtrack, and get ready to be riveted. the 97 minutes of the movie. I highly recommend recording it as it is only available on VHS and DVD from Holland and the DVD is encoded in region 2.
