This production, based on real stories of Danish crime, is an experience through excellent leadership, acting at all levels and has a nerve that is not often seen in crime series. Each episode is exciting, because it seems that the hole team believes that "this is my life now - that murder or murders are MY responsibility to solve" and the exit is brilliant. <br /> <br /> As a spectator, you just have this wonderful fill of being entertained because it seems that their focus, on purpose or not, is that they will not have fun ...: o) Do not miss this one, just enter Quality band of siblings and is an experience "must have seen" - What a wonderful crime time!
