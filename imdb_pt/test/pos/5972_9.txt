Fantastic Russian movie from World War II. Like most Russian WWII films, The Ascent is incredibly harrowing. It is also dense in its symbolism. The story follows two supporters, Sotnikov and Rybak (Boris Plotnikov and Vladimir Gostyukhin), who go on a mission to look for food. On their journey, they are seen by German soldiers, who injured Sotnikov. Sotnikov, in turn, kills one of the Germans, which leads to problems for the two supporters and all the others they face later. The biggest success of the film is its vivid sense of place. Russia is frozen and snowy, and it's hard not to feel the cold going straight into your own bones. Shepitko keeps his shot close to the characters, examining every rock of their faces. Probably not the choice, but the film is framed at 1.33: 1, which gives the film a feeling of claustrophobia. While the whole movie is a great achievement, I felt that the first half was stronger than the second. My main complaint about the film is that it develops into a very subtle little Christian allegory at its climax. I just do not think the symbolism adds much to the process, especially when I was already intrigued by the debate between the two supporters. Is not fair. I was weighing the pros and cons of their argument. I started leaning toward the point of view of a certain character, and then the director appears and tells me that he is Judas! Despite a bit of seriousness, this is still a must-see.
