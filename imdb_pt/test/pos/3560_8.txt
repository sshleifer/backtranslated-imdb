"Any Gun Can Play" (1967), directed by Enzo G. Castellari, is a good pastiche by Spaghetti Westerns, especially Leone. The first half is great, which, in addition to the opening that is a direct nod to "For a few dollars more," with Monco, Colonel Douglas Mortimer and El Indio appeared to enter a ghost town and then promptly killed by a hunter of rewards called "The Stranger", is utterly serious, with great shootings (especially the train robbery scene), fast and furious action and pleasant performances of Gilbert Roland, George Hilton and (who manages well, considering that he is evil confused) Edd Byrnes. But then, when the film hits halfway, there's a punch fight between Hilton and Byrnes. It's not very funny, and it's the weaker part of the movie, but throw everything you've seen previously in a new light. You realize that, in fact, the whole thing is a parody of the conventions of Spaghetti Western, and in retrospect, the first half is so well done that you completely lose this false undercurrent tendency. What follows now is a more obvious parody, with even a few acrobatic jumps around Brynes that precede all 70's circus. The ending, a complete ending of the climax "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," is very well done, since in other hands it could have been very silly. So a fun Western Spaghetti, which does not take itself too seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Spaghetti Westerns.
