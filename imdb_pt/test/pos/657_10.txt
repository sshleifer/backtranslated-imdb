I saw this movie for the first time in 1980 and it touched a cordon that reminded me of a more innocent moment. Norman Rockwell's opening narrative, music, and paintings set the tone for me. You love the movie or you hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was at his best and played Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in an innocent and touching way. This movie is at the top of my all time favorites, a shame that is no longer available on DVD or VHS. The end was also wonderful. John Hancock did a wonderful job of capturing the essence of the time.
