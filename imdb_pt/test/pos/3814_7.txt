I saw this before 'bubba ho-tep' at the festival of fantasy films in montreal. all about it is to tilt the hat to (or rip off completely) tim burton. I liked it anyway, even if it is extremely derivative. What struck me most was the quality of the look, given the obvious budget of the shoe rope. set design and props were inventive and original, although the script definitely was not.
