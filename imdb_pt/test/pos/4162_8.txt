Emanuele Crialese has done a fantastic job with one of those films that have remained in the back of his mind for years. It was Respiro (see comments and synopsis here in IMDb). <br /> <br /> Now, carrying the magnificent young talents he had for the first time on the screen, he takes the audience into a grim void. A literal dive in dangerous waters. The subject is migration. In this case, from Italy to the New World (the name of the film). A great deal calling it to its American release "The Golden Door". <br /> <br /> The story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest - that is, their lives, for a dream. <br /> <br /> I hate ruining the show by telling the story, so I'm going to live a little at work that Crialese and his entire team did so brilliantly. <br /> <br /> First of all, choose to stay with what he knows: direct sound as much as possible. That means the whole movie. The textures, the pain, the nuances of reality are always mixed with smells, heat or cold, sweat and blood, life and death, as vibrant as in real life. <br /> <br /> The crooked metal winches and shredded wood, the infamous buzz of the wind and the menacing sounds of big engines and horns are among the points that make this film so engaging. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is in the hands of a French couturier. The symbolism of light has been present since the first shot (again, almost the first shot of Respiro) and permeates the entire film with intimacy and a terrible feeling of despair. The soothing tones and very gray and gloomy depictions of people who suffer from the cramped and filthy boat they sail to expect are fascinating. <br /> <br /> The light is sparsely used, almost to discover all the characters in the dark. The beauty of each scene, and each scene is accentuated by the period costumes and the perfectly selected physical characteristics of the actors. <br /> <br /> Once again, as he always does, Vincenzo Amato is definitely alone. He plays the father of two children (the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and now are nineteen and sixteen) with all the power he always conveys to his very complex characters. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gainsbourg is more or less. . I think she never again achieved the perfection she achieved in The Cement Garden and in her first film: L'Effront√©e. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just because she seems a bit clumsy in her role. <br /> <br /> The locations and scenarios are tough and compelling, almost playing a character on their own. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most notable character is the one played by Filippo Pucillo, the youngest and mute son. The contrast here with your first role is complete. So he played a supercharged boy who was as ruthless as anything around him. Now, your character is all expression. And that's all: without words. His eyes tell the whole story with sublime power. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is one of those films that will not be very well received in the United States. It's absolutely Italian in everything. It is so Italian that, for the most part, language is one of many dialects that is much older than Italian itself. In the US this movie may be a little too much for Americans because of the subject. But anyone who remembers the history of their families when they get to the United States will see these films with admiration. <br /> <br /> And again, the minimalism that goes hand in hand with Crialese's ideas is back with a closure. scene in water. Except this time it goes from underwater photography to aerial photography. <br /> <br /> All in all, another great and very well told story of this filmmaker who only this year (2006) has already won 6 awards and was nominated for the Golden Lion. Not a small action!
