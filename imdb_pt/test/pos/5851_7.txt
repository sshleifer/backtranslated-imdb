Rating: 7 of 10. Directed by Barbet Schroeder. If you like 'Rope' from Hitchcock then you will like this movie. Sandra Bullock, the star of Murder by Numbers, is the psychologically disturbed but brilliant police detective, Cassie Mayweather. His partner is Sam Kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective played by Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Teenage murderers are high school students Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). These young psychotics are willing to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away, but the closeness of the catch is thrilling and exciting for at least one of the killers. <br /> <br /> Supporting characters include a police chief, an assistant public prosecutor, and the high school janitor who the assassins attribute to the murder. The film reminds me of several 'Hitchcock' films crossed with the TV show 'Law and Order'. We see a bit of police work and it's really interesting to see which clues detectives follow and which ones do not. <br /> <br /> The other plot in the movie relates to the past of Cassie Mayweather and ex-incarcerated. -husband. Most viewers found this aspect of the film unnecessary and slow, but I found this in the most intriguing part of the story. <br /> <br /> The movie "Murder by Numbers" is a well-crafted movie if you are looking for something safe. or should I say dangerous, murder mystery. For more excitement and suspense, try Hitchcock's Se7en or Dial M for Murder.
