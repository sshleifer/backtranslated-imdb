I always enjoyed listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in a plane crash. He was not in the old rock 'n' roll class of, say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he was not far behind. Who knows how great his legacy would be if he sang for decades. Almost everyone he launched was a success. <br /> <br /> So, I was pleasantly surprised by the good work that Gary Busey did in interpreting it and imitating his voice. He made Buddy proud, as did the actors (Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith), who played Holly's supporting group, "The Crickets." <br /> <br /> In terms of music, there are some of Holly's best-known songs. the beginning of the movie and it's really good, with a strong finale at the end, when Holly and the boys are shown in Iowa at their last show. Busey not only sings like Holly, he's a dead idiot for him in the looks department. Something was the best performance of the actor of all time, and you have no argument from me. <br /> <br /> I'm also glad that they finished the film on an upbeat note with the Iowa show, instead of thinking about its tragic accident. The ending could have been a real misfortune, but they did not allow it.
