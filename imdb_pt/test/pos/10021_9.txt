A jewel of a silent-time cartoon - it was rediscovered by THE CARTOON NETWORK, and was probably first broadcast in decades, if at all. <br /> <br /> What makes this so enjoyable is the varied beddings ... Douglas Fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitoes; Will Hays visits as "boss" of Static Studios; as well as appearances of Chaplin, Keaton and William S. Hart. The image of chewing gum decimating the population's shoes (an idea of ​​making money for the almost bankrupt salesman of Felix) can not be described - it must be seen. An excellent cultural gem.
