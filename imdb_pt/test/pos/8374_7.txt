An unusual movie for an audience outside the US. Lena Horne looks fabulous and Ralph Cooper does too. The background of the tap steps is not added as in other musicals so you do not hear the tapping of the taps, which is a great realism. The music is silenced to hear the dance steps that exist. Acting is a bit forced and the casting is slow to make you think the movie is older than it is. Costumes are daring for time in the dance routines at the end. It often seems like you are part of an audience at a stage show. The furniture you see is very modern, which adds to the sense of other worldliness in the movies. A must for all movie fans.
