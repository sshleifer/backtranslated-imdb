The first directorial work of Christopher Nolan, a year before "Memento", and this is almost as brilliant as this classic. He uses time differentials in a similar way to tell his story, and is very intelligent. <br /> <br /> Bill is this young writer who gets to follow complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they are. all about. One day, he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the table and confronts Bill, who dismembers and confesses what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Cobb is a thief and takes Bill in some jobs to teach him the ropes. Both men are voyeurs of one kind and a bond begins to grow between the two. <br /> <br /> But there is a hidden reason for Cobb to nurture this relationship, and everything fits in very well in the end. No, I'm not going to ruin it, but this is a really cool movie and I'm starting to think Christopher Nolan is a genius. <br /> <br /> If you like suspense movies with amazing endings, this is a must see.
