This is a great movie to watch with a good friend, boy / girlfriend or family. Basically one of these feels good movies that you want to share with your loved ones .... without all the crappy girl you find in a lot of American movies feel good. This movie is light but it makes you think and it will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Just a really simple but universal plot. I would think most people could relate in some way to this movie. The characters in the film are amazing and the actors do a great job of sucking it into the movie. And the film is headed along all the way with a hilarious and true Jewish humor. I watched the movie for the first time last night, and now I want to own it. :)
