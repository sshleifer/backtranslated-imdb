Do not expect a classic military comedy, which claims to mock the military, while only reinforcing a militaristic outlook. Instead, it deconstructs the elements that make the military such a murderous machine. East German version type of "Buffalo Soldiers". <br /> <br /> "NVA" runs on a meta-level that sympathizes with the attempts of its heroes to escape from the army drill in any way they can. These are not laughter, but lasting smiles. Utopia, of course (in a scene you will be shown the harsh reality), but very thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Just to fill in the 10 necessary lines: Do not go into that movie if you're an army officer. And I enjoyed your work.
