The End of the Suburb (TEOS) is a very useful film. It is also important and provocative. There seems to be no middle ground between the film or its main source of entertainment, the anti-expansion Meister, James Howard Kunstler. <br /> <br /> Although I am not a big fan of New Urbanism, my criticism is because of his small vision. In the case of New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe - another talking head - you finally hear what is obvious among the special extras of TEOS ... Calthorpe does not understand the peak of oil. <br /> <br /> I used this as a teaching tool in economics classes to understand the importance of land as a production factor - a fact diminished by neoclassical economics - and also as a vehicle to educate about: Peak Oil , our land use, global warming, our threatened food production, public transportation, our committed future <br /> <br /> Move on South Park! .... Made by Toronto Canadians for $ 25,000 and released in May 2004, this video sold more than 24,000 copies in October 2005. A major supplier of DVD rental companies recently ordered nearly 400 copies. <br /> <br /> Suburbia's sales were actually up 1.5 years after its release and has also been available on one of the leading online video services since September 2005. <br /> <br /> One sequence, Escape From Suburbia, is under construction with a possible release in August 2006.
