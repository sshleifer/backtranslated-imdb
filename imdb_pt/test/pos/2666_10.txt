Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is the greatest movie experience of all time: 1) It's a visual odyssey that could only be told on the big screen. The special effects that have earned Kubrick, his only Oscar, are the most impressive effects before that era of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least accurate) representation of space travel to this day. The silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also increases the mood of the film (to be discussed at a later point with HAL). The fact that Kubrick filmed the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is a courageous but satisfying move. Many said that after its original release, it was a favorite "travel" movie. I can not think of any other movie that has amazing visual effects for its time and even for all time (sorry for Phantom Menace fans!) 2) Kubrick's directing style is fantastic. As in all of his films, Kubrick likes to use his camera as a means to immerse himself in the psychology of his characters and entanglements. His camera is not as mobile as other big ones like Scorsese, but he sits down and watches the narrative unfold. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick movie. Like classic films like M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the faces of the characters to give the audience a psychological point of view. Even he uses extreme close-ups of the bright red "eye" of HAL to show the coolness and determination of the computer villain. I could go on, but in the end, Kubrick is at the peak of his style. 3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in movie history. I wholeheartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion on HAL 9000. Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of the silence and the darkness of space, a climate of isolation is created. Dave and his crew are isolated between Earth and Jupiter, with no place to escape. Combine this humor with the cool, calculated actions of HAL 9000 and you'll have the most hideous villain imaginable. I still, despite having seen this movie several times, feel my chest tighten in a particular scene. 4) The controversial end of 2001 always alienates people from this film. Instead of trying to give my opinion on what that means and what is my idea of ​​the meaning of 2001 in general, I would like to discuss the fact that the end serves to leave the movie open. Kubrick stated that he decided to make 2001 open for discussion. It left its meaning in the hands of the viewer. Respecting the public's intelligence, Kubrick allowed his film to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful discussion about man's past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is that the ending does not have to mean anything deep, it may just be a purely planned explanation and the whole movie can be seen as a fun journey through space. No other film, save the great Citizen Kane, is left open to discussions like 2001. It's really a surreal journey that involves not only the eye, but the mind. Instead of waiting long lines for Phantom Menace, rent a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the best movie experience.
