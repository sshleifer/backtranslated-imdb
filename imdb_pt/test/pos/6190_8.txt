To be completely honest, I was intrigued by the original 'Sleeper Cell' concept. Having watched the best part of the series on the FX Channel (UK), my Sky broke, which means I missed the crucial end. But what I saw in it, I assumed it was a great story, good acting and as I did not watch '24' I thought it was great, and it was confirmed for a second season ... <br /> <br /> One of the best TV shows I've seen. Much more realistic and believable than "24." Excellent character development and plot. It does not criticize Islam, but offers a thoughtful and thoughtful approach, showing the difference between radical terrorist Islam and true Islam. Everyone should see this show! <br /> <br /> Xx
