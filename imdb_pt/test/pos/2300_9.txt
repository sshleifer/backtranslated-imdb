this particular title is very interesting. the whole movie was like watching a ninja RPG, which is pretty cool. three magic swords, three clans, a horrible demon, a political power, yotoden has it all. the animation is decent but a bit grainy, the story is top notch, and the fight scenes are pretty cool. One thing that really looks good in this movie are the monsters. They are very crazy. if you liked the reign of blood and the ninja, yotoden is the only one to see.
