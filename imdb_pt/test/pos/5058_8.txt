When I go to see Rendition, I was expecting an exciting movie about a controversial subject with big names of actors. I was not expecting a movie that was so engaging, exciting, poetic and sad that caught me from the start and would not let me go, even after I left the theater. A word of advice to those who have not seen it yet, do not let your politics get in the way (or not) of this movie. Take it, take it for what it is. I saw this with my conservative Jewish family (I am the black sheep, the pseudo-liberal university student) and I thought they would write it as "liberal propaganda." Instead, they said it was a great movie with excellent performances (they like to imagine movie critics). <br /> It's sad that such a movie has to be marketed by its Oscar-affiliated actors, leaving Sarsgaard constantly underestimated, as well as new talents such as the truly excellent Metwally. The whole cast made good performances, with some standing out much more than others; my only problem with that was that there was a lot going on that did not allow a lot of screen time for each of the characters. In fact, I felt that the "sub-plot" with Fatima and Khalid was as prominent on the screen as the part of Anwar in the story. <br /> <br /> All characters have the potential to fall into stereotypes, but the actors do a good job to give them depth with the little screen time they have. Streep is really amazing, like a heartless senator, and as much as I do not want to see the actress in such a terrible role, it's impossible not to believe her. Gyllenhaal, who will probably be one of the Oscar nominations for this movie, seems a bit unsure in his role at times. H is trying to portray his internal conflict, but usually ends up as if he had forgotten his lines or did not know how he should feel. Sarsgaard gave an excellent performance; his unforgettable showdown with Streep is easily one of the best parts of the film. Metwally, again, was great, and I hope to see it in more mainstream movies. It's a pity that Gyllenhaal was probably named before him. Yigal Naor, as shown in IMDb, has been some movies already, but he is a newbie in my eyes. He, along with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach, gave great performances. <br /> <br /> The story of Fatima and Khalid had no credit in commercials, but it brings a sad humanity to the story. The narrative was interesting because I was actually trying to connect the two floors until it was clearly told to us in the end. I read some reviews here that say the love story was useless, but I disagree. I think it definitely shows another side of the controversial issue as well as humanity in general. Khalid was the real terrorist, but he was doing it to avenge his brother, and even though he was responsible for the attack, you see a human side to him through the story with Fatima. Not that I think we should feel bad about real terrorists, but I think the theme "we're all people" was definitely relevant. <br /> <br /> Whatever your feelings about terrorism, politics, etc. theater. The bottom line is that this is an interesting story with a message that we all need to hear.
