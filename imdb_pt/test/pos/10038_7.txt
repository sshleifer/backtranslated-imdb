Of course, along with everyone else, I was prepared to expect much from Hollywood's fantasy revisionism in THEY DID HAVE DONE WITH HIS TRUCKS about Custer's legend. Just having someone like Errol Flynn playing Custer is a sufficient clue that the legend takes precedence over the truth in this production. And, for the most part, my expectations have been met (in an admittedly exciting and fun way). <br /> <br /> Yet even in this obviously biased (and highly criticized) account of Custer's story, I was struck by some of the points in this film that sometimes subtle but still solidly seemed to counteract the typical clich√©s the manifest destiny and the unvarnished heroism usually found in the westerns of the early twentieth century. <br /> <br /> For example, even while this film tried whitewash is hero, certain scenes still suggested the most imperfect and foolish character of real life Custer: 1) Your initial entry into the gate the front of West Point, where his arrogance and pomp is a clear aspect of his character. 2) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed both to Custer's lack of clarity and military service requirements as to any other factor; there are moments in how Flynn plays Custer at West Point, where he looks totally stupid. <br /> <br /> 3) Custer's promotion to the General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake but also as a slapstick comedy. I half expected to see the Marx brothers or Abbott and Costello coming on the scene. <br /> <br /> 4) Custer's position against Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless. <br /> <br /> 5) Custer's Drinking Problem certainly not ignored. <br /> <br /> And although the music and some of the ways the Indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it was still a surprise to me that the film actually went into some detail about because the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving to their lands, and explicitly blamed the battles. in the Black Hills directly at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the plain villain of the play is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white devils who make the false claim of gold in the Black Hills. Of course, this part of the story is true, but I did not expect to see it pictured so unequivocally in a movie like that. <br /> <br /> And one other thing: usually in these films are the Indians. who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals, seemingly incapable of the basic good sense of avoiding getting drunk when they get close to alcohol. In this film, it is actually the troops of the 7th cavalry, not the Indians, who in at least two scenes are portrayed in this way. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie slides in some surprising moments. in the middle of the Hollywood bunk.
