This is a powerful movie that seems never to have reappeared after the McCarthy censorship period. He influenced me as a Jewish teenager who had friends of various colors and whose father's family had suffered under fascist regimes in Europe during the second quarter of the twentieth century. Unlike the latest robbery, "On The Waterfront," which seemed to have some of the same themes and twisting them to suit the political rigor of forced Hollywood of the time, told its direct story and with respect for the characters and reality. is reflected in a fictional way. It was an antidote to "And the Wind Took," "Birth of a Nation," "Triumph of the Will," and so many other glorifiers of hatred and violence. I would put it next to the recent German film (also hidden in the USA), "Rosenstrasse". <br /> <br /> I remember that the TV version, also in black and white in format and history, was obscured. for some seasons because the wife of the black hero looked white. As a young civil rights worker, it created a conflict for me because, on the one hand, I was opposed to smoking cigarettes and, on the other, against the boycott in Georgia of a TV program sponsor, a large I remember more of them - someone else?). <br /> <br /> I would love to find a CD of the movie or TV show to let my kids see something that has informed my opposition to racism universally (as opposed to just fighting racism against the Jews) and the recognition of the connection inherent between racism and militarism.
