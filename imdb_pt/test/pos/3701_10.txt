It's three thirty in the morning. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie about six minutes ago and it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> A teenager has a night of passion with her mother's lover and ruins everyone's life. The really interesting thing about this movie is that you can not really put the blame on anyone. <br /> <br /> Everyone had a perfect performance, and the story was thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> You should definitely see this movie if you can get your hands on it. <br /> <br /> I give 10.
