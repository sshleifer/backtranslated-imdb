When I was a child I remembered this show, but I thought that now, as an adult, the show could be a bit old-fashioned. Well, yes, it's just for me that makes the show more retro (and the songs very funky). <br /> <br /> This show is mostly well written. I think it's a farce that this show was canceled after a season, especially when this show was more popular than the Incredible Hulk. <br /> <br /> I think fans should ignore the poor special effects and enjoy the stories. <br /> <br /> This sentence contains spoilers: My favorite episode as a child was when there were two spider-men battling each other in an interesting way. A similar idea is invented in the movie Spider-Man 3. I liked the ideas in this TV show that some will hate it. I believe Stan Lee was not a fan.
