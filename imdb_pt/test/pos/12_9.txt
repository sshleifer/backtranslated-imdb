I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing up as a preview at my local theater. <br /> <br /> We've all seen this storyline before (Top Gun, GI Jane, an officer and a gentleman), but a good script still works. This story is basically about training a Coast Guard rescue team with a couple of parallel stories. Kevin Costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader, Ben Randall, who is forced to lead the training team after a difficult mission. The film takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both Costner's character and Jake Fischer, played by Ashton Kutcher. Glad to say Ashton is great in that part. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this movie and you will probably notice what is to come long before you arrive. However, using humor, exploring the hardness of training and the fun of watching Ben Randall "do his own thing as a trainer", left me fascinated and thoroughly entertained. I really enjoy watching a movie that makes the whole audience laugh loudly, sigh here and there, and applaud in the end as a tribute to the movie. <br /> <br /> We all had fun (despite a couple of tough times in the movie) and, I think, you did too.
