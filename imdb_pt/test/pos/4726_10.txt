This is one of the most underrated films of the 1990s. If you allow yourself to identify with the character of Patricia Arquette, you will see that it is a very touching story of a woman regaining a sense of purpose for her life and finding a new will to live . <br /> <br /> Arquette's performance is brave because it is purposely "wooden" - it is a way of defining his character's spiritual death, his total lack of desire to be alive. She moves through life as a zombie because her family was murdered and she can not see the point of life. What is moving is how, in the course of history, it is awakened - by the Burmese landscape, by the beautiful quality of its people and landscapes, and by the primary choices it is forced to face. <br /> Boorman supports this visually (and Hans Zimmer supports it with one of his most astounding and astounding scores) with a camera often static and with a propensity to shoot through glass, windows, windshields, etc. We are outside looking in, just like Arquette ... until she finds herself in the middle of the jungle and is forced to choose whether or not to fight for her life. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the 1954 film THE PURPLE PLAIN. It's a similar story in a similar scenario and makes a fascinating comparison.
