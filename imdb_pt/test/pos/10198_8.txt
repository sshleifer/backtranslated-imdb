Scientist Carl Lehman (well played by David McIlwraith) explodes something terrible in a deliberate chemical outburst. He has his brain transplanted into the body of a cyborg metal costume almost indestructible by his evil colleagues who are led by the wicked fellow obsessive scientist Alex Whyte (a perfectly odious portrait of Richard Cox). Lehman embarks on a total kill. It's up to the nasty mercenary Hunter (a wonderfully disgusting turn of the divine Pam Grier) to finish him off. Director Jean-Claude Lord, who previously directed the underrated psychological thriller "Visiting Hours," stages the abundance of action scenes with considerable enthusiasm and keeps pace with it all, thus ensuring that this film is seen as a fun science fiction and trash Action horror. Maury Chaykin, a potbellied character, easily surpasses the honors of actor Burt, who in the most insipid sequence of the film has a brutal fight with Lehman's pregnant wife, Lauren (a winning performance of Teri Austin's adorable). Stan Winston's fantastic composition, f / x, and Paul Zaza's exciting soundtrack add even more to the overall vibrancy.
