Witchcraft, or witchcraft as is commonly known in Europe, beings with Jane Brooks (Linda Blair) waking up from a nightmare involving a witch. The mother and father of Jane Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) are interested in buying an old desert hotel on an island about 50 miles from Boston, renovating it and reopening it. Together with Jane and her young son Tommy (Michael Manchester) Rose & Freddie are planning to travel to the island with an architect named Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) to check the amount of work they need to do, they also come across the property. agent Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth) and hires a local fisherman named Sam (George Stevens) to take them to the island. Once there, they enter the hotel and begin to inspect the property, while back to the boat Sam is dead and the boat is loose to sail away. They discover two unexpected guests in the form of a photographer named Gary (David Hasselhoff) and his fianc√©e Leslie (Leslie Cumming) who happen to be researching a book she is writing about the horrible legends and superstitions surrounding the infamous island and hotel. As the night approaches a violent storm outside, it isolates them from the mainland while a mysterious 'lady in black' (Hildegard Knef) continues to appear while the old evil that resides in the hotel seeks new victims of demonic possession, human sacrifice and satanic rituals. ... <br /> <br /> The director of this film co-produced by Italian Americans is somewhat wrapped in mystery as the IMDb list Fabrizio Laurenti as Martin Newlin, but there are rumors that Joe D'Amato did the honors, anyway to be honest, despite the bad reputation, I found the Witchery a lot of fun in a rather mean and tacky way. The script credited to Harry Spalding & Daniele Stroppa on IMDb again is confusing as well as the actual credit in the movie itself is Daniel Davis, however who wrote this thing did a decent job, please stop laughing. In the background is a Haunted House horror, but adds some bloody deaths and a surreal feeling to everything. The different sets of characters have reasonable motives and do not get on my nerves as much as I thought they could, it's not very well drawn, it does not make any sense and the dialogue is not exactly top drawer stuff but as a whole Witchery entertained me for its odd 95 minutes of simple and simple duration. It's reasonably well paced, a little slow to go, maybe, but there are many surreal and bizarre occurrences and repulsive deaths to keep a person amused. One part of Witchery that destroys part of its credibility is this so-called storm, there is no storm in sight & the sea is probably calm enough to swim, the supposed 'twist' final of Witchery really did not work for me check out the idiot face look of Cummings in the last frozen frame. The hotel offers a good secluded location and adds a certain atmosphere to the movie, which has the distinctive "horror" undefinable throughout, cheap horror. Technically, Witchery is not all that bad, it was obviously filmed on the spot, so it looks good all the time, and while it's not exactly the pinnacle of film production finesse, its production figures are a bit better than expected. The violence and blood are typical of the Euro, a woman has her lips sewn and hung inside a fireplace so she does not scream while the others light, someone is crucified and then burned alive, impaled on a swordfish, veins expand & pop & a woman is raped by a man with no lips. Witchery was filmed in English, so there is no dubbing, as far as David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair act in the same movie, what more can I say? Yes, ladies Hasselhoff takes off his shirt, and for the boys, Cummings takes hers. Both Hasselhoff & Blair are a joke to watch this thing, however, the kid is very annoying and really can not act at all. I'm sure the healthier movie goers will disagree with my opinions, but I still agree with the fact that I enjoyed it and would be happy to watch it again, Witchery is a lot of fun and definitely worth seeing if you like bad movies or a horror fan in general.
