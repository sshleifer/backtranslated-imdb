This is a very good thriller at a nuclear power plant in Southern California that was directed by James Bridges and stars Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas. Fonda plays a TV reporter who wants to be an investigative journalist, but can only be a TV reporter. Douglas is an independent cameraman and Lemmon is the supervisor of a nuclear power plant. Fonda and Douglas are sent on a routine mission at a nuclear power plant and an accident almost happens and they record everything. Everyone tries to cover it up, except Fonda and Douglas, so Douglas steals the movie. Lemmon begins to investigate and discovers that the company is more concerned with profit than with safety at the factory. It's a good movie with a good ending.
