Any movie about World War II made during World War II by a British production company does not have any modern pair in my opinion, respectfully. The confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in At Dawn We Dive: as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of World War II and particularly of naval warfare, I favor subs and North. Atlantic and especially those that include the German side of things. For those unfamiliar with the target's priorities, an attack on an enemy warship is the biggest event a submarine can expect to encounter, and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here. The pace is deliberate and typical of the works that come out of the Ealing, Rank and British-Gaumont studios: I frankly prefer its calmer, more cerebral approach to its humanity and realism that fits much better than any overproduced Hollywood. movie could never. It reminds me of The 49th Parallel by Powell and Pressburger, thanks to the powerfully persuasive Eric Portman, one of my favorites. John Mills gets the second billing and a smaller source in the titles, so this is clearly Mr. Portman's movie, but the entire cast shines. As for the title sequence, am I the only one who is delighted with Gainsborough's lovely Gainsborough Girl pre-CGI from Gainsborough Production?
