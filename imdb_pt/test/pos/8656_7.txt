I liked 'Den brysomme mannen' http://ow.ly/PTTp (my wife did not, so I saw him in a few days.) Reviewers mostly confused - most agree that it is allegorical, but not of that; 'Heaven', 'Inferno', 'Socialism', 'Capitalism'? <br /> <br /> That most people do not want to escape, and it is essentially forbidden to go with most of these options. <br /> <br /> So, presumably you should project your favorite worry / prejudice / fear about it. <br /> <br /> So I'd say it's about an Epicurean life. A live color desaturated, literally in the film, figuratively in the interpretation.
