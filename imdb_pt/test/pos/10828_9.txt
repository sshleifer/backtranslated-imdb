"Bon Voyage" has the fast pace that somehow reminds me of the Indiana Jones / Star Wars movies - it's like you're on a fast train or a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> It is heralded as a novel, mystery, suspense and farce; is all this and more candid remarks about the reactions of French society during the Nazi invasion at the beginning of World War II. And it's also a juggling exhibit that involves 7 main characters. All the scenes seemed historically accurate (in my eyes) and gave a great feel for the period. <br /> <br /> All the actors were well released and gave great performances, but IMO the most superb was that of Isabelle Adjani who played the role of an opportunist and egocentric French film star; She not only convincingly interpreted the role of a young actress perhaps half her age, but also interpreted her love affairs convincingly, so the audience sees that she is only half as serious and complex as a person. His character and energy propel the movie from start to finish. It was only when I read Roger Ebert's review that I discovered that she was 48 at the time of the film. What a beauty !! <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the ending - it's satisfying but it allows you to write your own conclusion about what happens to the main characters. <br /> <br /> As noted by another user - DO NOT arrive late; you need to be there from the opening scene. Good advice. <br /> <br /> Dei 9 out of 10.
