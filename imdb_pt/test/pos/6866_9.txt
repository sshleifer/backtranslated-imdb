This movie will send chills down your spine, even if you do not understand German. I saw this for the first time in my German High School class and found it for $ 5 at my local Wal-Mart. I've seen at least 20 more times since * this being just a few years ago * and it's great to watch it on a movie night. The plasticized bodies are mostly real, used in Body Worlds. This movie was a whip for that. A dr. German * dubbed Dr. Death * began plastifying human bodies for display and now Body Worlds is a touring business now in Chicago, IL. Many people opposed this and then a great German horror film was made. I personally love this movie and recommend it to all those who like horror movies.
