The Mikhail Kalatozov Cranes are flying is a superb movie. Winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, he has an excellent cinematography and performance by Tatyana Samojlova, the only Russian actor to win a prize in Cannes for a performance. She plays Veronika, a teenager in love with her boyfriend, happy and carefree, with plans to get married. Your life will be upside down when World War II strikes and your boyfriend volunteers for the army. The film portrays the effect of the war on adolescent love and on the people who stayed and watched their loved ones go and fight, waiting for a letter or other information. It is a picture of lost innocence. Samojlova does a magnificent job, and the transformation of his character will break his heart. The camera's movement is fast with many close-ups, it's a dancing camera. The first scene on the stairs is fantastic, but it's not the only one, there's a scene later in which Veronika tries to commit suicide, and another, in my opinion, one of the most powerful scenes in film history, the bombing of Veronika's house when she runs up the stairs in the middle of the fire, to find her apartment completely destroyed. Simply great! 10 out of 10.
