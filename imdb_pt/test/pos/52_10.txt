This is a must-see movie. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and when you're done you'll want more. Well written and convincing, this movie attracts you and grabs you. The cast was perfect, the characters purposeful and the performances exceptional. "Nanny" is the standard that all women must maintain: strong, forgiving, protective and never judgmental. "Nanny," to me, is the epitome of what a Christian mother and woman should be: a true pillar of the community. If I were half the "nanny" woman, I could consider myself well. I would have been devastated if "Nanny" had died sometime in the movie, but as she did not definitely buy it when going out on DVD. I can only hope that the story continues and that Ruben returns to Lackawanna to try to rebuild the city, piece by piece and person by person.
