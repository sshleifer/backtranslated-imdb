Fantastically written, acted and produced! I loved watching this brilliant and talented cast - each one of them - give such a great performance. This movie completely warmed the clams of my heart! Great storytelling! <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for the month of Black History. Filled with an accurate portrayal of recent history and very real characters who have resisted incredible pain - with dignity and a belief in a better future. It is so easy to see how these various adults affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually fuel the talent of his adult life. The next time you are in the company of a child listener and observer, remember; show or he can be a writer-at-do!
