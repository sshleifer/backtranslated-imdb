This is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival so far and arguably the best the festival has to offer. I got into this movie with little or no expectation after learning that the director was responsible for the terrible vampire movie The Forsaken. and I left pleasantly surprised. The film starring Lori Heuring of In Crowd fame as a young mother whose husband has just passed. She moves to an old family home in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine that is a tomb for overcrowded children in the past. Lucky for them the kids return with a killing revenge and eating everyone on their way. The movie works on many levels. It's well done, full of suspense, has good cinematography points and especially Compton capable performances. The atmosphere is scary but a little uninteresting, the score is decent and the makeup effects are horrible and simplistic. The film retains a scary and disturbing tone and the children themselves with pale skin, plucked lips and empty eyes are quite scary and relentless. The film is original and inventive without being artistic or complicated. I can not see this movie making it a wide release without some fine tuning and fine tuning. But they definitely have a good product in their hands and should seek some kind of theatrical distribution. However, the theater I saw was horrible. The sound was terribly confusing, which I felt was pulled out of the film mostly and stopped in the middle because they could not center it on the screen, which slightly killed the mood. All in all, though, it was the most satisfying of horrorfests entries perhaps because it had fewer expectations, but nevertheless it was a welcome addition to genre films.
