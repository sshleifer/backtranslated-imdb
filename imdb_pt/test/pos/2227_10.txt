It's been since 1972 that I've seen this movie and I still remember it as one of my favorite movies all time. I would buy a copy if it was on DVD and it is very bad, it is not. You'd think anything starring Peter Sellers would be brought back. Much better than "Being There" and as good as the Pink Panther series. Uschi Digard had a small part for such a well-endowed artist. She's a bonus in this movie. I think the medical field may not appreciate this film as it really makes fun of the profession and also makes it appreciate that Sellers was never available to treat them as well as their analysis of urine samples.
