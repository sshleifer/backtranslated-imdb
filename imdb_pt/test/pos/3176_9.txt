This is one of those movies that were never released and therefore lost when they originally played in theaters. <br /> <br /> I came across him as I switched to a TV channel and immediately got involved in this story of an old hobo rodeo. whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I always wanted to see the movie again, but I could not even remember its name, and I never saw it in the movie theaters. <br /> <br /> James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent at their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. Despite being an action movie and having a western setting and theme, it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their liking for movies.
