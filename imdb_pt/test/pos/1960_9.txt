I've seen this movie several times and find it very appealing and sad. The lack of real emotion of most characters is very disturbing. They seem empty, without hope. The story is based on a real event. <br /> <br /> A teenager is murdered by her boyfriend for no obvious reason - apparently he just felt it. So he brags about it to his friends and as they do not believe him, he takes them to see the body - a number of times. No one reports the murder. There are two strong clues - Keanu Reeves and Crispen Glover - the Crispen Glovers character is seriously annoying. <br /> <br /> Keanu's character, Matt, seems to be the only one who has a sense of right and wrong. This is Keanu at his best - impeccable performance and very convincing - whoever thinks this man can not act should watch this movie. Matt's younger brother is almost the most disturbing character in the film. Only twelve and no compassion or love factor in your life. It is very sad to think that there are children out there like this. This really makes you grateful for what you have. 9/10
