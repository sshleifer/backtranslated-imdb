I just loved this series, and I was very sad to see it happen. Yes, it is based on Christians and traditionally as well. It deals with some difficult issues, as the other reviewer points out, but I think it depends on your point of view on these issues, and as a teenager growing up and now as a mother, I was so happy to see a TV series that was clean and, well, frankly, wonderful! I, unlike the other reviewer, was excited to see how they handled the condom deal. Instead of listening to the typical washing of desires about condoms, they showed that the son actually worked to be chaste and apply it to his later relationships, which were pure and pious because of it, and much safer because of it (100 %!). After watching this entire series, you become extremely connected to all the characters in the family and outside the family (once they settle down more permanently), and the moral values ​​they teach in each episode are simply invaluable. I found Touched by an Angel (made by the same producer) to be cheesy here and there (although overall I liked it), but this series, in my opinion, was much better made and had better acting and was more interesting as well. It was good for the whole family and was interesting for the whole family, which was a huge plus. The family was not great, they had their own shortcomings, but in the long run they did what was right and you watched them grow, change and fight like any real family does. It was my favorite show at the time and will always be near the top of my list, hopefully it will come out on DVD!
