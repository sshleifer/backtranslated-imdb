I rented this movie with very low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. This movie is extremely good. And no one would have guessed it was a low budget. DECEMBER, directed by Richard Bell centers around an 18-year-old named Pip, played by the superb "Paul Anthony", who leaves his house because of circumstances surrounding the way his older brother died. He is overcome with blame for this event and falls into a difficult life for a teenage fugitive with drugs and alcohol. On his 18th birthday, his father tracks Pip and gives him a tape left for him by his grandfather, whom he should listen to on his 18th birthday. <br /> <br /> The way the whole movie is told is with two simultaneous stories unfolding at the same time. The present life of Pip and the past life of his grandfather during the WW11, of which Pip hears the tape. <br /> <br /> The three featured performances in this film are those of 'Paul Anthony' like Pip and 'Brenden Fletcher' playing Jason, the young 18-year-old WWII soldier, his grandfather. In addition, the role of the injured doctor WW11 'Macauley' played by 'Mark Hildreth'. Everyone doing beautiful performances. <br /> <br /> A couple of worries and scenes that did not look very well on me ... the priest, Father Chris played by 'Alan Cumming' who is gay and in broad daylight pick up the local street neighborhood that the whole neighborhood knows. And then we have the local store clerk named Jeff, a love played by the compelling "David Beaszely" who just wants to be loved and for some unknown reason, is drawn to the very sloppy and bored street hooker, Clerk, who sleeps with just about any one and in all likelihood is a walking toxic time bomb. After all, he's not a very nice person. This part simply does not sound true. <br /> <br /> The parts that I like the most were the flashbacks of the War. They were so well acted and very touching. There is a scene at the end where the soldier is dying and the other soldier, Jason, is there to console and show him love while he is seriously injured and dying. This is a scene so wonderful and touching that it left me in tears. Beautifully acted. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. It is the love, redemption, and power of the human spirit to survive.
