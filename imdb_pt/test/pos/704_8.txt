"The Desperate Housewives" (1943) is a genuine classic, not for its history (which is quite routine), but for its technical elements of production. This was a western landmark, the greatest of all time at the time of its release and even more original because it was a Columbia production - a lightweight studio with a reputation for inferior food. Only Fox's "Jesse James" (also starring Randolph Scott) a few years earlier gave the genre a luxurious treatment. Although it was eclipsed in a few years by "The Searchers" and "High Noon", "The Desperadoes" was an innovative effort and a treasure trove. In 1863, the Red Valley, Utah, economy was based on gathering and selling wild horses for the Union Army. The script is somewhat confusing here with references to the railroad (which years in the future of Utah) and Custer's Last Stand (Custer was busy wrestling with Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time), but these are not important elements of the plot. <br /> <br /> Red Valley has an honest sheriff, Steve Upton (Scott), but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; robbing their own bank every time the government pays for a herd of horses. The city is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford), a famous outlaw who is an old friend of Steve. He wants to go straight, especially after falling in love with beautiful trainee Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes). Cheyenne's partner "Nitro" Rankin is there for comic relief, as is Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and the city judge (Raymond Walburn who models his character in the crystal ball "Magic of Oz "by Frank Morgan forger). <br /> <br /> Not risking, with its huge budget, Columbia joined this thing with tons of action and all Western movies, but the Indians and the wagons covered. There is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed, a spectacular bar brawl, an explosive climax, romance and three-strip Technicolor. All these things do not necessarily fit, but who would care in 1943. Marriage is a problem as it tries to be both a serious Western action and a comedy. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was probably the best of all his filming. The inner scenes are solid, but it is the outdoor naturalist photography that is truly stunning; both the static lyrics and the moving footage of the action sequences. <br /> <br /> Scott and Claire Trevor were top-billed, but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford, which would soon be their biggest star. And director Charles Vidor used the film to showcase his new wife, Keyes (whose portrait of Scarlett's sister in "Gone With the Wind" connected with the public more than any small part of the film's history). <br /> <br /> The Ford-Keyes dynamic is "The Desperado", the most original and important feature. Instead of going for the clich√© "love triangle" with Scott and / or Trevor (what appears for the first time will happen), the whole romantic focus is on the two younger actors. This was probably the best role that Keyes has achieved and she makes the most of it. Playing a young but extremely sexy woman who looks great in pants and leather dresses, and who rides and fights as the character of Kiera Knightley in "Pirates of the Caribbean." This was revolutionary at the time and coincided with WAAC's 1942 formation for World War II military service. <br /> <br /> "The Desperadoes" is a film that has been well cared for and the impression looks new. Unfortunately, there are no special features on the DVD. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
