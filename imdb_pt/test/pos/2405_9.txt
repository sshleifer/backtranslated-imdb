Well, they took 4 tries, but they finally made it! In this fourth sequel to the Karate Kid franchise, the producers actually made a home run! Well, first of all, I applaud you for finally getting rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt that he never served the role of the Karate Kid. I'd rather have seen Danny "Ralph Mouth" more in that role. Macchio showed what proved to be the best film in the series and look where his career is now! Instead, they get a girl! They have Hillary Swank, best known for playing a variety of sheman parts in every movie she's in. I personally do not care about your teeth, but this is a personal preference. But still, see how Karate Kid 4 launched its career into orbit! She won a fucking Oscar. Jiminey Christmas! Meanwhile, where's Ralphy? He should put some amateur porn tape like Screech or something. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my only disagreement with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate. As a self-proclaimed master of karate, I have been the proud owner of a white belt for the last 8 5/8 years. The first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls ... well, except for judo ... but that's kind of gay. So, for the sake of accuracy, I think they should have stayed with another man for that role. I was thinking maybe of Dennis Franz. It would give the paper the depth it requires. <br /> <br /> Maybe they listen to my suggestions and make the proper adjustments in Karate Kid 5. Your Pat Marita too is not anymore. I was thinking that Justin Guarini is the perfect substitute for the amiable Asian fellow Mr. Miyagi. It will give "wax wax" a new meaning. Funny HAHAHAHAHAHA right? Anyway, if you are looking for an exciting movie, full of karate and triumph of the human spirit, the Karate Kid 4 is for you. Do not waste your time with 1-3. This is the Karate Kid for you! This is the Karate Kid for ages!
