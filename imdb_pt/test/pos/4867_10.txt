This second pair of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner is great as the first. Predictable, maybe, but I do not care and still laugh a lot whenever I see him. Wile E. / Roadrunner shorts have always had the most special place in my heart. So, knowing that the second Golden Collection album would not only present 11 of it, BUT they would be in chronological order (from 2 to 12, the first episode was in Volume 1), made me stay with hazy eyes. I love these things. This short animation can be seen on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2. It also features an optional Micheal Barrier commentary. <br /> <br /> My notes: A +
