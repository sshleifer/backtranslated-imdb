Crackerjack is a hit and miss film set in the Australian suburban grassland club of Cityside. Mick Molloy plays a scammer who has marked free parking spots on Cityside. When the club is pressured to install poker machines on their premises, they need to raise $ 8,000 to prevent that from happening. The club needs new members to help out and that's where the character Mick Molloys comes in and has to throw away to save the club. With many Australian actors on the rise and aging, Crackerjack is a hidden gem. Be warned that most of the jokes are for those with a knowledge of lawn bowls, but there are lots of fun jokes to provide comic relief. Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy co-star. Overall, the movie should be recommended for people who play bowling or played, but there is enough material for a fun game if you have a little understanding. If you like Australian humor, I suggest you stay white from bowling and head out to the theater, because this is the premiere comedy debut of the year (also the only one).
