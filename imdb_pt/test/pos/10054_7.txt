Nicole Finn (Madonna) has just been released from prison. Although she is ordered to go by bus to Philadelphia, she wants to stay where she was arrested. This is because she claims to have information that would clear her record. Louden (Griffin Dunne) is assigned to accompany her to the bus for her future father-in-law. Louden will be driving around town anyway (in his future mother-in-law Rolls Royce), taking the alliance and a rare big and big cat to an eccentric collector. Nicki, however, begins the ensuing chaos as she jumps on the Rolls to take over the direction. Between big cats, taxi drivers, gunslingers, bridesmaids and a wedding cake with guns, lawyer Louden knows he's not in Kansas anymore. Is there a way out of madness? This movie is a crazy comedy trip. Madonna and Dunn√© are perfect sheets for each other, making their connection noisy, while playing their roles as ex-offenders and a tense and buttoned lawyer, respectively. The script is praiseworthy in its ability to send the viewer into crises of hysteria, as one implausible scene gives way to the next and to the next. Everything that is secondary, from the supporting actors to the scene, to the costumes, is also very good. If you know someone who needs a lot of joy, rent this movie for them. You will both be ready.
