I'm sick of people complaining that Never Say Never Again is just a faint remake of Thunderball. Yes, the influence of this film is unmistakable, but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of refined films is reserved for films as unthinking and unintelligent as the 1998 version of Psycho. While it's true that the twelfth opening theme (and Connery's last film) is one of the worst in the entire series, the film itself still stands on its own, despite many other weaknesses. In addition, even the weak title song is made to match very well with the closing dialogue of the film. Of course, Sean Connery was getting a little older when this movie was shot (at least by James Bond Patterns), but there is a lot of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to the filmmakers. James Bond is close to retiring before receiving his assignment, having spent most of his recent time teaching, not doing, and there is even M's insistence on paying more attention to his health, diet and training, and doing more exercise. and what not. Besides, this is James Bond, remember? This guy is supposed to be some kind of superhuman, and all his fans are getting upset because he has some gray hair. When this guy retires at the end of the movie, M sends the poor 'Small-Fawcett' (in a hilarious tip from Rowan Atkinson) to tell Bond that without him, he cares about the safety of the free world, and you all do not can overcome the fact that he is no longer a cheerful young man. Come on, Sean Connery could still play James Bond as well as he could, or at least better than anyone else ever got. <br /> <br /> Most of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and keep the world hostage (as Dr. Evil would say, 'Oh hell, let's do what we always do' so clearly there's nothing new there, but this is one of the Bond films that the best liners. Is there a fun scene where Bond is invited for a urine sample? `If ​​you could just fill this glass for me ?? "From here?" There are many good examples, but the sexual insinuations directed at Mr. Bond are especially prevalent in this issue. But then, later, he throws that urine sample on a villain's face, making him scream as if his face is burning. Not a very good attempt at comic relief, especially since this guy was kicking Bond's butt with some sort of super-spring device that could cut just about anything. And, of course, Kim Basinger stars in this film as one of the best Bond girls in the entire series. <br /> <br /> Is it no secret that Never Say Never Again has gone wrong, and one of the things that has gone through the worst is the special effects? with the sole exception of the flying missiles, which were obviously fake but still stunning for 1982. The colored contact lens at the beginning of the film was totally without effect, and the laser-watch was one of the worst things in the entire film, those damn sharks. Of course, Fatima Blush put some sort of device in her dive tank that attracted sharks (granted, they had own guiding mechanisms), in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line, `I have a simple request. And that's having FRICKIN 'laser beams attached to their heads!' And then, of course, there's the bursting of the hotel room scene, which was redone in an episode of The Simpsons, and which was obviously followed by another obligatory and overly casual phrase from James. Domination The video game created by Largo, the villain of the film, is a particularly memorable scene, and the film also features what is probably the best motorcycle chase in the whole series (far superior to laughable from Tomorrow Never Dies). But despite many strengths, the film's weaknesses are made lighter in the public's mind at the end of the film due largely to the anticlimactic underwater conclusion (one of the most obvious parts borrowed from Thunderball and recreated below). No matter the fact that Largo revealed some crucial information for Bond when he left it in the living tower (the brilliance of Dr. Evil once again, "I'll leave you there without actually witnessing your death and just assuming that everything was planned" The climax of what is expected to be a fast-paced action movie should never occur in a silent underwater atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In all, Never Say Never Again has a very high rating on the James Bond scale, and Connery's wink at the end of the film (as well as the two closing lines) suggested at the time that he could still returns for another turn as Bond. Clearly, this is no longer likely, so we can only hope.
