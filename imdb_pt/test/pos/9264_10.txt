I've always been a big fan of "Homicide: Life On The Street" so when I heard there was a reunion movie coming up, I could not wait. <br /> <br /> Let me just say, I was not disappointed at all. It was one of the most powerful two hours of television I've ever seen. It was great to see everyone back but the greatest pleasure of all was to have Andre Braugher back because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss has always been the strongest part of a great show together.
