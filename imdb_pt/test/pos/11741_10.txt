The film stars William Holden, who falls in love with an impressive Eurasian physician, Jessica Jones, in Hong Kong's breathtaking scenery. The cinematography is magnificent when they meet on a hill overlooking Hong Kong. History deals with racial tensions, society frowning on mixed relationships and extramarital affairs. But what I love about it is the strong character of the heroine portrayed by Jessica Jones, who is an Eurasian physician who remains humble and steadfast in her altruistic mission and remains faithful to her love. Despite this, she is fired at her hospital for marrying a married man snooping on top rankers. One day, William Holden is called to the Korean War, which he covers and then that ill-fated day, she receives news of his death. The end, of course it's tragic, I cried when she went to their hill. It was a case of very sweet love ill-fated. He defeats all odds, the fact that she was dismissed from his job, as his wife did not grant him a divorce, but his great love persevered - they experienced a great love despite everything. I personally do not believe in extramarital affairs, and I do not think he should have started anything when he was connected to someone else and she should not have allowed herself to let that happen, but nonetheless, a truly magnificent film. I think the heroine overshadowed the hero. Jessica Jones is sensuous and gave a magnificent performance even though I thought it was strange that they did not hire a real Asian actress or someone with Asian blood. I agree with a review, Jessica Jones exudes sexuality as she lies on the floor and looks at William Holden talking quietly, but his eyes say come and take me now. <br /> <br /> I find it a pity that most of the great movies were made before I was born, it seems that many Hollywood movies are lacking in depth, great interpretation and entirely dependent on sex scenes and heavy sex scenes. This is truly one of the biggest ill-fated love stories in the movies.
