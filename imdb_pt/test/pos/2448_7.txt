There have been many films about people coming home from wars and having to deal, but "The War at Home" is worth seeing. Portraying Vietnam veteran Jeremy Collier (Emilio Estevez) having trouble connecting with his family in Texas, much of the film is very likely to get you tense. But nothing can prepare you for what is revealed. <br /> <br /> Part of what makes this movie so good is how it gives the viewer the feel of both Texas and the gulf between generations. Jeremy's parents Bob (Martin Sheen) and Maurine (Kathy Bates) clearly have a problem with their son's attitude about both the war and their rejection of Americanism. His sister Karen (Kimberly Williams) is not sure where to stand. But after dinner, there can be no neutrality. So we Americans may never be able to get through the Vietnam War, but this movie can probably help us see how seriously that has affected us. many people. Emilio Estevez certainly did a good job steering. Also starring Corin Nemec and Carla Gugino.
