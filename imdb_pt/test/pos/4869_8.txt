This cartoon documents the second meeting between Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner, and is definitely better than his first meeting in Fast and Furry-os (1949). <br /> <br /> If measured by aesthetic value, then this cartoon would not rank among the top 5 or 6 of the year 1952. Regardless, this is a very funny short. Coyote chases the Roadrunner (Accelerati Incredibilus) along the road and becomes completely tired. The ingenious "Latin" scientific names of the characters are very original, and have been imitated before in other unrelated drawings. The coyote collapses and puts on a wonderful expression of - I do not know - handling. These Jewish expressions make this cartoon offer more than its share of laughter in seven minutes. Then he has an idea, and another laughable expression is used. The slapstick jokes are hilarious and mask the fact that it is really wrong to inflict so much pain on a poor and helpless GENIUS coyote. Everyone knows, but who cares? <br /> <br /> The old rocket gag is also present. Coyote attaches to a rocket, which should produce enough force for him to reach Roadrunner and grab him. Instead, the rocket fires into the air and becomes a firework in the distance: eat at Joe's. This classic gag stems from this cartoon; though obvious, still makes people laugh. <br /> <br /> The highlight is the chase through the mine shaft. The two wear helmet lights and see the tunnel through which the two are going, with only visible lights. Here, the comedy reaches a peak. An unforgettable sequence, perhaps even the best sequence in the early days of the Roadrunner. The final touch is provided by the writing of Michael Maltese, while the Coyote's light goes out and he inadvertently lights a match in a room full of explosives, the surface is shown where a lot of cacti jumps and spells the letters "YIPE!" after the explosion. These little things make you laugh in just seven minutes, and so begins the whole fun. Skates are another good idea, as is the water-free drink and the anvil on the tightrope (a sequence that appears in Space Jam [1996]). Giving the results of those far would be useless. The free drink proves to be a problem for Wile E. at the end of the second sequence: the rocket skates. <br /> <br /> This classic cartoon is full of animations, except for the characters. Although very animated, the two characters are very primitive; which may be a euphemism. Though it may seem odd at first, the mood of subsequent sequences makes one forget. <br /> <br /> If you like vintage Jones, note that. If you LOVE Roadrunner, get it on video. Excellent entertainment (Rating: 8/10).
