I saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for children. A little predictable. The book was better, gave more plot details, ore about the environment and how the children discovered the conspiracy. I think Hiassen's distorted humor appears better in the book than in the movie, but there were also many funny moments in the movie. It's probably a little too slow for kids under 6 years old. I loved the cast of Jimmy Buffet as a science teacher. And those baby owls were adorable. I wonder how they managed to film them. The movie showed a lot of Florida at its best, made it look very appealing. Am I imagining, or has author Carl Hiassen made a brief appearance?
