The clever and intriguing drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon appeared on the cover of every American newspaper (when life imitated the film). An employee of a nuclear plant in southern California is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with the real story behind an accident at the factory. Ostensibly a problem of stuck valves, the film of a TV crew shows that it was an accident bordering on disastrous proportions - and worse, that the security conditions are being cleaned to save millions of dollars, a cover-up that endangers the lives of all . The film occasionally gets very technical (especially in the second half) and could use more human interaction, however, the performances of Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda (as a news woman in the right place at the right time), and Michael Douglas cameraman) is superb. The disposable parts involving nuclear demonstrators are totally accurate and bitterly satirical, and the news (with its corporate structure and tasteless sim-men) is sharply captured. *** 1/2 of ****
