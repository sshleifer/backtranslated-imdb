I'm not sure how it could have been better, so I gave it a 10. The acting was excellent - the main woman was SO HOT - the guy who played Darwyn was a fiery and thoughtful character that showed the inner turmoil he was suffering . (the death of the truck driver is an example) in an excellent way. The plot was believable and the duration of the series was almost certain (ie, I love Lost, but will it never end?). As British, I usually think of Yanks as enthusiasts. The LAPD was in its ill-advised attempts to arrest it, but the other agencies were portrayed positively. My main thought about programs like this (and also the excellent 24) is - could it happen? Would that happen? Is this happening now? Probably, probably. <br /> <br /> I hope they do another series, but after reading some of the previous comments, it seems they do not. <br /> <br /> To summarize - If you have not yet seen Make sure you do.
