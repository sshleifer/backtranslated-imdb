A delightful story about two evacuees has been turned into a short film by the BBC. Most children who enjoy a good story will like this. The characters are played very well by a very good cast. I'm not sure if our American friends will like it, but they're mentioned, since Aunt Lou runs off with a handsome American soldier.
