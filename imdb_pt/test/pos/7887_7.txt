Unusual film about a man who befriends his social opposite for fear of blackmail. Peter Boyle makes this film with his coarse portrayal of a tough working class "Joe" in love with the past and fearful of the future and concerned about the present. The first half hour of the show features the movie debut of a young Susan Sarrandon as Melissa Compton, a rich and stubborn girl who enjoys her loser boyfriend, full of a scene of complete nudity. Her boyfriend is the weak spot in the film, a drug addict and poorly portrayed drug dealer who finds his death after Sarrandon's overdose. We meet Joe de Boyle in a bar while he talks about minorities, crimes, hippies and drugs, and it's easy to see that the character of Archie Bunker's television, based on Norman Lear, is based on a clean version of Joe. The comparison goes to Joe's wife, personal life, and hobbies. Joe insinuates himself into the life of Bill Compton, Melissa's father, and the two make an unlikely pair as they search for Melissa, who escaped the drug treatment and returned to the drug addicts she calls friends. Their quest leads them to a "rowing," as Joe calls it, a drug-fueled free love party, lots of nudity, and surprisingly, Bill Compton and Ultra Conservative Joe join them. They are stolen and this leads to violent violence. and final murderer who foresees the austere and creepy end of Taxi Driver six years later. Joe is a funny movie that, at least on the surface, is anti-violence and anti-racist. However, the main character of the film, Joe, becomes the instrument of the revolt he fears when he enters and joins the illegal and unbridled sexual excesses against which he complains. So in that regard, the film falls short of being a powerful message and leaves you wondering what the final result really meant.
