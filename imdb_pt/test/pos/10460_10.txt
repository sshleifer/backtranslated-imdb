There is no need to repeat the synopsis presented by Glenn. The black and white version is even more powerful in portraying the desolation of village life in the countryside at that time. Babette's deep measure of friendship toward the two older sisters touches the strings of the heart. The supporting cast is excellent and their performances are excellent, it would not be fair to single out a character, since the whole story depends on the cast as a whole. I do not know exactly why I rate this film so well, since I'm not a professional critic; individual viewers may or may not agree with my rating, since the pleasure of this type of film is always in the eyes of the beholder.
