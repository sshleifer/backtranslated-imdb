This movie for me and my wife is more fun than all the violent suspense / mystery / murder movies that abound. It's about real people making the best of their lives. They are simply Indian and the main characters are in the law. The realistic acting and the great scenario compensate for the little implausible plot. The soundtrack is BC Smith, who also did the soundtrack of Coyote Waits, and is great. Adam Beach plays a tribal cop who is somewhat prone to accidents and Wes Studi is the stoic professional detective. There are many other excellent roles of support or special participation by Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal, etc. We also saw Coyote Waits, another adaptation of a Hillerman novel, and we had a lot of fun too.
