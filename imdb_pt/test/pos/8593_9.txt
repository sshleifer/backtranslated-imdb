To answer a question from a previous reviewer who asked the name of the US official mentioned in "Lumumba," the character's name is "Mr. Carlucci." Frank Carlucci is reported to have been, at the time, the Second Secretary of the US Embassy in Congo. Later, among other duties, he was appointed US Ambassador to Portugal, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Secretary of Defense and now the President of the Carlyle Group. Not surprisingly, Carlucci's biographical sketch on his website www.carlylegroup.com is unable to credit his service in the Belgian Congo. If his name was deliberately censored from HBO's "Lumumba" version, it may have been to prevent HBO from being prosecuted in US courts. Carlucci's name, however, is clearly mentioned in the theatrical version of "Lumumba" I saw recently. In the event, I hope he denies any involvement in the Lumumba murder. Others commented on the fairness with which the film "Lumumba" deals with the parties involved: Lumumba fans, other Congolese, even Belgas. A slightly more sinister view comes, I think, from the BBC documentary entitled "Who Killed Lumumba?", Based on the Belgian historian Ludo de Witte's "The Murder of Lumumba." When examined closely, these films demonstrate that the fate of Lumumba and Congo's history is not just a matter of black and white. Only Lumumba's assassins believe that.
