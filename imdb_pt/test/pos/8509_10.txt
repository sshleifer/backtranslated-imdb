Many criticized Never Say Never Again for not being an official Bond movie. Nevertheless, it is clear that the producers have adhered to the fruitful Bond formula. Although the film does not have a pre-credits sequence, it is clear that the training exercise at the beginning of the film should be the introductory scene. It would have been impossible for EON to prevent producers from including a pre-credit and title sequence, although without the introduction of the barrel of the weapon. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is in good shape as the immortal secret agent and this movie is certainly better than Dr. No, Thunderball, you only live twice and the diamonds are forever. Although, the NSNA is a remake of Thunderball, it's a big improvement. 007 spends more time on dry land and a more diverse range of exotic locations are included in the film. <br /> <br /> There is some resplendent performance in this movie. Barbara Carrera is flawless as the bizarre Fatima Blush. One of the best scenes of the film is the coup de grace between Bond and Fatima in Nice, which is preceded by a dynamic motorcycle chase through the city. Klaus Maria Brandauer plays the psychotic Largo and Max Von Sydow is free of the melodrama that other actors portraying Blofeld surrendered. <br /> <br /> NSNA tends to focus more on Connery than on Bond's character. At first, Bond is said to be aging and out of action. This seems to refer to the 12-year hiatus in Connery's interpretation of Bond. Bond promises "never again" to work in the Secret Service; an allusion to Connery's portrait of Bond. It seems the producers were trying to undermine Bond's official franchise. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is worth watching. This is the last time Sean Connery played the role of James Bond, but his performance convinced me that maybe he should never have said "never again."
