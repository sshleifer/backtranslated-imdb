When I rented Batman Returns for the first time, I immediately thought it would be less than exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie? Simple, play Danny DeVito. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns is a darker movie than Batman. There are more villains here, less real dark comedy in many ways and more striking issues. However, the music is similar to the first, if not darker. The setting is definitely more depressing than the first, all the details until the time of year. This film follows the same format of comics that we started to love in the first Batman. <br /> <br /> Now for the presentations. Michael Keaton, fortunately, returns as Batman / Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first film, and both in this sequel. There has not been enough screen time in the world for Keaton as Batman, need more! Danny DeVito made an award-winning performance as The Penguin, the toughest, loathsome, lovable, angry, wicked, sad and pathetic villain who ever made a superhero movie. You hate him so much and feel so bad for him at the same time. And that explains even the last detail too, making it even more conflicting. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman / Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. She really does have a good amount of history back as well. Christopher Walken did not disappoint as Max Shreck, the company's greedy, judgmental and selfish CEO. Michael Gough also happily returns as the lovely Alfred, and he was also so good here. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, though I think he's never been in the limelight. <br /> <br /> With many twists and sub-plots, Batman Returns will surely please any fan of the original. 9/10
