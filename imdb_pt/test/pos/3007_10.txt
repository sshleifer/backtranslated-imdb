I started watching The Show around July. I found by mistake, I was surfing on the canal during the holidays. It's a great show, I just wish it was not so late at night. It's at 12:30. As a working person, it is difficult to keep watch all the time. <br /> <br /> I read some comments. I did not agree with the deceased about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that it could happen. <br /> <br /> I grew up in the 60's. I'm a Latin American and I had a "white boyfriend"; in addition, we had black friends in high school. I believe that people get along because of their interests and personalities and have nothing to do with a particular race or color. <br /> <br /> I can not wait until the program is released on DVD so I can buy it. This way I can see this from the beginning.
