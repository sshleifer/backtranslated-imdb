To be some kind of social commentary about how our lives were getting out of control in the 1970s, this movie looks more like something that Mr. Schlesinger played together after a bad day on the road. A mixture of stretches over the walnuts found along the road in Florida, and along the expressway of life, the cast is largely wasted and probably ended up on the court floor floor. The problem is that what did not end up on the cutting room floor probably should have! Now available on DVD, it's kind of fun to watch a comedy that would have cost $ 100 million to produce if it had been made in 2004. It keeps rolling and it's not too difficult to sit down, and strangely, in 2004 we are all still practically just hopping in our cars and going faster and faster, going nowhere.
