Yes. Watch this movie if you like brave movies. This is perhaps the best Mexican photo since Midaq Alley just because the cast excellent, the outrageous direction and a sublime soundtrack. Many people did not like 'Chronica', they think it is very aggressive, but they did not understand that it was just a representation with hyper-realism of Mexican society, but similar to all the families of the third world. I hope that Benjamin Cann and Bruno Bichir (who in this film give another example of his greatness as an actor) will soon be reunited with a new film. Just remember how Los Olvidados (Luis Bu√±uel) was misinterpreted when released, but now we consider one of the best films of all time. Please, get ready and watch this movie.
