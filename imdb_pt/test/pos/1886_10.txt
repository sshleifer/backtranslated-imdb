This is frighteningly funny (well, except when Bruce is in the hospital scene, which is a bit sad). <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Keach are excellent and are worth watching. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not a great budget-controlled blockbuster, but it's all it promises to be and more. and BTW - women are wonderful in their parts, although I do not know them from other movies, I would like to see them again. <br /> <br /> The two-brained walk scene is inspired and certainly a showcase for Bruce's great physical comedy - he's a hot guy! <br /> <br /> Thank you Bruce, for your brain, this is your baby!
