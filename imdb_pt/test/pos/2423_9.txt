*** SPOILERS *** Feeling lonely and in need of company, in addition to love, Frances Austen, Sandy Dennis, keeps all these emotions inside as she goes through life as a young single girl who has many high class friends. But because of her deep insecurity, she keeps them at a distance. As for Frances, male friends are not even close to her age, so she will have no reason to have any romantic involvement with them. <br /> <br /> One night when Frances was entertaining some of her friends, she saw, outside her apartment window, a young man, Michael Burns, sitting alone in the cold rain. Feeling that he is homeless and alone after his friends leave, Frances goes to the park and offers shelter for the young man in his house until the rain disappears and even stay to spend the night in a guest room she has. You can immediately see that Frances is more interested in just having the young man safely, out of the cold and the rain, so she wants to have you as a friend lover or even play toy for herself and as the movie progresses, you see that you were right. <br /> <br /> A truly incredible performance by Sandy Dennis, who in a way is very much like Kathy Bates' Oscar performance in the movie "Misery," which was made in 1990, about twenty-one years later . Frances thinking that the young man was alone and homeless, and later, when she met him, she changed the perfect person for her to have as a real friend. He is by no means the same or better than she as the friends she has, medical advocates, indigenous chiefs, and therefore is totally dependent on her. It turns out later that the young man is not the lonely, homeless man Frances thought he was. It is when she slowly discovers that he does not really need her, just as he, manipulating her, rather than the opposite, unleashes something on Frances's mind that turns out to be a compulsion of murderous proportions. <br /> <br /> A really strange film by director Robert Altman that goes deep into the depths of loneliness and depression of the human mind. Actress Sandy Dennis is perfect as the personality of Dr. Jekyll and Miss Hyde in her acting as the lonely but at the same time dangerous Frances Austen and it's a shame she has not only gotten an Oscar for her role in the film. but was not even indicated for that. Like most of Robert Altman's films, there seems to be a lot of improvisation between the actors in the film and in the impromptu dialogue especially between young Nina's sister Susanne Benton and her boyfriend Nick, David Garfield. The only thing in the movie that I found confusing is when we see Frances go to a city clinic for a complete gynecological examination and tells the doctor that she hopes to get married very soon. Was your husband the young man in her apartment? But in addition, the film sticks to the story very well and the ending is a real shock to the audience as well as to the young. When he finally, in the end, realizes that Frances is not only slightly off the wall, but also murderous and insane.
