If you watch this movie, you will be quoting and referring to it for a long time. It's been years since I've seen Dolemite and I still mention it to this day. It's a real classic. It's so horrifying it makes a hilarious view. Every terrible line of dialogue is totally incredible. Every hesitant shot a work of art (?). And every punch and kick so terribly run. You will not believe your eyes. That's all I can say. If I really like how fascinating this movie is, I will not be able to stop and I will exceed the one thousand word limit of IMDb. <br /> <br /> Please watch this movie. You will be in hysteria. 1/10 or 10/10, depending on your sense of humor.
