Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy, with heavy bittersweet tones, is a great match, pleasantly unexpected for Billy Crystal. This film has several serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both fun and serious, a film about love lost, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values ​​with a good deal of humor, especially in the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy is not always maintained as in the new classic genre of this type, but the true message and motivation for this film remains solid. Billy Crystal's discovery of Billy Crystal's talent / talent agent in Romania of a giant human is revealing and the vision behind the movie-agent scene is fascinating. However, the focus remains on sensitive bonds of love and learning about oneself. Eight of ten stars.
