Normally, Alan Alda plays characters who are very "soft" and overly verbal - it's probably how he really lives. This time, it fits the character. Although he exaggerates when the verdict is being handed down. <br /> <br /> The 1971 riot in the Attica jail and the response of the State of New York are remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists told the true story. This film provides a quick glimpse into the horrors and excesses associated with riot / Attica revolt. Attica had a great impact in this country. Maybe the movie will spur someone to research the story. <br /> <br /> I do not remember a feature film made from the perspective of the prisoners - although there is a large part of PBS with the current Attica survivors / participants. The perspective of the held hostage guards is explored in "Against the Wall" with Kyle MacLachlan, Samuel L. Jackson, Clarence Williams III and Frederic Forrest. <br /> <br /> Back in the past, we shouted: "Attica Attica! It was good to hear this in the film. <br /> <br /> Brought back memories. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie are the natural wigs that Morris Chestnut and the other African-Americans should use it. It would have been easy for these people to grow up.
