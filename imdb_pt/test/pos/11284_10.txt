A warning to potential viewers of this experimental film: the nature of the image and the effects are such that this is one of those types of films that really should be seen in the film, projected. The pixelation created by digital transfers sucks a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to already abstract and grainy films. However, since this movie is virtually unavailable in any format, I suppose you will have to settle for what you can. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this great artwork comes courtesy of the guy who would end up giving us Vampire Shadow. It's an obscure and dirty film of the genesis of the elements (as far as I can gather the names of the characters) through a horrifying and surreal process. Begotten is a good example of what is known as abject art, a stylistic approach that seeks more meaning through the visceral than the thematic. <br /> <br /> And visceral describes it. There is not much going on in the film technically, but the levels of emotion you'll face are countless. The very repeatability of some of the images creates a fascinating fascination about the senses. The particular sound and sheet music editing is immaculate, and they serve incredibly well images. <br /> <br /> Fans of this film would do well to check out the collections of short films released through the DVD of Other Movies, Experiments in Terror I, II and III. Films like these make me more and more certain that the realm of true horror lies in the abstract, abject and non-narrative, rather than in the scary tales of ghosts and ax murderers. <br /> <br /> PolarisDiB
