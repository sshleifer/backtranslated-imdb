Probably one of his lesser known films, he suffers from the same lack of exposure that Salvador, in fact, is one of his best. Written by and starring Eric Bogosian, Talk Radio tells the story of an opinionated radio phone host that disturbs the wrong kind of listener. The film is important, and has a lot to say about the issues of free speech and how free it should be, and you can easily say that life began as a play. Know what you are getting into before you sit down to watch it and you will be fine. <br /> <br /> There is not much to be interpreted as Bogosian practically steals the film, he wrote and is Excuse me to complain, I could not take his eyes off of him and that was part of the fascination that many of the listeners had; the people who hated him would not hang up if they lost something. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, but a very good drama and, overall, a very good movie.
