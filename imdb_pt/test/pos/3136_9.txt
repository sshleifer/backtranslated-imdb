This small image happens where many large photos fail. Because it was a small photo, John Ford was not harassed by the big wigs in the studio. He was happier with this movie than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of talented actors who played such an important part in his past successes. Some of them, like Ben Johnson, were discovered by Ford and had the opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma, who usually did his own stunt work. Years later, he would win the coveted Oscar for his brilliant performance in "The Last Picture Show." Ward Bond even beats Ben Johnson in this film. He is not the wagon master, this role is played by Johnson, but because of this film, he was later given the role of wagon master in the classic television series "Wagon Train." Ironically, one of the bad guys in Wagon Master, James Arness, would star in the hit series "Gunsmoke" in a rival "Wagon Train" network. Ward Bond portrays the Mormons' leader heading west, who often relapsed into his sinful days, cursing only to be called by fellow Mormon Adam Perkins (Russell Simpson). When some uncomfortable situation arises, Elder Wiggs (Ward Bond) shouts, "Blast your horn, Sister Ledeyard!" The Mormon sister, executed perfectly by Jane Darwell, blows so loud and loud that even the devil must have been shaken by the sound. Darwell and Simpson were famous for playing Ma and Pa Joad in the classic Ford version of John Steinbeck's novel "The Grapes of Wrath." Another of the great characters in the company of Ford was Hank Worden, who plays one of Uncle Shiloh Clegg's offspring sons is notoriously bad but not very bright. Worden would become famous a few years later for playing Mose in Ford's "The Searchers." Worden lived to be 91. He was still making movies when he died. <br /> <br /> Wagon master Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and his partner Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) are horse dealers who never accept their work. seriously, having a lot of fun along the way, especially with the local sheriff. They mingle with a Mormon wagon heading west. Ford's beloved Monument Valley is the setting for most of the film. The main reason for team-building is a redhead Mormon beauty, Prudence Perkins (Kathleen O'Malley), who catches Sandy's attention. Along the way, the train takes a coochie hoochie show which includes a quack doctor (Alan Mowbray) and two dirty angels (Joanne Dru and Ruth Clifford). Also joining along the way is the Clegg family, wanted for murder and armed robbery. Ford shows how strenuous the journey of the west by the wagon was in those days. <br /> <br /> The songs in the film were written by Stan Jones of the legendary Sons of the Pioneers. Jones' writing was almost as good as that of Bob Nolan, who had already done a good deal of writing for the group. Jones' most famous song, not in this movie, is the much-recorded "Ghost Riders In The Sky". The Sons of the Pioneers make the background singing in "Wagon Master". This increases the overall impact of wagons rolling to the west. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that acclaimed Native American athlete Jim Thorpe of Oklahoma plays the role of a Navajo leader. This was his last movie appearance. He died shortly after "Wagon Master" was released.
