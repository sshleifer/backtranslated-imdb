I remember this movie, it was the first movie I watched in the movies, the image was dark in some places, I was very nervous. It was in 74/75 that my father took me to the Newbury Cinema in Newbury Berkshire, England. I remember the tigers and the many snows in the film, also the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery, I think one of the tigers is shot and dies. If anyone knows where to find this on DVD etc please let me know. The cinema has now been transformed into a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema is now 20 miles away, I would hear from other people who saw this movie or any other similar.
