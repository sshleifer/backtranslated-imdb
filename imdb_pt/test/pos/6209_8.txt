The Power and Glory of Preston Sturgis was not seen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s, when it resurfaced and appeared on television. Meanwhile, he had gained notoriety because Pauline Kael's book THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that Herman Mankiewicz-Orson Welles's script for KANE was based on the Sturgis script. As mentioned at the beginning of this topic for the movie on the IMDb site, Kael exaggerates his case. There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the news (representing Ralston - the clone of Henry Luce), the memoirs of Thatcher, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane and Raymond, the butler. Each one has his different inclination in Kane, reflecting his faith or disappointment or hatred of man. And, of course, everyone also reveals their own shortcomings when they are telling their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlaps of recounts of the same incident. <br /> <br /> This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, as KANE is about a legendary business leader - here's Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who climbed up from under to be the head of the most successful rail system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are the right arm of Garner, Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the almost three-dimensional view we have in Kane's time in Garner. Henry, when he recounts, tells of his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in Henry. <br /> <br /> Typical example: Although he has worked his way up, Tom becomes increasingly anti-working in his later years. The unions are troublemakers, and he does not mind being held back by his mischief. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a major way, and how it troubled him to the detriment of his domestic life. But Henry's wife recalls how Tom used sarcasm and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up Union headquarters - killing many people). Then we have two visions of man, but one is pure white and one is pure black. <br /> <br /> I'm not really beating Power and Glory for not duplicating KANE's success (few movies do - including all of Orson Welles's other films), but I'm aware that the story is well presented enough to keep the interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the duo's worldly success is fully brought home. <br /> <br /> When they get married, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and family the benefits he never had. But in the United States, the success of big business comes at a cost. Tom is deeply involved with the working of the railroad empire (it expands and improves constantly). But that takes him a long way from home and he loses contact with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the youngest woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally discovers her unfaithful behavior, he destroys her. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Tom also gets a total shock (which makes him a martyr in Henry's eyes). Eva marries Tom and presents him with a son - but ends up being Eve's son by Tom's son, Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous horn makes Tom kill himself. <br /> <br /> The film is not a total success - the action sometimes skips unconvincingly. However, it makes the deal look real (note the scene in which Tom tells his board about his plans to buy a small rival rail line and discusses the use of debentures to fund the plans). Sturgis came from a rich background, so he could bring that kind of detail. So overall, it's a top-notch movie. No Citizen Kane maybe, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in America's Depression.
