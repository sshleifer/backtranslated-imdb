<br /> <br /> This is the best fake documentary of a dog show I've seen in a long time. Long time. Well, let's face it, ever. Is not that part of the charm? The idea of ​​really taking the trouble to make a movie mocking a documentary about an event that most people would find strange in the first place. Even if there were no big laughs, it would still be a smile at the thought. Any movie that tries something new wins a lot in my proverbial book. I loved the dogs too!
