At school, I was taught how some shots were called and there were two constantly mentioned directors: Orson Welles and Sergei M. Eisenstein. I did not care that much (I was a child!) But now I know why, Eisenstein is a genius and it is a shame to see what was possible in 1938, where almost more than half a century we are stuck countless blank films! Some say that this film is not worth Eisenstein's genius (so they have to watch it over and over until they can say something bad) or worse yet, it's just an advertisement for the Russians. Let's say as it is, it's actually pure propaganda for patriotism, but is not it "saving Ryan private" or "The longest day" like that? I could summarize so many films in which America is being raised to the top, so why not Russia, and beyond all war is waged by your patriotism, why else would they raise flags? Aleksandr Nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography, since almost all the pictures are sublime pictures. Maybe it's all supervised but I'm amazed that this is not included in IMDB's Top 250 where there are so many overcated Oscarcrap in it as well.
