This movie was a great Universal Monster movie. Once again, starring Lon Chaney as The Wolfman and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's monster. Oh yeah, that idiot John Carradine is back like Dracula. I like all the actors in this movie. I especially liked Onslow Stevens as Dr. Edelmann. (It's written with 2 ns) I thought it was a good idea to have the good doctor heart condemned as Talbot was. One scene that I think is very good is the scene where Dr. Edelmann is deeply thoughtful while he changes. Everything that's bothering flashes before your eyes. Good doctor is saying not as his bad side is saying yes. That's the only reason I did not want Dracula to be completely eliminated from that movie. I thought Dracula had no business at the Frankenstein House. If your character was taken, you would not miss it. In this film the doctor's blood is contaminated with Dracula, giving him his curse Jekyll and Hyde. I hate John Carradine and I think he should never have played Dracula. I did not care about other actors playing the Frankenstein Monster after the great Karloff, because they all did good work. But when they catch another actor to play Dracula, he stops there. John Carradine thought he was so tall and powerful. They offered him the role of the Monster Frankenstein once and he refused because he thought he was highly trained. I could just imagine Carradine if he played The Monster arguing with the director on set, "I do not have to take it from you, I did Shakespeare." John Carradine was not Dracula and he will never be. Sorry John, Bela Lugosi is the first and only Dracula. Thank God they got Bella back as Dracula for Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie. It does not disappoint you and you will have fun as you did the other. This is a very good addition to the monster movies. If you are a collector, do not leave this one here. <br /> <br />
