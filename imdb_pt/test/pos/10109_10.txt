The beauty. The terror Poetry. The horror. The innocence. The guilt. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's almost everything I should write in this review for A TALE OF TWO SISTERS. The best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it. I did not even know one thing about the story of the two girls when I joined this film. I just took a look at the beautiful cover, did not read the synopsis on the back and put it on the DVD player. I just knew that I was getting several prices at festivals around the world and that this was highly recommended. The DVD cover said: "The scariest movie since THE RING, THE GRUDGE and DARK WATER". Although the scary part may be right, you can forget the rest, because the only thing that has in common with this movie is ... a ghostly apparition with long black hair. It's even unfair to compare it to the famous Japanese films because this Korean movie has a lot more to offer and is actually a bit more complicated and intelligent than the others. <br /> <br /> This film is simply a little masterpiece, and here are some reasons (without saying anything about the plot): The movie itself caught me off guard at least twice with clever twists. And when you think you've come to the conclusion (whether you understand it or not, that's irrelevant at the moment) and you think the movie will end ... this movie will take a little longer. The cinematography is incredible, using bright colors during the day and dark tones at night. The work of the camera is excellent, with the director sometimes picking up impressive angles, if not innovators. Some shots are pure poetry (eg the top shot with the two sisters on the lake). Everything looks very elegant. There are only four main characters, but the intrigue around them is intense. The story itself starts a little slow, but there's plenty of variety of tones and emotions to keep it interesting. There was even a scene (when the girls went to the lake) that suddenly reminded me of Peter Jackson's CELESTIAL CREATURES. But when the horror comes into play, it's quite effective. There are also some very successful surprises in it. Damn, I jumped off my couch. The music score is great, and sometimes when it should not be scary, I could not help but notice that it had a kind of Italian feeling. A little strange for a Korean movie. But nevertheless, a great score. So much care has gone into every detail of this film, including perfectly balanced surround sound. <br /> <br /> I also think that calling A TALE OF TWO SISTERS just a horror movie does not give enough credit. It's another mysterious horror drama that works both psychologically and supernaturally. No matter how you look, this is the Asian terror that is among the best. It may not be bloody, but it gets pretty scary at times and the subject is quite disturbed. So if you have not seen it then find a copy, put it on your DVD player, follow the stream and be sure to give this movie your full attention for 110 minutes in length. <br /> <br /> There, I hope to have done a good job praising you without ruining anything.
