The only Zeppelin footage I've seen before this DVD is the movie 'The Song Remains the Same' from 1976. We used to spend hours around a friends house watching this, but I never liked it and hated fantasy sequences. .. So, what about this DVD? I did not know it existed until I looked for the Physical Graffiti CD ... 'When did that leave?' I thought <br /> <br /> For some reason I thought Page was not a great live guitarist, but to say watching this DVD changed my mind is a huge euphemism. <br /> <br /> There's 'White Summer' from 1970 - 10 minutes of guitar magic. <br /> <br /> There's a 1975 acoustic set - 'Bron-y-aur Stomp' has a shiny finger. Choose the improvisation section. <br /> <br /> The performances of 'In My Death' and 'Trembling under the Feet' (also 75) are breathtaking - with Page and Bonham doing things in pieces like no one else has ever done. Demonic possessions of rawk !! <br /> <br /> The magic continues in the 1979 Knebworth section. The interpretation of 'Achillies Last Stand', considering its various drug addicted states, has just begged the belief! A song from complex guitar overdubs, Page arranged in a way that allows it to just 'punk out' live - the effect is totally hypnotizing. 'In the Evening' - I never liked that on the record, but it's coming through here. "Sick again" - great piece of sleaze rock. The filming of Knebworth is very interesting, cutting between big screen, several faces and filming pirates with great effect. <br /> <br /> The plant is amazing in all presentations. Page, despite being painfully thin, looks like a six-year-old kid having the most fun of his life at Knebworth's concert - and makes an infectious display. <br /> <br /> One thing that intrigued me - The 'Black Dog' performance of 1973 sounds very 'encampado' !! Robert Plant has always loved a little 'mince' and these jeans are absolutely ridiculous - and would justify a prison nowadays. All very different from the muscle-bound kick-a studio version. <br /> <br /> I love this DVD. It reminded me how Zeppelin was good and remains.
