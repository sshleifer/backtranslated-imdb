There were some harsh criticisms of Comanche Moon in IMDb. I think this is for three reasons. First, the purists are disappointed that the miniseries is not exactly like the book. Secondly, it is not as good as the original Solitary Dove. Finally, people like to complain about IMDb and the biggest movies in the world will have bad comments. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say that no movie will be as good as the book. This is how it is. Lonesome Dove was not as good as the novel on which it was based. In addition, the Lonesome Dove movie had some things left out and changed. That's just the way it's going to be with a cinematic adaptation of anything. So it's a futile argument when you look at Comanche Moon. <br /> <br /> I agree that it is not as good as the original Dove. But hey, nothing is. I know people who guide their lives through the lessons they learned from Dove. If I were to compare every book I read, the movie I watched and the TV I saw on Lonesome Dove; I would be perpetually unhappy. <br /> <br /> This is a made for TV miniseries based on a prequel to Lonesome Dave (the novel) and sequel to Deadman Walk, and that's what you get. It's the best TV I've seen in years. It's fun for the Lonesome Dove. We learned about the history of the Rangers we know and love in Dove. Zahn does an incredible job rebuilding Gus McCrae. Elizabeth Banks and Linda Forenelli (sp?) They also do great jobs like creating characters that help fill the past of the rangers and Newt. <br /> <br /> If / when it happens again, I promise you'll like it is more than a crumby reality show.
