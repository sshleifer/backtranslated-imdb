Would you like to know why Frenchmen and Italians love / hate each other? Would you like to get a glimpse of the story that drives our life? So go watch Virzi's film (in the original language, of course) and you can look at a wonderful Monica Bellucci who finally speaks her native language of Citt√† di Castello (Umbria, just on the border with Tuscany). And the rest of the characters talking Livornese (lovely Sabrina Impacciatore and all the others). Daniel Auteuil definitely in his shoes with Napoleon. Lots of fun, a real fresco of the Elba Island landscape and a picture of the political reasons for killing or letting a tyrant live (good for all times).
