When the circus arrives in town and puts the lion's cage directly over the house of Bugs Bunny, Bugs ends up somewhere in the midst of scared and intrepid. Despite the title "Acrobatty Bunny", it is only at the end when Bugs and the lion do acrobatics. But even leading to this, it's very funny what Bugs does to escape being eaten; somehow he always manages to use the weakness of the other character against him, and then pulls any convenient object out of nowhere! Bugs later ended up at the circus in "Big Top Bunny". I liked this better, since the latter reduced the drug a bit by giving the antagonist an Eastern European accent (I know it was during the Cold War, but still). I highly recommend this one. <br /> <br /> And with the end, we can state that it will never be Aloha Oe for this cartoon.
