The Aristorcats is a hilarious movie that many people have not seen. Clearly not that many because it only has a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with that. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic movies already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and Peter Pan. The reason the Aristorcats are so high on my list is because of how funny the movie is. I hate to say it, but I do not blame Edgar for what he does. I would probably have taken care of them too. I'd be devastated by an old purse I'd been working with so many years ago and decided to give her will to the cats. I'd kill them too. I do not even like cats, so I would not give a damn. I think the Aristorcats are so cute and cute. There are many characters that are hilarious, like Edgar. The Aristorcats is my favorite of the Disney classics, and this is final. The Cat is out of the bag. <br /> <br /> The Aristocats: **** / ****
