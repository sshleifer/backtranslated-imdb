Speaking relatively, if anyone had now seen "Pixote" by Hector Babenco (1981, pronounced "pi-shot") after having seen a large number of films dealing with street children, juvenile delinquents, children in distress (Truffaut's " The 400 Blows, "Bunuel's" Los Olvidados ", De Sica's" Shoeshine ", Nair's" Salaam, Bombay ", Bresson's" Mouchette ", Nugroho's" Leaf on a Pillow ", etc.) fear that the suffering of the boy portrayed in the film may not affect one more, having been "de-synthesized" already after going through the thrilling roller coaster driven by the films previously mentioned. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this will not be the case. Babenco narrates his film in such a realistic way ("unthinkingly," as a movie reviewer put it, in a positive light) and that his central son, Fernando Ramos da Silva (13 at the time and a street kid), gives a performance so bad, wounded, raw in its simplicity (that face hardened, those eyes lonely and anxious) that it is difficult not to be pierced in any way. (Such a feeling can reach such a high realism when it is discovered that the child only had a short life, having been involved in street crime after the film and then murdered.) In the first half of the film, Pixote and his street mates and delinquents spend their time in a repressive state reform school where brutalization and humiliation, rape and murder are the norm and culture, where they are forced to confess their "crimes" in the fragile notion that, under Brazilian law, juvenile offenders are not "punishable" for their offenses. For these children, the dubious freedom offered by the streets is more preferable than the harsh rehabilitation offered by these so-called well-meaning authorities. Within the walls of this supposed protective establishment, these young souls will soon discover that the love and care of parental figures is also found nowhere, if not to a worse degree. <br /> <br /> (For Pixote, the only form of escape comes from steaming grass and sniffing glue, secretly smuggled inside the reformatory.) <br /> <br /> When the children exploded in a "revolt" small-scale to finally express and then fulfill their collective desire to return to the outside world - their "home" - the intensity and form are such that one can not help thinking of the boys' uprising in the influential "Zero for Conduct" scored by Jean Vigo. It's just that in "Pixote", the "insurrection" is made to appear on a gutter level. <br /> <br /> Since Pixote and her small group are back on the streets (the second half of the movie), they engage in robbery, prostitution and drug dealing to take care of themselves, along which they can find Sueli, a beaten but kind prostitute. Sueli willingly accommodates the four lost souls in such a way that she allows her clients to be stolen by them and that she provides more than maternal care (at least for one child). <br /> <br /> I thought street children have finally found the only person who can provide them with the love and warmth they lack in their lives. But as dubious as the freedom these children believe the streets are providing, this newly discovered "maternal figure" can not but remain forever. Envy, fights, differences and murders only separate children - and forever. And during that defining scene where Pixote, motivated by circumstance, manages to shoot not only Sueli's arrogant American client but also his street friend Ditto (more than a son of Sueli), he literally goes back to "childhood" as he sucks on the right breast of the disoriented woman, right there, materializing his persistent desire for affection from his parents, his own sad and disturbing image. <br /> <br /> It is so that Sueli, in a likely return to his "senses", lamentably alienate Pixote from his "nourishing" position and reject it, forever. So, in a quietly painful moment, Pixote, with that youthful face and those dark eyes (not totally different, albeit in a different context, to the expression of the young man in the harrowing "Come and See") of Elem Klimov, rises. , puts on his coat and picks up his gun (yes, a gun!) and heads off to nothingness, walking on the train tracks and with the morning light beginning to appear. With this scene, Babenco may just be paying homage (among many other honors found in different movies!) To the final iconoclast scene of Truffaut's "400 Strokes". <br /> <br /> But as we began to know what became of Antoine Doinel, three years later, in the short film "Antoine et Colette" (as well as in three other films in the following years), we stayed in the dark in what concerns Pixote's head after he finally disappears from the last frame, this being the last time we'll see this real-life street kid (despite the fate that eventually hit him nowadays). "Pixote" may not be nearly as capricious as "The 400 Strokes" or as hallucinatory as "Los Olvidados", but it still stands out among similar theme and texture films because of its power simple and raw.
