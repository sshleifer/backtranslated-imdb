Alien Warrior (or King of the Streets) is one of those 80's jewels you encounter by mistake, then you watch in wonder, amazed at how wonderfully silly and exaggerated it is. <br /> <br /> A strange alien arrives. on earth (LA to be exact) and stumbles into a world of corrupt drug dealers, gangs and cops. He falls in love with the beautiful blonde-haired teacher who just wants to help the children of the city center read more. He also manages to infuriate a drug dealer smelling cocaine that promises to destroy him. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this movie at first preview ... it sure is ridiculous, silly and low budget. But you can tell the filmmakers that they had the heart in the right place and fuck it if it does not work! I just pray for it to be on DVD soon. <br /> <br /> There's a hot soundtrack, dance break, violence, nudity ... all with a positive and healthy message! Look.
