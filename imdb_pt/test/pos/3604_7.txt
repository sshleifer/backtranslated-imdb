A nice and pleasant film full of Mediterranean landscapes (Cephallonia is a very beautiful Greek island) that retains many of the characteristics of the novel. I think Greek scenarios add something special and magical to a movie. One thing I did not like though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father, were not Greek actors, but foreigners. I mean, the actors tried to express the Greek way of life, but for me they were not successful and it was very clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use Greek words was terrible and that was bad for the plot of the movie. Irene Papas was really great in her role, a typical example of a mother living on an island during the 1940s, who lost her husband and tries to live a child by herself. John Hurt, father of Pelagia, also acted very well. He reminded me of a Greek in many of his reactions.
