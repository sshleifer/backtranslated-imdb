What kind do I say about this movie? well for beginners, I thought this movie was good, not the greatest or the worst. I said that because I found the script great and original, very different and refreshing. Now I would not say it's the biggest movie I see because of the acting. The actors who played each role, it seems that they touched them without emotions, as if they took the life of them. When the wife laughed or cried, that did not seem real to me for some reason, that's just an example, but honestly all the characters did not really act. I wish I could say more positive things about this movie so you can see it at least once, but how can I do that, since I know I will not see this movie again. I rented this movie from my school library without hearing anything about the movie itself or the director. I ventured because the story that was described on the back sounded really interesting and really was.
