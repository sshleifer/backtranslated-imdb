I watched this movie because of Costas Mandylor and Lauren Holly. I adored them together in picket fences, so it was a pleasure to see them together again. This was not the best movie of all time, but it was cute. Very predictable, but sometimes amusingly fun movies are exactly what I need. <br /> <br /> The desserts were beautiful, and I wanted to eat them all. I loved it when it collapsed. I bet it still tasted good. <br /> <br /> Costas and Lauren still had the great chemistry they had at Picket Fences, and I fainted when they kissed in that movie. <br /> <br /> I would not see it again, but it was a great filling for one night.
