The director loves the actress and shows. The actress lives the character, whom we love at first sight and sound. The character loves his husband jealous and without appetite and he loves her. His childhood friend secretly loves his wife and the fact that his friend is a beautiful woman makes love tragic and ironic. His wife is jealous of her childhood friend and thinks her attentions are out of secret love for her husband. <br /> <br /> So there's a murder and the lieutenant police investigator, who loves only his bi-racial son, and resents being taken from his company by the characters above, who had some unpleasant contact with the deceased and are all lying to one degree or another, unravel the mystery with some of the most accurate and authentic procedural details ever captured in the film. And then there are the atmospheres of a post-war Paris where coal is scarce, music is filled with erotic desire and melancholy memory, and innocence has long been washed away by the rain. All this in an environment of wizards whose tricks do not always work, dogs that walk on their hind legs and express criticism of music, hungry reporters and exhausted police officers. <br /> <br /> And then there are many of the best actors of his generation who have gone through some very bad things driven by ars, to come full circle, a man who is passionate about his leading actress and who, with full justification, was a respected friend of Picasso. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times and I love them all and this.
