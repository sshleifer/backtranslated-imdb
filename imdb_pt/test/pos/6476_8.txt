The result is a vibrant image of the man responsible for the legacy of high school sports, Knute Rockne. <br /> <br /> The film features Rockne from his humble origins in Chicago for his studies at the notorious Notre Dame University in South Bend. Indiana. He was an ambitious man who had a vision about how the game should be played. Fortunately, he went to give his beloved Notre Dame the glory he was behind. <br /> <br /> Pat O'Brien looks a little older when he starts out as a freshman. In fact, it does not change much over the course of the movie, but he is just like Mr. Rockne. Pat O'Brien shows that he could inspire the players under him just by being a paternal figure. Gale Page plays Bonnie Rockne, the wise woman who understood her husband's calling in life.
