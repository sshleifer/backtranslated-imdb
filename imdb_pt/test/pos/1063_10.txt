It's fun and fast, because one falsehood leads to another and the other to an inevitable and surprising conclusion. Suspense separates this vacation movie from everyone else. One can imagine how the pieces will fit, both during the film and in the future. <br /> <br /> The actors of the character laid the foundations and entertained us in the process. Sinkewicz (Frank Jenks) shows us what manipulation can get ... and finally what manipulation can cost! Uncle Felix (SZ Sakall) evaluates each person for us as we try to protect "Lishka" (Barbara Stanwyck), and this helps us to decide who we will twist in the end. <br /> <br /> If we could reach a perfect world, imperfect people would probably have to go through a series of events like these. <br /> <br /> A glaring weakness is that the fake baby cries after allegedly swallowing Uncle Felix's watch. I heard more authentic crying of a doll in a toy store. <br /> <br /> Look, and you really feel like you're somewhere!
