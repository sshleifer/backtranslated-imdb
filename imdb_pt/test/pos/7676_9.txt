I've been looking for this movie for years. I have great memories of acting and first-rate singing in this movie. I never knew that the reason the movie was inaccessible was because of the actions of the Gershwin family - SHAME AT them for trying to crack down on American Classic !! I can only hope they yield and allow this film to be released and enjoyed by the American public. <br /> <br /> Sammy Davis, Jr. is at his absolute best in this movie. The only other performance of it was that it was like 'Anna Lucasta' - another great movie that I wish it was released on DVD. <br /> <br /> Porgy & Bess contained a first-class cast film. I hope one day you can see for yourself.
