"Chips" is an excellent blend of music, light comedy and drama with a perfect performance of Peter O 'Toole and an effortless romantic performance of Petula Clark. The 'Toole' is able to show the shy and unconomic teacher who wants so much to be loved by his students and is only able to express his love when he married Katherine (Clark). She brings to him the world "That many flowers" and it is changed forever. He becomes the beloved director of Brookfield through tragedy, but knows that he could only have achieved his goal through Katherine's love. The songs (with the exception of the Music Hall number) are all "thinking songs" from the character's emotions and thoughts, and the more you hear them, the more beautiful they become - "Walk the world with me" and "You and I ". O'Toole's best moment is the final speech he gives the students (which was the reason for the Oscar nomination). As a teacher, we question what the "book" learns - but, as Chips says, we teach them how to behave with each other and that's what really counts. Beautifully filmed, perfectly orchestrated by John Williams and one of the most moving films about love and how it can change you. "Did I fill the world with love?" The boys sing the school music. In the end, Chips realizes he was able to do it - but only because Catherine was there.
