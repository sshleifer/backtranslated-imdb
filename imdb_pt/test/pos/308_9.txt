Well, I watched this movie for over 25 years and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most original films of all time. <br /> <br /> I still think Martin Sheen was also "big" on billing. He dominates the movie even has less billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hour and 17 minutes (theatrical version). How unfair is that? <br /> <br /> Sheen is fantastic here, especially her narration, which spreads everywhere. It's one of the best stories, if not the best, I've heard in a movie. His voice is just haunting as he reports his thoughts on this incredible nightmare adventure. I never cease to enjoy your work in this movie. <br /> <br /> The other thing that impresses me in the movie over the years is the number of memorable scenes I have never forgotten, such as .... Sheen lost in his hotel room in the first scene of the movie; Robert Duvall and the surfing scenes totally out of place and then the ensuing attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music coming out of the helicopters; The Playboy rabbit entertaining the troops; Frédéric Forrest is startled to see a tiger approaching in the jungle; the strange scenes on the long boat ride; the emergence of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greeting the crew in Cambodia and then the bizarre character of Brando. It continues and continues with strange scenes. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that I liked everything. No, there are some very nasty scenes, like one in which an ox is cut in half (can not watch anymore), an innocent family is slaughtered in a small boat by the young Sheen crew, and crew is a bit too goofy at times. So there's a huge amount of profanity, led by many terms. <br /> <br /> So there are a lot of good and bad things in this movie for almost everyone who watches this. One thing is certain: it's a movie you'll remember!
