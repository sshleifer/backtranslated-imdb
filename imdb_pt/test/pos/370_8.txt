In my incessant quest to see as many quality movies as possible during my life, I came across this movie on cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before that, and never felt that the man's work matched the praise he received. I always felt he was good, not great (from what I saw) This was the best of his films I've seen so far. Robert Walker is absolutely chilling, his performance takes the film where Hitchcock wanted it to be. Even an average performance here harms the total product. My favorite scene was his obsession with taking the lighter out of the drain (how exactly does he get his arm down there?) Bruno is a very attractive character, but I also loved Patricia Hitchcock's performance as Barbara. The rest of the Morton family, as well as Guy, were a bit dry and boring, but it added some sparkle to the film, as well as having some of the best lines in the script. <br /> <br /> Finally, in any thriller, you will live and die by its end. This holds water, unlike some other Hitchcock movies I've seen. I really was not sure how it would end, which kept me on the edge as I watched and waited.
