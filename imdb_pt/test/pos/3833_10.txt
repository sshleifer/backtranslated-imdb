Despite all the fuss about the episode THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES, THE BALANCE OF TERROR may just be the best episode of the series. And while I've always loved PIECE OF THE ACTION because it's so much fun, I really have to vote like this Romulan episode as being the best. <br /> <br /> The film, oddly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie as it goes back and forth between the hooded Romulan ship and the Enterprise in an attempt to destroy the Romulans before they return to the Neutral zone after an attack to the outposts of the Federation. In many ways, the show is very much like the movie THE ENEMY BELOW - where the American captain (Robert Mitchum) and the German captain (Curt Jurgens) are shown in counterpoint, as they both try to trick the other - and in the process they develop a reluctant respect for the enemy. <br /> <br /> Curiously, just a little bit of the beginning of the episode happens on a planet - and this is incredible because an episode aboard the ship could easily have been static and monotonous. But because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters wrote and acted as well (Shatner and Mark Leonard as the Romulan leader). Strangely enough, for the diehard Trekkers out there, they'll recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played Spock's father. <br /> <br /> The result is that this is simply a great and extremely interesting episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
