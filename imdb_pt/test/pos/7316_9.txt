Everyone's favorite trio of clumsy jerks run wild in a hospital in this incredibly hoarse and often hysterically funny prank. These guys are undoubtedly the most incompetent bunch of doctors who have ever fumbled on the screen. The comic strips include the Stooges constantly breaking a window pane, his meeting with a demented patient who claims that rats used to come out of the buttonhole of his shirt, the Stooges walking down the aisles on a giant bike, a huge horse, and miniature racing cars, and our sublimely stupid trio accidentally dropping instruments inside the abdomen of an unfortunate patient after they finish operating the poor guy. Director Ray McCarey recounts the frantic comic antics at a restless, uninterrupted pace and plays the big jokes with considerable enthusiasm. Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Curly Howard are all in great shape with the support of Dell Henderson as Dr. Graves Hospital supervisor, Jeanie Roberts as a solitary nurse (the scene in which the Stooges make nonsense the improvised group singing with this girl is absolutely nosy!), Ruth Hiatt as a whispering nurse, Billy Gilbert as the crazy patient and "Little Billy" Rhodes as a tiny, grumpy patient. The witty madness never leaves for a minute, making this beautifully berserk baby one of the Stooges' best ever rides.
