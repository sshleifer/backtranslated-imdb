The numbers do not lie, 109 people voted for this movie. That says a lot about the position of one of the most intuitively insightful comedians of the late twentieth century. And for those of you who know the work of Bill Hicks, if he were alive today, imagine what he would have to say about the boy president of his home state? That his short career is not recognized is a sad situation and this film, or rather, these two films explain why. First, you see how his talent was obvious from the start, over and over again, those who knew Bill Hicks always said that he was not just funny, he was also unique. The film also shows how the quality of their material was very challenging for many in the entertainment industry. His drink also contributed to his career problems, but this is less evident in this film. And then the second movie is a complete performance. If you've never seen or heard Bill Hicks, this is a wonderful introduction to the person and his dark but clever humor. Especially due to the fact that the topics are now almost 14 years old, still remain ironically updated is underlined by the fact that many of the events occurred under the first President Bush. Watching them together - first the biography and then the performance - makes you realize just how talented this youngster was, how quickly his life went by and how the American media can sometimes act as the great homogenizer. Let's make sure nothing is too provocative, nothing will be very interesting. And the result? Well, as the man himself said, go to sleep America, your government is in control ........... In your life, at least in Britain, this artist was recognized for his talent and was successful over there. 11 years after his death, 109 people on IMDb can say something about the movie. After seeing both, I hope you understand why more people should be listening to Bill Hicks.
