I saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when I was on HBO and I loved it !! It was so hilarious I've seen it many times to tell. I love the Stork brothers and the ugly and ugly dog ​​Bosco! My favorite quote from the movie is, "It's so ugly it should be put to sleep." I also loved it when the little sister hit the girls on the back and their faces were like that. I love John Cusack and Demi Moore in this movie as well. They were great. This movie brings back memories of my college days when I first saw it. I have rented the movie countless times and watched it several times. My classmate and I could not get enough. Who could not love this crazy movie ?! I want to buy a copy on DVD, does anyone know where I can get it?
