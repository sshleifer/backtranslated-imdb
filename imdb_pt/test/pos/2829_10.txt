And that's saying a lot. Rent this if you want to be surprised by the strangeness, impressed by one of the most bizarre scripts, direction and cast in movie history. I'm staggering. I can not believe I saw it. I'm a big Bernadette Peters fan, usually, but that tested my resolve. Do not read any comment here, it's best that you do not know anything about the plot. Just rent. You will not believe what you see ...
