People need to give this show a chance. People who write bad reviews (they are very few) are clearly people who have not seen too many episodes. You really need to sit back and watch this show to enjoy it. All characters are realistic because they have many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC errors, which is an unusual thing to see on television today. Moreover, for the most part, the acting is superb. Lauren Graham was despised by an Emmy six years ago. Someone needs to give this woman the credit she deserves. The same goes for Kelly Bishop, who plays Emily Gilmore so perfectly. Also, it's good to see a show that may have a young girl in the center of it, and not be filled with teen angst. Rory is a smart girl, who is not seen on television either. If only other shows could capture the wholeness of this show ...
