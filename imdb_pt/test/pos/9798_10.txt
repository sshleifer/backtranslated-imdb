Young Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello stand out in this great film about two boys who promised to "take care of their mother" and how they deal when their new stepfather starts beating the younger boy. The support cast around the boys is top notch as well. The script really enters the mind and heart of an imaginative child. It's hard to believe that Wood can grow up to look like Tom Hanks, but that's nothing new in Hollywood. This is honestly my only criticism of the film.
