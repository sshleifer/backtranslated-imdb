This is my first Deepa Mehta movie. I saw the movie on TV in its Hindi version with its character "Sita" presented as Nita. I also notice that it is Radha who has suffered the allegorical judgment by fire in the film and not Nita / Sita. However, what I loved about the film was the screenplay of Ms Mehta, not her direction. The characters, large and small, were well developed and looked quixotic in the end - a bit like the end of "An Unmarried Woman" by Mazursky. They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. And a cardboard man (Ashok) seems to be alive in the last scene we see of him - carrying his invalid mother Biji. He seems finally to assume a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherence to religion. Mrs. Mehta seems to be in trouble as a director (however, compared to most traditional Indian cinema she seems to be brilliant), since she can not use the script to go beyond the microscopic family that presents, except presenting A glimpse of the Chinese micro-minority in the social environment of India. She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter (not to her father!) However, her Radha is reminiscent of happy days with her parents in a mustard field. Compare it to Mrinal Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Muzaffar Ali and she is overshadowed by these giants - given their competent Canadian production team and financial resources! Mehta's film of two bisexual women in an Indian middle-class house may be sacrilegious to some, but it only captures the atrophy of middle-class households that do not seem to aspire to anything better than their immediate survival in a limited social space. Kannada, Malayalam and Bengali films played parallel themes in India but did not have the publicity surrounding this film and therefore were not seen by a broad segment of knowledgeable moviegoers. <br /> <br /> Ms Das, Ms Azmi Jafri and Kharbanda are credible, but not exceptional. Ms Azmi is a talented actress who has given superb performances under good directors ("Khandar" by Mrinal Sen, "Paar" by Gautam Ghose, "Ankur" by Benegal) a glow remarkably absent in this film. Ms Das shone because of her onscreen presence rather than her acting ability. All in all, the strength of the film remains in the structure of the script that is above average in terms of international cinema. I'm sure Ms Mehta can perfect her talents in her future scripts.
