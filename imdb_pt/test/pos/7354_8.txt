After the return of "scary movies" (come on, Scream is not scary!) I had no high hopes for this three-story, low-budget horror film. But I was positively surprised! Dude this is scary !!! The first two stories are simply brilliant. The first about a new couple who was driving in a dark forest with their RV, When they bumped into a ferocious ........ (watch the movie)! The second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl who is alone at home for one night ... I know it does not sound anything special, but it's scary. I promise. The last story is not scary, but at least not bad. It's about a biker and a ghost house. In fact, the stories are based on real urban legends (I think Kevin Williams can also steal ideas). Renting this movie is good !!! I would say it is the scariest horror movie of three short stories ever made!
