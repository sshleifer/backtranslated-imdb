The third movie I watched at the philly film festival was this drama from Japan. After fleeing from prison, nine convicted fugitives plan to find the "key to the universe" that a tenth convicted who has not left said to them. Along the way, we know each of these men well. Everyone has their own dreams. For much of the film, it seems to be mostly a comedy, but a change occurs that the film ends up being a tragedy. All the actors give great performances. I can not say much more without ruining the film, but suffice it to say that you end up feeling for some of these individuals. At 2 o'clock, this movie is a little long, but good anyway. I have no qualms recommending it with the warning that there is violence a little disturbing to the sensitive heart. Toshiaki Toyoda hit a home-run this time, and it makes me want to look for his previous films, as well as look forward to his futures. <br /> <br /> My notes: A
