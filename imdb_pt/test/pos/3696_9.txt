Jenny Lewis plays a clumsy girl named Jade. She smokes and drinks. She does not have many friends and has a boring mother (Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing up near her mother's boyfriend, Billy (Rob Estes), maybe she'll be attracted to him. Of course, I do not need to tell you what happens after that. <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is guilty. This movie also has the best acting I have ever seen in TV movies. Beverly D'Angelo does a great job as a sweet and loving but negligent and blind mother. She could not see what was happening under her own roof. Rob Estes is at his best here as the sleazeball. Jenny Lewis is the highlight. She seems to be exactly like your character. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems to love this movie!
