This movie was a lot better than I expected. + + + + Jean Peters really does a passable job as a pirate and does a decent job in his sword fights. (To the extent that she can have a double doing the action, it's hard to say ... but Peters herself is obviously doing a good part of it, and doing it well.) + + + + With a good and serious script, this one could have been an excellent movie. But it's basically extravagant. Still fun though. ++++ Not even a regular film by Jacques Tournier, but definitely above a regular film by Jean Peters. Color is typical of this time period of the 1950s, ie. very gaudy and unrealistic. The actors of Blackbeard and his first companion and the drunken doctor were good. Louis Jordan was a little weak. I do not think Debra Paget was right either. But certainly Jean Peters and Debra Paget were probably the two most beautiful female stars of the fifties.
