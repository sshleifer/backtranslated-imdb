I had borrowed Sarah's three films from a friend and watched them while I was sick in bed for a weekend. I really enjoyed each one of them. I liked how the last film gave a glimpse of what Caleb and his sister were when they grew up. In addition, I liked the repertoire of the song "Billy-boy" that was first heard during the credits of the first film, the title "Sarah, Plain and Tall". However, the only thing in Winter's End that I did not like was the youngest daughter. She was a very cute little girl, but she was very spirited and looked like a brat compared to the other boys, even compared to the quiet, though good natured, when she was younger.
