in a time of predictable films, where violence, cheap romance and melodrama abound, it's amazingly surprising to find such a weird movie. the plot itself is compelling and the actors are excellent, especially Alan Rickman. If you want to watch a movie that does not provide all the answers before asking the questions, a movie that will surprise you (good or bad), Dark Harbor is for you. And if you're not convinced, believe me that Alan Rickman's performance is well worth it ... especially in the end, ladies ....
