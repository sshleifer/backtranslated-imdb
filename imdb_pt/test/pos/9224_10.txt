People talk about how horrible the script was, and how horrible the animation was, but Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer are really a Japanese anime aimed at kids. If you look at anime today it is done in the same style, and it is immensely popular. I do not think this movie was meant to be seen by adults. Just like I do not think it was meant to be serious. The same things that people seem to hate about this movie are the things I love. Rainbow Brite is one of the best cartoon characters ever created in my opinion. She's smart. She's funny. She cares about the environment. She cares about her friends. This movie can teach a lot to young children. My younger brothers even liked this movie. I have to say that this movie taught me a lot when I was a kid. When it came out on DVD I was the first in line to buy it. It's a great kid movie. So, and if it is not perfect, nothing is really perfect when you look closely enough for that.
