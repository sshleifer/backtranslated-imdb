I've been waiting for years for a new DVD edition of this wonderful movie. I have a max beta recording with French language. Unfortunately, MGM omits the French track on their recent DVD ... Only English has spoken a legend in French ... I do not know how to make MGM be advised: I wrote emails to them but of course no response . If I insist, it is because, exceptionally, the dubbing track in French was spectacular, funny, well written, etc ... George C. Scott is always excellent and, for people who were born as I was during the 1950s, Diana Rigg represents something very different Madonna (for example). Thanks for your help ... Regards ...
