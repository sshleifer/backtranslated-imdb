I liked this because I can relate to it. <br /> <br /> At one time in my life I was trying to make movies, and I experienced many of the same problems that Mark Borchardt did when trying to make his movie. And I also went through a prolonged period of interrupted development self-absorbed, where I refused to grow. But then, miraculously, I got married and had children. I realized that being a hardworking filmmaker, in all likelihood, would not feed my family. So I got a decent job and did what I felt I needed to do to make it happen. That's what a mature and responsible adult does. <br /> <br /> Mark has not yet faced this reality and in that sense, he is a retarded teenager. For this reason, there is a lack of hope about it. Like Don Quixote, he seems so inept and self-deluded that he does not realize how bad he really is. The viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle. Mark has children and an ex-wife and bills to pay, but the film shows that he is basically concerned with pursuing his "artistic vision". <br /> <br /> Despite this, Mark appears in the film as a nice guy, surrounded by a very interesting family and a group of friends. Unfortunately, Mark lacks many of the things needed to succeed in life and career: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, prioritization, financial influence, etc. Still, he crawls, like Ed Wood, seemingly without any resemblance to a clue. <br /> <br /> I think we should feel encouraged by the spectacle of the "never say die" attitude of this noble individual, fighting the odds. And man, what chances are there! Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Hanks, Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie are puppies of great movies or TV people; no doubt, they will all want to drive someday, if they are not already. How much space is there for an independent like Mark? It's like watching a guy hit his head with a board, over and over again. Come to think of it, which is very much like what happens with one of Mark's actors, with the kitchen cupboard door, in one of the funniest scenes I've seen in any movie. <br /> <br /> Despite these doubts and apparent criticism, I really enjoyed this movie, and I strongly recommend it to everyone. Uncle Bill is incredible. I have a friend who met Mike and Mark and he told me that in real life these guys are exactly like they appeared in the movie.
