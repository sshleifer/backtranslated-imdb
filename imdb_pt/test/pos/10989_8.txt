I found this movement beautiful, pleasant and uplifting. Initially the local movie sites, which were filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me. Later I found myself lost in the power of the film. How do you repay a gift from God? The ability of the characters to rise above their base natures and respond to the touch of God warmed my heart. The whole audience cheered at the conclusion of the film. I left the theater with a cadence in my rhythm, joy in the heart and hope in the human race. What else can a movie do? Hollywood, I hope you're paying attention. America likes positive and optimistic movies.
