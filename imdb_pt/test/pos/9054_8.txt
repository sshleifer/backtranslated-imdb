Hick Trek is clearly a movie that is jealous of even a budget-level El Mariachi ($ 7,000). Still, creators are able to take decent effects sometimes (often due to large issues) such as beams, situations aboard the cat-ship, and the unique way of communicating with your ship without the use of a traditional communication. device. <br /> <br /> The acting has its tough spots, but the portrait of "Horns" McBoy is excellent and Fluffy certainly is not too hard for the eyes. <br /> <br /> I wish the film had been longer than its approximate time - and this should be seen as a compliment. This film is a success due to the sincerity and hard work of those involved.
