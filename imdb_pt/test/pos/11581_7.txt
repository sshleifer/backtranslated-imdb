I suppose it is a great achievement to be able to present to a public a true tail on a fragile man; a tail in which the protagonist will spend most of the film on his back, in a bed and totally unable to move. And yet, the achievement lies in the effectiveness of the film as a dramatic play; as a reminder of a true story and I think it's an argument as to why people should have the right to die if they so desire. But the film is not a political statement and, fortunately, it avoids many debate scenes, although it does include one for the argument anyway. More so, this is one of those foreign language films that features your main character as a cripple who can not do anything but talk to the people around you and still be able to become engaging and attractive anyway. <br /> So instead of being an out and out argument, the movie is yet another sweet but timely dramatic play about someone else wanting something or looking for something; the only difference is that by reaching that goal it would mean the end of one's life and it would be achieved by not going physically anywhere. Javier Bardem plays the Galician Ramón Sampedro, an individual who, at a much earlier age, plunged into a water clearing that was too shallow for such activity. That left him in bed for the rest of his life and his desire to die is the focus of Chilean director Alejandro Amenábar's film. We've already seen so many movies in our lives that the characters have certain 'goals' or targets that must be found before the end of the movie to provide a satisfying experience for the audience, but the change of pace in The Sea Inside is delicate; does not involve young, energetic and attractive heroes who go out to fight in distant places, but a real person, after something that means a lot to them. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a strong policy, whether pro or anti-euthanasia, you may find yourself waiting for Ramón to get what he wants in the end. The film sets the tone very early on, with Ramón giving a speech about why he wants to die to watch family members, immediately presenting the situation and subject to the audience who may not know about what the film is. Interestingly, some of the family members are "anti" what he wishes they can put any member of the audience who feels strongly about it in their respective shoes. But the purpose of this montage is to tell the public, "No, this is not a man after something that incidentally made his whole family support him to the end." Quite easily, the film could have traveled a route in which the Sampedro family is against all others, but some are an anti-Ramon idea; some are too young to recognize what is really going on, and others are seemingly too upset to have a different opinion of just wanting Ramón to be around a little more, they love him after all. <br /> <br /> The Sea Within is the next of a story that revolves around a kind of victim. Ramón is quadriplegic and it is his perspective that we see things. This is something that may disarticulate the viewers or that the film seems rather strange since we are being introduced to a movie from a victim's point of view instead of an instigator or a main character in a movie that is always inducing the cause . cause and effect. But this is not critical and is a credit to the director for presenting such an approach in the actual way it is. The film asks questions; provides a setting for your audience. If you were in Ramón's position: what would you do, think, dream or speak? Consequently, dreams with lawyer Juila (Rueda) are not as much shots for the pleasure of the public as they are a window ever so light on the escapist fantasies of a man of his situation. The study of Julia intensifies a little later, when she begins to share certain similarities with Ramón and that is when she begins to have spills that result from a disease of her own. This trait seems timely in the progression of their relationship and adds another connecting ingredient to an already engaging friendship. That's because Julia feels physical pain and restraint, not in the sense that she is not able to get up and walk, but I think she realizes the value of life given how emotionally bad she felt before. While the film is based on a true story and covers the subject of euthanasia, it seems more like a drama about the earth about a man in a situation where he is prepared to fight for what he wants, but must do so verbally. It's exciting to watch movies like The Sea Inside, as he not only references the story and gives us insight into it, but as an independent film, it offers an emotional and engaging level.
