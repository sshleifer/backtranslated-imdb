Dr. Sayer (Philippe Leroy), a wealthy physician with psychological problems related to the opposite sex, kidnaps an employee, Maria (Dagmar Lassander), a liberal woman of free thought who believes that men should be "fixed" rather than women . Sayer retires to his palatial estate, directing Mary through a series of humiliating mental games, threatening to molest her and kill her. Sayer's desire, it seems, is to dominate his body, mind and soul, making her his sexual slave, obeying his commands, adhere to all his desires and whims. After resisting, Mary, at first, walks slowly towards the goal, but has plans of her own. She says she wants to help Sayer abandon his sadistic behavior toward women, so he could love and not feel that those longings want to hurt. It seems that Sayer has her under control, agreeing with certain embarrassing scenarios (such as swallowing her toes, making love to a doll that is a recreation of herself, often spending topless time, and even picking up torn when she hits strength in the face bringing blood from his nose) that almost breaks, but something happens when the troubled doctor slowly falls in love with Mary ... and through what appears to be a desperate attempt to end the madness, Mary gains an advantage, joking with Sayer's lust for his body. <br /> <br /> Another battle of wills, a kind of sexual war where it seems that somebody is in charge when the other really has the higher power. hand. Through a large part of the film, Sayer mistreats Maria, forcing her (... it seems) to submit to her series of psychological games of a sexual nature. His attempts to escape fail because his house is such a well-designed fortress ... it is a typical European Art Deco style palace, trained and orchestrated by a man who has stayed at this weekend retreat for a long time (.. walls and doors opening at her command, with a quarantined area for her "victims." But, once Maria apparently swallows a bottle of pills as a result of her anguish in her hands, the tables are turned and she has him where she He discovers that he really longs for her and Maria uses it to his advantage, playing hard to get when Sayer wants to hug and devastate her (..and, I could understand her frustration because she has this fascination that can leave a man crazy) <I felt that the film ultimately functions as a war cry for women, their power and revolt against men who have the notion that they should always have control, both sexually and mentally. i will finish I could not swallow Sayer's fate because of his rigorous cardiovascular activity and exercise regimen. We have seen how he develops his athletic figure and how this regimen is part of the normal routine every weekend before the real mind games with his victim begin. If he is so well in shape, and spends this time developing for the extracurricular activities that follow his scheme, how could he suffer the fate that follows the finalization of the agreement with Mary at the end, when she stops resisting their advances? <br /> <br /> Mary, he would admit later, is the first he actually kidnapped; others from the past, program girls, were paid for their services so that Sayer could feel the power to dominate a woman, even if all this was a fictional farce brought on by a deeply disturbed individual with an inability to connect with the opposite sex. The spontaneous decision to do so, take a leap from the norm, costs you more than he could know. <br /> <br /> All this psycho-sexual subtext is quite fascinating to see unveiled, but Dagmar Lassander, a sex kitten so tasty, was my reason to like it so much ... without her, I could not have liked both because she is vital as a victim that is worth striving to get. Perhaps the highlight of the film, Lassander's delicious dance, dressed in gauze (!), Uncovers the wardrobe exposing your breasts to a jazzy soundtrack ... is the sexually seductive moment that makes your mouth fill and sweat the forehead. Dagmar Lassander must have been a joy to fashion designers because she wears these clothes so well ... she has this kind of cool, a sophistication and presence on the screen along with her beauty and seductive powers, Dagmar transcends the part to create a character iconic that would define his career ... even if the film is not well known (.. I discovered through word of mouth). The provocative nature of the script and the wrong subject may not attract certain crowds, since it deals with sex (... and pain) in many different ways, the dialogue is quite illustrative and elaborate. Sometimes I could not help laughing at Sayer's comments to a prey Maria, about how he likes to make women suffer, and the excitement he has in forcing them into a kind of slavery (... in an attempt of making poetic words). , everything seems a bit corny). But Dagmar is the real reason to see him, and the film, to me, works best as a fetish movie, a possible male fantasy with that seemingly primal and appropriate idealist, captured and held against his will, forced into a precarious movie . situation, his fate possibly at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist. Her submission, and how she reacts to her aggressive behavior with her (there are times when she unfolds in a vacillating desire to embrace him, unveiling a possible attraction for him which, on its own, may scare some who watch) are among the most fascinating highlights of this exploration feature. My other favorite scene, besides the dance, is the piano concert with Sayer stroking Maria while she plays a soft melody.
