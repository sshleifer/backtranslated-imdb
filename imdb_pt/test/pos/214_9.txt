I remember seeing the Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a really funny show, thanks to the many visual gags, non sequitors and scripts full of words. In one episode, there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt that it deserved a much longer run, but a network executive thought the series required a lot of attention from the viewer because of all the visual jokes in each episode. One that I remember was in the opening where the episode title was different from the one shown on the screen. Leslie Nielsen's portrait of Frank Drebin was expressionless, but very funny and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb, by Dragnet. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus in one of his few roles since Mission: Impossible was not as bad as Norberg, but the only character who stood out was Johnny, the Shoe Boy, played by William Duell. After giving advice to Drebin, there were appearances by Dick Clark, Joyce Brothers and then Dodger manager Tommy LaSorda. <br /> <br /> Same as the police squad! had a short life on ABC, Zucker Brothers did not give up the concept that resulted in even more success in the film franchise Naked Gun. I'll close with a regular closing gag. Freeze the end right here.
