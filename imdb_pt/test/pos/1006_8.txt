[CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!] <br /> <br /> Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut. They basically had no life at all. All they did was lie down and count the roof tiles. Jon even arranged his socks drawer according to the color and fabric. He needed a life. Then he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. A singles bar was a great place to start. Unfortunately, when the song started and Jon entered the dance floor, we see what made the album die: Jon killed. Jon then tried to pick up girls at the video store. He ended up feeling his mouth. Literally. The laundry was not a prize when Jon and his alleged encounter glimpsed each other's underwear. Jon tried to act on the beach, but soon it annoyed a real guy, which left Jon feeling, once again, in the mouth. Literally. Jon then tried to catch girls walking and running. Not available. Jon pulled out a guitar and sang the blues. Unfortunately when he mentioned that his cat was fat, a fat man approached and stepped on Jon's guitar. It was hopeless. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Jon, an ad appeared on TV: an advertisement for Lorenzo's School for the Impaired Personality. It has secured a lifeless person to get a life in a few easy steps. Jon and Garfield watch the class. The building did not look exactly the same as it did on TV, nor did Lorenzo act as vigorously as on TV. Jon sat next to a pretty girl named Mona. Then, as Lorenzo taught his lessons to introduce himself, checking his wrist and pretending to speak a foreign language, Jon and Mona met. They go out together, forgetting all about Garfield. At home, Jon and Mona sat on the porch and talked. Garfield was jealous of Mona for fear she would take Jon away from him. Garfield imagined the future: Jon and Mona get married, she moves in and soon she gives birth to a little Arbuckle who is very happy to make Garfield's story. Back in the present, Garfield would not accept that. He tried to make Jon get rid of Mona, until she began to itch behind her ears. But then Jon discovered that Mona was allergic to cats. So that was basically the end of their relationship. But they still met each other now and then, and Garfield was sure to be with them. <br /> <br /> Another hilarious special TV from Garfield! This was done while running Garfield and Friends. Garfield was reduced a little. A little. Since the first drawings of the 80's. The scenes of Jon trying to catch girls are funny, just like the one where the fat one steps on Jon's guitar. Good old Lorenzo Music is back as Garfield. Thom Huge is Jon. Frank Welker (The third man with a thousand voices) is Lorenzo. And June Foray (The Woman of 1,000 Voices) is Mona. If you like Garfield then I recommend you to see Garfield Gets A Life today! Along with Here Comes Garfield and Garfield on the Town, were released on DVD! So check all of them today! You're guaranteed a good time. Hey, has Garfield ever let you down? <br /> <br /> -
