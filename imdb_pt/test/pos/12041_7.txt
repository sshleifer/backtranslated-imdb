Darr was a Super Hit movie, which was loved by many people. It tells the story of Shahrukh Khans' innocent obsession with Juhi, who loves Sunny Deol. Honestly, it was a fun movie, but if you look carefully, it's not very realistic. Shahrukh Khan continues to call Juhi and tells her that he loves her too. He gives an ad in college that he loves her, and gives her some nice surprises, such as beautiful pictures of her. Unfortunately, instead of being flattered that a guy loves her too, she gets very scared. I personally know hundreds of people who are deceived by someone, and these people like that because they play a lot. Yash Chopra gives us a good entertaining film, largely because of Shah Rukh Khan's character. Sunny Deol is supposedly the lead actor, but Darr belongs to Shah Rukh Khan performing a superb performance. Shah Rukh Khan is literally the villain in the movie, but I would be happy if he caught the girl because he loves her so much. Sunny Deol has a decent performance but he outshines all these guys alone and survives a brutal knife attack. Juhi Chawla is cute as always in a pretty good performance. Some good songs, including Tu mere samne, are the best.
