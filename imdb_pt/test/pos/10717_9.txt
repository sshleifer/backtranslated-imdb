KRAMER VS KRAMER has won five Oscars, including Best Picture in 1979. This intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down when his eight-year-old wife leaves him, leaving him to care for his son . build a relationship with him that he never had. Robert Benton's incisive script presents us with imperfect but real humans with hearts, souls, and brains. For example, in the scene where Joanna announces to Ted that she is leaving him, she not only runs out the door ... she gives him the keys, his credit cards, the dry cleaning account, tells him which accounts were paid, and informs him that he withdrew from his bank account the same amount of money he had when they married, no more. This decision to leave was not a whim ... it was thought and Joanna felt, with no other choice but to leave, if she was leaving she would do it properly ... and without any specific plan in mind, she did not think Sure to catch Billy. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man so obsessed with bringing home the bacon that he had no idea that his home life was falling apart in pieces. Meryl Streep also won an Oscar as Joanna, the unfortunate woman we felt sympathy for at the beginning of the film, but it all changed when she returned to her son. Hoffman is at the top of his form here. I always rip during the scene in which he tries to explain to Billy (Justin Henry, nominated for an Oscar) why his mother left and he does it all in a whisper or when he meets Joanna on his return and hits his drink on a wall Hoffman's moment, not in the script, about which Streep was not informed in order to get a natural reaction). Justin Henry hits all the right notes like Billy, the confused boy who does not know why his mother is gone and does not know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also received an Oscar nomination as Ted and Joanna's neighbor, Margaret, who changed loyalty with the film's completion. This is an intense family drama, but there are laughs around here too ... Billy and the chocolate ice cream ... Billy pouting because Ted is late to pick him up for a party ... Billy taking a night out on his father ( JoBeth Williams) on their way to the bathroom completely naked, but it's the moments of the human drama you remember ... Ted running through Manhattan with Billy in his arms to get to the emergency room after BIlly falls off the jungle ... Ted be fired shortly before starting his custody battle and instead of making a scene, he tells the guy in a whisper ... "Shame on you." And, of course, the end where Joanna tells Ted that she's not taking Billy, which I found a bit difficult to swallow. Why would she go to all this trouble to sue for custody and then change her mind? But this is a little pun in relation to a wonderful film, masterfully directed by Robert Benton and executed to perfection by a first-line cast. Unmissable.
