"Rififi" is a great assault film, and one of which subsequent assault films have been made ever since. Jules Dassin had an idea of ​​the obscure underworld in which these thieves live - you will not find here the Hollywood glamor of "Ocean's Eleven." The thieves in "Rififi" do not steal the emotion and are not playing. They steal to survive, to pay for the education of their children, to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world. The much-lauded assault scene is a biting nail, filmed in virtual silence. I had the feeling that the plot was a little longer than necessary, but the high-speed race to deliver the child to his mother closing the film is classic. <br /> <br /> Be warned - this movie is very somber. But it's also very good. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
