I'm a bit biased because I appeared in this movie, but I loved it and I'm only in about seven minutes scattered and I'm not the most interesting part of it. The film is an honest and intriguing account of an independent, independent group of filmmakers trying to make a lovely film. It is also an account of swollen expectations and fallen heroes. The interviews are well-edited. Different people are all interesting and there is never really much of a person. In addition, the interviews are filmed in a very interesting way, keeping the film visually satisfying. Definitely worth a movie. I hope you stay close.
