If we consider three films with a similar subject, which is this one, which was made in 1930, 'The Covered Wagon' made in 1923 and 'Wagon Master' made in 1950, the distance between 'The Big Trail' and 'The Covered Wagon 'is only 7 years, while the distance between' The Big Trail 'and' Wagon Master 'is 20 years. This is incredible because it shows how movies have evolved over the last 7 years, and how changes in the next 20 years have taken place. 'The Big Trail' is technically close to 'Wagon Master', but has different ages to 'The Covered Wagon'. The story is about pioneers going from Missouri to west in Oregon. Tyrone Power Sr. is the man who leads the caravan, he is a rude and evil guy. John Wayne is the good guy and the movie makes a lot of sense in his good looks, not giving him the chance to be the Wayne we're used to. Marguerite Churchill is such a proud woman that you wonder why Wayne just does not forget her. Raoul Walsh was a master at showing caravans and cattle moving down the west, he directed "The Tall Men" in 1955, which has much in common with "The Big Trail".
