This is a kind of hidden gem. Has little or no promotion, no fanfare, no classic status, and deserves all of the above! One of the great directors of the cinema, Fritz Lang, created a real jewel in this excellent western. A great cast led by Randolph Scott (probably in one of his greatest performances), the ever-robust Dean Jagger, Robert Young as a surprisingly talented guy and many veteran actors: Chill Wills, Slim Summerville, John Carradine, Barton MacLane and others in one Zane Gray's grip on Western Cable's imposition across the country. It has tense drama, mood sprinkling and great effects. It is reminiscent of DeMille's ways and yet Fritz Lang leaves his own mark on it. At the very least, this is a very good Western!
