Much has already been said about this film and its striking importance in shaping the language of cinema. If you are interested in the history of cinema, to truly understand the innovations that Eisenstein brings to the medium you can try to see Potemkin next to any film made before (those of D. W. Griffith offer a good contrast). It must be admitted that Eisenstein was not the only theorist of the montage and that the principles of editing the montage would probably have been discovered for another definite time. However, to this day, few principals have approached the ability with which Eisenstein created meaning by combining images at such an early moment in the evolution of the medium. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in this sort of thing, Potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films of all time. You should see it, buy it and carry it to your chest.
