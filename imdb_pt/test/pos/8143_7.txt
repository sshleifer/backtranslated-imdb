"Purgatory Flats", recently shown on cable, is a small movie that packs a lot. Harris Done drives with style. The screen of Mr. Done and Diane Fine is a good thriller. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie yet, you may want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> The film is the story of a young Los Angeles doctor who made a mistake and lives to pay for it. Upon being released from prison, he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he will be forgotten. Bad choice! What Thomas Reed finds on Purgatory Flats is hell in the desert. Soon after getting a job as a bar tender, Thomas meets a beautiful young woman, Sunny, who clearly is someone to turn away from. The young doctor is called in to help as Randy, Sunny's boyfriend, is shot dead by a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> We met Randy's family. His Uncle Dean seems to be fine, but his brother Owen is a loose cannon. Each one in the house is connected in more than one way to the nubile Sunny. <br /> <br /> The performances are good. Vincent Ventresca is Thomas, the man who should have gone to his LA practice instead of making a detour to the small town. Alexandra Holden is Sunny, a young woman with a tremendous ambition to escape from her surroundings. Kevin Alejandro, Gregg Henry and Brian Austin play the men of the Mecklin family. Nicholas Turturro also makes a good contribution as a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> The film shows a promising director who will go far, judging by this well-built film.
