My first exposure to Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his producer Studio Ghibli was when an English version of Spirited Away was released about 7 years ago. What a wonderfully creative and unique movie experience that was! So, on that note, I managed to get my friend from the movies to know me about this new Miyazaki movie with me, especially since he loves all things Disney (the US distributor in the movie). Again, all I can say is "Wow!" What awe-inspiring visuals about how water is represented as the ocean ... and about transforming the title character of a goldfish to ... and see how the behavior of some characters changes ... and, well, see this movie if you want to know what I'm talking about. Oh, and the voices being used for this version dubbed by the Americans: Tina Fey, Betty White, Liam Neeson, Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. Good choices all. Everything makes sense? No, but that's part of the childish charm that permeates everything. There are many funny scenes about Ponyo, the boy and many other people they meet. Oh, I think I wrote too much, so I highly recommend Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo.
