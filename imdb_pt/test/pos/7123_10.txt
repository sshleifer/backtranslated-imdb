I saw the original rough screen showing 4 times at Gencon a few years ago. I was delighted to have done this, my daughter is in the movie. <br /> <br /> I stood in the back of the room with her watching much younger fans sit on the edge of their seats, still, unwillingly. lose a line. Standing ovation later was like watching the fans when the US hockey team beat the Russians at the Montreal Olympics. <br /> <br /> I love excellent comedy and visual jokes. Taxi, Barney Miller, Cheers, Frasier and Married with Chilren are my favorite comedy shows of all time. Smaller shows I will not even watch. <br /> <br /> This movie will do to the Gamers what Animal House did for the days of College Frat, what Dodge Ball did for strange sports. Forget the lack of a mega budget to support production. This is pure art, it is so good. <br /> <br /> I could not be happier with all the cast and production company.
