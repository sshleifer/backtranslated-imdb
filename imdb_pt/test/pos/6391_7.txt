On a routine mission in Iraq, a group of Delta soldiers retrieves a computer hard drive from an Alqueda training camp, detailing the location of weapons specialist Dr. Walsh. After witnessing the end of his secret weapons development program, Dr. Walsh finds an alternative source of funding and installs a new research facility in the notorious Belzan forest in Chechnya, where he is developing weapons and selling them to the rebels of Chechnya. sent on a black operations mission to recover the doctor and his technology before the Russians found him and his laboratory. What the Delta team will soon discover is that newer physicians are a bunch of large carnivorous bats that have been genetically altered to develop a human flesh taste. I found this movie a lot better than I expected. There is a lot of action and a lot of blood. It's more or less what you'd expect from a creature resource. The performance is not great, but it is acceptable. I have certainly seen worse. Overall, it's a nice movie for what it is. A good popcorn movie.
