This is a delightful jewel from a movie, sadly confusing as "just for kids". The plot revolves around a young man, Roy Eberhardt, recently arrived in southwest Florida from the mountains of Montana. Trying to fit in with the other kids at his school, Roy discovers a team of siblings trying to protect threatened owls at an illegal construction site. Look for Carl Hiassen, the author of the book on which this film is based, as the male secretary of the evil boss at the company's headquarters. Writer / director Wil Shriner is also the official Public Records Office where intrepid teen detectives discover that the incriminating Environmental Impact Report is missing. Luke Wilson almost steals all the crucial scenes of the charming teen actors who have the most of the best lines. Wilson is the clumsy cop in his three-wheeled electric police car with blue light and funky siren. As Officer Dave, he tries so hard to do well, but usually ends up falling into the mud, literally! Several times! Jimmy Buffett is quite discreet as the tacitly supportive science teacher. But young actors Logan Lerman (Roy), Brie Larson (Beatrix the Bear) and Cody Linley (Mullet Fingers) are superb as teenagers who finally put cop Dave on the right track, following the trail left by the evil corporate boss. . I hope you get out of this movie feeling as good as I do. Simply fun! One small complaint, however. I hope all non-Floridians realize that not everyone in Florida is as rude to newcomers as portrayed in this film. We are a really friendly group! Just ask Carl Hiassen and Jimmy Buffet !!
