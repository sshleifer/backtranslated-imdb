This story is an excellent story of two boys doing what they can to get away from an abusive drunk parent. The star of "The Lord of the Rings," Elijah Wood, is remarkable in this unforgettable role. This movie is one of the main reasons why I did not play a single beer and I will never do it while I live. It might make me sound like a nerd, but that's what I have to say. It's a wonder because this is not like a classic American tale.
