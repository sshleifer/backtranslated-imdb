There's a serious scene in this movie. A scene that lets you know that his movie will not rip off many cheap punches. It occurs in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by killers with automatic weapons. They pause for it and manage to get out in a burst of gunfire. The main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people who were caught in the crossfire. Some would call this very sad and / or somber to put in what is supposed to be a nice action movie. I call it honesty. Most action movies tend to lean toward the "safe side" of showing violence and plotting elements. This means mainly that despite great shootings, innocent people tend not to die or at least not see them dying. Violence is purely the good guys against bad guys, especially with bad guys dying. A little common sense clearly shows that this is absurd. <br /> <br /> Renny Harlin showed a suggestion of this in his first (and sadly unique) success, Die Hard 2. The villains intentionally knock down an airplane full of people to get their point. The scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people on board falling, but the darker and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used. However, to fit the spirit of the first film, Die Hard 2 was mainly a "fun action movie". Here, this most somber and convincing advantage is widespread. The violence is bloody. The pamphlets are hilarious, but with a certain style that echoes the natural human sarcasm more than the clich√©s of the movies in key moments of the action. The plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action movies. The villain is not just a rogue for revenge or an attack of power. It's less ridiculous, but even more frightening than that. From recent films, the "Bourne" trilogy almost gets there with its less tacky action movie style than usual, but this film is from 1996 and 7 years before "The Bourne Identity" with Matt Damon hit the big screen . <BR> Another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a hero. And that's well before the film version of "Tomb Raider" becomes a success. What's more is that this heroine really looks like she could topple John McClane and then take the cigarette still lit. This film marks the second action heroine role of Geena Davis and she still has not managed to score a hit. While Angelina Jolie debuts in "Tomb Raider" years later and scores a hit. The reasons are beyond me. Completely. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is not all grim. There are many scandalous and spectacular pieces that we can only see in an action movie. The climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of pyrotechnics of films, with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break. So there is formula here, but it is the Anti-Formula for the everyday Hollywood Action Movie Formula. --- 9/10 <br /> <br /> BsCDb rating: 13+ --- violence, profanity
