How I Spend My Vacation Closes the TV series that aired from 1990 to 1992. I've always liked the series for what it is. I've never compared the series to the old-time Looney Tunes. The release of the video was divided into four or five episodes (I can not remember how I'm writing this) for television and is included in the episode list of the series. What's good about this series is that all of the main characters in the show have an important role in the story. We see what they all do during their summer vacation in different parts of the world. Elmyra is with her parents on a safari, Plucky and Hampton crossing the country with the parents of Hampton, Fifi is on some beach, etc. The climax is very good and in the end all the characters of Tiny Toon gather for the beginning of a new year in "Looniversity", practically finishing the good execution of this TV show.
