I found The Last Stop one day at a store and they were selling for only $ 2. I decided to try and bought it. It was very good, I liked it. The story is about several people all trapped in a hut somewhere because of a furious blizzard. There is a cop, Nancy, his ex-girlfriend, two brothers who have just come out of prison, an older man and his lover, a black man and the couple who owns the huts and their never-talking son. Suddenly someone is found to be murdered and a bag full of money is found. Everyone is a suspect. The Last Stop is a good thriller, I would give 8/10
