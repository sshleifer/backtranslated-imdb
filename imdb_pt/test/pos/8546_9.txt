Anthony Quinn is a master at capturing our heart and sympathy. He portrays a Romanian peasant with a below-average IQ, harassed by his wife to do more. It is World War II and the Nazis took over their country. Soon he finds himself digging trenches in the hope of benefiting in the eyes of his wife. The Nazis have different ideas. In the next few years, we see the events unfold through his naive eyes, but all he wants to do is go home. Their manipulations and bad luck only lead to more hot water. Finally, without any fault, we see his photo on the cover of "Der Spiegel" as the perfect Aryan. The war ends and the Allies put him on trial for war crimes. But all our peasant wants to do is go home to his wife.
