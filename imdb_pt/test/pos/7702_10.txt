A great thriller of thriller acting is top notch and the plot keeps you guessing. This well executed and directed film is based on a real and worthwhile story while Joe Penny is extremely well released and Ann Gillian is convincing as the sister concerned and terrified. Joe again proves that he is acting skillfully is amazing and the end well done. Worth watching I hope they repeat soon on any channel, I will definitely record it. For Penny and Gillian fans, it's worth your time. Rent if you can better still try to buy it I will. Perfect early nineties thriller watching this movie is great.
