The mystery and its solution were a great noir concept. I have some questions, maybe I was not paying enough attention. <br /> <br /> Who killed the neighbor and why? Who killed the surrogate girl and why? <br /> <br /> And a few minor complaints, they should have shown the stop at the hotel for the exchange. Not that they should have shown the change, but they should have shown Jim and the girl going to the hotel, Jim going to the bathroom, leaving and being told by the waiter that his girlfriend went to the car without him. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> So, <br /> <br /> This would give the viewer a sportive chance to discover the solution. <br /> <br /> I'd like to record it, I'd like to see it again.
