I saw "The Reader" at a Manhattan film festival this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films did. In ten minutes or more, he tells a touching story of two characters that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers did a great job of capturing very real moments and suits in the film. What I really admire in this film is that the director chose a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in perfect timing. This is no small thing. Have not we all seen shorts that are simply longer stories squeezed to fit in the format, or stage stories that were not appropriately adapted to the screen? I applaud "The Reader" for really doing it right, and I encourage anyone who is interested in movies and storytelling to take it seriously. Worth every moment!
