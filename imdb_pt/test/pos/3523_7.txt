The mountainous woods, happy young campers, a warning by a forest ranger and a lurking figure. The ingredients are there for a treat of terror, and the director / co-writer Jeff Lieberman does a proper job to achieve it. It is a stereotyped horror of the forest, but for the most part execution is at the top of the game and history (which is fairly basic in a trimmed sense) is effectively counted in a certain realism. Perhaps a little more exposure has not been disoriented, but Lieberman's work offsets the typical flaws and details of the material with the growing tension, the dark visual effects, and the stifling atmosphere created by Brad Fiedel's sinister and persistent punctuation. Whenever that scary whistle was introduced, he painted a truly unnerving sensation that set in with the beautiful scenery. Filmmakers Dean M. and Joel King do a remarkable job as well. There's a lot of style, even with its minimal scope and the build-up is slow. Sometimes the pace can become a case of stop and run. It's not particularly violent, but there's still an obvious mid-line, even if it happens on the screen. The latter chases scenes and growing fear is well done as darkness comes alive with its killer and you catch actor George Kennedy riding his white horse in a light but wonderful lap. There are a lot of enjoyable performances; Deborah Benson is a strong and bold heroine. Gregg Henry, Chris Lemmon Ralph Seymour, Jamie Rose, Mike Kellin and Katie Powell complete a modest cast of credible deliveries. The final climax is a bit twisted, but the end is one of those guys that leave you thinking ?? "It is?" <br /> <br /> A well-engraved backwoods slasher item, which probably throws it a bit too secure to really set it apart from the norm.
