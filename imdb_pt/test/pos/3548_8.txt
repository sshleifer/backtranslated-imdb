10 respected directors have released a short film with optical arias as inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately: Nicolas Roeg (dir) - Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 in Vienna. Theresa Russell (wife of Roegs) plays a man! Not bad - very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - Verdi. No story, but there are some amazing black and white images that fit perfectly with the music. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Useless, boring, without plot, with nothing. Full of free female nudity. Worse! <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - Verdi. Buck Henry, Beverly D'Angelo and Anita Morris star in this funny, if obvious, story about a traitorous couple. Very good. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - Erich Korngold. Short, lush and romantic. Very good. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - Jean-Philippe Rameau. Chest. A yawn. <br /> <br /> Fran Roddam - Richard Wagner. This has Bridget Fonda in her movie debut. Beautifully made love story with a pretty explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - Giacomo Puccini. Really weird, but OK. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - Gustave Chapentier. Lyrical look at youth and old age. Very sweet. <br /> <br /> The last one is by Bill Bryden doing "I Pagliacci". He has John Hurt (!) Dressed like a clown doing lip sync with Caruso (!!!). <br /> <br /> When it came out, he almost received a X note (for the abundant nudity and the sex scene). It was given an R with a strict notice attached stating that the R rating would be heavily enforced. After the movie bombarded this warning disappeared. <br /> <br /> The idea is not bad and 6 of the 10 segments paid off. Worth seeing, even if you do not like opera. Just avoid Godard's segment. I'm giving an 8.
