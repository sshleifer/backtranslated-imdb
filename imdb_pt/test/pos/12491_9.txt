This is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it. The acting and the writing are great and there are many plot twists. Like a French film "Noir", its language is certainly much more terrestrial than its American counterparts, but for me this only increased realism. Besides, I liked how everyone was not glamorous - particularly the husband and the lieutenant. About the only negative, and the reason the film gets a 9 and not a 10, is because there was a hole in the screaming plot. Like another famous French film, Dr√¥le de Drame, the confusion between the cops and the accused could easily have been resolved at first, but the characters made stupid decisions. For this, you just need to suspend disbelief and keep watching - the reward is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> This is simply one of the best French films I have ever seen. Period.
