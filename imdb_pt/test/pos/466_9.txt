This is really a movie that you need to see twice. When I first saw this movie, I was really drawn to the story. While most of the story takes place inside a hotel room, the stories Buddy (Nick Drake, wonderful allusion) and Daphne share take you out of your room and into their world. Through your conversations, you feel the loneliness and pain that each one feels. The soundtrack accompanies the movie perfectly, dark, lo-fi and intriguing. When you watch the movie the second time, you can pick up all the tracks that you missed the first time they led to one of the best finals I've seen in a long time. I hope this film finds a distributor for the DVD, to make it more accessible. Great movie, you will not be disappointed.
