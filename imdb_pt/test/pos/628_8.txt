The plot is a bit original, and all the actors did the job very well. There's a lot of comic relief too. Some things do not make much sense (for example, the first "chase" scene, why would not the heroine just hide somewhere and wait until the bad guys left?). The Russians really speak Russian without an accent, but the cars are extremely strange, with models that last about 50 years, so the place looks strangely out of time. Overall, if you like thrillers you'll probably like this too.
