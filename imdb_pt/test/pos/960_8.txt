I do not know why people thought it vulgar or unpleasant; It's not like American Pie or anything. I do not know why people are offended by the universal plugs; since it is part of the plot, the advertisement is excusable. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with good dialogue, subtle good humor, a good story, a good morale (which fortunately is not very sentimental), GREAT performance, and a tacky ending. The basic premise here is the classic story of a shepherd (Muniz) who lies so hard that no one believes him when the Wolf (Giamatti) comes together. Then he picks up his best friend Kaylee (Bynes) and they drive him crazy. <br /> <br /> Frankie Muniz may be annoying in other roles, but not like Jason Shepherd. He deals perfectly with the soft confidence of his character, and what seems to be a lack of expression at first glance is really a perfectly executed indifference. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes. What else can I say? The girl has the gift. She is funny, talented, versatile and very, very attractive. (I'm only 6 months older than her. I need to go to California soon.) Actually, the 'best friend' part was originally a boy, but it became a girl so the creators saw the interest of Amanda. Which works very well, since the part would have been pretty boring without the blessing of Bynes' abilities. <br /> <br /> Paul Giamatti is a very talented man. While some would play with Marty Wolf as evil and devilish, Giamatti made him - not just an idiot, remember, but an idiot of LIKEABLE, an idiot who animates the screen instead of intentionally darkening it. And I doubt that many other actors could make the psychological collapse that Wolf suffers as well. <br /> <br /> All right, great movie. He loved seeing Jaleel White mocking himself. I loved seeing all the little references and such embedded in the movie. (one of the guests at the party scene is the director, Shawn Levy, another is the former Bynes co-star, Kenan Thompson) I loved seeing Amanda in these clothes ........ Get the DVD if you can. It has all sorts of extra things, and the lovely Ms. Bynes is your guide through the menus. :)
