I really like the Surface show. The show is a lot of fun and it's a clean show. A show like surface is interesting. That keeps my attention. You have compassion and suspense. I love all the cast members who are on the show. They are all very good choices. I think it's very important to have the right cast of any show because that's what makes any show a hit and of course the scenes and the show itself. Television has changed a lot over the years. It has changed in a good and bad way. I love watching comedy, action, thriller and romance. And scifi But Surface is a show that I hope comes back for many seasons because it's a great show and it's something that families can watch. My kids are grown up, but my husband and I like to watch these kinds of shows. I appreciate your time and letting me comment on my opinion. <br /> <br /> Thank you. <br /> <br /> Paulette Blackwell
