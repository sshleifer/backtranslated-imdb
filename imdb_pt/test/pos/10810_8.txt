Danton was a hero and one of the founders of the French Revolution of 1789. This film is set five years later and the revolution has turned into something ugly. While the revolution initially promised freedom, at this time the small committee that runs the country is extremely repressive and is a dictatorship. Danton and his friends were furious with how the country was not better off in 1794 than before getting rid of their king, so they began to criticize the government. The film begins when the printer who makes critical leaflets about the government is beaten and his business is destroyed. So much for "freedom, equality and fraternity"! Thus, as a result of being silenced in this way, Danton et al. Begin to publicly criticize the government. Eventually, Robespierre (the committee leader) and his colleagues end the charges, have a trial and get rid of dissent. Some have mentioned that Polish director Wajda also intended this to be a criticism of his own nation - which at the time was Soviet-dominated and too repressive. This makes sense when you watch the movie unfold - especially when the government destroys all dissent "on behalf of the people." <br /> <br /> The acting is good, the story compelling and I do not have major criticism of the film. However, I really wanted the ending had been treated differently. Especially because, in addition to history lovers and French, they probably have no idea that this execution helped to end the government. After this purge of Danton in April 1794, Robespierre himself was executed in July 1794 because the country had just had enough - in addition, the surviving French knew that they too would face the guillotine sooner or later if that sick system remained in place. . Some sort of epilogue would have been good-like showing the soldiers coming to Robespierre. He replied trying to kill himself first, but he only managed to blow part of the face - still alive, he was guillotined shortly after. This would have been a small epilogue and could have been done in about five minutes. However, not showing a connection between Danton's death and the fall of government is a strange thing to omit.
