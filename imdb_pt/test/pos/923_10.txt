Well, every scene so perfectly presented. Never before had I seen a film like this that has meant in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> Well, while watching this movie, I remembered watching "Amilie." Amilie is also a similar type of movie with more fun and fantasy touch. These movies are based on the same plot line. But both are perfectly perfect in their own way and are able to create a world of their own. <br /> <br /> Red is capable of provoking many people's thoughts about destiny and dejavu. And I'm still thinking about it. <br /> <br /> The story is great and the ending is a bit funny. I was laughing at the final scene. Pretty funny as this three movie Red White and Blue are connected. <br /> <br /> All in all a great work of art. A work of a master. <br /> <br /> 10/10
