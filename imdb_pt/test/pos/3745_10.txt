Before talking about the end of this movie I will talk about the plot. Some guy named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and flees to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months, Kitty and her aunt leave for Scotland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty discovers that Gerald has aged and he has become more evil. Gerald has certain rules for the castle (the rules are the same as 200 years ago). Gerald does not want them to stay, but Kitty insists on making excuses. One night, his aunt glimpses the monster running down the hall. This scares her so much that she faints and (another excuse) they should stay longer. Kitty becomes more worried about Gerald after she tries to enter the labyrinth, but Gerald catches her and is even more cruel to her. Kitty then sends for reinforcements, she calls her doctor who is really her friend and her ample. So, so things do not look suspicious, invite some friends (who do nothing really). Blah, blah, blah Kitty and her aunt end up in the labyrinth where the greatest suspense in history is. They somehow separate and try to find each other. But the aunt is faced with the creature ... here is the moment that everyone waited, which is the creature that lurks in the shadows? ... is a giant toad !!! OMG what's better than that! After seeing the aunt, the frog literally goes crazy and runs, opa, I mean, jumps up the stairs to the top of the castle. The frog then jumps out of an open window. We then go on a shot from the ground and see the frog branch in our direction (oh yeah this movie was in 3-D). But you want to know what's funny is the frog that falls out of the window is actually a toy because it's 1/10 the size of the frog before jumping. It is then revealed that all this was fault of evolutions, blah, blah, and Kitty and Gerald get married. So the last photo of this work is from the tomb of the frog in the labyrinth, the only place where he was really happy;).
