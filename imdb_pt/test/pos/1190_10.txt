Treat Williams has reached a degree of stardom with this film, and really wasted. Do not be fooled by your poor movie choices ever since. This movie really stands out. "Hair" is a musical that really deals with the attitude, and probably more with the persona, of the famous 60s peace movement. There is a lot of spectacular music done in a spectacular way. Unlike video clips of the late 70's, 80's and 90's, video flashes match the theme of music. In other words, the video makes sense when combined with the songs, so you know you could never have done it on MTV. The subject is about drugs and hippies, but it's mostly an anti-war film dealing with the senseless tragedies of Vietnam. One of the protagonists is an Oklahoma kid who wants to make a difference, believing in all the patriotic dribbling he's fed, and he's faced with a gang in New York that is more or less glorified; his characters are unique and probably will not make sense today, but this group joins burning his drafts. What follows in spectacular scenarios and mesmerizing scenes involving not only the three lanes but the other 3 gang members as well as a newcomer with a small child whose entry is easily one of the ten grandest entrances of the cinema in part because she sings one of the greatest songs of this generation. Despite your flaws, you start to love these people, a cinematographic triumph with a heartfelt and grand finale.
