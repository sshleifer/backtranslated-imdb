I just wanted to inform anyone who might be interested that the movie "New Jersey Drive" was my all time favorite. I admire the work that Nick Gomez and Spike Lee put into this masterpiece of a movie. This film impressed me greatly because of its reality and its appreciation of the details of life in the urban area of ​​New Jersey. This caught my attention, personally, because I grew up with friends like the ones portrayed in the movie. This impressed me most because I used to spend time in Teaneck several years ago so some of the characters were kept "real". Sometimes this movie looked like a documentary because you did not know if those real events were happening or not. Although films such as "Boys in the Hood" and "Menace II Society" attract more attention, I personally think these films have been somewhat "enhanced" to appeal to a wider audience. "New Jersey Drive" was an intransigent part of reality "in your face". Lee and Gomez covered every detail of this urban drama of music, clothing, slang and location. Unlike some of the films I mentioned earlier, the actors presented themselves as if they were not "actors." Nothing was compromised to make a good "theater". The only misfortune to come from this movie was the fact that many people "slept" in it. I look forward to more works of art from Nick and Spike in the near future.
