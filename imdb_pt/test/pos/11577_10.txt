Since many other users have already explained and commented on the plot, I will not do that. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to reaffirm that Bardem's performance is great, as well as those of the other actors and actresses in this film. Reading the previous comments, I have noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film does not show opposing views to euthanasia and that those gifts are ridiculed. In my honest opinion, this is far from true. <br /> <br /> There are many characters that move in a gray zone between loving Ramón Sampedro and wanting him to stay, and understanding his desire to die. The most obvious of them is the family. For example, Ramon's sister-in-law never speaks for or against euthanasia. Another of these characters is Gené (the social rights activist) who, at the last moment, tells Ramón to rethink everything. The scene clearly shows that she does not want him to die. <br /> <br /> So there are characters that are clearly against euthanasia. Ramón's brother is clearly against him, as is his father ("There is only one thing worse than the death of the son, and it is to have a son who wants to die"). Other users commented that the discussion between Ramón and the priest is ridiculed and filmed to make us think that Ramón is BOM and the priest is EVIL. Well, no doubt the scene is comical, but that does not mean the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. From my point of view, the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince Ramon to continue living using arguments totally unrelated to Ramon's thought. The priest's speech follows the line of "God gives and God takes," "We are not the owners of our own lives, they belong to God" ... and so on. The comedy arises from the fact that Ramón is an atheist and everything the priest is telling him is therefore absurd. <br /> <br /> This film is the antithesis of Manichaeism, it leaves the viewer the chance to think about it and make their own opinion. And above all, it is a song of FREEDOM.
