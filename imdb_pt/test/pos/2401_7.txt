I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternately. Anger arose in me to see the ruin of Hanoi after the 12-day bombardment. And living in the country now with my parents, who have lived in Saigon for 50 years, I understand that we are much better now and that it would be better if the American did not bring the war here. Watching the film, I learned more about the different types of wars the US has planned in Vietnam and about the disasters they have caused. <br /> <br /> The series seems to get along well with interviews with real people. But I do not like that some people only give generic opinions, like the analyst near the end of the series, I forgot his name. <br /> <br /> There should also be more documentary footage, such as life in the South Vietnam army camp and those in the North (if possible). There is also a sudden change from the year 1972 to 1975 (I'm not sure if the medium was censored because I watched the series on TV).
