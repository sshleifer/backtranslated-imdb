Good, boring or bad? It's good. Worth your money? If you can spare him a ticket, that's for sure. Better than the trailer makes it sound like? Yes, strangely. <br /> <br /> There is not much in the script - the guards working in the armored truck company move large sums of money. Guards see the opportunity to retire as millionaires, one of them is too honest to agree to all of this, and a well-defined plan goes to hell. This could have been a badly executed Reservoir Dogs ripoff, but the cast's ability and the director's ability to make anything strained pull out of that realm and put it on a solid foundation.
