I need help identifying an episode of the Queens King. It starts with a scene where Doug is talking to Carrie on the phone, and he suggests that they agree to stop ending each conversation with "I love you". However, it's hard to do and he ends up calling her, just to close with "I love you". It's a very smart time and one that I think says a lot about relationships that have lasted a long time. <br /> <br /> I think (but I'm sure) that it's the same episode where Doug gets some guys from the local building. whistle and make grim remarks on Carrie to cheer her up. <br /> <br /> I saw this episode recently, but it was probably a repeat. I do not know what network I saw. Can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode?
