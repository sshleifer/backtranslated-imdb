In Mississippi, former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife who has just left him. He finds the city whore and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) thrown on the road near his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nurturing her as a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is dismissed from the army because of her anxiety problem, he misinterprets Lazarus and Rae's relationship and tries to kill him. <br /> <br /> "Black Snake Moan" is a strange tale of faith, hope, love and blues. The talented Christina Ricci performs impressively in the role of a young vagabunda abused from childhood by her father and having had sex with the whole city where she lives. It's amazing the versatility of this actress, and probably this is the most mature work I've ever seen on Christina Ricci. Samuel L. Jackson also performs fantastically in the role of Lazarus. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard in a movie, with wonderful blues. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Between Heaven and Hell" ("Between Heaven and Hell")
