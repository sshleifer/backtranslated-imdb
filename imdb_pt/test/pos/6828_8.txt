"Confirmed Dead" is an important episode in the series, featuring four new characters: the rescue team Naomi contacted before taking a knife from Locke's back. However, as the quote in my one line summary says, your true purpose of being on the island may be something totally different. All new characters seem intriguing (especially Miles, some sort of psychic / exorcist), but at this point it's too early to make solid judgments. I felt that this episode was a slight step down from "The Beginning Of The End" (without flash-forward this time; short-term flashbacks), but it still has its impressive moments and takes steam near the end. *** 4.
