The glaring, cold landscape of Big Sky Country, with its majestic snow-capped mountains juxtaposed with arid plains, is used poetically in this exposition of Lynch's fables and slides, about the death and melancholy of young and talented Polish Brothers (formerly indie film fans treated to the bizarre and fascinating "Twin Falls Idaho" - a movie about a young girl falling in love with two brothers who are Siamese twins). A small orphan is dying, and a city is about to flood in the name of progress (in the form of a damaged hydroelectric power plant). With its strangely nice soundtrack, minimalist dialogues and character development, and strange fantasy sequences involving some unique angels, the Polish brothers focus on what every good movie artist knows about the film, moving images ... images, scenes ... deep beauty paintings captured on celluloid. This is best to be seen late at night so that the amazing images can stay in your mind and go over you while you fall asleep. The fact that all this was done with a budget of less than two million dollars puts Hollywood with its costs of swollen movies and empty films to shame and indicates something great to come from the Polish brothers in the future.
