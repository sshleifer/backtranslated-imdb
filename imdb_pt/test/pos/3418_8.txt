... and usually I do not like surprises !! Watch this movie by chance at a motel in South Africa in the second week of a three-month motorcycle holiday in ZA. Besides being well filmed and well-acted, it helped me to understand the problems of the countries tremendously. He just watched the "Million Dollar Baby" and had to look for Hillary Swank, since the name sounded familiar and her performance was superb. I did not realize she was the solicitor at Red Dust. Well, now I'm not worried that she'll disappear like so many other Clint partners before ... Now I'm being asked to write ten entire lines of commentary which is pretty ridiculous for I wrote what I wanted to write. OK, here it goes: I think if you are from a western country, especially from Europe, watching it will help you understand a little better because what is happening is happening down there! So we hope this fills ten lines.
