This movie will not win awards for its greatness. But if you have a free hour and a half and enjoy some light entertainment, then you can do a lot worse than watching this ... The cast is mostly young and handsome, the script has some genuinely funny moments and the soundtrack is cool too. Rupert Penry-Jones as Jake seems to have the most fun while Laura Fraser as Justine is sweet, friendly and funny. <br /> <br /> I rented it because I like the 'Spooks' series that RPJ is currently starring in. And here he is young and affable and the perfect eye for a girls night out. <br /> <br /> Get some wine and some ice cream and have a laugh.
