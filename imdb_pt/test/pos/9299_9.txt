I know one should not comment on the comments of other reviewers, but I will say that many of the negative comments seem to come from people who already knew a lot about the Manhattan Project and were upset about the things that were left out. (From his book 'Smoking In Bed' it seems that the original screenwriter Bruce Robinson is another one.) I knew very little before watching the movie, however, and found it fascinating. Dwight Schultz is absolutely hypnotizing as Oppenheimer - a truly magnetic and charismatic presence, an inspired cast that makes me wonder why he is not given better roles and more main parts. John Cusack and Paul Newman are excellent as always. It can be argued with several choices of script or direction, but as it is the film is extremely intense and sometimes horrible and in general I give four stars in five.
