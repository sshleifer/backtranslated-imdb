I was very impressed with this film that was directed by (Luigi Bazzoni). The story was about a young translator who suddenly lost her memory of the past three days and suffered nightmares with the astronauts on the moon. She can not explain how this happened to anyone. One day, a postcard arrives for her from Garma Island, where she will visit. Strangely, though people seem to know her, even though she has never been there before. Also your astronaut dreams on the moon come back to her. <br /> <br /> I thought this was a very weird Italian movie that looked very amazing at times and there were also strange images in the movie that seemed to stick with you the whole time you were watching the movie. I would recommend this movie to people just to see how good it is. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
