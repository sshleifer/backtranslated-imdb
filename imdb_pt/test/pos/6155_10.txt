I saw this movie in Wales in July. It is the courage of the Czech pilots who flew numerous missions to the RAF after their country was occupied by the Nazis. In this film, action occurs both in the early 1950s when those pilots were being beaten in political prisons in Czeckoslavakia and during World War II in Britain. They were arrested after their return to their homeland because the communist regime saw these warriors as a threat to the occupation of Czeckoslavakia. Pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous aerial battles against Nazi pilots. This film contains a sub-plot of love that makes sense because it helps us understand that both civilians and soldiers have made great sacrifices to preserve democracy. The end of this film indicates that the heroism of these Czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990s, after the restoration of democracy in the country, then known as Czeckoslavakia. This powerful and moving film was made with the financial support of the Czech government. I highly recommend this movie.
