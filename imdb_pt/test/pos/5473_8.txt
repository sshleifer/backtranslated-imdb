Seriously, any movie with John Malkovich is usually pretty good. And that includes Clint Eastwood, Ren√© Russo, John Mahoney (Frasier), Dylan McDermott (The Practice), and many other great actors. <br /> <br /> Clint is getting old now, but thanks to him he is also an incredible director (by itself.) We are accustomed to Wolfgang "water movies" like Das Boot, Poseidon and Perfect Storm - <br /> <br /> The assassin's premise is as serious as possible, the film is very rhythmic, a bit of violence is a bit ... But it is fully recommended (but not for children).
