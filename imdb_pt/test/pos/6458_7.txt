Axel Nordman (Cassavetes) appears in the New York shipyards looking for a job, but with a hidden past. He gets one on condition of a kick back to boss Jack Warden. While there, he creates a friendship with the black Sydney Poitier that unfortunately leads to a harrowing moral dilemma for a man who, we learn, usually runs away from his problems. <br /> <br /> The movie looks like an Oscar. Winner No Waterfront, looks like On the Waterfront, and more importantly, plays much like the 1954 production in Kazan. However, its racial theme is groundbreaking for the time. The black Poitier and the white Cassavetes are treated as equal in all respects. It may even be called the first of the black and white "friends" photos that would later dominate so many action movies. <br /> <br /> It is a great help that the two protagonists play so well in each other. However, the central flaw of the film is to fail to indicate why Team Leader Poitier befriends the stern Cassavetes. He really does everything to make friends with the newcomer. But why he would cross the racial barriers to do this is never really suggested. One possible explanation is that Poitier wants to use Cassavetes as a pawn in his rivalry with the other team boss, Warden, but then genuinely likes the guy. There is a suggestion of this in some of Cassavetes' suspicious reactions, but in addition, the relationship seems unmotivated. <br /> <br /> If there is a single scene in the entire movie, I could not identify. Everything is done in the decadent place of New York, without the usual extras of the cinema. In that sense, it's an anti-Hollywood production, carefully smashed even on the nightclub scene, which looks like a real after-hours crowd. I suppose sociologists would give this rather crude slice of life "a glimpse of the working poor." <br /> <br /> However, despite all its virtues, which are many, the film remains very close to Brando. Kazan movie for comfort. Here, a beautiful unknown actress Kathleen Maguire takes on the role of the redemptive girlfriend Warden, the role of the corrupt labor chief, while Cassavetes, like Brando, must suffer a bloody beating before regaining her moral standing and doing the right thing. Yet, despite its derivative nature, the urban drama retains enough of the original strength to deserve a look.
