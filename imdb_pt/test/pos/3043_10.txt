I saw this movie for the first time just over a year ago. I've seen this 4 more times since then. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself a connoisseur of classic cinema. A real polished diamond in the rough. <br /> <br /> This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (main character "Conrack") as a young teacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the children of the islands, all in one school. At first, the students reveal that they know very little about the world other than their home on the island. The heart of the Conrack movie is finding inspiration to awaken their young minds to the world around them. Students quickly reward the teacher with a willingness to learn and a remarkable ability to understand concepts that, just before, were foreign to them. Conrack uses unconventional and intelligent teaching techniques that happen to be a bit of fun! God forbid. Learning and fun? Together? It can not be, or so it says those responsible. To avoid a spoiler, I'll just say that Conrack finds resistance with the boss ... and the ending is truly bittersweet. <br /> <br /> I am a white man of 35 years with some teaching experience, so I should identify myself with the main character, Pat Conroy (aka, Conrack, Mr. Petroy). But I do not identify with the black boys. As a child, I was taken by bus to school across town from grades 4 through 6, around 1979. These children in the film remind me of my classmates. Fortunately, in the 4th grade as an 8 or 9 year old, one does not understand racism. I just remember that we were all kids, playing quadricycle, kickball, hide and run relays. <br /> <br /> This movie is very touching. There are delightful and poignant moments from beginning to end, non-stop. I met often with tears in my eyes, and suddenly laughing loudly. It's a funny movie. <br /> <br /> "Get away from this winda !!" .... "Lord, if you're prepared to accept crap, I should tell you that the rabbit just did it on your lap" ..... "So you're the white teacher, Mr. Conrack. Mr. Conrack.You're a good teacher, you're a good-looking white man. "..." wind at 15 km / h from the east. Big boats, okay, do not worry about anything. "..." not a fried cook, but Eleanor Roosevelt, not a part grower, but (something Latin) ... that's Latin ... they wait! "...." Conrack sings like a frog ... I sing well, what are you talking about?! ". <br /> <br /> It still intrigues me that I still do not hear anything about this movie or that it has little reputation or followers. I intend to seek more opinions, comments, background and "making of" snacks if they are out there. What strikes me is the performance given by untrained boys. One of the children, Mary, I understand was an actress, and you can tell. However, the other children have many lines and genuine reactions. I wonder how they did it! I suppose Conrack and Mary had precise dialogues to work on while some scenes unfold naturally or improvised. <br /> <br /> Conrack is a special movie. In my opinion, it's one of the few movies that are so good and so unfamiliar. Others in this category are King Rat ('65), Dark Passage ('47 with Bogie and Bacall), Gods Must Be Crazy ('80) and Bad Day in Black Rock ('55). I recommend all of them. But first, sit in Mr. Conrack's class.
