I love this movie despite the fact that it simply misses out being great. It is an adult entertainment, full of problems that an adult person can relate to. The acting is superb. It's fun to see John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands as a middle-aged couple. Who knows how much of this came from the marriage itself? Susan Sarandon has never been sexier or more attractive than her free character, Aretha. Raul Julia is a joke like a lustful goat herder. The scenery in Greece is spectacular; the scenarios of New York cause me contortions due to many taken of the World Trade Center. Fantastic score of Stomu Yamashta. With so many things, why is not this a great movie? It's a bit incoherent and overly long, unfocused and uncomfortably unbalanced between humor and drama. Still, it's engaging, fun and deeply thoughtful.
