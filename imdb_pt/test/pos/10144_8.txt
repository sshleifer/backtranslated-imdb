Unfortunately, due to a slow start, I can not say that this is one of Hitch's best movies. It is very excellent, however. The film stars Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as parents who are caught up in a political assassination plot and should try to recover their kidnapped son. Both give great performances, not surprising, of course. Actually, however, I was very impressed by the incredible use of music by Hitchcocks. The climax at the Opera House was fantastic, and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was pure genius. An absolutely fantastic suspense came out of this scene. Also, the use of Doris Day singing "Que Sera, Sera" was excellent. Especially when transposed into scenes at the end of the movie. So this movie for me turns out to be Hitchcocks' best use of the music I've seen so far. Unfortunately it had a slow start, or I could recommend this movie a bit more. Even so, it's still worth a look. 8 out of 10.
