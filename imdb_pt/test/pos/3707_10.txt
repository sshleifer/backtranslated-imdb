This movie was made in the area where I grew up and now I live. I personally know most of the owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields around the isolated road shown at the end of the movie with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr and the car. I was told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are natives of North Carolina. I was lucky to see it at a local exhibit. At that screening he was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the film. The bus had no reverse gear and during filming, the driver missed the stopping point a few times and had to drive several miles to get back to the correct spot. These details of the technical issues have increased the pleasure for me. The film accurately portrays life in this area during World War II. A well made film and eagerly await the availability of the DVD.
