SPOILER ALERT !!! <br /> <br /> You can listen to Wong Kar-wai's films as a radio piece: invisible vibrations between the characters, the rooms where they stand, the rhythm that presses them, attraction and dislike - the whole spectrum of atmosphere is reproduced by the soundtrack. Dialogue is mostly completely unimportant. <br /> <br /> The narration is like a childish loving gaze to a beautiful woman and a sad man whose sorrows are perceptible but helpless. "In The Mood For Love" is told from a childish perspective, but the child never appears as a narrator. The aesthetics of the film is developed by an extreme dramaturgy of light and color, severe cuts, an almost documentary and independent camera and a complex and discreet sound. <br /> <br /> The genius use of "Maybe, Maybe, of Nat King Cole". Perhaps, "whose mysterious power grows more often repeats itself and the melancholy waltz helps in the graceful choreography of the two protagonists. Maggie Cheung in her beautiful dresses is brilliant, the perfect vis-Ã -vis the handsome and elegant Tony Leung. a romance between them, but Wong only sees a sad resignation.The two potential lovers are spinning around each other like satellites, knowing that they will never share the same orbit.You want them to meet.These will not do it and the power emotional relationship of his non-love-sex relationship makes the film immensely fascinating. <br /> <br /> It is a broken luck and an implicit love.In all of Wong's films, these are the leitmotives.Love, if it arrives too soon or is too late to accept one and not the other person, the longing for the characters who are never satisfied, the loneliness, the mourning, and the luck they feel when it's too late.
