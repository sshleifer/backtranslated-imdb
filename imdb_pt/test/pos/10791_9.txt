Oliver Stone is not one of those who run away from a movie or theme. He is eager to confront people with their fears or show them their ugly faces in the mirror. Look at your CV for proof! This film is no exception, on the contrary, it is another jewel, which unfortunately not many have seen. <br /> <br /> As controversial movies go, this is one that you should be grateful for. A movie that should encourage you to think of you, the people close to you. The preconceptions that exist and that we all have in one way or another. Either we like to admit it or not, but it's easier to categorize people and be like "Oh he's 'xyz', yes he must be like ...". Now I may be reading a lot about it, but I do not believe it. I believe that Oliver Stone is a very intelligent filmmaker and that he was pointing to these things. And if it's something you want to explore (like a movie or inside you), watch this movie and get excited!
