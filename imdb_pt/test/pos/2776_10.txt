Susie Q. is one of those rare and sweet movies that give her a warm feeling. It's bittersweet but healthy, and its characters are fun and catchy. At first, I thought the movie would be the clich√© of the cuddly movie that would annoy me after five minutes, but I was wrong. It made me cry at times, and the plot was attractive, making me cheer for the good guys. I loved the movie and I still remember it today, 9 years later !! I highly recommend it to ANYONE, and the film is family oriented, so you do not have to worry about inappropriate content. Indeed, if Disney were to show more films like Susie Q's, it would be the most popular family-oriented channel in the world. Now, if Disney shows just one more time! ^ _ ^ Go to Susie Q. !!
