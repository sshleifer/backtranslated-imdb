I just watched The Dresser tonight, having seen it only once before, about twelve years ago. <br /> <br /> It's not a "big" movie, and it does not try to make a big splash, but my God, the brightness of the two tracks leaves me practically speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing short of amazing in this film. <br /> <br /> Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his closet Norman (Courtenay), a sort of valet. , wearing a production of King Lear during the London blitz in World War II. These are two men, each dependent on the other: you are almost helpless without Norman's help to persuade you, persuade you, and intimidate you into the stage for Lear's 227th performance. And Norman lives his life indirectly through Sir; without the Lord needing it, it is nothing, or thinks it is, anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and, as such, requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. Finney, just 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, aggressive, but brilliant acting actor. He whistles and fucks with his fellow actors even when they are catching their bows! And Courtenay is no less compelling than the sting decorator, who must sometimes act more like a mother than as valet for her elderly employer. Employer is actually the wrong term to use, however. For although his relationship is technically an employer and employee, most of the time Sir and Norman act as nothing more than an old couple. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are others in the cast of this movie. But there is no doubt that the real stars are Finney, Courtenay and the wonderful script of Ronald Harwood. This is not to say that there are no other good performances, most notably Eileen Atkins as Madge, the stage manager suffered. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets and what could have been. <br /> <br /> Although not talked about in those days, it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Oscars: nominations for Best Actor for Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates) and Best Adapted Screenplay. <br /> <br /> I remembered being a good movie, but I was not prepared to be as hypnotized as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what a great performance is, and have lots of fun all the time, then I encourage you to watch The Dresser.
