This is a typical Sandra Bullock movie in which she plays a sulky (but profane) woman who is in trouble, but finds a way to survive and be the heroine. Sound familiar? <br /> <br /> There are many holes in this story. Things just do not add up and some of the suspense is a little tacky. But this suspense is very good. There is a lot of tension in this story that has strong paranoia. The story begins slowly, but it comes into action very soon and remains so, becoming an engaging film for the viewer. That's why I give a very good note - the movie involves you in it. Bullock is cuter than annoying, which she usually is to me, so this is my most watched movie with her.
