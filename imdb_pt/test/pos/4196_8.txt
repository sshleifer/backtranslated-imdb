"I'm proud of 'head'," said Mike Nesmith. It should be because this movie, which either has been ridiculed by many of us or studied and examined by film teachers, works on many levels. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is not conventional. For many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers handed him the film and tried, "You figure it out." <br /> <br /> You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a great marketing success that depended on business acumen and was not small. serving as public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain. That The Monkees came out of the box for a short time to do "Head" is a testament to the group's popularity and importance in pop culture, regardless of where their head is. Make one thing clear: "Head" is not the Monkees TV show. <br /> <br /> So what we have here is a "psychedelic documentary" about Western pop culture, from a source who has authority on the subject. "Head" is a movie that can only come from those "inside the box". In 1968, the cast and crew of The Monkees were experienced and weary professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment. The film was a deliberate attempt at repositioning in the market. So he did three things: make a movie the way the Monkees figured it out. More importantly, reinvent the group to one that is not subservient to the old bosses - and is more modern than before. Make a film that exposes American attitudes of dissemination of information. <br /> <br /> The "head", therefore, is really about media manipulation and its net result: deception. The mass media must inform, educate us about events in the world at large, and finally asks us to form opinions about these events that can shape thinking into positive action. So we assume that the information we absorb is complete and unbiased - otherwise, how can we establish a valuable conclusion about any idea presented by a book, newspaper, or TV show? In one of the street interviews in "Head," one guy admits, "I have not seen a newspaper or TV in years." Is he smaller or better man? Even the drug parallels are a soft veil of "things are not as they seem". Remember the old joke: "Everything you know is wrong"? The script begins with The Monkees' public admission of their own "fabricated image" and runs with football - literally. Is the football scene in the film a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind "Head"? Is the film an exercise in the flow of consciousness? Is the movie the culmination of marathons smoking marijuana? There are too many coincidences that occur in the film that suggest otherwise. My guess is that "Head" is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intentional and unintentional. In large part, the insiders responsible for "Head" seem to have fun at the parties that take place in the film, but there is anger - rage of chaos that characterized the late 60s and anger at the way the media, especially television, had changed culture in negative ways. Drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late 1960s and still are, but the producers of "Head" want you to know that "information" is a much greater danger. <br /> <br /> The wars were attributed to fraud and lies. What a perfect way to spread disinformation than through TV? Repeatedly, the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle for the Monkees and, apparently, all of us as well. In one scene, Peter is grumpy sitting in a bar holding an ice cream cone melting, and is asked by a fellow Monkey: "What's wrong?" "I bought this ice cream and I do not want it." The film suggests that the primary purpose of the media is not to inform but blindly sell in bulk. "Head" goes further: it puts any idea in someone's head and fortunately it goes. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers know this, and the danger is real. "Head" is a film that is created "as we go along" or is a deliberate statement. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it's just "Pot finds publicity" as critics criticized in 1968. The jokes are in The Monkees and we. Be careful what you ask for, you can get it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations: A real guilty pleasure. Very funny. Intelligent. It will please the fans. Find the substance, it's there. Unashamedly weird. Bizarre collection of characters. Good tunage The length is appropriate. Many great pamphlets, including my favorite prophetic of all time: "The tragedy of your times, my young friends, is that you can get exactly what you want." Warnings: Dated. Drugs. No plot. No linear delivery of any particular thought. At least twenty-five stories that are intertwined in fashion. So you can easily frustrate. It may seem pretentious to some. People who do not support Monkees do not need to watch, though that is no reason to avoid it. Psychedelic special effects can kill your sick image tube or your burned eyes with acid. <br /> <br /> Combine, cut.
