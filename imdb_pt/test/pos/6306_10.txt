I've seen this movie so many times, it's good. Perhaps because I can relate to the way of life of Tittas is the reason why. Not everyone would find it to their liking. Also, my Italien is improving after each preview. Am I a sad case? Thank you, Mr. Sorrentino. I look forward to your next movie. Although I have not seen the movie in a movie theater, I have the DVD and I encourage anyone to buy it. The special feature alone is worth the price. The amount of time a director spends on producing a movie is very rarely appreciated, and the extras on the DVD give a great insight into the making of a movie. As for the story of the movie, I'm biased. It turns out that I talk about it to all my friends, but as I said before, I relate a lot to the main character who is a loner in a situation that is not his own choice. . The Mafia in Sicily uses Titta to launder money at a Swiss bank. He owes them by costing them millions of dollars years ago in a stock market agreement that went awry. Love kills.
