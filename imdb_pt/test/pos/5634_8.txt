What gives this film its personality is the knowledge, in the end, that everything is true. Although it is a captivating and humorous documentary that borders on mockumentary in some parts (are they staged or is it really happening with humor?), It seems a bit long for the ending. <br /> <br /> Film is funny in places that it needs to be and flows relatively well. Remembering the films of Christopher Guest, if you liked these or Adaptation then I recommend you stay tuned to this movie. <br /> <br /> B +
