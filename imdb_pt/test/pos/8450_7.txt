"The Syndrome of China" launched a series of films about the potentially devastating effects of used nuclear power, a black cloud of paranoia that would hover over the United States during most of the Reagan years. It is a well-made and effective drama, given an extra punch by its high-powered stars, especially Jack Lemmon, who plays a high-stakes nuclear power plant employee suffering a crisis of consciousness. But one can not help but think that it was the accident of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident that occurred only a few weeks after the release of this film, which gave it its enduring appeal as a classic of the 1970s. it is not a classic. With a redheaded Jane Fonda as a reporter and a bearded Michael Douglas as her cameraman (and the producer of the movie, by the way). <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
