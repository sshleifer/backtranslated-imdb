Robert McKimson's "Acrobatty Bunny" is one of the director's best shorts. Although the circus-based setting may evoke horrific memories of McKimson's "Big Top Bunny", "Acrobatty Bunny" is by no means as monotonous as that farce. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion, 'Acrobatty Bunny' is cool and funny from the start, not to mention extremely attractive to look at. There is a classic scene in which Bugs Bunny takes a strangled lift out of its hole only to emerge directly into the lion's jaws. In a brilliant parody of Disney, he shouts "Pinocchio" in the lion's throat! This bright opening is a sign of things to come. There are some cleverly choreographed clowns in and around the lion cage to begin with, followed by a hilariously grotesque and annoying interpretation of "Laugh Clown Laugh" which as a child I used to pass me regularly! All this culminates in a small acrobatic sequence that gives name to the cartoon. I've never liked the circus as a scenario for cartoons and I guess it usually makes for a dull and predictable jokes set, but 'Acrobatty Bunny' breaks the mold and the result is a funny exciting shit that ranks among McKimson's best.
