Compared to the acclaimed remake of Hollywood, this film is less flashy but much stronger to provide an overview of the drug problem. The remake loses the most interesting of the three plot plots, that of a farmer whose meager subsistence depends on drugs as a payment culture and whose growing involvement with drug trafficking in an effort to improve himself and destroy his family. In addition, the history of the daughter's addiction goes to the problems not only of abstinence, but also of the high probability of relapse. This original miniseries makes good use of the additional time to dig deeper into issues and remains the strongest beef in this controversial subject.
