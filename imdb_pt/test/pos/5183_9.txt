Rosie Perez is the protagonist in this all-encompassing case, played as Mercedes, a young Brooklyn woman who decided to become a movie actress, despite not being favored by her circumstances, living in East Los Angeles and struggling with a series of fruitless hearings for any kind of part at all. Mercedes became involved with a ragged, married actor, Harry Harrelson (Harvey Keitel), who once performed on a Western television series in the 1970s, and rarely since, accepting him as a lover, partly because of loneliness. and also a hope that parts of films will come his way because of his "contacts," but the latter are of little consequence, for Harry is simply self-deluded in his attempts to recover what he perceives as past cinematic renaissance . To support herself adequately financially, Mercedes works as a taxi dancer at a downtown Los Angeles Skid Row bar / dance floor while continuing her efforts to succeed in the film business, and it is there in the dance hall that a young immigrant of Mexico, Ernesto (Michael DeLorenzo) falls in love with her and most of the narrative portrays his efforts to please the object of his affections, even if they could mean to lose it completely. Essentially this melodrama rooted in tradition gets only a moderate budget, despite the presence of a number of well-known players, including Steve Buscemi, Anthony Quinn and Stanley Tucci, and was kept in the can for about a year before being quite disqualified. distribution and lead marketing efforts in its favor, more pity that its solid production characteristics are firmly complemented by the admirably controlled direction of Alexander Rockwell, a consistent virtue of his work, and on display in this film since his own opening scene, frames which form an assembly behind the credits, with Perez at Fifth and Main Streets on Skid Row. Rockwell has often demonstrated that he works very closely with his cast, and this is true in this case, as he allows his actors to create their roles, while any improvisation is neatly arranged through the editing process, resulting in artistic success for the cast. director. , despite the negative comments of some traditional reviewers. The soundtrack of the film is aesthetically perfect, with much of the contribution of Tito Larriva, who also plays as band leader for the taxi dancers. Honorary performers here must go for the ever-vital Perez, although only below-average performance is delivered. A fair test for the quality of any movie is given when a viewer watches twice in a short period. Sitting down through this underrated work will be considered a great pleasure for many.
