A very insightful psychological thriller! Footprints is a stylish example of the powerful Italian cinema of the 70's. And Luigi Bazzoni, an unfairly underestimated and visually incredible director 'auteur'. The film develops its unusual plot with an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere and never disappoints, especially in its sad and dramatic ending! Florinda Bolkan delivers excellent performance, rich in nuances and touching sensitivity, being able to portray a black lady who is not only fascinating but also painfully real and tragically lonely. But the whole cast is a pleasure too! Lila Kedrova, Nicoletta Elmi (the mysterious girl on the beach), the Italian screen legend Caterina Boratto and the beautiful queen of cinema B, Evelyn Stewart, in the brief but haunted role of the protagonist's friend! And Klaus Kinski in a surprisingly disturbing appearance! It's peculiar to see how incredibly well-made films like Footprints were! Vittorio Storaro's grumpy, scary cinematography, stylized scenarios and scenarios, Nicola Piovani's dreamy trail, and, above all, the story, so intense and disturbing, so cleverly layered and structured! A thriller with fantastic elements, but especially with a soul and a personal vision. I wish movies like Footprints were not forgotten! I wish the films were more insightful and personal today, since they were back in the 60s and 70s! And yes ... I wish someone would soon make a widescreen DVD digitally remastered from this little masterpiece!
