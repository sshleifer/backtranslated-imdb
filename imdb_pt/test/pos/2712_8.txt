I did not know personally Karen Carpenter, nor Richard, so I must go as the film portrayed it. I think a better person to ask about his accuracy would be his brother Richard. However, from what I saw and learned about Karen, I felt her pain, shared her sadness and she was a very special person to me when I was a child. I know I was not born until 1965, so I did not know her as much as some of you older fans, but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music. I remember the song on "Radio" (every sha la la la whoa ... so well, etc) and I remember "We just started! In fact, I memorized many, many of his songs and some people ( some) tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to it (I'm not joking about it.) I also used to be anorexic during high school and part of college (1978-1987) to be exact and heavy anywhere from 82 pounds to eventually 120 pounds in 1987. I developed some very serious health issues that helped me identify with the actress portraying Karen in the movie. Mother (Agnes) was VERY MUCH like my mother in many ways and I could also feel the pain which Karen must have experienced. Why, my mother was often insensitive, critical and disapproving as Agnes was (if that were true accuracy). The film was useful to identify and meet Karen on a more personal note, not just listening to her music, but seeing what she was doing the ult. to portray a person's life in 2-3 hours and recount every detail perfectly, so I would have to say that there is probably no biography that is so accurate. I'll give this story an 8 though! I would like to meet Karen personally! I would have died to meet her !! I would love to have squeezed her hand, given her a hug or talked to her. I feel your warmth and love every time I hear one of your songs and she misses so much.
