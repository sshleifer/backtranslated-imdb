Although the wonderful soft drink counter at the local pharmacy does not exist, and the clothes are definitely coming after the war, and good and evil are easy to understand, and those old planes are really dated, this movie will never be dated. <br /> <br /> Postwar adjustments and human problems, beautiful love stories, wonderful acting (especially Harold Russell and Dana Andrews) are as moving today in 2002 as they were in 1946. <br /> <br /> I was one of the young women who welcomed our wonderful World War II veterans. Like so many others, my memories of war years and returns are as fresh today as if they had happened yesterday - this movie is very relevant to our times.
