It may not be Miyazaki's best work, but I could not help but love him to death. A five-year-old boy finds what he thinks is a goldfish trapped in a bottle. He saves his life and keeps her in a bucket as a pet, but is really a magical being, the daughter of a human wizard and a sea goddess. Ponyo, as the boy calls her, is taken back to the sea by his father, who tries to discourage her from returning to earth and to become human, but she enters her magical elixirs and does what she wants to do. The story is simple and cute. Where the film actually comes to life, though, is in its tremendous work of art. The drawings are more childish than in any other work of Miyazaki, but there is beauty in its simplicity. As with all his films, Miyazaki creates this world of imagination that I was so much admired. Seeing this in the theater brought back memories of what it was like when the opening notes of Jo Hisaishi's score for Princess Mononoke took over and gave me shivers a little over a decade ago (the score here is equally as wonderful). I wanted to live in this world and never leave here.
