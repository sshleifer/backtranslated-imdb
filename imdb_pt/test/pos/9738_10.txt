I originally saw the Flash Gordon series on PBS, and I thought it was fun and amazing, I forgot the special effects of rockets with stars, and the great dragon monster with lobster claws, who cares about this is 1936 and it was a series , so each week they showed a new chapter, buster Crabbe played the Gordon flash 3 times in all 3 series. In 1939 he played with the Rogers, in 1933 he played Tarzan the undaunted. He was a very busy actor. the sexy dale Arden. Frank Shannon, as Professor Zarkov, and Charles Middleton represented the evil Ming the ruthless. He makes Darth Vader look like a boyscout. The serials were very close to Alex Raymond's comic strip. Space travel was just a dream. One can not speak of lightning and television weapons. This is the best series ever. Gordon's journey to Mars is 2 more chapters, Gordon's next flash conquest the universe is only 12 chapters. mongo .., hawk-males, lion-men, shark-m in the feature version leaves out the shark-men scenes. for the full effect, you should see the complete series. I heard that George Lucas was inspired by flash Gordon when he went to war in the stars. Gordon was from universal studios. And the music on the soundtrack is from many universal films as the bride of Frankenstein, werewolf. London, daughter of Dracula, etc. Even today, Gordon continues to delight young and old people.10 out of 10.
