In fact, I had considered investing in that film when Gorman was in the funding dispute. I loved most of the script, but I did not like the ending. Gorman insisted that the ending was as it should be. Seeing the full movie, I have to say I'm impressed. Reading the script, I had not imagined that the acting (and Gorman's direction) would be as powerful and moving as it is here. The two tracks did an incredible job. They were very believable and it's worth watching this movie just for the presentations of these two amazing stars. <br /> <br /> Now, for the spoiler and if you have not yet seen the movie, do not read over while you need to see the movie first. (I really wish I'd never read the script just to have tried the movie to finish first hand.) <br /> <br /> ------------------- - --------- SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have two main problems with the movie. First, and I'm sure I mentioned that when I read the script, the wife should have died. If she were dead, the end would be far more believable. So we have this guy who has agonized with a woman who left him 'years ago'. If she left him and he is still in love after all this time, he would have to be seriously delusional. But he does not come across it in the script. (There is also the problem of why he did not spend all this energy going after the wife he still loves.) <br /> <br /> Furthermore, if the wife was dead we could really believe they had one fulfilling, returning love, and therefore I believe the guy is devastated enough that the end is reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, I do not buy Daphne by doing what she does in the end. I would need a lot of conviction to believe that this naive girl (very naive to a prostitute, but believable because of Bohl's performance) did what she did. The character simply is not cold enough. And if she did it with some kind of love, or something else, then there's an entire part of the movie / story missing. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie is reminiscent of "Sex, Lies and Video Cassette." I think it might have been so popular if Gorman had chosen to give the film a more believable ending. <br /> <br /> So watch the movie, enjoy the performance. And make your own mind.
