I filmed this movie. I'm very proud of the movie. It was a great experience that appears on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the film the exact way we imagined it while preparing the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters but also worked well when shooting the movie, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an incredible bow, which contributes to a great story. I feel that all the actors gave excellent performances. I disagree with some of the other reviews that said the acting was not good. Watch and decide for yourself.
