Not everyone likes this movie. It's still one of the best "you have to be thinking" movies about Satanism ever made. The fact of not having leap cuts in the MTV era or every seven minutes is irrelevant. Also, speaking as someone who really KNOWS satanists, the spoiler warning! From the movie where the Brotherhood trades its old bodies for those of pre-teen kids, it has some genuinely scary scenes. The section in which (second spoiler alert) Strother Martin orchestrates the change is almost hyper-real in that it uses very few special effects, a trademark of this film. McEveety rarely received a large budget, but was often effective. Also worked in this case.
