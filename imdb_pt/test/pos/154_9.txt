No pun intended. I will not ruin anything about the story, but it's safe to assume you already know, what kind of character the lead actor portrays. And, of course, being a priest while being "naughty" exaggerates all that. Also, this is Park Chan Wook's most erotic movie yet. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Wook's previous works / films, you know he's very visual (in a good way) and shows again here. As he walks away from the revenge theme of his previous films on the surface, there's still some heat hidden beneath. And when it boils, some bad things start to happen. But through all this darkness, there are also moments of light (fun) to be experienced as well. A very stylistic and provocative film that lives off the mainstream and does a great job ...
