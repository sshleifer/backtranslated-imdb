So it's a bit dated now, it's almost 30 years old. Amazingly, I have it on BETA tape and it still plays very well. If I came to the DVD, I'd crash in the blink of an eye. <br /> <br /> The humor of drugs is not appreciated today as it was back then. So it was not so "damaging". Much like driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. I remember my dad crying, he was laughing so much watching it. I had co-workers in the 90's who had seen and I could arrest them by entering the intercom and saying "Iiiiiiiivvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy". <br /> <br /> Great lines, great parody of the original, and funny to me anyway up to three decades later!
