Little Dieter Needs Fly was my first movie during the 1999 edition of the GÃ¶teborg Filmfestival. As I was extremely tired that night, I was hesitant to see this, but the delirious overall score of 9 here on IMDB made me go there. <br /> <br /> 80 minutes of pure life force! Trying the life of Dieter Denglers through his own words was delightful. <br /> <br /> SEE! And if possible ... see in a movie!
