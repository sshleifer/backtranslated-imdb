The profile above was written by me when I used the nick of OldWereWolf56 which is still my email address. I still believe that Andy Devine's Frisky character is the best of the Twilight Zone episodes and I watch this episode at least once a year, since I consider Frisby a lucky man because he has many friends who love him a lot. <br /> <br /> In the event that many of you are too young to remember, I'm 61, Andy Devine organized an entertainment show for kids in the 50's that I believe called Andy's Gang. In it he had three assistants: a cat named Midnight who played the violin, a mouse named Squeaky playing a hand organ, and a fiendish toad named Froggy who could appear and disappear at will by embarrassing many of Andy's special guests like Billy Gilbert.
