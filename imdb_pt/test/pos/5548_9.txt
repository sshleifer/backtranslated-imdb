was a very well written film, and the actors had a very exquisite way of portraying the whole character. but as the movie came to an end I felt like there was more but they forgot to put it on the DVD. maybe they're planning to do a sequel ... well, even if they're not, it's a good movie and a good rental, but even a better buy.
