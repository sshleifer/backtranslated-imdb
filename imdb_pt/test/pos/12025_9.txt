This Bravo special is one of the most fun things I've ever seen on TV. Unlike Me First & The Gimme Gimmes (the first Punk-Supergroup / Cover-Band in the world), The Dan Band really should be seen to be enjoyed. <br /> <br /> On paper, The Dan Band is just an atheist joke sings female songs and inserts gratuitous swearwords into the lyrics. If you listen to the "Dan Band Live" CD, it will be all you can, and everything will be faster. (I just bought it because I had some songs that were not on the TV special.) But what made Dan Finnerty a Hollywood cult hero is his incredible onstage presence. This guy has his audience for every second he's on stage. And support singers are also a big part of the visual punchline. As for the actual band, they are out of sight most of the time, but they are certainly much more energetic and enthusiastic than their typical lounge support band. Hopefully, a DVD version will be released soon - almost certainly some songs have been cut and although heavy censorship adds some unintentional humor, it also removes INTENTIONAL mood. <br /> <br /> If there is any sense in Worldwide, casino owners in Las Vegas will soon be struggling to know who can build Dan their own showroom faster. <br /> <br /> "Re ------- my name ... FAME!"
