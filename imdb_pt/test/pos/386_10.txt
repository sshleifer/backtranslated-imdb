"Strangers on a Train" was one of those movie classics I've always heard of, but somehow I've never been able to see it. I finally watched it a couple of weeks ago and, as always with any Hitchcock movie, it not only stood the test of time, but it outperformed most of the thrillers being made today. You can see the inspiration for future action films here - the culminating finale with the out-of-control carousel and the two dueling villains reminded me of the great action sequence at the end of Jan de Bont's "Speed." "Of course" Strangers "is more than forty years older than" Speed ​​"and does not contain modern special effects, but the visceral emotion is there - Hitchcock was a true genius. so subtle side of Bruno (Robert Walker in an incredible performance) has taken shape in many other psycho-stalker figures in future films.Look it a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Single White Female." He met Guy before he even met it on the train - almost feels that their contact is not incidental - and soon becomes totally obsessed with it. Hitchcock loved the oedipal elements in his films (see also "Psycho" for tones Bruno's father hates him and wants him to die so he can stay with his mother.His effeminate manners and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped through the censors in 1951 when gays were not "allowed" portrayed on the screen - but Hitchc ock passes the message effectively when we see Bruno in the lounge on the phone wearing a non-male robe, flirting with Guy and responding to his mother. <br /> <br /> The deep layers of this film make it a fast-paced thriller that you can go back to over and over again - unfortunately it's being remade as a big-budget Hollywood production, but after seeing the original, I honestly can not imagine anything that surpasses the white emotions of the film.
