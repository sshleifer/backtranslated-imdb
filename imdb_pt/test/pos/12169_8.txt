The trio is a pleasant and nostalgic journey at the first sign of desire - when it was still about the simple exploration of the unknown - before we "grow" and add to those complexities of HIV status, emotional baggage, and emotional mixture. <br /> <br /> The anguish portrayed is pure adolescent anguish, but it is true in all three stories. Your sweetness and positivity make you feel good that you are gay. And these types of movies are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Good news! Both Boys Life and Boys Life 2 are now available on DVD in September 1999.
