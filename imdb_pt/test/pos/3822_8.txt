Ah the outer limits. I love this show. It was surprisingly scary or mysterious. I loved every genre of the show, from terror, from suspense to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I think I must have started to see the path after it was canceled, when the Sci-fi showed it as a replay, or played marathons from it. It was a very good show, I do not know everything about the stations and everything, but I remember every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV said, "There's nothing wrong with your television. the image "I would squeal with pleasure. It was a good show, and I like watching it if it happens. I give a healthy 8 out of 10.
