I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theater and immediately went to IMDb to search. I was greeted by a comment from another user, who believed it was nothing special, a 6 out of 10, and below expected. I would feel morally negligent if I did not disagree. <br /> <br /> Now, I am an avid fan of the Masterpiece Theater, but often the stories can be a little silly on television, for example, "He knew it was right" was absolutely horrendous. "Carrie's War", however, is probably the best I've seen so far. The whole cast does a great job, and kept my interest more than any other piece I've seen recently. The Evans character is of particular interest, and through subtle images of, for example, a pristine birthday cake or a grenade ring, my opinion of him went from bad to really good. Truly. His final death, and the story of how everyone around him made him a hard and cold man, was what brought me the bittersweet of that story. <br /> <br /> The end is gratifying in every way, except in one; that everyone did not get what they deserved, but things in general worked. I absolutely recommend this to everyone.
