Obviously, Ponyo can be seen not as just another stupid animation movie that a studio could pose to simply survive. It is far from that, and can easily be described as a captivating and beautiful cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Miyazaki has indeed another masterpiece. Now for many, this was said to be the least of his feats in filmmaking, due in part to his "certain factor of strangeness" not being there. This is true - the morals and insights that are not so evident in his previous films are very clear in this picture. Ponyo is not too difficult to understand or understand. His idea, I believe, was to make a children's movie that was as suitable for adults as their children, and for it to be so complicated. He accomplished this perfectly, and he also did not lose any substance along the way, which is why he earns a 10. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film itself is so captivating from the start, and the way it is presented is so beautiful, that it left me at times admired, because I remembered how they were all drawn by hand by Miyazaki himself. I have not been so enlightened and happy after seeing a movie since I saw it once a while ago (another movie not to be missed). Everything about Ponyo was absolutely stunning and breathtaking; even the music was pure perfection. The only bad thing I have to say about it was his dubbing in English. Do not get me wrong, they were good too, but I had seen Ponyo about two weeks before leaving nationally, and I believed that in some places I wish I had kept some of their dialogues in Japanese (not all Ponyo is absolutely flawless and in another movie league. Finally, and do not argue with me, but I would not be surprised if Ponyo was nominated for an Oscar for best film, since there are now 10 films that can be nominated for it.
