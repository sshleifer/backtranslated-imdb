In one of the best films of the year, Tom Hanks stars as Congressman Charlie Wilson in this sardonically funny and extremely relevant historical comedy-drama (given current events) around the 1980s Afghan / Soviet fiasco. The Soviets were attacking Afghanistan by killing hundreds of people. Why should anyone care? People are dying, right? No, the reason the United States got involved with Charlie Wilson was because the Afghans, afraid of being hit, began to illegally enter Pakistan, which in turn led Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. Charlie Wilson in an effort to fix this situation joined Texas's sixth richest and most religious fanatic, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), and a fun-loving, hard-nosed CIA spy, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to help fuel Afghans . with high-tech weapons to destroy Soviet fighter planes that would try to attack their lands. <br /> <br /> Although certainly not a serious Oscar nominee for Best Picture, "Charlie Wilson's War" is probably one of the best. of the many political films of the year. Oscar-winning Mike Nichols provides solid direction as one would expect, while Emmy Award-winning Aaron Sorkin (Night of the Sport, The West Wing) provides a remarkable script that balances comedy and drama almost seamlessly. The acting is also great for the most part. Tom Hanks makes his best and most enjoyable performance since his 2000 Oscar nomination as a FedEx worker stranded on a tropical island in 'Cast Away'. Hanks takes on a viscous character like Wilson and, with his characteristic charm, turns him into a nice guy. Amy Adams and Ned Beatty are as reliable as ever, but the real highlight of the film is Philip Seymour Hoffman. Arguably the best actor working in the film industry today, Hoffman takes on a small supporting role and overshadows everyone around him. From his first scene where he's yelling at his boss before breaking his window violently, Hoffman sucks. The only disappointing cast member is award-winning Hollywood star Julia Roberts. Hamming her way through yet another film, Roberts' overbearing and over-the-top portrait of a wealthy Texas oil woman hits all the wrong notes and is mostly annoying flat-out. At 97 minutes, the film is short and sweet, and that does not mean that it does not creep in at some points, but when it is dragged, it is for a very short period of time. <br /> <br /> In conclusion 'Charlie Wilson's War' is not a perfect movie, but certainly worth a look.
