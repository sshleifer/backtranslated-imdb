Anand is one of those low budget movies, but well done. It's a "cup of coffee" entertainment, no violence, no blood or "jumping out of your seat" excitement that most Telugu movies have. However, it has some masses of its own. Roopa is a stubborn young woman and foot on the floor who is not afraid to face any kind of situation, even her mother's dislike of offending her. She even leaves the wedding because her fianc√© does not defend her. However, her air of trust and independence is enough to make Anand, a rich young woman who lives in the city, wish to be her new husband. Your father accidentally kills his parents in a car accident anyway, so why not pay him back? But Roopa is not the type to fall in love with charming smiles and polite behavior, she puts him in a lot of situations, continuing to be rude and a pain. It's not until he stands up for her and saves her life that she understands that she loves him too. But complications follow ??
