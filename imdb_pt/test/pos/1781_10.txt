The Dekalog Five was an interesting viewing experience for me, because of the question that Kieslowski seems to ask the audience subtly. Three men are the focus of this chapter, and Kieslowski presents the two involved in murder with good and bad traits (in the case of someone, almost overwhelmingly bad). With these vile characters, I was almost glad they got some kind of punishment. However, when the time comes for murder (and it is a subsequent effect on the murderer), Kieslowski takes an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who shared my opinion: "Are not you as guilty as this man?" This kind of indirect public address makes the end of Dekalog Five much deeper, since Kieslowski (as usual) does not fall within the literal boundaries of his subject. Just as the other parts of the Dekalog do not accept the theme of his commandment literally, Dekalog Five does not. He asks us what is murder, who is guilty of murder, and what should be the appropriate punishment, if any? It is a fantastic film and, typical of Kieslowski, absolutely stunning.
