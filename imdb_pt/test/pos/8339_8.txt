This film, one of the first William Wellman, has an important message, particularly nowadays. He posits the notion that sometimes there are things more important than his own personal safety or well-being. The film, which has Walter Huston as the protagonist, is stolen by the performance of "Chic" Sales as Grampa. He is the most completely drawn character in the movie and a joy to watch. You will recognize some familiar faces if you watch many movies of the 20s and 30s. Well, it's time to watch if you get the chance. Recommended.
