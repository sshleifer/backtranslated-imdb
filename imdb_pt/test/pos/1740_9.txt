First, I've never been to Dr. Who until recently. Honestly, I've never had the opportunity to watch any of the previous incarnations (pun intended) since it was never "big" here in the US like anywhere else. <br /> <br /> That said, I must say (obviously) that after finishing Season 2, this is one of the best science fiction shows I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now, I watch a lot of science fiction shows every show stands out. <br /> <br /> The first season was top in the beginning, with Christopher Eccleston in the lead role and I thought he was great. Of course, just like the lovely Billie Piper, who adds so much humanity and warmth to Rose's character that no one could have done better. Let's not forget Camile Coduri as Jackie and Noel Clarke as Mickey / Ricky, who are just a blast to watch. Then there is David Tenannt. At first, I thought he was too clumsy to play the character (his ears !!), but after watching the second season, he fits in very well. His sharp acting and physical comedy is almost flawless. He is great with sulky dialogue and can be serious without flinching. <br /> <br /> In addition to the great performance of the cast is the performance of most of the guest actors who appeared. A lot of them are veteran actors, but some of them are new to me and they look great. <br /> <br /> The production and direction of the show is top notch. Occasionally, there will be some extravagant effects here and there, but this has always been a factor in the original series and, like these episodes, is insignificant. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing of all about the series: stories. Writing people, is always the key to great entertainment. Russell T. Davies wrote many episodes together with some other writers and they did an excellent job. They have managed to bring emotion, creativity, intelligence and fun with intelligent concepts and great dialogue. I also appreciate the fact that they can breach the plots and enemies of the past of the older doctors (my friend explains much of it to me while we watch the program) and respectfully. <br /> <br /> I will not mention anything about season two and how it ends, as the Sci-Fi channel began broadcasting the second season. <br /> <br /> I would not want to ruin everything. It's very fun and exciting. You will never want to look away or miss a word of dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's so good. <br /> <br /> PS: Thanks to the producers for Nicholas Briggs back! **EXTERMINATE!**
