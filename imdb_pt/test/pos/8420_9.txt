I got this movie in the DD while browsing through the channels ... And thank God, that too when it started ... Having studied in Pune, this movie provoked many happy memories of the city ... which in addition, we wonder why more movies like this is not done ... Every character is so well recorded - grandpa, boy, doctor ... except for the social worker who gives a grateful, the rest of the film hardly has a fault ... a merit entry to the Oscar, even if it has not been nominated ... definitely leaves a lump in the throat ... who do you think needs porridge to tickle your tear stains? And to think that this film needed Sachin Tendulkar to propagate it. Despite being in Marathi, there was hardly a time when I was not able to follow the film ... the subtitles were good .. A must watch for any good movie fan.
