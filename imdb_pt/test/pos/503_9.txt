For a brief moment. The opening scene with Traci Lords and the techno bar is incredible. I'll probably follow her until my final death too! Best vampire movie of all time, but with a twist. The fight scenes are incredible. Wesley Snipes displays an athletics that you can not see every day. And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very believable as a new ambitious recruit moving in the hierarchy by any means necessary. Great movie 9/10. Where's Blade II?
