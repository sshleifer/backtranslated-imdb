I can not beat the quality of the score, the book and the performances. This is the first production I've ever seen of Sweeney Todd so I do not have others to compare. But the impact is so strong, I just can not imagine anything better. <br /> <br /> First, there's the song - pick up "Johanna" (Act II), during which Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna sing an interlacing. vocal line incorporating the melodies of three songs. It's like a Bach choir in that sense - just a masterpiece of composition. And the structure and underlying voices are so perfect - a little melancholy, a little contentment, a little yearning, all expressing the views of these three singers. <br /> <br /> So - the letter. The rhymes are so clever. Rhyme schemes sometimes seem random, but they always add up at the end. (The DVD, which I watched, has Closed Captions, and these are indispensable for enjoying dialogue and lyrics.) Sondheim deserves a literary award for his poetry. <br /> <br /> Finally, the performances. I can not imagine anyone better than George Hearn. Why have not I heard of him before? His singing, alone, is masterful, but the scope of his acting is simply incredible. Angela Lansbury totally surprised me. The song about "you and me by the sea" - who could do better? His timing is flawless, the pitch is perfect, every punch hit counts; and overcoming this musical achievement is his utterly delightful comic book delivery. <br /> <br /> It's a dark tale, but I thought it was sweet at times; and the melody for "Johanna" continues to ring in my head.
