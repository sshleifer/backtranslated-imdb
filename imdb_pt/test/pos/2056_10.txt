I've seen this movie probably a dozen times since it was originally released in theaters. Anyone who calls this movie or horrible garbage can not understand action movies or recognizes a good movie. Perhaps for some the incidents and results may seem improbable, but in my opinion screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon / Bang Bang Bang Kiss) has created one of the best-thought action adventures you'll ever find. On top or not, this movie flows like clockwork and action keeps coming. The final action sequence is one of the best I've seen in any movie. The cast of this movie crackles. Genna Davis gave a tremendous performance and it is a shame that there was never a sequel "LKG". Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as his helper Mitch in his private eye trying to help her uncover her lost past and earn some change. If it confuses me like someone could not like this movie. It packs so many emotions and it's so funny. The jokes in this movie still make me laugh so hard 10 years later. In my mind, the first Matrix movie and the Long Kiss Goodnight were easily 2 of the best and most original action films of the 90s. In fact, Shane Black made a fortune when he sold this screenplay. At the time, it was the best selling script and was worth every penny. It's so sad that audiences never gave the film a chance because they would have witnessed the best Renny Harlins and Genna Davis movie like you've never seen it before. Long live the "Long Kiss Goodnight" !!
