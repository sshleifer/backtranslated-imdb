Mama did not date, it's as funny now as it was when it was released. A genuinely eccentric comedy that does not go to great lengths to be appreciated and is even better for her, full of memorable laughter aloud. Even small characters are well written and beautifully touched, such as Billy Crystal's best friend's girlfriend, and a lovely participation by Rob Reiner as Crystal's agent. A little insane and very funny.
