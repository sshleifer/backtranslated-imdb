This movie has some of the best dialogue ever written. The really good lines are all given to George C. Scott, a man who knew what to do with a juicy piece of dialogue. I just saw this movie again, for the first time in over 20 years, and the dialogue is as good as it was before. The bizarre events at the hospital are so imaginative that they leave you dazzled. They often involve poetic justice so wonderful that it is almost a stroke of genius. I love this movie!!
