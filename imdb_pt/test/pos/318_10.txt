I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985, when it was first broadcast on British television. I was shocked to see this masterpiece and, despite a fierce competition with the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, this film still remains my favorite for almost 20 years after I first saw it. <br /> <br /> This leads to the problem of how I can start commenting on the film. I could compliment the technical aspects, especially sound, editing and cinematography, but everyone seems to have praised (correctly too) these achievements to high heaven, while performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular were also noted, and all others mentioned the glaring image of the Dou Long bridge and the mount of the boat that travels upstream after passing through the border. <br /> <br /> What about the script? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as director but he is a brilliant screenwriter and director, I said "I was" in the past because making this movie seems to have burned all the creative brain cells in his head, but his sacrifice was worth it. In John Milius's original solo sketch, we have a script that is as insane and disturbing as the one on screen, but Coppola's involvement in the script has injected a narrative that mirrors exactly that of war. See how the script begins with everything and sexist with a star of Bill Kilgore that would not seem out of place in THE BEREN GREEN, but the more the story progresses, the more shocking and insane everything becomes, so much so that by when Time hits the post Kurtz, the audience watches another movie in the same way the characters navigated to another dimension. When Coppola states "This film is not about Vietnam - it's Vietnam," he's right. What began as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid-1960s, when the film was set (Manson's judgment suggests it is 1970) changed the US view of the world and the world view on America. It's the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes her a cinematic masterpiece and tells you more about the brutality of the conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians than you did in the Vietnam War, Mr. President? could expect to say in a lifetime. I did not see the REDUX version, but watching the original print, I did not feel there was something missing in the story, which like all really great movies is very basic. In fact, the premise can lend itself to many other genres as a Western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel leading an injun war party, or a science fiction film where a UN assassin kills a colleague of the UN. soldier who is leading a resistance movement on Mars, although this is probably Joseph Conrad's original novel of origin. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of all time and it is very fitting that I chose this film to be mine thousandth revision in IMDb
