This movie was hilarious. It provided a somewhat comical insight into the British club scene, which, if you really look at it, is a funny thing. The characters in this movie were so realistic for those of us who watch here in my house that it was like watching a movie about ourselves. <br /> <br /> There were some crucial scenes that really made this movie work: preparing scenes; the scene "give me a real doctor"; the white background scene showing each character in a state of total destruction, ending with the infamous line "what was I saying?" and the comedown-sunup scenes. I myself have lived through these moments and have seen myself laughing hysterically at my own ridiculous behavior. <br /> <br /> I can not give this movie a 10 because it is not up to Groove, which I thought was out of this world, but it certainly has its moments. The mise-en-scene and the camera work are excellent, the special effects are noteworthy, and the acting is fantastic. <br /> <br /> After waiting a long time to see this movie, I'm glad to say that I was not disappointed. I hope to see more of the writer / director in the future.
