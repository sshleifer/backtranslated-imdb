at least for me. and quite unexpected as a subject. a movie that makes you question your beliefs, your life, your approach to everything. which helps you see the world in you, we live through a lens - or a plethora of lenses ... an exciting, astounding and amazing film. <br /> <br /> And you benefit from one of the best performances ever Kevin Spacey. supported very well by Jeff Bridges. there is not a false note in this tango. It's a perfect dance. perfect to the end. <br /> <br /> What does the ending reveal? well ... everything you want ... <br /> <br /> a movie you'll want to see again. perhaps not immediately. maybe after a few days. months. years. but it is something to go - or go back.
