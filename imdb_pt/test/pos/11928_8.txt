I have not seen this for years but when I was about 6 I first saw this on VHS and I must have watched it at least 10 times. Now, as I said, it's been some time now for me to spoil the plot, but I remember some Colombian terrorists having a preparatory school hostage with requests that the terrorist father (the "master of desires") be released from prison. Now I could just check the plot here in IMDb, but I'm sure that's right. Anyway, a group of school kids decides that they will not just sit and wait to die, so they decide to fight back. this movie always stuck in my mind. There are so many pictures that I have not forgotten like the scene of Joey's death (or do I think?) Or bubbling into terrorist sandwiches or a child's false asthma attack (no idea of ​​his name). just a great movie. It may be that films like this have given me my tolerance for violence in the movies, because, as I recall, this film is very graphic. guys being hit by helicopter gunships, a special forces staff being ripped off by a grenade (I'm not sure about that, but I do remember something like this in the end) and the bloodiest being the leading terrorist getting stuck in the head in bloody details. great acting, great humor, good acting, wonderful cinematic experience. I have to watch it again after all these years!
