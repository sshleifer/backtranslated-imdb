An interesting comedy that will happen on a train from Stockholm to Berlin in December 1945. You can not feel sorry for the poor writer / critic who quits his job and jumps on the train to Berlin. His ambition is to make a difference and participate in the construction of a new unified Europe after the end of the war. <br /> <br /> I like the black and white format of the movie as well as the closed-film scenario. Train on the move. Robert Gustafsson does a classic "role of Gustafsson" in this film. If you are a fan of him, this movie is for you! The philosopher Wittgenstein, through his saying "one can never assume that anything is what it seems to be," is referred to several times in the film.
