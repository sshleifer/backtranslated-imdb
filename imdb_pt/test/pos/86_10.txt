This movie was anything but annoying. Deal with reality. For people who think this movie was boring, open your eyes to the real problems of our society. Our children are dying. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse should not be ignored. I work at a correctional institution as a chemical dependency counselor, and I deal with these problems every day. People of all ages and all social classes are affected by the consequences of alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys families, hurts people and leads to serious brain damage, all sorts of health problems and death. Everything is avoidable. This film should be screened at all colleges in the world. If someone owns this movie and wants to sell it, or sell me a copy, please email me at: Ottenbreit2@netzero.net thanks
