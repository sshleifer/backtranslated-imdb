This movie takes you from the opening scenes and never lets go. You watch indulgently at the excitement of Janos Szaby for coming to America. He's a nice guy. You can not help liking him even when his craving is replaced by bitterness as his fate changes. You know that under your circumstances, you would be forced to make the same choices that he makes to survive. This film comments on the worship of beauty and all the superficial things in society and is only truer in the culture of the 21st century. Janos himself becomes a victim of this philosophy when he tells his blind girlfriend "you are young and beautiful, if you could see, you would have the world." And like many modern gangster movies, when his security is threatened, he draws a powerful revenge. His innocence is not totally lost, for he demands an equally high price of himself, knowing that he deserves his fate. <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre is in good shape in this lead role. Only a few actors were able to convincingly realize the transformation of this character from innocent to bitter criminal in sixty-nine minutes. Lorre is well supported by the entire cast, making this a real picture of the ensemble and not just a vehicle for a star. With a little less dialogue, this movie would be a 10. Highly recommended.
