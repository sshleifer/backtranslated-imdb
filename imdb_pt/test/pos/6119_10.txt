The film John Waters gave us is one of the funniest movies of all time. Yes, it can be disgusting, but it is full of hysterical moments that no one has done since. The infamous dog scene has to be one of the highlights of the cinema. not a movie for the easily offended, is one of those movies where you always see something new. Divine performance is worth the reputation. Mink Stole is hysterical. This is the film responsible for the Farrely brothers and the entire Gross-out comedy genre. I know it sounds a bit extreme, but think about it. Before, these comedies were very much executed and almost identical. After this movie, the comedies became strange and strange, but in a good way. I'd give it 15 out of 10 if I could.
