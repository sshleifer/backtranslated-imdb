You have to think about the Last Tango lines in Paris for this one because the climate and the emotion follow the same lines and they maintain the same heights - the difference is that in this exceptional, intense and torrid representation of the love between the ruins of a disappointing one of Dostoyevsky , the setting is a gay-subcultural setting - perhaps even one that goes away in time, not the equally sweeping but heterosexual context of Bertolucci's own film. <br /> <br /> The last third of this film portrays a passionate love never seen in gay movies. Talking about pornography or gay self-annulment loses the point and intelligence of this work. This film, although on the first impression, seems to lead us to the familiar and often portrayed underworld of gay street life, then precedes subverting the rules of this genre by exaggerating it to a super-real degree. The result is an overloaded emotional boost - an exceptional strategy that elevates the drama to one of the great universal themes and giant gestures. <br /> <br /> This film snatches the high ground because of the brilliant performances of its actors, notably a young Jean Hugues Anglade and the direction. A tour-de-force of the cinema. Excellent in ambition and incessant plunge into the depths of human emotion. As a contribution to gay cinema, this film conquers this difficult terrain and makes it its own triumph.
