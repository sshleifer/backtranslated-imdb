In the year 2000 (remember, that's two years ago, not four), two men had the motivation to create the most miraculous work of art on this side of the Mississippi. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now enjoy Second String, a delightful TV movie that depicts a tale of second-string gangs (so the title) that are pushed into position to start due to an order of bad oysters. Because of the motivational direction of director Robert Lieberman and last-minute QB from Buffalo Bills, Dan "Give 'Em Hell" Heller (played by Canadian actor Gil Bellows) the Super Bowl snake Split accounts are in the final position. <br /> <br /> With an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict, a love story, a comraderie that only the good sport of football can bring, and a general theory that the oppressed can compete, Second String is a excellent film worthy of seeing every possible moment that appears on TNT. <br /> <br /> The only potentially bad thing about this production is the spelling of the first name of the costume designer, Jenifur Jarvis. <br /> <br />
