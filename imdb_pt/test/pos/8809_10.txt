If you've been "there" and "done it", you'll love this movie. I have and by "there" I mean underground clubs and parties at home, where there is much more rare to find people just being drunk than finding people loud to their ears in extacy, speed or LSD. By "this" I mean dancing and sweating like crazy for eight straight hours with a brake, and followed by a long way of not sleeping and almost wanting to die, followed by a week just waiting until the next weekend to do it all over again. <br /> <br /> So while this movie is now one of my absolute favorites, I can certainly understand why some people, or even most people, do not like it.
