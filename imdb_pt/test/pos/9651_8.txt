The reason I'm reviewing this is that the previous review was written by someone who left this movie, not even in the middle. Unfortunately for him, he missed a movie of tremendous beauty. Woke up the movie was too slow to start, actually the friend I was with fell asleep briefly, I woke him up before his snoring disturbed the rest of the audience. Fortunately, the film developed from there into a love story, drugs and what it was like to be young and free in the experimental 60's. Fantastic performances of the two protagonists and a great look at the film that gave it a real authentic feel. Be patient as many great movies are well worth waiting for, and it's certainly a movie that I'm looking forward to revisiting! 8/10
