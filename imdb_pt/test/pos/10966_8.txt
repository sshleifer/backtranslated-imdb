It ends with the statement that "the movie you just saw was an improvisation" - once making you feel like an idiot for thinking that an improvisation was a good movie, and surprised the genius of Cassavetes ... once again . Of course, Cassavetes told a guy who was not really an improvisation itself, on his deathbed, so ... it's the story about a light-skinned black woman, Lelia, who goes by white, and her family: another passage . A white brother named Ben and a black-black brother named Hughie. When she falls in love with a white idiot named Tony, he becomes unpleasantly surprised when he finds out she is black, and from there goes on the individual aspirations and shortcomings of the three main characters. Hughie is a jazz singer in the process of becoming a failure, Lelia is still desperately depressed about Tony, and Ben is distressed and violent in general in desperate need of something to shock him from his old patterns of existence. Overall, I suppose it's really about stasis versus change in human life. I suspect that Cassavetes has organized the plot enough, and it was only the dialogue that was improvised. The dialogue itself is very uneven - sometimes someone says something memorable, other times it is memorable. What is surprising is the extent of the impersonation of amateur actors in their characters. Cassavetes went through the acting class he was teaching the moment he decided to do Shadows, whispered in the ears of the top ten students, and this was the result ... the guys who play Ben and Hughie are very good. At first I did not like Lelia, but as the film progressed you see more and more she is one of those actors that gets better as tension and drama build - not necessarily the best with small talk. Shadows is acclaimed by many as the forerunner of the indie film movement (made in 1959) and is definitely recommended.
