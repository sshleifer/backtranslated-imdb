I waited for years to comment on this program, and felt it was time to do it justice. This is one of Christie's darkest, most sinister and engaging works, not simply someone being killed for money, this is a dark and engaging story of mystery, intrigue, love and murder, made even better by the seams made by the adapter. The level of acting is absolutely superb, Joan Hickson is sublime in the play, as always! The rest of the cast, including the likes of Liz Fraser, Anna Cropper and Helen Cherry all perform beautifully, but it is my opinion that the show is stolen by Margaret Tyzack, the final scene between her and Joan Hickson is simply magical, the acting is so good as possible, creepy, moving and totally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Please let me know if you agree with my words. I'm seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well Geraldine McEwan's version is. Watch and enjoy.
