I do not usually enjoy watching movies while they're still in theaters because of the high ticket prices, but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, "that young actress looks smart and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS ". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on its opening night. <br /> <br /> I must tell you, I was happy surprise. I went to this movie without expectations. I did not really know what it was, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland made me quite satisfied with my decision. Alberta Watson also did a fantastic job as the role of Tamara's mother and I should also add that I was quite impressed with Megan Park's comic style as Tamara's friend Brenda. <br /> <br /> The film was beautifully directed by Gail Harvey, and met in the 1950s kitschy style that makes you feel warm and happy, even if the plot is not so edifying. I also thought the film was well filmed, many beautiful images of a 50's landscape will remain in my mind in the coming weeks. <br /> <br /> This film as a whole was quirky and great. I found it unpredictable and, although the story ended in a slightly open way, I was still pleased. Whether you are looking for a fun but powerful maturing story, or simply want to reminisce about life in the 1950s, I guarantee that this movie is for you. Even if you do not have expectations, you're still likely to be very impressed. Give this one a shot!
