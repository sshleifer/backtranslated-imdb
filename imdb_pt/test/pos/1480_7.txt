All reviewers are making a big mistake. This movie should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It was made for children and teenagers from the late 80's or early 90's and as such was really a movie of its time. If you hated this period, or love the first movie that you can not even play with, then this is rubbish, but only because it was not meant for you. The low budget here and the failure of the Beastmaster 1 at the box office (raised with less than four thousand with a budget of nine thousand) were obviously the reasons to put aside the seriousness of the original and put it into the present day. You can complain about history, dialogue or logic, but again this was done to run, not to win races. If the movie had tried to take itself seriously, it would be a total failure, but that does not happen for a second (in "our" world, Dar sees a movie that is announcing The Beastmaster 2, enough). Paraphrasing Clint Eastwood from Dirty Harry movies: This movie knows it's limitations. It's more of a comedy / parody than a normal adventure. The soundtrack (for the season) was also great. The actors are not taking themselves so seriously, so even the generally annoying role of "spoiled rich pampered" (played here very well by young Kari Wuhrer) is good. <br /> <br /> So if you're nostalgic for the 80's / 90's (cheese) culture, or liked the first part, and do not mind quitting with a cheese, you'll have a lot of fun with this attempt to revive Giving in the 90's (literarily). This is not the continuation of the first, and do not see if this is what you want. It's more of a sequel to "what if". <br /> <br /> As for the question "why different size and not just different time": When in history do we have those winged humanoid creatures that suck the bone glow (from the end of part 1)? By the way, the movie ends at the zoo because of an attempt at a big cheap end (moneywise). It's supposed to be the best place to give show all your moves (he being the animal manipulator).
