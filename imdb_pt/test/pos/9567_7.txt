Well, in 2002 I got some things to do. And looking back on a dull year, the Best In Show shone. No big story. Little action. Just a ride of magnificent characters. Private reference to Fred Willard and Jim Piddock as a pair of TV commentators. Well done. It's worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Ron (24Mar2001)
