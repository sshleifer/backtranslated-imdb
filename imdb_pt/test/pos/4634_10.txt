If you're an "eighties kid" like me, you probably remember this 1981 Disney movie - one of Disney's first children's films and the Michael J. Fox movie premiere. I remember watching this movie several times on HBO when I was in high school, and only recently did I find a very old copy, since Disney stopped producing the movie several years ago. Needless to say, this is a real fun movie to watch. Five college teams decipher clues in a night race in Los Angeles, trying to get to the finish line first. Watch for Paul Reubens cameo. From the playful song to the disco scene with the fat twins, this is a quintessential 1980s fun movie that you will love.
