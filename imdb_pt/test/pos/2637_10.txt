This movie was very funny. People who expected to see a comedy worthy of the Oscars should be overcome. This was a fun movie to watch with interesting and interesting characters, plot lines, dialogue quotes and effect phrases. I rate a movie as 10 if I bought the DVD, or in this case the video tape, and watched it several times, and in this case still laughs loudly. I have about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half have nothing to do with the Oscar. Again, this was just a fun and joyful movie. I hope this goes out on DVD. I strongly suggest checking out this movie, if you're in the mood for a crazy comedy.
