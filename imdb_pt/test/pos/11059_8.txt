This short film certainly does not attract punches. The story is of a butcher who mistakenly kills an innocent man who he believes has sexually harassed his retarded daughter. The film shows how the butcher fulfills his time and returns to life with his daughter in his care, having to accept a life without a future. <br /> <br /> The opening scenes of a horse being shot down, and the full frontal birth of the butchers' daughter puts a brutal state of mind that stays with you throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The fast flow of the film is very direct and increases its brutality. Consequently, a lot of land is covered in the 40 minutes. You are totally taken with the butcher's non-life - particularly after he loses his daughter to social services and his business. His story continues in the excellent film Seoul Contre Tous
