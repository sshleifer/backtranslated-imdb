Lucius Fulci has made several great films throughout his career and the way so many of them have presented a lot of things has earned him the title of "Gore's Godfather". While Do not Torture the Duckling was done before Fulci became well known among the gorehounds, and it's not all so bloody; is certainly a brave little nasty thriller, and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made! Do not Torture the Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values ​​and unlike many of the later Fulci films, everything about this Giallo is great. The plot is concentrated in a small rustic community, where the corpses began to appear. The murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys. Soon after police condemn an ​​innocent man for the crimes, a reporter named Andrea Martelli arrives in the village and decides to start investigating the murders on his own. Martelli soon finds several suspects, including a sexy young woman named Patricia, a sinister priestess and a local witch who likes to make effigies of wax and nail pins into them. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not feature many details, it has two of Fulci's most unpleasant sequences to make up for it. The most disgusting thing involves a woman being brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a graveyard while the image of a man falling off a cliff and striking any amount of stones on the descent can turn some stomachs. Do not torture a duckling presents an absolutely excellent Italian cast. Barbara Bouchet (one of my favorites) is incredibly sexy in her role as Patricia, and is able to flex her acting muscles more than in many later films. Tomas Millian is excellent as usual, while the rest of the cast is well-nourished by the likes of Irene Pappas, Florinda Bolkan and Marc Porel. The cinematography on display is impressive and Fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts a lot of care and effort into every scene. The story unfolds slowly, and is always interesting, since Fulci never allows the film to deviate too far from the central plot. There is not much mystery about the killer's identity; but Fulci can almost keep us guessing until the end and Do not Torture the Duckling makes the climax on high. Overall, it's a shame that Fulci has not made any more films like this. Do not Torture Duckling is his best work and I urge all Giallo fans to see him!
