I felt sorry enough that this movie is not popular in Hong Kong. However, for all Chow fans, this will be a masterpiece that has not been left out. This is "Mo Lei Tou" (a comedy style based on the unrealistic and ridiculous storyline pioneer of Chow) in its heyday. The plot is absolutely absolutely ultimately 1000 times more ridiculous than any movie you can imagine. The dialog box is amazing. No part of the movie cools you to stop laughing. <br /> <br /> The plot seems simple but crazy for you to start laughing. It begins with Chow starring a junior magistrate (a corrupt, of course) imprisoned in helping an innocent married woman whom he loves at first sight to free her from a murder charge plotting for an evil minister whose son was really the true condemned Chow escaped from prison and fled as a refugee. He intends to go to the capital to see the emperor and report the condemnation. On his way, he manages to catch two lovely women, one circus, the other a prostitute, while in middle time mastering the supreme ability to fight and the bad mouth of the thin Mama-san (which happens to be his future in the law). Finally he managed to force the emperor to reopen the case by a black letter to the emperor, whom he found in the brothel. The Emperor made him a higher level judge to judge the case with the evil minister. He manages to arrange some bright but hilarious plots to force the convict to commit the crime, to execute him while he plays the evil minister in prison. <br /> <br /> The plots are really hilarious and ridiculously brilliant. Also do not forget the tremendous dialogue that includes a brilliant bad-mouth fight between Chow and Mama-san, a fight between the fat Mama-san and the lean Mama-san to inspire Chow to learn the ability to fight later and also fight between Chow and the evil eunuch Lee near the end. Also, some of the scenes are brilliant too. <br /> <br /> One thing we need to mention is that in order to really understand the movie and achieve 100% of all elements correctly, this will be a must for the master. Cantonese very well. Which may be the reason why the movie Chow of the early age receives the only moderate response from the Asian world. However, when Chow's film began spreading its influence around the world, hardcore fans like me discovered that his film is no longer as funny as the old days.
