I loved this movie, but again I'm a big fan of Cronenberg. If you have not seen a David Cronenberg movie then this is not a good place to start. Scanners, The Fly, Rabid would be a place to start and then work up to the Videodrome before checking this out. This is certainly one of their best and takes the phenomena of interactive play a step further. <br /> <br /> In this game, players connect a block of biological engineering game through a monkey inserted into their spinal cord and enter the game. directly through your nervous system. It is very difficult to tell more without revealing the story and the plot, but suffice it to say that this is a game you will not forget. He is full of slippery work on Cronenberg's body, gloomy avarage scenarios, all populated by a great cast including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law and Willem Dafoe, who take the situation very seriously. These people will do what they can to find out the game and then win. Like other movies of yours, there is no shortage of imagination or parts where you sink into the seat, but as an automobile accident you do not look away. If you liked any of the movies mentioned above then please go out and get this one.
