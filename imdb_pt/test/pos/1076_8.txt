A very interesting documentary - certainly much more than Sideways, a pseudo-drunken drama - where the capitalist conspiracy is revealed in all its greed. According to the documentary - and confirmed by the recent publication of a biography about Parker - only two men dictate the nature of the wines in the world: Robert Parker of Massachussets and Michel Rolland, a French wine industry expert from Bordeaux and also known as "flying winemaker". The director is smart enough to enter interviews with local winemakers from various regions of France, from Sicily to Argentina, and interviews with the major players in the industry, such as the Mondavi family, to discover the wrappings on the globalization of wine and marketing . A must see for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry. Drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial act after watching this well-made presentation.
