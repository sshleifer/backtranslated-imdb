The 80's is widely considered the decade when terror decided to have fun. Sometimes there were some brains set behind everything ("Evil Dead II", "Night of the Creeps" and "Return of the Living Dead", for example) and then there were those movies that were irrational but had a low rental charm set and were perfect for a night out with beer and friends. Movies like "Pieces" and "Blood Diner" piled rental shelves in the 1980s and 1990s, offering little intelligence or skill but lots of stupid fun. Kevin Tenney's "The Night of the Demons," 1988, is part of this stupid tradition, poorly represented and not an original bone in his body, but damn if you do not have fun. <br /> <br /> The plot is so simplistic that it just had to come from the 80s: a group of dumb teenagers played by a group of actors between 20 and 20 years decided to go to a party at Hull House, launched by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) and Suzanne (Legend of the Scream Queen Linnea Quigley.) Well, Angela and co. Decide to play a session. This ends up being Will Arnett's character "Arrested Development" that Gob would call "Huge Mistake", because a demonic force soon has Angela, and begins to reach out to others as well. Take The Evil Dead, The Nightmare on Elm Street and your dumb and dumb teen movie, throw them in the blender and Night of the Demons is what you get. The film is anything but original and, in fact, not a good movie. The whole thing is insanely derivative, the acting is terrible, the jokes often fall, the characters are annoying (especially the character of Stooge) and the plot holes are numerous. That's out of the way, it's still a lot of fun. Then why? <br /> <br /> Well, on the one hand, the effects of make up and gore are top notch, with some really memorable moments (especially a nasty and sober bug with a lipstick tube) that really stand out . Also rarely, if ever, does he take himself too seriously, but with the exception of some terrible puns, it is straightforward and never wastes public time with the wink of self-awareness. In addition, there is a definite energy and enthusiasm for the entire company that is almost impossible to resist. Yes, it's nothing special, but you know it, and could not be more proud of that fact. It's a silly party horror movie, and it never pretends to be anything more. <br /> <br /> It may not be a classic, but "Night of the Demons" is a good example of junk food from terror done right. It may not be very memorable or original, but sometimes you do not want a chic beer. Sometimes you want a Budweiser.
