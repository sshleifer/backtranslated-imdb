I did not expect much from this movie, it was just one of those movies that I thought I would just watch because it was on television. I certainly underestimated this movie. <br /> <br /> It's about a guy who kills his girlfriend and brags about his friends. I was very happy with the performance, they had the characters played well. It was a particularly good scene when Feck (Dennis Hopper) and John (Daniel Roebuck) are talking about why John killed Jamie. It's disturbing to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel control and that's why. But Feck loved the girl he killed. Feck felt remorse as John felt nothing, hell he was proud of what he had done. It really makes you think of people. Keanu Reeves did a great job as Matt, and Ione Skye was good. It's strange to see her as a speaker on 'Say Anything' and she's like Clarissa. Every actor did very well in acting. It was very good for a change. It was a great movie and I would say recommend it.
