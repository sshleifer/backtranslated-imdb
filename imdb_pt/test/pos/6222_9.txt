A wonderful film in the best magical tradition of the Scandinavians, with a very insightful analysis of many of the great issues we are just beginning to face. <br /> <br /> It should be a must-see for all politicians. <br /> Choice of your privacy, nuclear sustainability, global climate change, quality of life. <br /> <br /> Reminiscence of Walden of Thoreaus, but with a modern touch and a considerable humor. <br /> <br /> I'm not Finnish, although I've traveled there and have good Finnish friends, but found it totally accessible, and also culturally informative.
