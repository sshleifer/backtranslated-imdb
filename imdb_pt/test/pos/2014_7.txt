'Rock star' is not on the way to any category of 'stairway to heaven' as one of the best rock movies of all time, but makes you 'jump' once in a while because of your high-energy energy. The theme of the film is about a rock band fan who becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based on the true story of what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think this movie is full of a witty script and direction of intellect, then you have "something else coming". However, what "rocked me all night" was Jennifer Aniston's beautiful performance as the rock star's devoted girlfriend. I could not say the same about the rock star himself; Mark Wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star. I enjoyed the retrospective journey of the 80s with the movie entries. It reminded me of my adolescence, where everything "smelled like teen spirit." I think the movie is worth a show, but for you to have a better time watching make sure you bring some "girls, girls, girls". *** Average
