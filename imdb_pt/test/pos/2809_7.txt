The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very pretty. I like the movie. Can someone tell me how I can get hold of the songs in this movie? Even the soundtrack will work. If that is not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I've tried searching amazon.com but it's not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed Google for some details, but there were none. I would be grateful if anyone could give me the answer to my question. I know the songs belong to Country Music and are sung by a country artist. I just need the names of the titles along with the singer. I would recommend this movie or rather the songs to any loving person in the country.
