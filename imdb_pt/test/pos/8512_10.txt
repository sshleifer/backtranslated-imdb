People criticize the NSNA as it is a low on the career of Bond God Sean Connery and why it is not official. *** May contain SPOILERS * First of all, this movie is better than any other movie titles with any other actor then Connery, all aspiring sub par in my book. Sean Connery is the only true Bond, no one comes close to his toughness, good looks and sex appeal. Yes, this movie is a low point in Connery Bond's career, but it's still the best bonus movie of the '80s. Sean Connery is the only Bond actor who is good at a later age. he did not become a messy mess like Moore, but kept his good looks and stamina, but earning some gray hair. And? he's still the only real 007, and he's as cool and tough as ever. Sean Connery is the only 007. And this movie is definitely worth seeing, no matter what anyone says. No gun barrel opening, but you can not have it all, can you? great theme song, however.
