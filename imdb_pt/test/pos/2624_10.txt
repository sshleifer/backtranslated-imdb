This movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best TV movie mysteries I have ever seen. The acting is superb. I've seen this twice and I'm still confused in some parts. I would love to have a copy so I can play certain parts over and over again. I'm interested in buying a copy of this movie, but I can not find it anywhere. I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to find it? I've tried e-bay, Amazon.com, Internet searches and am completely frustrated. I did not see this in Turner Classic Movies or American Movie Classics and I even put flyers in our community asking if anyone has a copy.
