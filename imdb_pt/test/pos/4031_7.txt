This movie is not really a remake of the 1949 film O'Brien (which is excellent). He lends the main premise - a man was poisoned and spends the rest of the movie trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers have chosen an English teacher rather than a particular penis as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves fast enough to keep you awake. But what spoils this movie is a strange quality dated over it (probably due to the horrendous original 80's soundtrack) combined with an affected "noir" sensation. Dennis Quaid smiles inexplicably throughout the film at odd moments, but it's still alluring in a general way. Meg Ryan is well as student helper / love interest. When the movie gets a bit bad is when Dex (the teacher) knows the British bodyguard / driver and his duels are quite laughable. The bodyguard works for the rich widow (played by the lovely Charlotte Rampling), but these scenes are very "self-conscious" to help the film, although the familiar "plot" is quite interesting. Dex also continues appearing in the same place and finding this bodyguard, which is quite coincident. In the last part of the movie, a man is shot through a window and outside you see him jump out - that was a very bad direction. But in addition to some of these obvious shortcomings, I think it's still valid. I certainly did not foresee the ending, so that was good - there's a twist, and although some posters here think they were cheated, I thought it was a good, believable ending. Dennis Quaid, with his strange smiles and black eyes, is more sympathetic in The Right Stuff, Great Balls of Fire, Inner Space and Cold Creek Manor. But here like Dex, he should be an idiot, so he did well. Pretty decent movie.
