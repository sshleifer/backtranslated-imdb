I first saw this movie in the theater. I was 10 years old. I watched it for the second time and I must say it was amazing. The music, the dance, the acting. It's a great story and very well told. I fell totally in love with Treat Williams when I was a kid after seeing him in that movie. One of my favorite parts was when his mother kept screaming at him to give him his pants, and then finally said "how much do you need"? (money). That was classic. ; ). <br /> <br /> Moms are the best. If you have not seen this movie since it came out, say to see it again. It is timeless. He will do what all great movies do; Make you laugh, cry and think.
