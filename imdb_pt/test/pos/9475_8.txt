This is the first James Cagney movie I've ever seen. I've never been interested in your movies before because I figured I would not like anything in this movie style and because I've heard that most of Cagney's movies are the same. I have to say that I really liked it. By today's standards for movies, it was not special, but I found it surprisingly entertaining. Cagney did not look like a tough guy, but he played the role very well.
