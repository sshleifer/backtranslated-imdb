I do not know if it's fair for me to review this. I'm not a fan of gratuitous violence. I've never understood the film industry making heroes of Mafia members and cold-blooded killers. When The Godfather left, I thought they had broken the mold, but the decades have produced a number of well-meaning mafia films with big stars and directors doing them. This is obviously low budget, but it certainly is well done. At some point in all this, I feel like taking a shower. If such characters really exist, it is difficult for the soul. I always intellect that humanity will rise above this kind of thing. This kind of garbage needs to be stopped. I hope people who go to movies like this are more voyeuristic and less vicarious. I feel the same way about horror movies. Why do we have a fascination with death and dismemberment? To be fair, I am judging this by acting and direction, and for what it is, it seems to work very well.
