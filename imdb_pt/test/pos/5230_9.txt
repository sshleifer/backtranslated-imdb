The best photo I've ever seen? Considering the year the film was made, I was absolutely struck by the amount of attention devoted to the scenes and what seems to be authenticity. Although I'm not particularly a western movie fan, every scene is given to the utmost detail, and it is astounding. There is a sincere connection with nature. Sometimes I am impressed by the amount of action that goes through the scenes, but I never get bored. I feel like I'm really looking at a time machine and looking at the old west. I recommend this movie to anyone who is studying set design, rental planning, and photography in general. It can be a humiliating film to experience visually considering this era of digital retouching we are now experiencing.
