In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hires horse dealers Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to the San Juan River. Along the journey, they first encounter the waterless broken wagon of charlatan Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic Clegg thugs decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol led by the sheriff of Crystal City who pursues them. When the Navajos cross their path, they are invited to visit their village for a dance party. When the wagon is near its destination, Clegg's boys threaten the settlers, forcing Sandy and Travis to take action. <br /> <br /> "Wagon Master" is another great western of John Ford. The sequences with the wagon traversing the desert and the hills are impressive. The Mormons' group adventure is fun and fun, and the songs fit well into the plot, though they are dated. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Caravana dos Bravos" ("Caravana dos Braves")
