Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August, a single mother who is the functional definition of the word "dreamer" and her solemn and pragmatic daughter. Adele, wanting to make a fresh start in a big city, moves them from Wisconsin to California. <br /> <br /> Decent, if not exceptional or particularly memorable, with some serious and sad moments. He squeezes some emotional buttons for sure. The best thing he offers is a solid cast, and Sarandon and Portman are very good at leads - even if their characters are one-dimensional at times. <br /> <br /> Could be better, could be worse. <BR> I gave this seven out of ten.
