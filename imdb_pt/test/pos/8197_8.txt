This three-hour Chinese epic, set in 220 BC, can sum up a familiar theme of the emperor's idealistic dream of peace through unification turning into corrupt isolation, and there is nothing inherently challenging about the film, but it is a narrative convincing, full of intrigue and passion and betrayal and epic events told in vivid traits. Even for those who are not attracted to such historical spectacles by themselves, it is an amazing feast for the eyes: the scene depicting the Marquis's attempted coup is one of the most astonishing evocations of physical space and greatness in memory, and the scenes of battle. are both memorable in scope and immediacy. The title sums up the use of compelling contrasts of the film - huge vistas of the plain against intimate horrors; the noblest of motives against the most degraded; I hope I turn to dust. If you've never seen a three-hour Chinese epic, this would not be a bad place to start.
