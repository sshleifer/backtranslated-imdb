It resembles both films like PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS, that it is impossible to think that Tarantino's films were not a source of inspiration for this Thursday. However, for a low-cost B-series film, it's not bad. The plot about gangsters is captivating and funny and also has a bit of black humor and sarcasm that we can find in PULP FICTION. The features were not many right, but the film is well produced. The acting is also good. I liked the scene when the girl was sitting on the couch teasing the doctor ... It was hot and funny at the same time! The soundtrack is also cool. I did not hear many songs, but the ones I heard liked them. I scored 7/10.
