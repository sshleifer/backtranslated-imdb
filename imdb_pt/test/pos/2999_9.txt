I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was beautiful in this film when she played the role of Harry's girlfriend (Mike Wagner). Harry, a lucky thief trying to make one more assault. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a walk. When things go wrong, they gather mines to find the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica, from there in the crowd. Rest assured that no matter what the gang goes after, the outcome is never the same and will keep you on the verge of your place. The rest of the way out comes you need to watch by yourself. As far as Rachel goes if you're a fan of this, then you need to watch this movie because she never looked better standing on the beach with an orgasm. I give this 10-star ferret movie to Raquel Welch's body alone. No wonder why she was the hottest actress in the '60s. She was the sex symbol everyone wanted and no one could. Not only does she look good, she can act even better. If you like, Raquel Welch then you will like this movie
