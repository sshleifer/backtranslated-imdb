This is just my favorite movie of all time. Nothing special. It is so incredibly detailed. It makes me cry just thinking about it. Geronimo Bill is the coolest guy I can imagine. Money is not important. Bamboo lances are important. You do not need the money to get what you need. If you need something, it will only come to you. If people realized that the world would be a much better place. Whatever you do, do not do it for the money.
