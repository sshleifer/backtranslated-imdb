If it's not the best movie of all time, "Babette's Feast" is certainly one of the most loving. This is a wonderful exploration of the meaning of art, generosity, loyalty and grace. Humor is mixed with caring desire; the characters are treated with honesty, but also deep respect. There are meditations here in memory, destiny, old age and fidelity. Wonderful camera work by director of photography Henning Kristiansen: rarely did the wrinkled faces look so luminous by candlelight. The meal is accompanied by delicious vintage music, Brahms, Mozart and simple folk hymns. Enjoy this feast for the eyes and for the spirit, for, as the General says: "Mercy and truth have met, and righteousness and bliss will kiss."
