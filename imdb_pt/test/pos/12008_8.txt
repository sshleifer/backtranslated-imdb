What I can say about this film besides the narrative is one of the most exciting in film history ... and based on a true story! Being old enough to remember the Berlin Wall when it was still used to contain a country, this film gives a bleak view of the incarceration of East Berliners, and their desperate attempts to escape, no matter the cost. The film follows the lives of two families, who decide to escape using a hot air balloon made by themselves. Always fearing the arrest of the authorities, under scrutiny of the neighbors, they have to calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall. A tense and exciting story of courage and determination that truly pays homage to all those who succeeded and failed the treacherous journey to West Berlin and freedom.
