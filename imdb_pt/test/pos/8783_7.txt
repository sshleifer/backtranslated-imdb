Writers Peter Viertel, Joan Harrison and Dorothy Parker (of all people) allow director Alfred Hitchcock to explain what may have been his favorite movie theme: an innocent man mistakenly charged with a crime takes him on the run. Hitchcock, who has some credence in originating the story, projects a great deal of suspense in the plot over an employee of a warehouse blamed for the blast that killed his best friend; he goes on a journey to find the real culprit. Lots of excitement on a grand scale, with usually colorless actors (Priscilla Lane, Norman Lloyd, Alan Baxter) doing a surprisingly good job. Even eternally presumptuous Robert Cummings enters the proper spirit! *** in ****
