One of the best made for TV biopics, I just wish they had told us more. I read many biographies and saw other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the restrictions imposed by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was no more perception about Karen's anorexia. In my reading of the disease (especially the wonderful book by Cherry Boone O'Neill, Starving for Attention), anorexia seems to be a controlling disease. Karen saw her weight as something in her life that she could control. She felt that she was being controlled in every other aspect of her life. Do not get me wrong, I believed she really did love the song, but she felt she had little control over her career. She really loved her family, but they did not express well, and she did not know how to get her family to understand her. The film could have touched a lot more on that. I value the music I have from the Carpenters and wish she was still alive to contribute more to the music today.
