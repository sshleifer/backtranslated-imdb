As long as you do not mind paying a little more attention than you normally would in other movies, this is one of the best "thrillers" you'll see. The film depicts an incident that may occur in real life; nothing seems fictional, actually. It also portrays how people can react in real life. <br /> <br /> In fact, it portrays this so well that it looks like real life. Combine this with the lack of soundtrack and you almost got the best news movie you ever saw. Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are particularly good at this late 1970s masterpiece, evoking concern at its end and genuine tragic grief at its end. I recommend it to anyone who likes thrillers.
