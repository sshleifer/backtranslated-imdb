Oh my God!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's so amazing ...... I loved it as a little baby and still love it as an adult. It's my favorite Disney movie allllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch, watch and love. My friends and I watch a ton ..... It's soooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart. My favorite part is the song and dance number with all the mutts and Thomas O'Malley. The writers / producers / director completely nailed this one ... yes, they nailed the wall. xoxo ~ Wolly ~ xoxo
