This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is truly unique. Equal parts of pornography, fairy tale and musical comedy - this movie is definitely a weird story of adult movies. <br /> <br /> Alice is a sexually naive librarian who ends up following the rabbit into "Wonderland." , where she meets all kinds of "experienced" weirdos like the Mad-Hatter (who likes to pull her pussy out whenever possible), Humpty Dumpty (who broke her sausage along with her ladle), Tweedledee and Tweedledum. > <br /> This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is actually quite harmless to the standards of the time - a time when lots of pornography was petty. witty and unpleasant (as noted by the sub-genre "roughie") - this is actually very funny and strangely captivating. It's the kind of thing you'd show your kids-if it were not for the sex of the sexes. A bit slow to get to "good-stuff" ... but really fun. Ah - and some of the musical numbers are downright hilarious. If you are a drinker - have some, if you are a smoker - roll a pair and give this a shot. 8/10
