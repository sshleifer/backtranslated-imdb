I grew up in New York and this show came when I was four years old. I had a half-day kindergarten and was on channel 11 of the WPIX in the afternoon. I loved the music and the stories and I remember humming them around the house while playing. <br /> <br /> I just saw part of an episode on YouTube and for a moment I remembered what it was like to watch these shows as a little kid. I, of course, stopped watching when I got to 1st grade because I was connected before school came out (no VCR or DVR at the time). I grew up not realizing that the show was still in 11th grade! <br /> <br /> I also had no idea that there are DVDs and I would like my nephews and nieces to be young enough to enjoy this show, but now they are all from the past, or I would buy all of them DVD sets. That was a lot better than many children's shows today.
