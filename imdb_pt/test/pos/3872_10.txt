by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who stars as Reggie, fights against the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded bandit recently released from prison, helps Reggie find out who murdered his father. One week after his father's death, a preacher, Reverend Packer, appeared dead. Reggie should be the one to kill him, but did he? Reggie killed Reverend Packer or was it some kind of setup? Back in the day there are also some romantic scenes. See, Reggie falls in love with the shepherd's daughter and J-Bone does not approve of her demon love. As J-Bone tries to destroy what they have, Reggie discovers that love is about forgiveness. But what the j-bone is doing, does it work? Does Reggie and his girlfriend end or does this bring them closer? I like this movie because it leaves you wondering what is going to happen next and made it or that happen. I like suspense movies! It kind of makes you want to be in the movie so you can spot things. I also like this movie because everything fits, if you really pay attention to it!
