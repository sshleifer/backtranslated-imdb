I'm new to gaming, but I would have started a lot earlier if this movie were out there! I picked it up at Gen Con last year (a trip done just as a favor to my husband) and I LOVED it! Even for a non-player like I was at the time, it's funny and approachable - so much so that I finally gave in and started participating in my husband's gaming group. <br /> <br /> I do not want to provide plot details, but if you're a gamer, you NEED to see this movie - and if it is not, you're going to have a lot of fun, though. There are certainly "in" jokes, but the vast majority of the movie is accessible to anyone. <br /> <br /> My only complaints: I wish they were longer and that they were available on DVD. So maybe?
