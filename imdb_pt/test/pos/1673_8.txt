This film is a pure class work from start to finish, for a moment forget the famous 28 minutes without dialogues, forget what is happening in Paris and forget about the Noir. The film itself, the premise and the execution make it a pure gold experience. He is sharp and intelligent in detail, as is his own assault. It portrays real characters that are not only believable, but with whom you have empathy. It's a movie that does not glamorize the notion of a robbery, but it shows what it is ... theft. This shows that a robbery is hard work and ultimately not worth doing. Now all things considered put on that a bold 28-minute sequence without a word spoken and set in wonderful Paris with a great attention to detail and a fantastic cinematography and that last scene ... when you look up and see those trees . wonderful use of raw and basic filming techniques ... it is a work of art to my credit and I am glad to have seen it.
