I giggled for an hour. I had no idea who Dan Finneity was. Why have not I heard of Dan Finnerty before? He is hysterical and his singers support him as well. They make all these songs of women who would never want to hear a new experience. They blow those songs. That was Bravo last night. Why is not this Dan guy "ultra famous"? Great voice! Charisma to burn! He surprised me with this show! I just read on the internet that he was already a member of "Stomp" I think there is nothing he can not do. I saw "Stomp" in a UCLA theater years ago and these guys were amazing. This show last night was made by Dreamworks! Does that mean Spielberg did it? Why do not they star in Dan Finnerty in a movie? There was a standing ovation at the end of this show and every time the camera cut to the audience, everyone was so wrapped up, singing along or dancing. The whole show had this incredible energy. My only complaint was that it was not longer, but looking back, when you see how much energy these guys put out, I think it would be impossible for any human to run with so much taste for over an hour. Dude I loved this show!
