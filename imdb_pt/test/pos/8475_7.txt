In recent years, there have been a number of biographies of famous singers, and "Ray," the story of Ray Charles, has a lot in common with "Walk the Line," which was made the following year and told the story of Johnny Cash. Cash and Charles were almost accurate contemporaries, both born in the early 1930s and dying in 2003/04. Both grew up in poverty in the American deep south. Both lost a brother in an accident during childhood. Both reached success in the 50's. Both experienced problems in their marriages, and both were addicted to drugs. All of these subjects are emphasized in both films. There are also similarities to Ron Howard's "A Beautiful Mind." Although the film was about a mathematician and not a musician, he, like "Ray" and "Walk the Line," highlighted the role played by his participant's wife in helping her husband overcome his problems. Ray Charles was born to a single mother in a poor black community in Georgia in 1930. (His original name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but when he began his career as a musician, he left his surname to avoid confusion with the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson). In a way, Charles had an even harder time than Cash, having to deal with two further disadvantages in the form of his blindness and racism that affected all black Americans, especially in the South, during his lifetime. Charles had a particularly traumatic childhood, witnessing the death of his younger brother George in a drowning accident and going blind about a year or two later. He seems to have been haunted by nightmares and feelings of guilt over George's death throughout his life. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is rather slow and it is a biopic of showbiz standard the story of how the young Charles is taught to play the piano, becomes a nightclub performer and then gains fame as a leading artist , falling in love with the beautiful Della Bea. The best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks of Charles's childhood. There is a recurring and effective picture of colorful glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of your house; maybe this was one of his few visual memories of his life before he went blind. There is also a memorable scene in which the adolescent Charles embarrasses a biased bus driver to drop him off on the bus, pretending to have lost sight of Omaha Beach (in fact, he would have been only thirteen at the time of landings in Normandy). <br /> <br /> The second half of the film becomes more interesting as it moves into more controversial territory, focusing on Charles's drug addiction, problems in his marriage caused by his affair with Margie Hendricks , one of his supporting singers, and his battles against racism. In the early sixties, Charles made a stir by refusing to play in front of a racially segregated audience in Georgia (although, contrary to what is said in the film, this did not result in his banning from performing in the state). He also fought against racial divisions within the music industry, performing not only traditionally "black" styles of music such as gospel and rhythm and blues, but also traditionally "whites" such as country and western (considered by many black Americans as Peter Bradshaw, a film critic for The Guardian, noted that "Ray" is a sunny film that diplomatically moves away from the darker side of things. It omits any mention of such things as the death of Charles's beloved mother, Aretha, during his adolescence, his brief marriage to Eileen Williams in the early 1950s, and his eventual divorce from Della Bea in 1977. He also minimized the extent of his womanizer and womanizer, the number of his illegitimate children.There are similarities here with "A Brilliant Mind," who also omitted a number of controversial details about the subject's personal life, including a divorce. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fans of Ray Charles will no doubt appreciate It's not the movie for the song, but it's worth watching even for those who do not know much about it, mainly because of Jamie Foxx's Oscar-winning performance in the title role, reproducing Charles's mannerisms so exactly that we think we are watching a blind man, although Foxx is sighted. (Unlike Joaquin Phoenix in "Walk the Line," however, Foxx did not make his own singing - undoubtedly Charles's distinct voice was very difficult to reproduce). He gets good support from some of the other artists, particularly Sharon Warren as Aretha and Kerry Washington as Della Bea. The film is uneven and long, but nevertheless rewarding. 7/10
