An unfairly overlooked classic, "Intruder in the Dust" is one of the great movies of the 1940s that unfortunately fell into obscurity. Based on a story by William Faulker and filmed in his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, "Intruder" tells the story of Lucas Beauchamp (played with great dignity by Juano Hernandez), a Negro unjustly accused of the murder of a local white man and a a white boy (Claude Jarman, Jr.) who uses this as an opportunity to repay a debt owed to Beauchamp. A great performance, especially by two great actors, Porter Hall (as the father of the deceased) and Elizabeth Patterson (better known as Mrs. Trumbull in "I Love Lucy") as an old woman willing to confront the people of the city to see what it is certain is done. This direct, tense and sincere study of racial fanaticism deserves to be seen more.
