Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine are a joy to watch in this crazy comedy. Alec Baldwin, who was a rising star when the movie was made, is a joke. Dean Stockwell, in a confrontation of John Gotti, is hysterical. But Mercedes Ruehl, like the paranoid and exaggerated Connie, steals the film. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme, formerly known for eccentric comedies as "Something Wild" and "Melvin and Howard", adds another genius. I was not surprised when he won the Oscar for directing "Silence of the Lambs". The performances he evokes from his actors in "Married" are inspired, and the audience is taken to a wild and woolly ride. <br /> <br /> One of the cutest, cuddly movies of the '80s is head and shoulders above many of the satires of his day.
