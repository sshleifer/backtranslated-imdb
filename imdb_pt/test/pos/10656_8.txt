There are only a handful of movies that have been made on such a large scale and have made such a difference in the art of making movies. "Bronenosets Potyomkin" is one of those films, and should be on the list of anyone who wants to learn more about the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Grigori Aleksandrov and Sergei M. Eisenstein directed this groundbreaking film documenting the horrors of a Russian warship. When the sailors finally retaliate against their superiors, the locals embrace and support them. Things get ugly when a group of soldiers is sent to the small town to take care of business. What follows is one of the most imitated scenes in movie history. Anyone who has seen "The Untouchables" and "Bronenosets Potyomkin" knows exactly what I mean. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that this movie raised the level of cinema, as did "Intolerance" a few years earlier. If you do not mind dumb movies, do yourself a favor and see "Bronenosets Potyomkin". <br /> <br /> If you do not like silent movies ..... watch "Potyomkin Bronenosets" anyway. <br /> <br />
