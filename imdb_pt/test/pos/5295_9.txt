It has been widely accepted that Hayao Miyazaki is a master at his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful story lines and similarly imaginative characters. His films, from NAUSICAA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA and MONONOKE to the recent HOWL MOVEMENT CASTLE, are not only beautifully portrayed in terms of art, but also in terms of film production. Can not this man make a mistake? Not true, but it's impossible to expect all your movies to always be five-star wonders. His latest film, PONYO, a shamelessly familiar tale of a "goldfish out of water", is as exuberantly lively and alive with interesting characters as you would expect ... and yet it's his first movie that stomps on "smaller" territory. Do not get me wrong, PONYO is not a bad movie at all. As mentioned, it is a sight for the eyes and is as lovely and lovely as TOTORO and KIKI. The problem is that the story does not surface to satisfy anyone eager for another captivating and profound plot. For its opening hour, PONYO is the narrative of Miyazaki at its best, The exuberant goldfish (which will later become Ponyo) makes a trip forbidden to the human world, where it is subsequently adopted by a boy of the same age named Sosuke (modeled, curiously, according to the director's own son). This did not please Ponyo's father, a mysterious wizard named Fujimoto, who is very angry with humans for his destruction of the sea (this environmentalist theme is not much different from the other Miyazaki movies) ... a problem he intends to rectify. creating jellyfish from the bow of his submarine. He separates the pair and tries to convince Ponyo to stay underwater with him. The goldfish, however, has already tasted both Sosuke's blood (curing a finger cut) and a bit of human food (ham, from which it becomes inexplicably addicted) and, of course, steals his father's forbidden potions, transforming hyperactive. young girl (who is Mei's spit image of MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO). This triggers a dangerous tsunami that threatens to swallow the entire world with water. Conspiring with his wife, Gran Mamare, a diaphanous sea goddess who alternately switches from a super titan to a human-sized form, Fujimoto decides to test the love of the two young men for each other. They do this by raising the sea to the level of Sosuke's house, prompting youngsters to cross their ocean-infested world into a large toy (made possible by Ponyo's own magical powers). <br /> <br /> It is at this time that the PONYO starts to run out of steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are adorable and the scenes surrounding them are funny and cute, they slow the movie down. Where the film actually takes water, unfortunately, is at the climax in which Sosuke must prove his love for Ponyo, presented in a way that is strangely anticlimactic and rushed, leading to a charming story to an abrupt halt. This will likely fail to impress viewers who expect another instant masterpiece from the man who presented far more interesting endings to many of his other films. Remember the destruction of Laputa? The search for Satsuki by little Mei? The rescue of Kiki from Tombo? The fight of Porco Rosso with Curtis? The rescue of the head of the Spirit of the Forest? Or even the test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All these resolutions were much more satisfying and felt more complete than this. <br /> <br /> At a technical level, PONYO can not be criticized. The animation is absolutely dazzling to see, produced entirely without a single take of computer generated images and, of course, Joe Hisaishi offers us yet another breathtaking musical track; the best moments are the thrilling sequences underwater, accompanied by a chorus and a soprano voice. And the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed like any other Ghibli movie. <br /> <br /> Having proved themselves worthy of translating and dubbing earlier Ghibli films in English with high quality results, Disney Studios and Pixar once again provide an English. dub complete with a cast of more capable actors. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good as Sosuke, sounding very natural and believable throughout. Noah Cyrus as Ponyo, on the other hand, sometimes goes to the sea shouting his lines before finally settling down at the end. Leading aside, the rest of the cast includes Liam Neeson as overprotective Fujimoto (who manages surprisingly well in character), Cate Blanchett as Gran Mamare (in a ubiquitous tone that is not very different from his Galadriel in LORD OF THE RINGS) Matt Damon as the constantly navigating father of Sosuke, Koichi (who is good, but nothing to write) and Tina Fey as Lisa. Of them, Fey is the best voice of the whole cast, imbuing the character with the right amount of spirit and personality. His scenes with Sosuke show real chemistry. On the other hand, Cloris Leachman, who was spectacular as Dola in CASTLE IN THE SKY, is disappointed as one of the three elderly women with disabilities (she almost DOES NOT have ANY queues!), Who are also dubbed by Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Of them, only the character of Tomlin, a grumpy woman named Toki, shows any real personality, but if I were casting the movie, I would trade Tomlin for Leachman. Probably the only really shocking drawback of dub is a techno blas√© remix of the captivating (but ridiculously repetitive) movie title, which fortunately does not occur until half of the final credits. <br /> <br /> all, PONYO is a good movie; a beautiful work of animation that is perfect for young people and the family audience. Due to the loss of momentum in the end, however, it falls far short of the classic status. As Miyazaki, at least, is still better than most other animated films, I will be generous and give a full recommendation to PONYO, because any feature of it is still worth watching, particularly on the big screen. (Make sure you get it in theaters for as long as you can.)
