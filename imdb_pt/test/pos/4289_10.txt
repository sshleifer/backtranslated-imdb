Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime despite treachery on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is not a brutal Othello in the setting of modern England. Then, gradually, a web of deception begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of "separate lies" begins to fail and then holds together again. And life (and death) continues, despite the brilliant flame of her husband's love and the deep despair and guilt interspersed in so many lives. How many webs of deception should be displayed in this growing tapestry? The thrust is to sustain excellent reputations, careers and relationships in this most civilized corner of the world. Wilkinson gives an emotional performance, full of grace, discretion and decorum, and still humanity, of those who have much to hide. Those who desire clarity and openness in the path of righteousness will be disappointed by the evil of so much deceit. And yet, who among us does not have something like that to hide over their loved ones? However, the viewer may wonder if this web is doomed to fall apart someday.
