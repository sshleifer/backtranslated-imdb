Gary Cooper (Michael Brandon) played the role of an American millionaire who had seven bad marriages but always divorced his wife with lots of money to live on. Michael is in Paris on business and enters a French department store to buy a pair of pajama tops and sellers refuse to sell only the tops, he has to buy the funds or there is no sale. Nicole DeLoiselle, (Claudette Colbert) hears this conversation and offers to buy the underside of these pajamas. Michael becomes very interested in Nicole and they have the opportunity to meet and go on dates. It does not take long for Michael to propose marriage to Nicole and she is very taken back with her request for marriage, since she does not really know him very well. However, once she discovers that she will become Michael's Eighth wife, she begins to change her mind and this story becomes quite funny and funny. Do not miss this movie, it's great entertainment by great veteran actors. Appreciate.
