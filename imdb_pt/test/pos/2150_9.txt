This small, hard-to-see picture played at the 2007 Mods & Rockers festival. It's a wonderful, loving look at Harry Nilsson, wearing many famous faces that sit for interviews, rarely watched TV presentations and scenes behind Nilsson at work. There are even some pictures of "Son Of Dracula". This film is the final tribute and suitable for one of the best voices, the most intelligent composer and the funniest man of popular music. It is a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and / or performed. His friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented hulk with a subconscious desire for self-destruction. As a bonus, you even get Eric Idle playing the song with the end of Nilsson's album during the final credits. It's funny, it's sad. It's not in the general release. If this image touches anywhere near where you live, see!
