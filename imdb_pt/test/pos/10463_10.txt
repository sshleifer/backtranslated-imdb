Sometimes it is difficult to watch movies with subtitles (in this case, Danish), but the observation is worth it. As the story progresses, the reasoning for choosing two sisters to care for their father is questionable, but their society is different. Their choice leaves them alone until a French woman comes. There may be a question about why the French woman came to her place to stay and this is never fully developed. The party that happens later, as a result of unexpected funds from France, is an unusual source of pleasure for all who attend and something they have not experienced before. It provides a fitting thanks for the kindness given to the guest. Filmed with a somber aura and the display of poverty, it is a beautiful experience for the viewer.
