I just want to comment to the woman above, that the movie credits Beethoven to beg. In the opening credits they show this. Thank you. I think this is an amazing movie. They chose the right song for the mood of the movie, the animation is wonderful and they chose the voices of the characters very well. It teaches children to never give up and to always have hope. Princess Annika does not give up and shows the children that they can do the same. The film also has humor in for all ages, parents and kids, to laugh at. The colors in this movie are great, and kids can feel good while watching. I watched this movie for the first time, now I'm a big fan, and I'm sure your son will be too. Walmart sells tons of things from Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus, so your child can continue to enjoy the movie even when they're not watching. Thank you!
