As you may know, Norway is the most developed country in the world (in relation to the HDI, Human Development Index). This film cunningly reveals our future to us. Our future would be that of Norway, since we are paddling to achieve the best and offer the least. The life that was shown was perhaps an exaggeration, although comparing the concerns of today with those of our ancestors, is not a far-away reasoning of the reality. Watching this movie free of all our pre-assumptions, we can find our two faces; the one who's laughing at the bright scene of Andreas pouring his girlfriend and the one who's been looking in hour-and-hour magazines to pick a dumb chair among stupid collections. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the hole with the hope of lightness was another magnificent idea of ​​the film. The slight glory; but the only one, and the effort that was made to reach it makes us feel closer to Andreas. <br /> <br /> Although I was drawn mainly to the idea and production of the film, the Trond Fausa Aurvaag played very well and the atmosphere of the film was quite palpable.
