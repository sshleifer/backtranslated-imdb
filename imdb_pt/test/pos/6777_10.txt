Many Americans are lazy, and this has even manifested itself in our watching DVD. Many of us do not like reading an hour and a half (or more) of subtitles, so we chose not to see many foreign films. A movie that TOTALLY is worth your time, no matter how mundane a task you may think the caption reading is, however, is "The Green Butchers." It's by far the best foreign film I've ever seen, and it's the top of many American movies I've seen lately as well. It's a complex situation told in an incredibly simple and funny dialogue. The character depth derived in this movie is AMAZING. The way Svend and Eigel (sorry if those are spelled wrong) feed on the contrasting personas of each other is downright spectacular! The actors were well-formed, and I'm very hopeful that a sequel is in consideration ... she needs very little of Bjorne and what is her face ... just give me Svend and Eigel on some kind of journey with characters of support and more incredible dialogue! For the author of this beautiful script, I say: Write more! The story itself is rather skewed, but you will find yourself cheering for the bad guy anyway ... without remorse. Please check this movie!
