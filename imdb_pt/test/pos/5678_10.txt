I went out with my friends and saw this movie last week here in London. We did not know what to expect, the poster gave some of it, and I will not say anything else to not spoil the plot, but we thought it was a great movie with great acting, compelling and scary storyline as hell! Having done some research on the production of the film, I have to give it to those guys, filmmakers, actors, writers, etc., for having put together such a film with such limited resources. Post-production very well done too. For all this, I give them 10 out of 10, and I hope they continue their good work. Keep it up, folks. You are amazing!
