I have not seen many movies with Holly Hunter, but seeing her on Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise. She is an uncompromising journalist, Jane Craig, who devoted all her time to the TV news. His colleague Aaron Altman carried his torch for a long time without saying anything. The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick. He is the former slightly distant sportsman who is the new reporter. For Jane, it symbolizes everything she does not like in the news - turning it into edutainment, not into serious business. To her surprise, Jane finds herself attracted to Tom. Holly Hunter is doing a great job as a cheerful journalist. But I do not quite see what she finds so charming about her new colleague, Tom. It's something that keeps us from getting close and personal with him. Almost as impressive is Albert Brooks, who gives his all in the role of a professional who gives more than 100% to his work, but does not receive so much in return. In fact, for a while, I thought he was Steve Guttenberg of the Police Academy (1984). It has some funny lines and if this was an image of Meg Ryan, they would call it a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> After more than two hours, some scenes could have been edited or left out altogether, for example. Jane and Aaron's trip to Central America. Also, I'm a sucker for happy endings and I preferred a different end than just a meeting between the three seven years later.
