Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a multitude of Indian locations and a plot that is inspired by Bollywood still grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance / adventure. And by that, I mean "good", not an easy and artificial happy ending of Hollywood or Bollywood. The East meets the West in a different version of the movie Friends. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the epic cinematography and the fun, engaging and poignant plot without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugs in the strings of the heart. HARI OM is a sweet movie that does not rot teeth. Look!
