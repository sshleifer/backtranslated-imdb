Spoilers in this review! Despite some highly improbable scenes, including PE boys measuring their penises in a contest and the few mandatory teens - trying-to-get-vignettes, this film captures the painful essence of high school in ways that few teen movies ever made. He accomplishes this by not only showing the trio of friends, Gary, Dave, Rick, like smoking, drinking, always in adolescence, but also looks at the nature of the friendship itself while these three friends have their loyalties tested. This film is a snapshot of the time when childhood ends. For the shy romantic Gary, when he sees the lovely Karen for the first time, he falls in love instantly. The excitement of awakening in Gary is written on the screen, and he proves his love for her by accepting her when she is abandoned by her lover. This love for Karen signals the end of Gary's innocence, as ties to his two best friends will be tested and broken through history. The confident man of the ladies, Rick, is the middle-class person we all secretly wish we were: handsome, cool, and always has impossibly beautiful girls in a swoon. Rick turns out to be an idiot, but you have to keep in mind that your character is only 17 years old. He panics and makes a bad decision. From Rick's point of view, the story is also about finding the girl of your dreams, a bad breakup, and at the end reconciled. The look on Rick's face as Gary walks in and sees Karen kissing Rick, shows that he finally understands that his best friend and he love the same woman. As in real life, you do not bend because your friend has an unrequited love. This is the tragedy of the movie. Rick is not a villain, and constantly through the film he reminds Gary and Dave that they are his best friends. The soulful quality of Gary's performance, however, is the heart of the story. Lawrence Monoson is a handsome loser. He does everything right, his heart is in the right place, and he is consumed by love for Karen. However, Karen, in the end, is not moved by the devotion and kindness of Gary. Karen represents all the people in the world who accept unrequitedly, who exist in the vacuum of their own ego and never stop to realize the emotional damage and trauma they inflict on others. This movie is brutal in its statements about love and friendship, but it is what makes it unique among teen films. It ceases to be a comedy and becomes an irretrievably romantic film, although doomed to a tragic conclusion. Whoever has met the girl of his dreams and has not won it, will understand. The poignant passions of high school are as real as the emotional tensions of adulthood, and this movie will remind you of this in strong strokes. Gary's final reversal, as he walks away with the inscribed medallion, is as moving as in the movies. Sit down, after you see this, which is actually made of two movies. The first part is a silly teen sexploitation movie, and once the story begins, it's a drama heavily affecting. A great movie. It should also be noted that the soundtrack was prescient in its selection of many rising stars, including The Police, The Cars, Devo, Oingo Boingo, The Plimsouls, The Waitresses, Brilliant Pinnacles and Phil Seymour.
