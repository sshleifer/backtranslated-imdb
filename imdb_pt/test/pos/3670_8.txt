Yes, sometimes "Unconditional Love" dominates when it ricochets - not, as it ricochets - from one element of history to another in the more unconventional use of elements and thematic characters. In fact, it was only when I watched the movie for the second time that I began to understand what I think Father J. Hogan might be trying to do with this quirky, unconventional movie. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love that Grace (Kathy Bates) longs for and describes in the back of the film. Grace insists that unconditional love is just that, without condition and without qualification. So I watched "Unconditional Love" again with that in mind. I laughed a lot more than the first time, got more involved with the characters, I began to understand the sometimes absurd twists that the story takes. The performances are often exaggerated, but no more than they need to be to fit Hogan's weird and crazy vision, a vision that has led me to tears, yearnings, and burst of laughter. Yes, Hogan is asking a lot of your audience. But I at least learned to truly love his film - unconditionally.
