After reading the terrible reviews of this movie, including comments that claim to be cited by Colin, I almost did not bother to add this movie to my Firth Film collection, however, being the Firth Fan that I am, the intrigue got the better of about me! <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I liked the movie. There was suspense, drama, and intrigue, and the scene of you. The plot kept me guessing until the final credits and I felt that once I got over the opening scene of Jennifer Rubens, the actress played her role convincingly. Colin was as brilliant as ever and it's great to see him play a "black side" character, a "creep on the spine" and after watching it I can not wait to see the recent Trains "Trauma" movie coming soon DVD. <br /> <br /> OK, maybe 'it was not a movie that was' in your face' so to speak and you could not 'sleep in the plot', especially near the end, because there was a movie A lot going on, but was what I liked about it, the acting was subtle, fortunately not overdone (like many thrillers of suspense), this made the movie even scarier to watch. One could not guess the character of Colins (Ross Talbert), or the character of Jennifer Rubens (Jamie Harris), and there were some surprises in the store, I sat on the edge of my seat everywhere, with a cushion on hand !! <br /> <br /> Personally, I'm very happy to have watched 'Playmaker' and will certainly come back and see again. I think any fan of Firth would benefit by watching this movie if they did not like the plot, so just watch Colin ;-))
