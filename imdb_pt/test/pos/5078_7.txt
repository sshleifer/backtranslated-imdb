On this day and time when almost every other news story is about drowning, Abu Ghraib images, or tales of forced detention at Guantanamo, Gavin Hood's "surrender" is the latest and most timely of a story. movie as it is likely to come out of the Hollywood mainstream entertainment factories. It is by no stretch of the imagination a perfect film, but it also does not deserve the awkward reproach it has received at the hands of critics across the ideological and political spectrum. The term "rendition" refers to the CIA's ability to arrest any individual suspected of terrorist business after having secretly taken them to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time, without due process of law. Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian man who has lived in the United States for twenty years. He has an American wife, a young child and a new baby on the way. He seems an unlikely candidate to a terrorist, but one day, without warning or explanation, Anwar is arrested and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that Anwar claims to know nothing about. On the downside, "Rendition" occasionally fails in his storytelling skills, often biting a little more than he can chew on in terms of plot and character. The ostensible focal point is Douglas Freeman, a CIA rookie agent who is taken to observe Anwar's "interrogation" at the hands of Egyptian officials. The problem is that, as conceived by the writer Kelley Sane and promulgated by Jake Gyllenhaal, Freeman seems to be a "scout" too naive to create a very plausible agent, and he does not get the screen time needed to develop completely. as a character. We know little about it at the beginning and even less, it seems, in the end. He "goes through the motions," but we learn very little about the inner man. So, without a strong center of gravity to hold it together, the movie occasionally seems to be tearing itself apart, with story elements flying in all directions. A similar problem occurs with the disturbed wife of Anwar, played by Reese Witherspoon, a woman about whom we never know much beyond what we can see on the surface. Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon proved to be great actors in other circumstances, but here they are surrounded by a restrictive script that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances. <br /> <br /> What makes "Rendition" an extremely powerful film, however, is the extreme seriousness of the subject and the way two concurrently executed plot lines fit elegantly into each other in the final stretches of the film. It may be a slightly more artificial story than we may have liked on this subject, but, after all, this is Hollywood, and the movie has to pay DEMONSTRATION to the expectations of the general public if it wants to be enlightened, much less see the daylight as a complete design. <br /> <br /> Two of the supporting performances are particularly appealing in the film: Omar Metwally, which makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a real-life Kafkaesque nightmare. which he can not awaken, and Yigal Naor, who makes a surprisingly complex character of the main interrogator / torturer. Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles. Special mention should also be made of the warm and richly colored cinematography of Dion Beebe. <br /> <br /> Does the film oversimplify problems? Probably. Stacks the deck in favor of the victim of torture and against the forces of evil government? Definitely. (One wonders how the movie would have played if Anwar really were a terrorist). However, the film has the courage to step on controversial ground. He is not afraid to raise risky issues or risk disapproval of some by the political positions he takes. It openly addresses the question of how a nation clings to its hard-won principle of "civil liberties for all" in the face of terrorism and fear. And how much courage does it take for people of good will finally to stand up and say "enough," even at the risk of being labeled as terrorizing terrorists and unpatriotic by those in power? (The film also does not deny in any way the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism). <br /> <br /> Thus, to reject "surrender" would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the Good. "Surrender" may not be perfect, but it is good, and there is something important to say about the world we live in now. And that just makes it worth seeing.
