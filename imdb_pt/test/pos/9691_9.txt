I would give this movie a 8.5 or a 9. I thought it was just hilarious. I do not know how you could not think that this movie was funny, but the thing that disappointed me was that there were a few very gross things because personally I think when they fly bikes and things like that is a lot funnier but I'm sure there are people who think that other things are very funny then it is not my will but rather should definitely go buy it too if you do not like this movie that's good because I'm sure there are many people who think this movie shows how disqualifying our society is or whatever this is just my personal opinion and you have yours. also the set of jackass boxes is definitely something worth downloading or buying or what you do to get your videos
