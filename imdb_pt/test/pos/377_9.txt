In Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's Strangers On A Train, Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meet for the first time on a train trip and discuss the idea of ​​two murders. Anthony, a little aggressive, suggests that he could kill Haines' unfaithful wife and that Haines could murder Anthony's domineering father. The lack of any connection between the killer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes remain unsolved. The content of the conversation leaves the Haines quieter with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious. Complications come later when Anthony assassinates Haines' wife at an amusement park and then pursues Haines to keep his part in the deal. <br /> <br /> The differences between the two men are clear from the start. Haines is a professional, respectable and fairly modest tennis player about his accomplishments, while Anthony's life is not going anywhere and he admits to being kicked out of three colleges to drink and play. Haines is in a relationship with the daughter of a senator with whom he wants to marry. Anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical maneuver on Haines's part to provide himself with a shortcut to a career. Character differences are also visually reinforced. Anthony often inhabits shaded areas and travels on a boat called "Pluto", while Haines is often seen from the more heroic perspective provided by low camera angles. <br /> <br /> There are some striking visual sequences such as: - (1) The murder of Haines's wife, who is shown through the reflection of her glasses falling to the ground as she turns strives to free himself from Anthony. <br /> <br /> (2) depiction of Anthony alone, dressed in black and looking very small against the huge white Jefferson Memorial building. <br /> <br /> (3) The time when all spectators in a tennis match are moving their heads in unison, following the action, while a head (Anthony's) remains fixedly frozen in a position looking at Haines. <br /> <br /> (4) The scene where the rotunda goes wildly out of control and eventually drops spectacularly. <br /> <br /> Frequent use is made of "doubles" throughout history, for example, Haines and Anthony are originally introduced as 2 feet feet from their taxis and going to the train. As the train leaves the station, there are two sets of lanes, each providing a choice of two lanes forward. The two men discuss the murders of two potential victims and order two double whiskeys. Hitchcock's cameo sees him struggling aboard the train carrying a double bass. Haines feels bent when his wife reneges an agreement that they had for her to see a lawyer to get a divorce. Haines's wife goes to the amusement park with two boyfriends. When Anthony confronts her before the murder, he lights his lighter and produces 2 reflections in his glasses. Anthony later becomes very baffled when he meets the senator's younger daughter, whom he sees as a double for Haines's wife. Anthony also feels bent when Haines refuses to move on with the second murder. When Haines is traveling alone on a train going to Metcalf, he sees two men in the same carriage kicking their feet accidentally the same way he and Anthony. The action throughout the film continues at a great pace and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (as the Senator's youngest daughter) are particularly powerful.
