In addition to the fact that the women in the film are incredibly beautiful and all the prisoners in the field are very fat, this movie sounds true in the post-war chaos. <br /> <br /> Beautiful photography and a powerful national expression of the Polish national character. <br /> <br /> It is very slow on some points, but its whole rhythm is so different from the American and Western European films that it is quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Both major actors do a very good job. In the DVD version, you can see interviews with the main actors and the team, and the leading actress Stanislawa Celinska gained about 15 kg and lost all its beauty. But by 1970, it was a dizzying one.
