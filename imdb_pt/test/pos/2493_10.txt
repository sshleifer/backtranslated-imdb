You can not watch a movie like Peter Watkins' "Privilege," a story of the exploration of a pop music artist by big business, state and even organized religion, without thinking of creatively degenerate commodities like Michael Jackson or Britney Spears . which sell corporate giants like Pepsi or some other poison for money. Or any number of artists, in music or movies, who become tools of political parties or commercial religious interests such as Scientology and Kabbalah. A film like Privilege must have looked almost science fiction when it launched in 1967, so fantastic was its premise. Today, we tend to consider celebrity endorsements as guaranteed, giving little importance to their most alarming implications. Watkins' vision did not just become reality, we tacitly accept this reality as "normal." <br /> <br /> Now consider Punishment Park. As Privilege challenges the viewer to examine what is being sold to us, and why, Punishment Park requires us to calculate what is being taken from us and why. <br /> <br /> Heaven helps America, and so does the world, if contemporary politicians get their hands on this movie. It is so close to reality that, in visualizing it recently, I experienced a genuine and nauseating feeling of anxiety. Once again, Watkins deftly employs a documentary-style narrative. While in Privilege some rough edges for this technique were apparent, in Punishment Park it has been perfected for a crisp and perfect perfection. The sense of realism is enhanced by disarmingly unpretentious, economic, and compelling representations of the entire cast. This is the kind of acting in which Hollywood has completely turned its back, to the detriment of favoring projections of aesthetically perfect images. The cast has first-line material to work on in Watkins script. Many cinematic visionaries tried to alienate the viewer from their false and complacent sense of security. No one has achieved this result with as rigid and frightening precision as Peter Watkins does here. "What seems clear enough right now is that instead of trying to bring the excluded and excluded Americans, like these people, back to the national community, the government has chosen to accept and exploit the current division within of the country, and next to what it considers the majority. Instead of politics of reconciliation, it chose the policy of polarization. "To paraphrase one of the characters, we do not need to call them pigs because they know the that are. Better than us.
