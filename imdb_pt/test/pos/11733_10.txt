The jazz soundtrack makes it look like a Clint Eastwood movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole thing calls me Burt doing Clint. The story is good and the movie is full of pamphlets that I carry with me to this day. (Reynolds for the bad guy: I'm going to pull the chain on your friend, because you're in my town.) And you want to know the worst part? Coil Technics 1500B is a beautiful backdrop for audiophiles! <br /> <br /> Charles Durning comes out cool while listening to tapes of prostitutes listening to (plus or minus) sex on the phone. (You would have to see, trust me, it's hilarious.) <br /> <br /> Brian Keith plays against the guy like a tough guy. (And it does!) <br /> <br /> Bernie Casie's concern with Zen. <br /> <br /> Rachel Ward. WOW! (Where did she go?) <br /> <br /> Doctor Severinsen and the band Tonight Show play out, as usual. (The guests of Joe William on vocals. Manhattan Transfer re-recorded "Route 66".) The soundtrack lends class to the whole subject. <br /> <br /> Do I need to say more? It may be Reynold's best ever film. <br /> <br /> (Yes, he touches himself, as always, but it works!) <br /> <br /> Have fun!
