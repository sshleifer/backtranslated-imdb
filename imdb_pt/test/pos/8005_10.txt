Many of us consider art nice only when the masterpiece itself touches something deep within us. That is, complete creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can relate to it personally. It was winter, here in Australia in 1992, when I saw Batman Returns in theaters and this surprised me. Both "I am". I should belong to an ideal, a pattern, but at the same time I was living another life. Tim Burton was the first filmmaker to say that it's good for a comic book to be bleak and confess that darkness can happen to all of us. After Tim Burton's interpretations of Batman, many other comic book heroes and heroes flooded the theaters. Comic-book folklore for decades told of friendly and friendly heroes with beautiful smiles and magical superpowers flying in the sky, waving powerful webs of their wrists, wore red boots, and had the strength of a locomotive. But what happens when you are only ten years old and see your parents coldly executed before your eyes? You are there. Somewhere in her psyche her young psychological suit falls apart. The only way to deal with this pain and hurt is to create an alternative person. You make a promise. Your other self will be stronger, use all the anger to use the means available to avenge the innocence of your parents on that criminal, those criminals, any criminal. This is the life seen through the eyes of Bruce Wayne. Both pairs. The world he sees is dark, dark and cold. Although he patrols the streets and people listen to him, they do not rush to get his autograph. He is your Savior, not the winner of a personality contest. Batman Returns is about losers. Batman, for yet another Christmas, remains "the only solitary animal in town." Bruce Wayne can never legally arrest the vile Max Shreck. The penguin can never unleash his pain of being discarded by his parents over the citizens of Gotham, and Selina Kyle is always lost for being mentally fragmented and traumatized. And the hero does not get the girl or the cat. This film investigates the desire of all of us to want to so desperately belong, to have a home, as expressed by Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot. The film brings a need in all of us to be heard, respected and not ignored as desired by Selina Kyle, Oswald and, of course, Bruce Wayne. But sometimes we are all repressed in one way or another, they tell us to be an ideal, to behave according to a certain pattern. That's until we finally fit together. Only hope remains at the end of the movie, as we see Catwoman climbing into the night sky. But come what we all must desire goodwill for all men and women. As for myself, I can not say that I will come to the point where I believe that my problem with duality will be reconciled. But it's alright. We all have a dark side. Batman Returns is not just the best of the Batman movies, it truly is an exceptionally good masterpiece of storytelling.
