one of the best and most inspirational films about a different culture I've seen in years. tragic and moving. it's worth the clock. maybe a few times. We all know how brutal children can be. I know of my own and my brothers experiences as children and this movie hit the nail on the head. perfectly! The kite race is incredible and I need to do research on the validity of this event. Although it is done in CGI it is still amazing and very interesting. maneuvering a kite like this with a single rope seems impossible, but makes it believable. Anyway this movie has many twists that are, I'm sure for many, probably easy to figure out, but they hit me before I could. which makes a great movie for me! when you discover the entire movie in the first 10 minutes, it ruins everything. but this one does so well that it's hard to guess even when it happens ... I'm a guy and I do not mind saying that tears were flowing in more than one spot in this movie.
