He plays straight but with a silent intensity that makes him one of the best cops in movie history. Roy Scheider stars the French Connection of a poor man who has a bit of the same brave appeal. FC is a better movie but I prefer to watch this movie because 1) I think Scheider is great and this is his best movie, and 2) he has the best car chase that makes Bullitt look like a cable production (thank you again to Bill Hickman, who actually plays the driver). It does not hurt that Tony LoBianco stops (again) to play a villain. Please enjoy.
