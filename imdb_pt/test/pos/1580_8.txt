This movie, I'd like to say, was completely great. I can see how many people would think it's just a shocking movie. This is not completely untrue, but it is as shocking a fiction as Chuck Palahniuk's books. One of my all-time favorite movies, Bijo no Harawata is a certain kind of crudely made movie about which you can have any reaction. It's scary, funny, silly, coarse, full of off-the-top stuff and for some people, waking up. The first time I saw this, it was with my friend, and his mother brought it home for him to see. He said it was just a spoiled Japanese movie, but I saw a lot more of that. It's badly done, yes, but it has a certain kind of poignancy to the point of being beautiful too. As the director says, this is a shocking movie made for a reason. It's like atrophy. If you leave the public soft, the whole human race will be gentle. I think this is a good philosophy and I agree with it one hundred percent. Bijo no Harawata is the kind of movie the gang rapes about fitness, yogurt, and all these new wave stuff.
