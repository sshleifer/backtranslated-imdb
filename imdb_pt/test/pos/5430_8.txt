Robin Williams is a national treasure, especially when he lets go and puts aside his mushy approach to drama. He manages to excite Barry Levinson's usual contained rhythm, and there are moments in this movie when he really shines. <br /> <br /> As the elected American president funny in "Man of the Year" Williams recaptures the outrageous and outrageous that used to be associated with him. What makes him so attractive is his humanity and sympathy. Here is a man who can attack his audience, but he also really loves them. His humor is like barbed wire, yet it is cathartic. It's what makes it very appealing to people in the movie and in real life. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney is once again portraying an intelligent woman in danger. She is a fabulous and very talented artist, but I think she fit into a stereotype and unfortunately it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable artist in this case. Walken practically walks by his ungrateful role, and the climactic SNL scene is barely above the water. <br /> <br /> Proceed for a few hilarious moments, and those are invaluable. Have fun with Williams and forget some of the deeper moments that slow down this entertaining movie.
