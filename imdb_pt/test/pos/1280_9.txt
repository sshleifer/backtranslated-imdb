It is an interesting exercise to witness the first works of great artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision that hindsight offers, you can see the gears and wheels that make these people what they are. Here's one of those glances back to the past of Christopher Nolan, one of today's great storytellers. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan's film style emphasizes movie delivery. the story. Although people may complain that it depends too much on the time change, I still find it fascinating to see how he uses this technique differently each time. Memento was probably the most complicated piece of storytelling I've ever seen. Discard the hardened cynics who say it's a piece of old meat wrapped in fancy sauce. Memento shows how even the simplest of stories can become a mental problem. The Prestige, which was considerably reduced in comparison, still showed creativity in how its three stories were intertwined. Even in a weary company like the Batman series, Christopher Nolan has spread some of his extraordinary yarn-weaving tricks, giving new life to the knight of darkness. There follows an intense tale of intrigue and mystery, where you see a dilettante writer, who becomes a reluctant voyeur, who becomes an unknown accomplice of a variety of petty crimes and finally sees an end that no one could wait. Having never heard of following before, I had no idea what I expected. At every moment, the movie kept me guessing where it was taking me. Since the mysterious angle was clear, I was constantly trying to figure out what would happen next. And that's where I think the movie succeeds. The film has many elements that have led me to many crazy goose pursuits. <br /> <br /> The film is entirely in black and white and counted in several timelines, both of which are considered enigmatic these days. Then all this is done in the least stereotyped or invented way possible. There does not seem to be a reason why the story is told the way it is, but you do not feel like you're being taken for a ride. The lack of pretense or self-conscious arrogance is what makes this style of storytelling work. Highly recommended!
