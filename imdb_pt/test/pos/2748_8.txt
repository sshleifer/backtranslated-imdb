William Wellmann, who directed one of the most moving silent films of all time, "Wings" (1927), returns to heaven with another story of the devil's pamphlets. Wellmann had been an air ace in World War I and no one knew biplanes like him. Here they are, stunt-flying, crashing, exploding in the air, and everything you can think of, plus a fascinating glimpse of commercial air operations in 1932 as well. And there is a very strong story, excellently interpreted by the sombre Richard Barthelmess (the silent star who made several films with D.W. Griffith), Sally Eilers and Tom Brown. Eilers is a true sizzler. It's a relief to see a real woman with real fire and character instead of one of those photographed botox dolls who play Hollywood movies today and they all look the same. The story is sad, played with true love and well directed. Towards the end of the film, there are some extraordinarily exciting scenes of danger and rescue, and what must be the most ingenious blind landing in the thick fog already imagined. I dare not reveal the ingenious aspects of that particular episode. The character played by Barthelmess is very much like Wellmann himself, a true creator of hell in the air. Anyone who likes aviation at first would love this movie, and it's very gratifying for anyone who likes good solid entertainment, love, tears and uninterrupted action, all combined into a delicious Wellmann kind of omelet.
