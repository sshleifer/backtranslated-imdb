I saw this movie on my local cable system under the title 'Beyond Redemption'. I was looking for new material to watch, since most reruns on a Saturday morning did not interest me. I've always been a fan of Andrew McCarthy and Michael Ironside, so I chose this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Personally, I liked the movie. Rich Roesing, who posted a comment about the movie being spoiled by him while watching scenes from the movie on the back of a video store, is well justified. I did not have the disappointment of knowing in advance anything about the movie. This led me to rate the film above the average listed on the page. <br /> <br /> I like thriller movies, and this was no exception. The movie kept me guessing until the end. I was surprised by the ending! <br /> <br /> The moments of reflection and memory of the protagonist's past experiences during the film only increased the suspense. His reactions to these memories gave the film a sense of the humanitarian, albeit conflicting, side of police work. Fighting with your faith is also a welcome addition. <br /> <br /> If you like suspense movies, but also from films that expose the character's feeling, the personal inflection side, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie in the local cable or satellite system guide, watch it! <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking for a rental video, follow the advice of Rich Roesing and ask someone to get the video. for you before you watch.
