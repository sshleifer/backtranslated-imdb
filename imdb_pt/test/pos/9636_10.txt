This is another classic Seagal movie. He walks, no, crosses the patriot just with all the other Mega Seagal movies. Nothing comes close to challenging Seagal in this movie, except maybe the part where he has to find a cure for that so-called 'plague' and he starts throwing things about the lab, but it all works, I mean, let's face it, your Master Seagal, he has to win. And about his clothing in the film, masterpiece, he must have picked himself. It's great that everyone in the movie is dying after being exposed to the virus, but Seagal does not even have a cough. The incident at the end, when he kills the fat guy with the broken glass, genius, I bet Seagal also thought about it. This movie is pure and simple class. great plot, great characters and Seagal.
