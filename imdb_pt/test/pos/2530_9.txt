For me, this is one of those movies I could watch on the "Z" channel in Los Angeles when I was on duty. And it was another of those movies I saw when I was young ... and I learned that there was a world out there ... one I did not want to accept. <br /> <br /> Moving to Los Angeles and starting to watch international films has become a great pleasure, and to this day, no premiere channel programming has combined with the "Z" channel in its international movie screening. The three international films that stayed on my young boss were "Spetters", "Beau Pere" and of course this, "Pixote". <br /> <br /> This was the most shocking and sad movie I've ever seen in my life. life. This was also one of the first films that made me understand that there is a difference in the cinema: entertaining and informing. Let me be honest ... growing up in a small town on the east coast, I had no idea that something like this - up to that point - existed. All I knew of South America were leaflets of fabulous vacations in Brazil and that Columbia had a lot of drug trafficking. <br /> <br /> Then comes a movie like Pixote. Sad. Disturbing. Inflexible. Spooky. You are watching: children. Those who need shelter, love, understanding and all this are a way to survive day by day through drugs, sex, stealing, stealing, sleeping on the streets and in homes of sadistic groups. Their survival is difficult to watch with other street children. , prostitutes, etc., and you begin to wonder how things like this can happen in this world. <br /> <br /> Pixote is not an entertainment film, it is an information film. It shows shocking and disturbing images - but it shows the lives of these street children daily.
