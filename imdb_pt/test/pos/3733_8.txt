I'm a guy so I was very hesitant to watch the movie because I know that Richard Gear likes to be in tear movies. I'd rather watch action / adventure / science fiction. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear. Diane tended to act a few more times, just like Richard, but they brought her back and made her work. The daughter was a repressed teenager with a huge attitude, so you started to hate her. The film is very predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece. Go rent it, see if you do not shed a tear.lol If you like the notebook, you will love this. The beach scenes were immaculately filmed. even if the hurricane scenes were a little out of sequence, it was still a little risky to see them react to it.
