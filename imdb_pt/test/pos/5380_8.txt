All great from time to time, you are faced with a movie that even exceeds your wildest expectations. Given the IMDb rating of 4.0, I was not really expecting much with the Brotherhood of Satan. I hoped that, at the very least, it could be fun, like The Devil's Rain or any other Satanic horror movie with similar themes. I could not be more wrong. What I got was an ambitious and clever film with a cast that I really enjoyed. Broadly speaking, to avoid giving anything, the style and structure of the film are far more experimental than the direct narrative so prominent in the early 1970s. Satan's Brotherhood does not hit your head with points and explanations. Much is left to the viewer to fill in the blanks. As a viewer, you know that something is wrong, but for a longer period you are simply not sure what it is. The unknown helps to create a much more frightening atmosphere than most similar films. The ending is effective with its surreal images. I was amazed when the final credits started rolling. Those who want a grand finale will be disappointed with the simplicity of the end. A smaller movie would have tried to remove all barriers and probably would have failed miserably. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the movie where it's easy to forget that the director, Bernard McEveety, worked mostly. on television before the Brotherhood of Satan. There are some scenes that are so well set up, enlightened and filmed that even the most talented directors can learn a thing or two. For example, I've seen enough movies over the years to realize that directors sometimes seem to have trouble shooting widescreen indoors. Not here. The scene where men are discussing their plan of action in the sheriff's office is incredible. Do we see all five men at once? each doing their own thing like in real life. In a smaller movie, we could see all the men at the same time, but each one would stand still, waiting discreetly to deliver the dialogue. It's a small scene but it looks so natural and it's so beautifully filmed that it's one of my favorite moments of the Satanic Brotherhood. <br /> <br /> Finally, I mentioned the acting in my debut, so without going into a long-winded speech, I will just say that The Brotherhood of Satan presents Strother Martin and LQ Jones Any movie with these two guys is almost a winner automatic with me.
