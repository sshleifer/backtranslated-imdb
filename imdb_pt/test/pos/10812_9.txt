This film depicts the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu at its best) and Robespierre (a performance commander of the Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak), who is the second year of the French republic formed after the execution of Louis XVI, . The moderate revolutionary Danton returned to Paris from his home in the country where he has been since he was ousted as leader of the Public Safety Committee the previous year by Robespierre. He opposes "The Kingdom of Terror", which resulted in the execution of thousands of citizens, mainly by the guillotine, which is thought to be against the Revolution. Danton is confident in the support of ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to contain the bloodshed. But Robespierre and the Committee fear that Danton's popularity will lead to their being overthrown, and that Danton and his supporters will be tried for being traitors. This was the first French film made by Andrzej Wajda after he arrived in France from Poland. His Polish film company was closed by the government because of his support for the Solidarity trade union, which had opposed the Polish government in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His previous film "Man Of Iron" (1981) dealt with the Solidarity union and its leader Lech Walesa, and it is easy to make comparisons between Walesa's relationship with Polish leader General Jaruselski and between Danton and Robespierre. Danton / Walesa are the voice of reason opposed to Robespierre / Jaruselski who continue the dictatorial government, although they have lost the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish play "The Danton Affair," written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s, and at its launch the film was criticized by some for being static and theatrical. But what the film does is focus on the backstage of the Committees and the scenes of the National Assembly and the courtroom, instead of the activities on the streets of Paris.
