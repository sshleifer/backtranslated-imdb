I really liked this movie - I like prison movies in general (I'm not sure why - I'm sure some psychiatrist could do something about it!) I spent a night in jail for over 20 years, and I knew so I would never go back - I have the individual version of "fear straight"! (I was locked in a cell of isolation in Alcatraz for a few hours, compliments of a park guard, but that's another story!) Anyway, the genre really interests me. The soundtrack, specifically the Rolling Stones' "Sympathy for the Devil," was the perfect setting for the film. To this day, I think of "The Jericho Mile" every time I hear the song.
