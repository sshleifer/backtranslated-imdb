This film is George C. Scott at his best, Bernard Hughes at his best and Diana Rigg in his most energetic tone and of course Paddy Chaevsky to write in the masterpiece "Warp"! There are also very brief excerpts from future biggies like Susan Sarandon, Channing Stockard etc., who have a scene line that you do not necessarily see until the fifth or sixth time watching. Nancy Marchand, as a young middle-aged nurse, is also superb, just like virtually every "Hollywood face" of 1970. <br /> <br /> It is one of the few movies that improves the more one sees this. Pay attention to the "surprise" scene ala "Wait till the dark"! This is one of the few movies I bought on DVD. It's so wonderful.
