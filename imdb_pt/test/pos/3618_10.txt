Being of Cephallonian ancestry, I was happily surprised watching the movie. I heard the true story of my relatives who still live in Kefalonia, but when they watched the movie and read the book, the fragments of the story were full. It's all true, the Italians would sing, the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often. The 1953 earthquake killed my great-grandfather, and the book and the film portray the sentiment of the time with great compassion. If you have not seen the film, watched it and read the book, it's not just a love story, and yes, there were many Italians in love with cephalonic women, in fact, a bunch of cephalonic women were taken to Italy after the war , is a true representation of history.
