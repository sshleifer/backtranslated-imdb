Ladies and gentlemen, we really got a winner here. Actually we do not but the boy is this movie a horrible joke horrible and always fun. Poor Alma (who seeks Julia Ruiz) is suffering from an ancient Mayan curse that causes venomous and lethal snakes to grow inside her body. Alma and her husband of demented shaman Brujo (Alby Castro, who feverishly sats with a delicious intensity of rolling his eyes) clandestine on a train bound for Los Angeles. Of course, a lot of deadly vipers are lost to terrorize the assortment of passengers. The Mallachi Brothers, working from an absurd script by Eric Fosberg, treat the ridiculous premise directly, thus creating a wonderfully miserable piece of raving campy cheese. The raw effects of CGI, the pathetically inflexible common variety that Gardner snakes (there are scary rattlesnake noises added to the soundtrack to impregnate them with a slight sense of nonexistent threat), the slow pace, the total scarcity of any tension or momentum, the obvious and precarious stage train, and especially the simply amazing "you must be kidding me!" absurd over-the-top end are all downright stunning in their chin-dropping cravings. Better still, we also have the play (if lame) acting from an unnamed cast, a little bit of sexy, nude female nudity, a funky hum'n'shiver track, and lots of coarse and extremely coarse makeup f / x. The bonus points to the fact that the annoyingly cute little symbolic girl is devoured by a large reptile and to the engineer who gets caught, who gets caught smoking crack from a hollow bulb (!?). An absolute destroyer of a kitsch howler monkey.
