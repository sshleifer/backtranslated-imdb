I first saw Robin Hood: Men in Tights in 1994 at the movies. I went to see why I always liked Robin Hood and saw the trailer for this movie and found it hilarious. After I saw the movie, I must say it was even better than I thought. Not only is it very funny, it is also a very well made movie with beautiful scenery and costumes and a very beautiful trail of Hummie Mann. Cary Elwes is funny as Robin Hood and also Tracey Ullman, Richard Lewis, Mark Blankfield, David Chapelle, Amy Yasbeck, Megan Cavanagh, Eric Allan Kramer, Matthew Porretta and Mel Brooks are funny. But the best part of the film is played by Roger Rees as the rotten sheriff of Rottingham. He has the best scenes from the film and also the best dialogue ("Illegal King's Forest to kill wildlife in one", which means "It is illegal to kill a wild pig in the king's forest"). He somehow mixes all the words and speaks a sentence that no one understands. Robin Hood: Men in Tights is in my book as one of the best Mel Brooks movies to date and I can not say I've laughed so much about a movie like this. Just stop laughing.
