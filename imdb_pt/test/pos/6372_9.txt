A great show. <br /> <br /> First of all, for people who do not like it. I do not like it, so DO NOT WATCH ... <br /> <br /> That's (was) an amazing show. Better than According to Jim (A favorite of mine). It shows a REAL family home (as opposed to 8 simple rules, etc., where everything goes peachy). <br /> <br /> They are noisy, they are confusing .... I can sympathize with their dragging all the garbage in the kitchen. It happens in real life ... Sorta likes the "Portal to hell", and everyone growls like dogs over the fast-food boxes. <br /> <br /> It's a "Been There" show ... You know what's coming, but fun to watch because you've been there before. <br /> <br /> A good cast, they work very close together, a spectacle admirable enough to guarantee a DVD release. Mel Gibsons "Safety videos" were also one of the highlights of the series. <br /> <br /> Opinion? Good show, REALLY deserving of a DVD release (deserving not be canceled too).
