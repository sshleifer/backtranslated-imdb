There is so much I can take from Filipino movies, especially nowadays, where the trend is sex, action and comedy slapstick (which I hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the film was a big advantage. It has good cinematographic scenes and the edition was great, especially cinematography. I think Claudine deserves the best actress here than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there are only a few Filipino movies that I really like. I think Cholo Laurel did a great job in this movie. I truly loved this movie, technically and character development wise; the plot was complex and that was what made it fantastic.
