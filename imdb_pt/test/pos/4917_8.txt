Although, for most of us, sensuality is a variable quality, I can not remember a movie that made me what it does. It carried me into a terribly familiar realm of desire and desire. All the compulsive attraction, the uncertainty about the outcome, the palpable fear, and the excitement so intent on this state of excitement were brought to the fever pitch by this film. So French and what I consider bold! No matter what your guidance, I think the danger of pursuing your desire is placed in front and center here ... much more, say, than with Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut."
