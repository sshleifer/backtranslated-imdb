This is one of those movies that critics really miss. This movie is practically the McHale Navy for the 90's or Police Academy at sea. Grammer proves that he can play roles other than Frasier, as he surpasses and surpasses the Navy to get his own submarine. Rob Schneider is as wormy as usual, the same in all roles she plays, and Lauren Holly is the local sexpot though with a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as funny as ever, with almost every sentence, a catch phrase. The film has a wonderful and clever plot and an unforeseen script that still surprises me every time I watch it. Many of the phrases and terms of the Navy go over my head, but it is a small obstacle to the absolute accuracy and realism of the film and its characters.
