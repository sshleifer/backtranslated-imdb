Ok, so this was not what I was expecting. I rented this movie just to see how it would be since I want to see the first one anyway. But this movie had a B movie everywhere. But when I watched it I realized it was very funny. In the first 30 minutes, it was exactly how the snowman was fixing people and a man losing his sanity. But, those first few minutes had some funny liners in it. When he vomited the first of his little footmen, I knew that would be very funny. They all act like the gremlins in the ninteen eighty-four gremlins that made it seem like they were doing spoofing and made me forget it was a B movie. So if you like to laugh, rent this one.
