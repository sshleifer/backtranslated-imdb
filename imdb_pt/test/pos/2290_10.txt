Redo the 1992 Oscar, and this movie can be nominated, or even won. It was so good at capturing its era and double cultures that it belongs to American and Japanese time capsules. If you wanted to know what it's like to live here or there at that time, this movie will show you. As an American, you will feel as if you have traveled to a long Japanese vacation, and at the end of the movie, you will be a diehard dragons fan, while accepting the injection of tradition and Japanese culture into your baseballs. , just as we did with our culture at our own game. Jack Elliot (Tom Selleck) is a Detroit Tigers slugger being traded for the Dragons, the undefeated runner-up of the dynastic Yomuri Giants, Japan's response to the Yankees. The giants are admired for their success, but this success also has everyone who wants to overcome them, something that is rarely done. The manager of the Dragons recruits Jack as the final piece of the pennant-winning pennant puzzle, and we get what might have been Gung Ho on a baseball field, but instead was much more. The cast was excellent: Selleck proved that with a good script and a character that suits him, he can take a movie, just as he did his television show, and the Japanese cast was equally good, until Mr. Takagi of Die Hard back as the image-conscious owner. The other actors, including the one who plays the love interest (also the daughter of the manager), strong and independent, but simultaneously a believer in the Japanese traditions, in addition to what was forced upon her. She is an adequate and supportive girlfriend for Jack. Even her father never tells her not to see him, almost sympathizing with Jack about what he suffers from her, and a little relieved at least he knows the man she chose to love. <br /> <br /> The baseball scenes are great, greatly enhanced by a pre-famed Dennis Haysbert as another former American patriot and Western mentor to Jack. The usual fish-out-of-water elements are there, and you can almost feel like stumbling along with Jack to fit a country that does not speak our language, and does not practice our manners, but copies everything we do, including our national pastime. One of the funniest scenes occurs when Jack, holding a magazine, informs his manager that he has learned about the tradition in Japan, where you can get drunk and tell your boss, and it can not be used against you, and does very certain exercises humorous The plots and subplots are neatly tidied up in the end, but not very well, and nothing concludes unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Calling this comedy is wrong: it's a pure comedy-drama, or even a drama with good humor. The plot is too deep to reject it the way it was made by critics as an actor out of his league trying to carry a lightweight movie. The situations were fun, but instead in a much more serious, deep and precisely detailed setting that results in one of the best movies I've ever seen. The cinematography of baseball rivals that of For Love Of The Game, for realism. <br /> <br /> Some say the movie is about baseball, or about Japan, but more than anything seems to be about the workplace and how people get to work from totally different backgrounds, with different agendas, and somehow have to put their differences aside for the good of the company, or the team. <br /> <br /> A really great movie that should never have to apologize to itself the way it did when it was in theaters.
