I'm definitely not a gamer, but some people of my family and my boyfriend are. Then, somewhat reluctantly, I decided to find out what the big problem was with "fanciful things." I saw Dorkness Rising and thought it was HILARIOUS! It is clownish, but not disrespectful to those who enjoy RPG games. Also, and more importantly, people who have never played before can have fun and not feel excluded or lost trying to understand the plot. The performance was great and the field shots / set was believable. This makes me want to see other films from this producer. I can not wait to see what the future holds for this group! Three cheers - well done !!
