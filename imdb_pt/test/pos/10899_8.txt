"Lonely among us" is definitely one of the best episodes of the first season. The plot, though a bit confusing, creates a lot of suspense, backed by the scary synth soundtrack. This is a scenario typically "alien body invasion," but ultimately has no evil purpose (the death of chief engineer assistant Singh to me was an accident). The two delegate species deliver a fun picture (best makeup so far), finally adding a bit of black humor to the series (the final scene). Patrick Stewart obviously likes to get out of his Picard character and explore some new terrain, as well as Data, posing as Sherlock Holmes (another all-time classic). The special effects are also convincing and director Cliff Bole did his job well. He is the first to try to make up for Trois' lack of performance by improving his appearance. She looks beautiful in some scenes and the neck of her dress greatly improves her appearance. Picard's "lightning scene" on the bridge gives him a faint air of Star Wars Emperor "Return of the Jedi" (which is a personal impression, but it made me smile). with the illumination of the corridors (simulating the night on board) and the first moving camera, moving away from Picard when he is entering the transport room to enter the cloud ... Good job. The clever cut, creating continuous dialogues in different scenes (Troi's hypnosis report), gives the impression of a well-crafted TNG episode. The first, where even the Wesley Crusher seemed almost tolerable ... <br /> <br /> The ending, however, is a bit confusing, as if the producers were running out of time. "P for Picard" is a little distant and its return is very easy, but this can be left aside in relation to the many strong moments that this episode has to offer ...
