Everyone told me to see "Cactus Flower" and finally I did. What a wonderful movie - the perfect stimulus for a Sunday night / fearing Monday morning. Matthau and Hawn were good, but Ingrid Bergman actually made this movie - after all, it was really about her. True real actors can do anything, and Miss Bergman proves it. It shows us - in the course of a film - a track that few people exhibit throughout their careers. The scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was touching. Even when the film came to an obvious conclusion, I found myself applauding Ms. Dickinson as if she were the Boston Red Sox. Fortunately, she did (no pun intended) much better. ;)
