An interesting piece for the true John C. Holmes documentaries. Unfortunately, it does not deal with what ultimately killed Holmes, and certainly could have benefited from it. Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg received the highest praise for this, but I felt that the real stars were Julianne Moore as the aspiring mother who smells of cocaine, Don Cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as a pornstar / stereo salesman in some pitfalls savages and William H. Macy, wife of who's the ultimate whore. Not to mention an almost unrecognizable Alfred Molina. Macy's New Year's Eve bash and Cheadle's chance to have a better life after an assault on a donut shop that went wrong are probably the two best scenes in the movie, or at least the two best ones. What this movie does best is to show how power can easily corrupt in its various forms. However, none of the characters seems to learn anything with their downward spiral and somber as they all recover and return to their normal life.
