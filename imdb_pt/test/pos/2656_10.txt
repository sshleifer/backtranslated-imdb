Spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> 2001: A Space Odyssey is arguably the most challenging and successful film of the late Stanley Kubrick. This is not a movie you watch to be entertained or entertaining. Instead, he offers her a feast of food to think about, images that linger in the eyes of the mind long after the movie is over. It's a movie that you could meditate on. <br /> <br /> The film intentionally offers us more questions than it can answer, is made to confuse and mystify, but leaves the viewer with a sense of respect and reverence. (this is to allow him to engage in the process of seeing him, the pleasure of this film requires some effort on the part of the spectators) the questions he asks are big and sinister, with respect to the genesis and fate of the human race, it is place ultimate in cosmic design and the existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself. <br /> <br /> The first of the Four Quartets films gives us a distinct view of the past of the species. We see our distant ancestors, half-monkey half human, in a state of near-starvation. The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts are almost starving. An extra-terestial object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and animals are inspired simultaneously by their presence in the making of tools and violence. They are transformed at night into carnivores, and when two tribes meet near a water source, the tribe that has developed tool-making capacity as well as belligerence, deeply destroys the neighboring tribe. The new chief of the winning tribe, empowered by the first vestiges of technology, triumphantly launches the bone he used as a weapon in the air. We see the bone transformed into a floating satellite, which contains nuclear weapons. We soon learned that the world is torn apart by nuclear paranoia. The characteristics inspired by the appearance of the monument that once helped us survive now threaten our very existence. <br /> <br /> Once again humanity is in crisis, again the supernatural presence represented by the black monolith will intervene to help humanity. in the next step in its development. In an exploration of the Moon, a monolith identical to the one we have seen is discovered. The governments of the world, usually mortal enemies, met in secret to discuss the implications. A mission is organized. the monument was involved in some kind of radio communication with Jupiter. Some men will travel to the destination of the transmission. Most of them, most of the time, will be kept in a state of suspended animation. The pilot of the spacecraft will be HAL, a supercomputer that has been programmed to mimic all the characteristics of humans. <br /> <br /> The film has many notable sequences. As usual for Kubrick, the use of classical music is excellent. The most memorable ones are "Blue Danube" and "Also Spake Zarathustra" (particularly appropriate given the film's theme of transcending the common consciousness). Cinematography is particularly great too, after a single showing the last 30 minutes of the movie will haunt you for the rest of your life. <br /> <br /> The HAL character is most important from the point of view of the central thesis of the film. By imitating all the characteristics of human beings, it also has its negative characteristics. The paranoia he develops that almost leads to the ruin of the mission is an accurate mirror of the paranoia that allowed the political situation back to Earth to reach a point of desperate crisis. The film suggests that these are the traits we should leave behind if we are to move on to the next stage in our evolution. <br /> <br /> The architecture of the film is also significant. The designs of many of the spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central theme of the film. The end of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This film has a vision of life similar to that presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and the novel by James Joyce Finnegan's Wake. It posits a pattern for human history and evolution that is cyclic but progressive, repeating the same events at great intervals, but with the human race developing according to the will of a being with a greater purpose in mind. Although we never know what that purpose is, the film guarantees that the human race is not doomed to failure, but fate is grand beyond imagining. It still amazes me that despite this movie, many people still consider Kubrick as a misanthrope. <br /> <br /> This is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to any specific creed, but because of it's invocation of admiration in the vast panorama of existence and it is involvement with the deepest and most vital issues on purpose it is true. <br /> <br /> In the hands of any other director, all this might be a little too much. The Hollywood view of life is very insignificant, usually to encompass the grandeur and intensity of such a vision. But Kubrick was a visionary, he drives with absolute confidence, not only that he can handle such material, but that he is the only one to do so. The process of making this movie used all its creative resources. The writing partnership with Arthur C Clarke is the most productive in film history. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the movie's startling climax. The resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time, so he brought them into existence. <br /> <br /> 2001 is an absolutely unique cinematic experience. Those who lose this do so to the detriment of their own intellectual and imaginative capacities.
