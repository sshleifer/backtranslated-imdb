I think Vanessa Marcil is the best actress in the cast. She makes Sam one of the show's best characters. James Cann is also very good. I love it when he cares about Delinda. One of my favorite scenes in when Ed and Delinda are hitting on a guy. That was funny. Nikki Cox is also good and has great chemistry with Josh Duhamel. Lara Flynn Boyle was amazing in her guest role. I wish they had not killed her. The show has a great cast with no bad actors that are not something you see on TV. I still think Vanessa Marcil is the best. She should have an Emmy in my opinion. Too bad the show was canceled
