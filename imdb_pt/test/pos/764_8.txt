I, being a fan of Rupert Grint, rented this movie a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written movie with a lot of great actors. It was fun, and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his best-known character from Ron Weasley. His subtle portrait of Ben and the great acting of everyone else made this film very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Ben, a very shy boy with an extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and becomes the, I think you could call "assistant" to Evie, a retired actress. In the beginning, it's just a way to make some money. But after a while, he and Evie seem to develop a friendship. Evie helps Ben out of his shell a little and makes him have fun and be happy with himself, and in the end both seem to need each other. <br /> <br /> Whether you're a fan of Rupert Grint or not, this movie is a lot of fun with some really cute moments. I recommend to anyone who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors.
