Let's face it. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly clich√©, like dramas and Korean romance films. First of all, there are a couple of brothers long lost, one of whom falls in love with the other. Secondly, there is a not-so-popular girl and two gorgeous, popular guys who fall in love and fight for her. Thirdly, one of the characters suffers from a tragic illness, which eventually takes away his life. <br /> <br /> Still, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Without the right actors, this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel. But as the actors fit perfectly into the roles, the film is fascinating - I honestly could not stop watching. Kang Dong Won, despite his handsome face, gives an incredible performance, not to mention Lee Chung Ah and Jo Han Sun, in addition to all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to everyone. .
