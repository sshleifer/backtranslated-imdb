This is one of the best sequels and a very good movie, even though there have been some mistakes, but still I liked it. This time, Charles is not only fighting one or two assailants, but an entire army of them. Death Wish 3 has great action scenes and I enjoyed every second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page providing the music, with producers Golan and Globus still doing there and Charles Bronson is still performing well for Paul Kersey. This movie also made it appear that Michael tried to end the series Death Wish and I can not blame him and I love the weapon that Charles uses. Death Wish 3 is one of the great films of 1985 and can not be better than that. <br /> <br /> I give it 9/10
