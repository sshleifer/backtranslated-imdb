This mostly routine, fact-based TV drama is driven by Cole's excellent performance. This is the story of a highly trained military man, unhappy with his wife and children, faking his death and running away with the other woman. To support her the way she is accustomed, he steals the banks. Predictable, but not a bad clock.
