Movies should not always be about deep and provocative thoughts. Sometimes they are simply to get away from reality. Out To Sea fits perfectly into the design. A mild romantic comedy of "golden years," Out To Sea may not be a big budget, you might be able to tell easily when they were acting in front of a green screen, but it's still a lot a movie worth watching. A sweet movie that needs a break. <br /> <br /> This is just good fun and light. Not to be a deep movie. It's something worth watching. If for nothing else you should see it for humorously rigid and rigid rendering of Brent Spiner of Oye Como Va. Gil is a character you love to hate and Mr. Spiner takes the perfect evil comic paper for two beloved comedy movie Gods .
