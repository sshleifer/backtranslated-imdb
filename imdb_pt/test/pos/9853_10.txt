In Sudan, Arabs dominate and are constantly at war with the Christians and animists who inhabit the southern part of this East African country. This film follows a group of Dinka boys, a tribe of cattle herders who became orphans after their village was destroyed and their families killed in a brutal attack by Arab forces. Most of these boys are now teenagers and nicknamed "The Lost Boys." The filmmaker follows a group of "Lost Boys" on their journey, as they were accepted as refugees in the United States. , where they will land in Houston. Those who have been accepted as refugees gain celebrity status because they feel (from what they have heard) that America is incredible. Taking a trip from Sudan to America is like "taking a trip to heaven," says the young man. A huge party is launched for the match, and they are told to do well to Sudan, and after being educated, return to Sudan so they can contribute to Dinka society. They are also warned not to be like "those in baggy pants," who are responsible for the negative stereotype of black men, and also, no matter what happens, not to forget the Dinka culture. <br /> <br /> Watch how the boys come from a third world country to America and how they try to integrate into American society, since they have come from a place with virtually nothing to this abundant world where everything is massively overproduced and consumed too much. They are taught about cleaning and how to use all the utilities we take for granted on a daily basis. It's funny sometimes to humiliate others. <br /> <br /> Listening to the comments they make about black Americans and American society / culture is very interesting. As the movie progresses, you see how American culture begins to corrupt your previously humble ways of thinking. <br /> <br /> One of the boys, Peter, is not content to work and earn enough to survive. moves from Houston to Kansas City so he can pursue an education. When the other kids visit, they talk about how they can not get into any school. The main reason they came to America was to get education and the media is saying that the boys were brought from Sudan for an education. This is because boys are given arbitrary ages, making them older than they really are, preventing them from enrolling in high school. <br /> <br /> The film juxtaposes images from Houston to Kansas. We watched Peter enroll in school, where he befriends a group of conservative Christian children, and while Santiago tries to run the school (even if he drives without his license), and works at Walmart. We see Peter struggling with high school life as he struggles to make his basketball team in schools and how Santiago finds it hard to keep up with work, rent, appease tensions in Sudan and, above all, deal with loneliness. > <br /> It gets to the point where the boys want to return to Sudan, and they tell them that everything they learn about America is a lie. "You must be alone here, do it all yourself," says one of the boys. A condemnatory message for a liberal capitalist lifestyle, showing how this makes people to become radical individualists (a trend that led to the creation of both neo-conservative neoconservative and radical movements). His greatest beef with America, however, is that there is no time; Time is money and we do not waste a second! <br /> <br /> Despite all this, boys never lose their sense of Dinka culture. They celebrate South Sudan Liberation Day, which marks the day the SPLA began fighting in Sudan, a struggle that continues today. They also meet with other "Lost Boys" on the anniversary of their arrival in America, where they discuss their experience in America compared to that of Sudan. When asked, a boy says that if he could make a living he would rather live in Sudan He's very lonely in America, he adds. They never lose the sense of community that has been conditioned in them as part of their culture! <br /> <br /> This film makes us question the way we live, makes us question the artificial happiness that the materialism and nature of our societies created within us. It will also change the way I see the refugees, I will never again take for granted how much they should work and what immigrants mean for a country like my own, Canada. This is a wonderful film. I laughed, I cried ... a very exciting journey and a very well done documentary. 10 out of 10.
