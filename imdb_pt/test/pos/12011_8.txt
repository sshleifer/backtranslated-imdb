I think this film has become an important record of the most horrifying aspect of the East German regime - the arrest of its people for what the regime called the antifascist protective wall. It is a document of despair and courage not to be missed. I would, however, like to comment on the actual location of this leak. This did not happen in or around Berlin, as some interviewees supposed, and it had nothing to do directly with the Berlin Wall. The exhaust balloon was overflew by the Iron Curtain, which not only divided Germany, but also divided all of Europe at that time. The balloon took off from PÃ¶ssneck, 170 kilometers southwest of Berlin, in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and traveled 14 miles to Naila, Bavaria, and freedom in West Germany. The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall at the end of that year. Although the balloon flight has created a thrilling thriller, it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives while trying to flee East Berlin, other parts of the GDR or other states controlled by the Soviet Union.
