We watched this movie in my chemistry class, so obviously it had educational value. I thought the film did a great job of interweaving the subjects of science, moral issues and personal experiences of the Manhattan project, but was not exactly focused on a strong performance. I would recommend this movie to scientists or those interested in the moral issues behind Fat Man and Little Boy, but if the subject of nukes bores you, I do not see it.
