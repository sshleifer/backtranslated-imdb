In relative terms, having watched a lot of disgustingly moody Tom Fontana & Levinson are geniuses to create and deliver in this writer's book the greatest TV show of all time. Oz was treated terribly In this country, the end came out well 3 In the morning, before this was strictly considered alternative vision for those unrelated to rubbish in prime time. <br /> <br /> I first caught Oz at the end of first grade and from then on it was a must-see watch. My man Adebisi, possibly the most intimidating villain of all time, Beacher, the perfect anti-hero, Eammon Walker's Saeed, an evocative acting class. There was the hardcore material, of course - some simple evil, but essentially Oz had soul. Augustus tells the plot unfolding with Insight pearls, while the fights of Beacher, Mcmanus, Saeed, Rebedahl etc. are better than any soap opera before or after. Tragedy of wisdom of compassionate violence Intelligence pain joy brutality love & heroism Oz has crossed the spectrum of human emotion - all within a maximum security prison! <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can say that Thursday nights with the great videos of Vids follow the series Oz 2/3 in 99, the best TV I've ever seen. Beacher Assault Vern At The Gym It's a time I do not need a video for - a small screen classic that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> Imagine what Oz would have done with the same jerk that the Sopranos gave a timeslot of 10 pm and all promos ??? All right, I got over this now, to those who took it. Consider yourself privileged by those who did not like TV sucks ... and you deserve it.
