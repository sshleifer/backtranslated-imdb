taking into account the Chan films that would follow, is not bad. There are many stereotypes beginning with the black in the beginning and when the police captain orders that "all the Hindus of the city" be reunited. A parade of stereotyped characters comes on the scene, including Shemp of the Three Stooges. Charlie seems to be moving quickly through the city, going from Sutton Pl. To W. Village in a flash. The end is silly. An obvious toy plane is used as it climbs through the sky and then plunges into the nose. Ed Wood could not have done better. The final scene is absurd, because the murderer will obviously incriminate himself in his attempt to calm the person who knows his identity. Overall, worth seeing.
