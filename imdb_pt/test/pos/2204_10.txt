Even if you are not a "theater person", I recommend you watch this. Based on a piece by the same name of Christopher Bond (which, in turn, was based on an old London legend), Sondheim did a wonderful job, taking her to the stage of musical theater. The score is simply incredible - by far the best of Sondheim, and probably one of the best notes written for a musical of all time. The show was released extremely well, my only complaint is of Johanna's portrait of Betsy Joscelyn. It's nice, remember, and she's a very versatile actress, but she just does not sing "Greenfinch and Linnet Bird" very well. But beyond that, it's all phenomenal - Angela Lansbury * did * the role of Mrs. Lovette, and she just does it so well. George Hearn was a good substitute for Len Cariou in the title role, and Ken Jennings gives a great performance as Tobias. The end will give you shivers. Best notes for a wonderful show.
