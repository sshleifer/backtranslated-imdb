Black Rain is an excellent movie, but watch out for DVDs currently sold for up to $ 300 each. I have the DVD and it's terrible. Tiny non-anamorphic image that needs to be magnified to the size of kill resolution. Sound acceptable. This is a primitive DVD that absolutely * has * to be re-released. <br /> <br /> BTW, I also own the laserdisc and the VHS of Black Rain. The VHS is a huge step up from the DVD! And the laserdisc has by far the best picture of them all ?? Subtitles in black, sharp, large picture, simple but very good soundtrack. Buy VHS and avoid the absurd prices these scammers are demanding!
