"Captain Corelli's Mandolin" is an old Hollywood war novel, but with sex and nudity, and supposedly without Americans. The story takes place on a Greek island during World War II. The Italians arrive to take the island, but with German supervision. There is a romantic triangle formed by a Greek couple and the Italian captain. Good performances by all the actors; Penelope Cruz's best work yet.
