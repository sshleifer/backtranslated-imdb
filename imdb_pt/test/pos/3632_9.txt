A very moving film, a great surprise coming from Brazil, a country that usually exports resources on social issues, violence, sex ... Magical realism is a very difficult task, and I believe that João Falcão has done it wonderfully. It seems like he really did not want to make a realistic film, far from it. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Hawk was influenced by the series "Today is Mary's Day". The TV series produced by Globo was made after the movie, but it aired before ... Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> The negative point is photography, by Walter Carvalho. It seems that he did not grasp or understood the concept that Falcon created. The story is captivating and universal, although it happens in a small town in Brazil. This could happen anywhere in the world. A great movie, I highly recommend it.
