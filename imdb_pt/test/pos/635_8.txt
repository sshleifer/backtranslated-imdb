I could not stop watching this movie, even though it was past my bedtime. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Hitchcock are well-deserved - this thing really plays with you. There is a wonderful line between real and immediate suspense and a dark and distant mood. Like many of Hitch's heroes, our innocent silent witness has stumbled upon something really horrible - and we are taken on a walk with her, in turns fully identifying and feeling her fear, sometimes watching in thrilling suspense as she is put in danger even more . <br /> <br /> The filmmakers took great care in working this out. From the first shots, they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is manufactured; who is trustworthy and who is a monster. The plot rotates and rotates unpredictably. The suspense is created with a combination of camerawork, images, music, carefully chosen - but more simply THE EYES of the characters, which sends raw fear directly to you. <br /> <br /> A warning: there are some real horrors, as well as some nudity. The horror scenes are made in an emotional way that make them much more frightening and disturbing than in any photo of teenagers. <br /> <br /> And a photo of terror teens is not. The characters are quirky and look like real people, on the one hand - a couple (including heroine) that you might even find captivating like I did. There will be no mistake in watching a movie made for adults. I mean, Alec Guinness is here, briefly, and you know he DID NOT NEED work! <br /> <br /> Pop into the VCR one night when you can not sleep. . . and I do not want to, yet.
