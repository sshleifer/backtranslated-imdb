I gave this 9 stars a possible 10. If I had only a little more plot I would have given 10. <br /> <br /> However, it is a very interesting film. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivey, who plays a nice little old lady, should have received the Oscar for her performance. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace (who plays Alice), whom I had never seen before, also does a great job. and has the sexiest body I've ever seen in the movies. <br /> <br /> In a crash to make an old car, Alice left the NE to Florida, where she has a friend (or maybe it's her sister, I'm not sure, and this is my fault, not the movie ) and high hopes of going to college, which she and her family can not afford. She seems pretty vulnerable out there on the road by herself, and she sure finds some rather rough characters and shortly after it turns out that there is a hole in one of her tires. <br /> <br /> She is on a rest stop at the time and is assisted by a woman named Sandra and her husband Bill, an older couple who is traveling in a trailer. <br /> <br /> They are going south, to Florida. , and take it under their wings, but is everyone the way they are performing? Flashbacks and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns some new lessons about life.
