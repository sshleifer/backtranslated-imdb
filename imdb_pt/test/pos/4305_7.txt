Double Shock is one of many good episodes of Columbo that reaches the level of a good movie. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements we like in the episodes of Columbus. We start laughing when Columbo does something awkward, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee you'll laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode. <br /> <br /> We also received the riddle, as usual, with an almost perfect murder, but something about the problems of Columbus murder. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbus solved the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is another good episode of Columbus, and I will rate 7/10. It is close to 8/10. <br /> <br /> "Just one more question" - The acting? Peter Falk is very good as usual.
