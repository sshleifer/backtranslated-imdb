I love meatballs! Fantastic characters and poignant situations make this one to be loved. Bill Murray is hysterical and you have to love that 4 mile trail run at the end! A total classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years. It brings back fond memories of the camp and deals well with the experience of being rejected by foolish colleagues and the empowerment brought about by being rescued by a supportive adult. Tons of great one-liners and a wide variety of wacko counselors. This is the kind of movie where you repeat key phrases between friends for years afterwards. Also nothing overtly gross and that sweet soundtrack of the late 70's to bring just the right amount of nostalgia. I can not say enough about meatballs; it's a classic Be warned! All the sequels are pestilent bombs that simply bought the name rights for marketing. They have no connection with Ivan Reitman's masterpiece.
