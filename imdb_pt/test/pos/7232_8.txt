Once upon a time, Troma, a company that brought us movie classics such as The Toxic Avenger, Rabid Grannies, Poultrygeist, Redneck Zombies and Surf Nazis Must Die, has long decided to adapt Shakespeare's famous play, "Romeo and Juliet." This adaptation decided to spice up the story, adding eccentric sex, extreme violence, genital monsters, piercing and incest and managed to create a bizarre but hilarious movie. Anyone who went into a Troma production should know what to expect, and this is an irreverent and perverse comedy with a lot of political imprecision. Expect a lot to nod to other Troma movies and lots of reused jokes (turning cars and smashing the head). Many may think it sounds like absolute crap that only idiots find funny ... they may be right but at the same time they may need to relax and enjoy the insanity and mental numbness that is Tromeu and Juliet. With a great cast, a funny script (by James Gunn and Lloyd Kaufman), an appropriate soundtrack and many great visuals, Kaufman was once again able to turn what's upside down and fill up the bag all. Grab some popcorn, have a beer, invite your friends and enjoy Tromeo and Juliet for what is, an adaptation of Shakespeare with many balls. The end. <br /> <br /> 4/5
