I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was. Whether you are a gore fan or a fan of suspense; you'll love it. I used to dislike scary movies, I thought they were stupid. But anyway, it happens that I make exceptions. I find something really extraordinary in this movie. Rarely have I seen a movie that scared me, but I tell you the truth that this movie gave me shivers in my neck. Unlike most horror movies, this one worries about the development of the characters. I recommend this movie and I'm happy that Asylum is finally releasing good horror movies nowadays. <br /> <br /> I recommend! Appreciate!
