Imagine the most depressing winter you will ever experience: gray instead of white, no snow fights and certainly no wonders. This is Finland as portrayed by "Frozen Land". This film follows a group of people whose lives are strangely attached to each other, with results beyond anyone's nightmares. Yes, most characters are defective in the way that only celluloid characters can - completely annoying and frustrating to watch, but for some reason you want the luck to change. With a random mood and a cast that brings together the more traditional faces of Finland, the Frozen Land offers a glimpse of the Finnish mentality that, despite its depressing downward spirals, manages to restore some faith in mankind. More than Kaurism√§ki, to say the least.
