I also saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw with my girlfriend who later became my wife. I remember that the movie made me feel that it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if the memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little too much, but the female character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and it could have been the introduction for the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since then and I wandered because it went to the side of the road. I would love to watch it again to see if it was as good as I remember. Elton John's soundtrack was excellent.
