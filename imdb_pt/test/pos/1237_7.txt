Adapted from Sam Shepard's play, this film retains many theatrical elements, such as a relatively fixed setting (a 1950s roadside motel in the southwest) and extensive and intriguing dialogues. A woman "May" is chased by a man "Eddie" (played by Sam Shepard). She tries to hide from him in the motel out of the way, but he finds her. The film explores the story of their relationship, especially from their childhoods, which brought them to that point. It is very easy to feel sympathy for the characters and understand that their dysfunctional present relationship is a result of past events beyond their control. We mostly watch them fight, make peace, fight, make peace and so on. An image that stands out in my mind, is Eddie pulling May over his shoulder kicking and screaming, taking her somewhere she does not want to go. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also perfect for soul with vocals from a lesser known artist "Sandy Rogers." She has a country doll voice that almost rotates in some parts of the album! This is the kind of movie that will be lodged somewhere in your brain / soul. In other words, go see!
