I just got this movie for Christmas and I already added it to my favorites list. A cute and simple story that makes a beautiful movie. Who could not love Uncle Felix or not have mouth water at the sound of all that food. Set points go to Sydney Greenstreet for his performance of Alexander Yardley and also for Reginald Gardiner, who played John Sloane, the incredibly boring bride. Truly a gem to be seen every Christmas.
