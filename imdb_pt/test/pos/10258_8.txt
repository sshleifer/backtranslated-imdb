This was the first movie I ever saw in my life in 1974 or 1975. I was 4 at the time and saw it in a drive-in movie theater. I did not understand that this would be a classic at the time (I went to sleep about twenty minutes in the movie). After watching it on television along with two of my other favorite movies Car Wash (my favorite movie) and The Wiz, which seemed to come every year about the same time all together, about 40, 50, 75 times I knew that here was a movie that I would have as one of my favorites. These three films were the only live action shows I could watch as a kid. <br /> <br /> I would not consider this a blaxploitation film, but a film of urban interest. Chochise and Preach reminded me of some of my uncles, especially the Wild Irish Rose, whom they drank. My mother also told me about some of the groups she participated in and that some of the things that happened in the movie were similar in nature to what happened in real life. If you are one of the two or three blacks in their thirties who have not yet watched this movie, I recommend you buy the DVD right away. I'm glad I was around to witness some of the events of the day.
