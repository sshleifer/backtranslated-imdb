I saw Peter Watkin's Culloden and The War Game a few months before that and I was very impressed. The technique is essentially the same, or at least very similar, in this film detailing on the one hand a judgment of California dissidents in the (seemingly) near future, and on the other the attempts of a group of "criminals" sentenced to Slog through 50 miles of desert to gain their freedom in a "park punishment" government as an alternative to arrest. Watkins films everything in a documentary style, which causes more than a little embarrassment or requires a strong suspension of disbelief: how the film crew is with the group of hungry and parched prisoners for two days without offering help or sharing their misery? And that's just the most obvious example. But the questionable narrative aside, that packs a punch; There is no doubt that you have to be interested in making political films to get involved really, but the film really is not like anything else of its time: it does not give punches, it does not offer simple solutions. Leftist political figures are certainly painted widely at times, but they are not all the same; the right-wing government officials seem a bit more caricaturists, but even they can show at least a bit of humanity. Overall, the film gives a lot to think about and leaves an indelible taste. DVD Rental
