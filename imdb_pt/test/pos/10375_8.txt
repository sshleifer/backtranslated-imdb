David Suchet is Agatha Christie's detective Hercule Poirot in "After the Funeral," produced in 2005. Anyone who has heard David Suchet speak in his own British accent knows it's a shock because his accent is so perfect and organic character. Suchet is Agatha Christie's Poirot's book, and although I confess a love for Peter Ustinov on paper, his portrait does not have much to do with what Christie wrote. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Poirot is asked by a solicitor friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. On the way to the train, the lawyer reports the events after death - a stranger will disclose the expected heir and the pronouncement of the man's sister that he was murdered. When Poirot knows the family, he discovers adultery, many secrets, another testament and murder. <br /> <br /> The story is great with rich production values ​​and a wonderful and detailed representation of the time period. All the acting is superb, especially Monica Dolan, who plays Miss. Gilchrist. Poirot here is without Hastings, his beautiful office, or Miss Lemon, but he is effective nonetheless. <br /> <br /> I had the privilege of seeing David Suchet on Broadway in "Amadeus." Breathtaking. What an actor - when he's playing Poirot, all I see is Poirot.
