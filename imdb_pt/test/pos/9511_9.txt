I've never seen a file in a language that I do not understand just because I wanted to see the movie and could not find it with the sub-English. I do not know how much I missed, but it was not much. Probably just specific details that sound silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together. I want to mention to The Diceman of Germany that there is no reason to feel that he "sucks" when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. As I said, I do not understand Japanese - or at least just the small amount I got reading the long book - probably my all-time favorite book that I could not put the next day's work just to finish reading! I do not know if there is a dubbed or subbed version in English, but if the movie, but if there is, I would love to see it. The movie was amazing in Japanese Anything better is the icing on the cake !! Slainte ', Maegi
