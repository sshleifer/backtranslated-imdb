The title suggests that this film is a continuation of "An American Werewolf in London". None of the characters from the previous movie returns and are not even mentioned in this movie by name. Then, as a sequel, the AAwiP fails, it would be said. <br /> <br /> I dare say otherwise. <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a charming and effective horror film. It's one of the best werewolf movies I've seen a long time too. And I've seen enough of me, like an American werewolf in London, The Howling trilogy, Wolfen, The werewolf and the underworld. <br /> <br /> The story tells of three Americans visiting Paris on vacation. At the top of the Eifel Tower, one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide. What begins as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that hide in the city are revealed ... <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the acting in that movie. Especially the two stars of the film: the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her. They have good chemistry together. But the other two Americans also play their roles well. I really did not find it boring at all about acting, so I enjoyed it! <br /> <br /> The effects on werewolves are good. It does not seem too cheap or fake for me. Of course, opinions are divided on this subject. But let's just say that I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> There is also a good amount of humor in this movie. There are some really funny scenes that you will probably remember for a long time. <br /> <br /> So to sum it up, an American werewolf in Paris may not be a direct continuation of his predecessor, but it's still a pleasure. movie. Perfect for werewolf fans! 5 out of 5 stars!
