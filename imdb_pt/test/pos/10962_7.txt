What there is to say about an anti-establishment film that was produced in an age of such colorless emptiness, social indifference and authoritarian contentment. Cassevettes' first major independent film was not an instant box office hit and has yet to receive the essential attention it deserves. I make comparisons with this wave of independent American projects consisting of "Beat" filmmakers like Robert Frank and Harry Smith, with the emerging scene emerging in Paris in the late 1950s, known as the new French wave. <br /> <br /> discussed poetry, philosophy, and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering American cultural supremacy; even at this stage, this peculiar and highly spontaneous brand of cinema struggled against the establishment of such lexicons and political fanatics who controlled the development of the arts in the mid-twentieth century. <br /> <br /> The Cassevettes film examines race relations. and portrays man as weak in the face of love, because we as a culture are blinded by racial prejudices and prejudices. The great element for much of Cassevettes' work is that his films have almost a minimalist reversal effect; a mental reaction is evoked through subtle relations of character, not so much of images. That's why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining characters that rely less on explicit actions and more on interpretation. <br /> <br /> Although my favorite movie of Cassevettes is 'Husbands', this one is the most important of them.
