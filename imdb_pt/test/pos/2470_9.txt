I got this movie on TV yesterday. I was somewhat curious about this being that it was directed by Emilio Estevez and starring him and his real-life father, Martin Sheen. I love watching a movie about a father-son relationship involving a real-life father and son. Of course, there is an instant chemistry between Sheen and Estevez, and their scenes of conflict are even more intense, knowing that they are really related. Of course, it helps that they are both wonderful actors. I've seen Martin Sheen in intense roles before, but I think this is Emilio's most intense role - as I remember him mostly from the "Mighty Ducks" series - and I was very impressed. The talent REALLY runs in this family. And Kathy Bates steals the film in an Oscar-worthy performance. She pulled my heart out with every word of dialogue. Kimberly Williams - the beautiful actress in the movie "Father of the Bride" - is also very good, remaining among a group of talented veteran actors. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit theatrical, with dialogues that obviously are aimed at the stage, but that does not bother me. This is not to be an action movie; this is a character study. And for a movie based on a play, it never gets too claustrophobic. When Emilio's character, Jeremy, remembers his days in Vietnam, we actually see his anguished memories brought to life. <br /> <br /> The film is extremely powerful and realistic without being sentimental. In the end, I hoped that all the conflicts would be resolved and the family would become excellent, but this is not how it happened. The ending made me cry, without resorting to the Hollywood standard melodrama. This proves that reality is far more exciting than anything Hollywood can evoke. <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for a beautiful and powerful drama, with extremely wonderful performances that will leave you out ... please check out this underrated jewel. I hope one day Martin and Emilio will join Charlie, and everyone will make a great movie together. <br /> <br /> My score: 9 (out of 10)
