John Parrish is a former Union official who plans to sell his ranch and land at Wilkison in Anchor. The problem is that the price offered is low and when they start bullying Parrish and his workers, he changes his mind, especially when things take a brutal turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> Originally after watching this movie, I had a feeling of frustration, mostly because of the cast involved. When you have Edward G. Robinson, Glenn Ford and Barbara Stanwyck in the same movie, you expect them to have a story and a road map to stand out. Unfortunately, they have no chance to produce a western classic worth multiple revisits, or is it my expectation to do a disservice. Well, I slept on it and decided to reflect on the photo. I think so, it's fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work, when all has already been said and done, a plot that was milked for all it's worth and then some. But The Violent Men is still a very rewarding film regardless of the obvious missed opportunities with production. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford as Parrish is as cool as an Eskimo's nose, and it's always great to see Babs Stanwyck touching a bitch because she's good at it. While Eddie G, when he gets used to it being in a western, is well in what is a written part. Robinson, who entered the last minute when the first choice as Lee Wilkison, Broderick Crawford was injured, is what is shorter changed by the creators, even supporting such characters as the devilish Wade Matlock {a laughable delight of the trustworthy Richard Jaeckel and Judith Wilkison , a radiant Dianne Foster, have something to make a good impression. But for what it is, Robinson's butt "bad" face is at least memorable for all the right reasons. <br /> <br /> Not shy with the action and the game of weapons, it is with the twists and almost Shakespearean tragedies that Rudolph Maté's film rises above the mundane, with everything marvelously framed by the impressive cinematography of Burnett Guffey. Lone Pine, Alabama, has been used in many Western images {see Seven Men From Now for another glorious use of it}, but here Guffey really stands out and manages to dazzle his eyes around every corner. The Violent Men is not a great picture from the West, and perhaps a better director than Maté might actually have given Donald Hamilton's novel The Big Country an adaptation to be proud of. But for every niggle and irk I personally had with it, I found two more reasons to really like it, so it is recommended, for sure. 7/10
