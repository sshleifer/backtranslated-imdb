Director and co-writer Alejandro Amenabar did not make things easy for the viewers of his story, a little long but very disturbing, based precisely on a Spanish man's struggle for assisted suicide. "The Sea Inside" is thrilling and its impact far exceeds the time spent in the theater. With the award-winning Canadian film "The Barbarian Invasions," the staff came to see a family along with a group of devoted friends addresses the desire of a beloved, though irascible, man to end his life. In that film, the center of attention suffered from progressive and incurable cancer and his descent to a terminal stage was rapid. Emotional as the scenes were, death was inevitable - the question was how gentle it could be done through a requested intervention. <br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro (brilliantly played by Javier Bardem) is a different story. For more than two decades, he was quadriplegic because of a diving accident. (Very attentive onlookers can detect a terrible irony as to why he ended up in this condition because of his improvised diving.) As a world traveler and lover of beautiful women, he is now trapped in a still body, all his needs met by a truly dedicated family who willingly gives up much of their privacy and time to sustain their beloved relationship. <br /> <br /> Rosa (Lola Duenas), a single mother of two little boys, enters the Sampedro house of what might have been. mere curiosity to learn about the situation of the paralyzed man, but it becomes both an emotionally supportive centerpiece of Ramon and a fun but occasionally aggravating presence. A good Duenas performance. <br /> <br /> The problem, of course, is that Sampedro is not sick in the normal sense. He may well live for decades more with proper care. Thus, his soft but persistent desire to end his life with "dignity" creates a moral dilemma for friends and relatives who, not surprisingly, react from different ethical and religious perspectives. <br /> <br /> Ramon is the quadricycle of posters. a group dedicated to changing Spain's laws on assisted suicide. "Death with Dignity" is his motto. Gene (Clara Segura) is a sensitive activist with the help of the public pro bono council, Julia (Belen Rueda). Julia has her own health problems that carry an indefinite but catastrophic prognosis. Luckily married to a devoted spouse, she bonds emotionally with her client. <br /> <br /> What follows is an extremely sensitive interaction of values ​​and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and wife, his technophile teenage son, not the intellectual Ramon, and his elderly father who can not stop mourning the cataclysmic fall of his son into utter helplessness. The moral and legal issues are represented by excellent performances and short vignettes, including a court scene in which formalism triumphs over any judicial interpretation that can take into account Ramon's feelings and opinions. It may be Spain, but the issues are alive in most countries, including the US. Especially fun is a scream, first floor to the bedroom, the debate between Ramon with a Jesuit priest, also a speaker, tetraplegic, but one whose dogma concealed casually disguises the absence of a soul. <br /> <br /> Special glory to Mabel Rivera, Ramon's sister-in-law, Manuela, for an authentic portrait of a strong woman who holds the family. together. And the same compliment goes soggy to Belen Rueda, Julia, who goes from objective advocate to intimate friend to a woman who is heading for a dark fate. <br /> <br /> The director does not impose value judgments allowing each character to achieve the whole expression. their feelings in an effective and sometimes heartwarming way. As "Dead Man Walking", this film can support any opinion on its deadly subject. <br /> <br /> No one can prevent a person from committing suicide if she is determined, but the universal tragedy of the Ramons world is that without assistance, life in a body in which only the heart beats and only the head can become to move is a sentence that no court could rule on the most depraved criminals. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is very similar to that of criminals. The history and the beautiful Galician scenes are an intentional contrast with the limited visions that Ramon, who has lived in the world, experiences in his special bed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
