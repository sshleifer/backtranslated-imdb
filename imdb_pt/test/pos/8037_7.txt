I found this film quite enjoyable and quite entertaining. Good characters, good actors and enough suspense to keep all your interest. The plot twists may have been a little too much, but overall a decent thriller. If you liked this movie I would recommend The Spanish Prisoner, The House of Games and No Way Out.
