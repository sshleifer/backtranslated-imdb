This was the first directorial work of Sebastian Gutierrez, the writer of Snakes on a Plane and Gothika. Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I love capers, and that was a challenge. A kidnapping and a woman were killed in the process. The FBI has Emma Thompson in the case of kidnapping and the chief of police (Roscoe Lee Browne) attributes Alan Rickman to solve the murder, which happens to be a wife of the senator (Hal Holbrook). These two make an exceptional pair while working together. <br /> <br /> The hijackers have lovers Simon Baker (Land of the Dead) and ultra-hot Carla Gugino (Sin City), along with some partners. . They kidnapped a computer tycoon and ran his accountant all over the city before they got the money. Things go fast there when new twists are brought. The whole thing is shiny and definitely a "piss in your pants because you can not go to the bathroom or you will miss something". <br /> <br /> Now, to be completely honest, I would have given this movie a 10 if there had been more of the movie that the security was watching at the opening. I would love to see more of Beverly Hotsprings and Yvette Lera, but, hey, that was not part of the trick; just the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Thompson and Rickman should definitely make more movies together. A treatment: Agent Hawkins: Fill me like this. Detective Friedman: This remark can be misinterpreted as sexual harassment, Agent Hawkins. Agent Hawkins: Let's get this out of the way: you've never worked with a female superior before. I got to where I'm pushing paper and playing well - I've never really fired a gun before, I'm just at work to prove to my father that I'm not a coward. I give decent head, so I was promoted before all the worthy candidates, all of them men, all of them equally talented in fellatio, but there was a gender quota to fill. I am also stupid and idealistic; You're hard and cynical, and you're usually right. I'm secretly in love with you, but I find it difficult to show it. Did I skip anything? <br /> <br /> Damn, this is great dialogue! Gutierrez not only directs a great movie, but also can write! <br /> <br /> And, did I say that Carla Gugino was hot? <br /> <br /> Put this on your list.
