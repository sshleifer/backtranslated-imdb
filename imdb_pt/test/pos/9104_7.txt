(Very soft spoilers; a basic outline of the plot, no real details) <br /> <br /> IF you enter this movie with sufficiently low expectations. I saw this movie at a free show a few days ago in Maryland, and the only reason I agreed to go ... was because it was free. I expected a few laughs, but as I've never been a big fan of Tenacious D, not much more than that. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes of the movie are hilarious, as we are seen The Christian origins of Jack Black in an American Midwestern city. The film takes us years to the future, to the first encounter between JB and Kyle Gass, the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name. Finally, as the title suggests, the second half of the movie details its quest to get the famous "Choice of Destiny". Again, the beginning of the movie was funny aloud, and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face. Having said that, there were times when it seemed a little long; are only 100 minutes, but still it looks like it should have been a little shorter. The story is as absurd as it sounds, and this is not a movie you see if you want a real plot. Which is good, except that it means that many of the jokes are too run down or wrong ... and when they miss, they miss something bad. Same thing with the songs; it's a musical, but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute ... and they continued anyway. <br /> <br /> I would say that the R rating really saved the film from the bombing; D's mood simply did not work without references to name-calling, sex, and drugs. But unless you're a fan of the band, or at least know that you appreciate their comedy style, I recommend that you save some money and income. "Pick" will make you laugh a little ... but it's worth $ 9? I think not. I was tempted to rate it as a 6, but as I think many would like it enough to justify its presence in theaters, a 7 seems more appropriate. Just make sure it's your style.
