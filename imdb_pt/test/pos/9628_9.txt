"Five Fingers of Death" began the craze of the American kung-fu movie, but I remember seeing it for the first time as "King Boxer" in Chinatown, NYC without the bad dubbing and few Americans. I was also lucky to see the American premiere of "Five Fingers Of Death" in Times Square, New York. What a contrast this ended up being ... same movie, but different audiences. <br /> <br /> In Chinatown, this film took a more serious tone for viewers. It was by listening to the real voices of the actors (in Chinese) that made this film more believable. Chinatown theaters were exhibiting violent kung fu movies for years ("Boxer From Shantung" of 1972 defeated them in blood), so the choreography and action story were the main attraction. Lots of rival schools were still not overloaded, so the plot seemed new. Every great kung fu movie had wonderful, cowardly villains you wanted to see, and FFoD also got them. The star, Lieh Lo, was a well-known actor in Chinese theaters. The mainly Chinese audience enjoyed this movie immensely. The audience buzz as you leave this movie gives the ultimate satisfaction to me. <br /> <br /> In Times Square, this movie was an action comedy ... probably unintentionally. I liked it here too, but for different reasons. The crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. From the beginning, the movie made you laugh. As the audience heard those strange British accents come from those Chinese actors, the film turned into a violent, bloody picture. Most American audiences saw this kind of blood in a horror movie that was not in an action movie. The action sequences exploded the audience. Unfortunately, the movie studios saw that they liked it so much that bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu movie formula. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching this movie with an American audience, but I liked it a lot more. Chinatown Some movies may pass the test of time, but the dubbed version of FFoD can not. The original "King Boxer" is still nice ... a CLASSIC!
