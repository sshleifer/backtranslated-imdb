This is another nice and fun Hitchcock movie. James Stewart and Doris Day are amazing in this movie. Bernard Herrmann appears as himself near the climax. <br /> <br /> The scenery and locations are great except for the one scene at the beginning where the background was obviously fake, which does not make sense to me since before and after scenes were in the same scene and were real photos location. I heard that Hitchcock did it on purpose sometimes. <br /> <br /> The comments for this movie appear to be mixed. I think this is a better movie than the average Hitchcock. Very entertaining and has a great comical light scene at the end. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 8 out of 10. <br /> <br />
