I certainly have not seen all the films of Jean Rollin, but they seem to be naked vampire women, which, if you like that sort of thing, not bad, but this is a big change and can be almost Cronenberg without biology. mechanical nightmare things. Except that it's in French with subtitles, of course. A man driving on the road at night comes across a woman in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up, while in the background yet another woman endures, wearing nothing. While driving, it is obvious that there is something wrong with the woman, in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen. Still, that does not stop the man having sex with her when he returns to Paris and his apartment. The man leaves for work and some strangers appear in his house and take the woman to this 'tower block', a huge building called the Black Tower, where others of its kind (for whom things 'out of memory' seems to be the problems) are being held for some reason. Time and events mark the film, which involves mostly trying to figure out what's going on and getting out of the building for this woman, and she manages to call Robert, the guy who got her first, to come rescue her from it. The revelation about what is happening comes in the last moments of the movie, which has a strange and touching ending. In avoiding what appeared to be his "typical" formula, Rollin created, in that sense, what I feel to be his most fascinating and disturbing film. I really like this, check it out. 8 out of 10.
