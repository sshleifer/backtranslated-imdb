I saw this movie on September 19, 2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. The Beagle is just in a couple of short flashbacks, the whole thing is about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1859 when he was housed in Kent with his growing family, over 200 pages of Origin had already been worked out and he was wondering if he should complete the book. <br /> <br /> The script is based on the book by Randal Keynes, Annie's Box (Annie, Charles's daughter, died when she was 10). It's mostly family drama, but it includes sex scenes - however, the participants are married both on and off the screen. Not very exciting, little science, but a well made movie that is nice to see and squeezes the right emotional buttons. A bit of a romantic weepie, actually. I suppose the conclusion is that you can be a free-thinking agnostic scientist from an atheist family background and still be an emotional romantic as well as an excellent parent. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters and Darwin himself say or wonder if he "killed god", but the viewer is able to doubt it. What is undoubtedly given the deadly struggle for survival and the web of predation in the meadow (well known before Darwin and completely uncontroversial) and the failure of Darwin's prayers is that the idea of ​​a kind of providential god who loves "his" creatures are unsustainable. <br /> <br /> I do not really see many Americans objecting much to this. Some may have issues with the title, which is probably the most controversial thing in the movie, or the fact that Bettany has no horns, tails, and forks.
