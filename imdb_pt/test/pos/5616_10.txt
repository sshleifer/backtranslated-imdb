Although many audio recordings of great musicians such as Jascha Heifetz survive, the cinematographic or television record is really limited. That's why musical offerings like "They Shall Have Music" are such rare gems. While with modern eyes and ears one can argue about the plot, the perceptive viewer must put the unique delights of this film in its correct perspective. The plot was designed to appeal to the young and old audience of the era, but remains pleasing to this day. An important aspect of the experience of watching classic films is to see them through the eyes of the viewer of that era. <br /> <br /> I must criticize the critic who complains about a black-and-white film, or who feel compelled to report that his students express these reservations. These are juvenile complaints that reflect a limited historical perspective. For the teacher, this should offer an educational opportunity to explain the unique qualities of black and white photography and its place in film history. Color can, in fact, disrupt a good story or music. For example, John Ford's "Stagecoach" black and white photography is, like the photographs of Ansel Adams, an artistic work of art. <br /> <br /> As for Heifetz being made of wood, I could not disagree more. If you want a blatant emotional stance, go to a rock show. The role of a classical musician like Heifetz is to move the audience, not him or herself. Heifetz's emotion is conveyed through his play, not through his body language. He had a rare ability to extract all the emotional nuances of the song and transfer it to his listeners. It is the listener that must be moved, not the artist. In fact, one critic asked about seeing Heifetz on YouTube playing the first movement of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto with Frank McHugh in the audience. This is the 1947 film "Carnegie Hall" and not "They Shall Have Music". "Carnegie Hall" is an even greater treasure of many great classical artists in their primacy. We are blessed to have movie producers who, at least in these limited cases, have chosen to show these artists. In was still an era not totally overwhelmed by the gut of lowest common denominator we have today.
