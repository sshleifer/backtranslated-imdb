Klaus Kinski appeared in a considerable number of spaghetti westerns throughout the 60's and early 70's; he was often scaled up into minor parts as unpleasant villains. Kooky Klaus succeeds in a juicy role as Crazy Johnny Laster, a sloppy, distracted, and insane sexual maniac who comes up with a plan to kidnap a lovely heiress in order to get his handsome inheritance. Johnny and his gang become wanted fugitives after the plan goes disastrously wrong. Writer / director Mario Costa skillfully manufactures a sordid portrait of an extremely ill-regarded and ill-finished work: the plot unfolds at a steady pace, the tone is appropriately somber and serious, and the thrilling action scenes are staged with actual scenes . skill and brio (the quarry shootings are especially exciting and exciting). Ironically dressed in white, dripping oily charisma from every rotten pore, and jumping into pretty women with every chance he has, Kinski's Johnny creates an extremely scary and creepy animal. Kinski is simply spectacular as this gloriously repulsive character; he receives the support of the exuberant Gabriella Giorgelli as the sweet and impetuous singer Juanita, Steven Tedd as the merry Riccardo, Giovanni Pallavicino as the relentless leader of the Machete gang, Giuliano Raffaella as the clever lawyer Gary Pinkerton, and Paolo Casella as the sensible partner of Johnny, Glen. Kudos are also in order for Stelvio Cipriani is temperamental and witty. Worth seeing for Kinski fans.
