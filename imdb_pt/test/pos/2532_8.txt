I have been studying Brazilian cinema since 2004, when I stumbled on "Cidade de Deus / Cidade de Deus". Let me tell you something, this movie is probably as good or better than "City of God". <br /> <br /> Acting, cinematography and musical supervision make this film a unique experience. I have not been to Brazil yet, but this film presents the harsh reality that is being faced by the citizens of SÃ£o Paulo. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if you like a good movie. This movie is disturbing and you may feel a little discouraged after watching it. <br /> <br /> Something you want to watch, but nothing that you want to sleep.
