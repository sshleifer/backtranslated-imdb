The eXistenZ movie is about a futuristic video game in a "pod" system that is almost like virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged when an assassination attempt is made on the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Unless it can be repaired, the many years and $ 38 million spent on development will all be wasted. The only way to repair the game, however, is to enter the game with the only person she can trust (Jude Law). This movie was very good, but it does not really arrive until very late in the movie. The best thing about this movie was the twists at the end. Definitely worth seeing. 7/10
