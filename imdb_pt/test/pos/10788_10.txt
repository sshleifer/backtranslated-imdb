Talk Radio, of course, is probably not the best-known of Stone's films, but do not let that put you off, this movie is ready to be discovered, I challenge anyone not to get caught up in it. Along with the best 80s movie performance by Eric Bogosian, for me (along with JFK) this remains Stone's best moment. Stone does not seem to comment much on this nowadays and has not made comments from a director on DVD like all his other films. Stone has nothing to be ashamed of, most directors would kill to take a chance on a movie like this. The studio's claustrophobia is intense and Champlain's views are still crucial arguments for today. The "legalize all drugs" speech is powerful and you can agree with it. In my opinion, the movie is about freedom of speech and how sometimes people do not like to hear things they do not agree with. The speeches and conversations with the listeners are very attractive, even disturbing, a shiver ran down my spine when a madman calls Champlain saying that he has to rape again because the town drives him crazy is utterly shocking. The tension is sometimes unbearable with a scene when Heavy metaller Kent becomes unbalanced, of course, Champlain does not favor himself by ridiculing him. Champlain (or should I say Bogosian) is fearless in the movie and performance, totally hypnotizing, a shame th @ Bogosians another great role was the villain in Under Siege 2 (god dear !!) A scene th @ did not sound true was when The boss of Barry, Dan (Alec Baldwin) makes him calm down, Barry does not seem to be the kind of person to shut up and does what he says, he seemed a bit artificial and clich√©d. The scenes outside the studio are criticized for being too stereotyped, it's true because Stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and allow the viewer to see the beginning of Champlain, but it does not work entirely. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliantly cinematic film with extreme close-ups, deep focus, extremely fast cuts and a fantastic 360 set that is used for the ultimate breathtaking monologue. Must see the cinema, it becomes rare because it was ignored at the time, but now is receiving attention again, what it deserves. A classic should be studied by generations of film students. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for inventive use of "Bad To The Bone" before T2, brilliant supporting cast including John C Mcginley (Dr Cox of Scrubs) as the despicable Stu, Leslie Hope (24) as Champlains girlfriend, John Pankow and Alec Baldwin as the Micheal suits and Wincott who plays three roles (a very underrated actor), the tension between the hearers and Champlain who is very heart-racing @ times and of course praise for the Bogosian stars and Stone for such a fantastic piece of cinema. Appreciate!
