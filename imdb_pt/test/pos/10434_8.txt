The Last American Virgin (1982) was one of the few teenage comedies I really enjoyed. The subject matter and acting were well above the usual complaint that Hollywood was (and still is) functioning nowadays. But for a while, the smaller studios were producing teen movies that were not softened or softened for the kids. The men who pull the strings behind this production were from his Cannon friends. <br /> <br /> Three teenage friends are trying to lose their virginity while still in high school. They will do anything to achieve the goal of their dreams. The sensitive group (Andrew Monsoon), which is to find the right girl, while their two best friends will catch what they can. One day, the kid finds his perfect girl (Diane Franklin). But fate would play one of his dirty tricks. Your best friend moves on and pulls you off your feet. After knocking her down, the sensitive kid helps the girl get up and pays for the abortion. He still has feelings for her and tries to win his heart. Meanwhile, her best friend has a very violent fall for having impregnated her dream girl. Still, he tries his best for her to love him. The night comes when he asks her the question. But his heart is shattered when he sees her dancing with his ex-best friend. In tears, the boy leaves the party. <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie was that it did not punch. Instead of being filled with fake situations, it was very realistic, honest and brutal. The movie is full of funny moments and hysteria. I have to recommend this movie to fans of teenage comedies. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
