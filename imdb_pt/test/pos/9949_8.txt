I remember running home from school almost every day to get KTLA Channel 5 monsters, but I never rushed home faster than when this movie was scheduled. Somehow, the idea of ​​being a boy and having a giant robot as a friend attracted me in a very unique way. Of course, I pretended to be Spider-Man, Batman and other superheroes, but I really wanted to be Johnny Sakko about any of them. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie in 30 years and I still remember it vividly. Who can forget the way the Giant Robot fired missiles from his fingers! Or how about the way Ghuillotene played his fingernails to make explosions! Wow, I can still whistle to the theme song that plays at the end, which is so tragic that I remember crying several times to sleep! <br /> <br /> Just another movie has the kind of magic that this movie does in my mind and this is the Wizard of Oz. But I've seen this movie many times since I was a kid. Of course the Wizard of Oz is a true classic, while the Voyage Into Space is a low-budget nonsense. These two films should not even be mentioned in the same sentence, but for a kid they are not the high production or continuity values ​​that capture your heart, your flying monkeys and giant robots! <br /> <br /> Q. My cousin used to make a very accurate impression of the Giant Robot (he said "Giant Robutt"). If you remember, the Giant Robot had a particular way of firing his missiles and my cousin was cold. I made him repeat the routine infinitely for my personal enjoyment.
