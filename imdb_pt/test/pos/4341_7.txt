LOL. <br /> <br /> The simple fact that I start my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and yet I felt the foolishness of it all. The low budget, the horrible acting and the lame script were already apparent at the time. I watched it again yesterday and just could not stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. As another reviewer put it, he does not take himself seriously. There is no way anyone can see this movie and say that the manufacturers did it. The soundtrack is so funny, I laugh every time I hear. The "climax" is just a riot of laughter. It's a war zone in New York, full of explosions and total chaos ... so ridiculous that you can not help but laugh when you see it. <br /> <br /> Other hilarious moments: <br /> <br /> The scene with Kersey and the cop running side by side like two cowboys all over the Old West was so corny that it was funny. <br /> <br /> - It killed me like the bad guys could be shooting at Kersey and he could even fall on one knee, having a goal so ever careful (and slow) and not being hit LMAO. Of course, with him was a shot-a kill with his LOL elephant weapon. Another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the gang leader .... with a rocket launcher lol ... destroying the entire side of the building with him. <br /> <br /> - It is apparent that Kersey is accustomed to losing loved ones ... when her new girlfriend is quickly dismissed after only a few dates. The acting is so bad that you can not blame anyone who just might think that Kersey is mad at the destruction of the car rsrsrs ... he runs down, looks at the carnage and just goes away. <br /> <br /> Again, so bad, it's good. <br /> <br /> *** out of stars ****.
