This film was marketed extremely well. When it was released in 1997, in the midst of Master P's fame and success, anything and everything with his name was selling on the shelves. That's why it's no wonder that this underground urban drama has sold more than 250,000 copies and still continue. <br /> <br /> If you are a No Limit fan at the time or even have already taken a look. He has some old videos and will not let me start with the extravagant and extravagant Ice Cream Party bonus strippers. So what I have to say to all people who do not like Master P or No Limit Records do not watch because it's not for you and do not bother voting for it because you're just going to dissuade TRU without limit fans from renting or buying this video with your low votes.
