This is a cute little movie that provides very well what it promises - some good entertainment. After all, when a movie proclaims that it features the best SASS shooters, you have to understand that it is not a likely Oscar nominee for "Best Picture." These guys are snipers, not actors. His next clue is that the movie does not have star Nicholas Cage or Jennifer Aniston, meaning you should not expect to see the hottest names today. It was meant to be just old entertainment and in that sense, it is as good as many of the old oaters I have seen over the years. <br /> <br /> So, what do you get with "Hell to pay"? You have 100 minutes of good old entertainment. You get a chance to see some stars from years past, which act much like what they did at their peak, but a little older. You get to see some good SASS shooters in main roles and some SASS hams in the background. It was a lot of fun for me to see people I photographed with, visited in their homes and who are my good friends to do something that many people only dream about - they are real, honest movie. They are doing something that many would-be actors and aspiring snipers will never get a chance to do, and I think it's worth it. <br /> <br /> It's true that not everyone is a member of SASS, so I've seen a lot of fun and humor that others may miss, but it's still good, old-fashioned entertainment, and frankly there are a lot of movies in the theater now that I would not give a penny to see, so save the money to go see "Brokeback Mountain" get "Hell to Pay" and watch some real cowboys have some fun.
