Let me just say - I love the horror genre as far as I see each one I can put into my hands independently (except quality horrors b-low quality movie I could live without) and recently I became a big fan of Eastern Horrors. Little did I know that a Korean horror would be at the top of my list, beating heavyweights like the Japanese Ringu (or the American Ring), or even quality American movies like Sixth Sense and The Others, and the widely acclaimed Hong The terror of Kong, 'The Eye'. Formerly 'The Ring' had been my favorite horror, but it seems to me that I prefer the beauty of 'The Tale of Two Sisters' any day - the story is extraordinary and quite open to interpretations , allowing for repeated views, although chances are you'll want to watch it over and over, simply because the movie is filmed masterfully ... the story is probably one of the best of the genre to date. The acting is also top-notch from the whole cast and the scares when they come in have the potential to shock you like anything inside the Ring - I found myself stuck on the screen at those spots unable to take my eyes off. <br /> <br /> I'm still glad that you did not come back to haunt me later than Sadako / Samara did of the Ring - after all these feelings are unpleasant and The Tale of Two Sisters leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling, but which, I hope, will not leave you sleepless, but it will leave you satisfied that you have seen something very special. But remember .. if you do not understand the plot after the first preview, a repeat view is more than advised .. I personally do not have time for this since it was late, so I leafed through scenes on the DVD, some often until I had a good synopsis in my head and after searching the net, it seemed that I had agreed on the widely accepted interpretation. And the satisfaction of solving such a puzzle is wonderful. <br /> <br /> In all - a magically crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same level remake (it was purchased by Dreamworks) simply because of Korean content and everyone is advised to take it in theaters or DVDs as long as they can ... is one of the best you will get. Unfortunately, because of the kind of movie it is, there's no way to talk about the story without spoilers, so it's best to do what I did - watch it without knowing a single thing, except for the 'tale of two sisters'! And be prepared for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time.
