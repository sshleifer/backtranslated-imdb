Cassie (Sandra Bullock) is a hyper-serious police detective. As an ex-boyfriend once tried to kill her and, in fact, left her severely injured, she is determined to bring those who harm others to justice. As a result of her near-death experience, too, Cassie favors one night and trusts no one. One day, a woman is found dead in the woods near the Cassie community. She was cruelly murdered, beaten and left to die alone. Of course, Cassie will stop at nothing to find the killers. Assigned to assist her is fellow officer, Sam (Ben Chaplin). He soon discovers Cassie's relentless attitude and instincts of consumption when she asks him to get a vomit sample that was left on-site for analysis, among other actions. The track soon takes them to two high school students, Richard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt). Could these teenagers really be responsible for planning and executing the perfect murder of "joy"? This is an intriguing movie, but viewers should be warned that the subject matter is really bleak. Killing for "sport" is rarely the theme of films that are of the "all sweetness and light" variety and this is no different. That said, the cast is great. Bullock, without a hint of his talent for comedy, is fantastic as the cop whose own past compels him to arrest the evil people of the world. Chaplin is also very good as the detective who is attracted and repelled by the strong Cassie. As for Gosling, he makes a memorable performance as a brilliant mind with a satanic soul. The production values ​​for the film are also good, with suitably fine costumes, settings and photographs. If you are a fan of Bullock looking for a laugh, this is not the only one for you. But if you love mysteries, even those with the darkest of plots, you will find this story captivating.
