I felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for Eleanor Bergstein. The lead actors (Campbell Scott, Jennifer Beals, Yancy Butler, James Goodwin III, Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron) were very well selected and played their part with excellence. It was a very uplifting film that I would like to be available on tape or DVD. A rare gem.
