The copy of this movie that I saw is not very good. It is grainy and almost has no color in some parts. He switches between English and French, often in the middle of the sentence, and sometimes even in the middle of a word! To make things worse, there are no English subtitles during the French parts which I think make up at least a quarter of the film. But surprisingly, the film is still very understandable and enjoyable even in this condition, and I think that says a lot about how well-made this film is. <br /> <br /> This is a spaghetti top western line with great acting, an interesting storyline and an excellent soundtrack. He also has a cool protagonist, a cute girl with dark hair, some strange characters and events, and a general feeling of melancholy. This movie has "Euro" written all over the place. <br /> <br /> I hope there is a negative or impression of this movie somewhere, because it deserves a quality DVD release, and when I leave, I will be one of the first in line to get it!
