I read the book written by Bill Carter that this movie is based on for many years. The book is certainly stronger than the movie. It provides more detail than a movie can provide, the end result is that I thought the movie looked a bit sketchy on a handful of items. All things considered, however, and given the limitations of the medium, the film provides a totally entertaining and informative account of the battle between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early '90s to host "The Tonight Show" after Johnny Carson retired. <br /> <br /> The highlight is clearly performance. I can not think of a performance more difficult for an actor than in playing a character who is still alive and well-known and on TV regularly. John Michael Higgins played the role of Letterman perfectly. Watching him was like watching Letterman. Daniel Roebuck tried bravely to be Jay Leno, but somehow he did not do so effectively. His whole "look" looked fake, and he just did not look natural on paper. In a less central role, Rich Little did not surprisingly hit Carson's voice, though the look was a bit wrong. In the book, the most interesting of the central figures was probably Leno's agent, Helen Kushnick. In the film, Kathy Bates was perfect on paper, though not as out of control as Carter's portrait of the woman in writing. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a light and fun sight. The subject is not especially important in the general scheme of things, but it is fun behind the scenes to look for a memorable moment in the entertainment industry. 7/10
