Sometimes, but very rarely, a movie tells a story so well that it almost becomes difficult. This movie tells several stories so well at the same time as it was the first few times I could not watch the conclusion. It was very real ... and the characters so strong that watching it became a personal struggle. Seeing these three men and their families deal with their difficulties, one in particular, often struck me with great force. Now I have watched in its entirety without interruption several times, and I realize what I have always suspected. This movie is a work of art. The writing, the acting, the mixing of several stories without being a bit agitated, everything about this movie is exceptional. Seven Academy Awards? No wonder, certainly must have deserved.
