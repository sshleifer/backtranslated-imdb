You have to like baseball, and you have to at least like Tom Selleck, but if you meet these criteria, you should fully enjoy this movie. Selleck plays the former major league star who is traded (?) For Japan while his career ends. Really well thought out and fascinating look at Japanese customs and behavior. Great supporting performances by Selleck's manager ("Clint Eastwood of Japan"), his girlfriend Takanashi and his interpreter. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanashi works great, this is really a very good romantic movie, besides baseball. Look for Haysbert as a teammate well before becoming a stubborn persistent for Allstate. The movie ends very well. Easily in my top fifty all time movies and maybe my favorite in baseball.
