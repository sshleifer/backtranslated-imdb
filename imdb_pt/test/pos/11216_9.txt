In this episode, Locke and Eko will look for the "?" symbol that we saw during the blockade in an earlier episode. Michael, having shot at Ana Lucia and Libby, struggles with his actions while Libby is closer to death. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this episode (I think). It is during the commercial break. Locke and Eko find a hatch under the plan that killed Boone in the first season, and a new training video ends with "Copyright, The Hanso Foundation, 1989" In a following commercial, a rather bizarre and anonymous commercial announces "The Hanso Foundation" (a planted ad), and the site announced (www.sublymonal.com) takes the visitor through a world of information about life outside the history of LOST. A must see for all fans!
