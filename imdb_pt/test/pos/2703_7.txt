Yes, this is one of the best television movies and I would not expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a big fan of The Carpenters, I started singing all their material in elementary school and high school choir and I managed to make a lot of the solo material that Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the '70s - and being a child / teenager singing these songs and learning music - the only thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman. I never got it, she died three weeks before that happened. And yes, it affected me because I did not know anything about anorexia - and I could not fully understand what happened. <br /> <br /> When this TV movie was produced, I understood it very well. Maybe not everything in the life of Karen and Richard is open to the television audience, but by opening the parts that were shown, I was able to understand much of the music industry of the time. What bothers me is that I am writing "of this time" and seeing "now". Nobody has learned a brave thing, even if that is a very informative and candid look at a family's problems in the music industry. <br /> <br /> These movies are not made for fun, they are meant to open a door and show us something. Here was a wonderful woman who became involved in the idea that her talent was based on weight. She was fine. I did not know that. She received mixed messages about her brother's weight she loved, the parents she loved, and the music industry that cared more about her looks than her talent. With the start of MTV, it got worse. With 'American Idol' it's like a purulent pussy in an English accent. <br /> <br /> A wonderful TV movie, I'm sure someone can do an HBO treatment, but in any case, many lessons to be learned and absence of another wonderful talent.
