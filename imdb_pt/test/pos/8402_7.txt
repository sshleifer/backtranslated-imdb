I'm a big fan of Gone With the Wind, and I read "Scarlett" before it was a miniseries and I loved it. This is a sequel to sorts. As you did not expect with that ending "Frankly dear, I do not give a damn." Timothy Dalton was great as Rhett, though no one ever replaced Clark Gable. Joann Whaley-Kilmer, on the other hand, could give Vivien Leigh a chance for her money (although I feel almost guilty for saying it). Your attitude and presence in the film fit the character, making you love and hate her. at the same time, that's how most feel about Leigh's portrait as well. The film moves slowly, mainly because it follows the book closely and was not released as a feature film. Excellent choice by the producer. I think this film deserves some recognition for the great story, the rebirth of characters that were gone almost 50 years ago, and for being something even Margaret Mitchell herself could be proud of.
