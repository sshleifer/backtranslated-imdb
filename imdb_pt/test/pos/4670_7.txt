Do not film to see if you want to be intellectually stimulated. If you want to have lots of fun in the theater, this is the one. Lots of small talk (and some really cheesy pranks too). Mos Def and Seth Green are very funny as the comic relief. Exciting and creative assaults and chase scenes. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron are sexy tracks. And Donald Sutherland!
