I saw this mini-movie when it first aired, and I loved it! It's kind of funny to see where people go for money. It's also funny to see how much a boyfriend can be "whipped." "Whipped" enough to kill. I think the cast was great, especially the character Kristin. Without his soft speech, and it seems misleading the movie would not have been the same. <br /> <br /> I've never used to watch USA, but now it's one of my seasons. <br /> <br />
