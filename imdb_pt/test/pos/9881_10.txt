A hilarious comedy by the best director of all time, Oz Scott. The list of 80's TV icons continues. (Who is the boss), Yothers (family ties), Stone (Mr. Belvedere), Robinson (Court of the night), Jackee (227), D'abo (Wonder Years), Walston . It's one of the funniest movies of all time. Big lines, meaningless subplots, cheesy, bad acting. This is a group of high school kids who need to pass on driver education. Night Court Mac needs them to pass the final exam, or he will be fired. Great performance by Brian Bloom as the stupid and cool guy Riko Conner, but it's nothing compared to B.D. Kiki de Wong (pronounced kee-chee). A great movie for all ages, so bad it's good.
