This movie is the most moving and funny movie I've seen in a long time. As a housewife (fan) and fan (Rupert), I thought she was nice. Anyone who misunderstands Dirk's angry outburst is wrong. Kathy Bates is not really an actress I know of, but she's perfect, the whole cast is perfect for her roles. Julie Andrews put me in stitches. I'm watching after reading Rupert's self-biography, so her inclusion was even more fun. Sometimes it's terribly moving. I'm not really a fan of the kind of music in the movie, but you get excited about romance and find you're singing the songs for days. This movie deserves to be more widely available. scene involves Dirk and a gun and his pants, watch and see!
