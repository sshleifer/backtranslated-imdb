I thought this was a beautiful movie. Not my favorite of your movies - Chungking Express holds that point - this is quite unlike anything else I've seen of it. is slow (but not annoyingly) - takes your time and ponders the characters. There is minimal movement in the frame - the camera work is wonderful. the acting is great. the film looks like a long, comforting drink.
