Although this is a nice and enjoyable cartoon, they did much better later, like the Carrotblanca. This is almost like the first feature of Star Trek, it would have been received with open arms and joy, no matter what, just by existing. This is actually a patchwork of old bits with some nice touches but nothing special. Remind me a bit of the trilogy of point hunting and the end is invaluable. Available and certainly worth watching just for the novelty and the good bits. Recommended.
