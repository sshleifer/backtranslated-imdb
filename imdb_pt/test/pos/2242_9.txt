Okay, so there was a weird hole in the plot that you could run a zeppelin, but how well did the emotional material get treated? It would have been so easy to get into a fight, but the writer succeeded. The image of the ex-cyber woman making screams as she saw her reflection after regaining her emotions is one that will stay with me forever. That's twice now, the monsters showed a soft side and were presented fleetingly sympathetically, the previous being the last Dalek of the one series, but by Jove it worked. Add to that the other ex-wife who had been "refreshed" the day before her wedding, and Jackie Tyler acknowledging her husband after she became "cyber" and you have a permanent throat lump. Keeps!
