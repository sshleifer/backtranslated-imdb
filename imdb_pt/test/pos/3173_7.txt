It surprises me that of all the reviews I've looked at, nobody seems to have noticed one of the main points of this movie, or at least how I've seen it. It looks like a great homosexual fantasy, camp clothing, a glorified naked Ferdinand, a sexual tension defined between Ariel and Prosper, and as a final climax, a group of men in tight sailor robes dancing the hornpipe. This whole approach, once you get used to it, provides all sorts of great scenes and images. The sight of an innocent Ariel being pulled into a disgusting nude Sycorax to perform "his terrible and abominable commands" is one of the darkest I've ever seen in a Shakespeare movie. However, by the end of the movie, I had grown tired of the style and the final dance of the hornpipe was too much to take. Still in general is an interesting interpretation of the play.
