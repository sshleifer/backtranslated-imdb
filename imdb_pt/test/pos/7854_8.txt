Probably this is Clint Eastwood's best movie. Here the action is minimal, but with good performance. A Yankee Eastwood soldier is wounded and taken away by schoolgirls and schoolgirls in the south where he is hidden and cared for. Shortly after her recovery, all the ladies wanted to have fun with him, and some of them were successful including the school principal (Geraldine Page). Erotic scenes are coming in until the ladies discovered that their "male" was shared by several of them, so they became furious and poisoned him at a farewell dinner. Geraldine Page, though somewhat old, managed to play a very suggestive role as head of the school, a woman with more failures than happiness in her life.
