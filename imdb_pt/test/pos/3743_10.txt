Oh yes! Hollywood recalls how to use the good old formula, and when a lightning strikes, it feels wonderful. Rarely does Hollywood create a masterpiece because lately there seems to be more concern in rushing and getting the most rewards in a hurry, or there is the question of many cooks in the mix. Generally good scripts are the result of a talented writer who is in total control of his property, understands his material and is a good writer. So there's a small, important part often overlooked by marketing geniuses who so often lack creativity and vision: a good actor. <br /> <br /> A good actor can make the difference between a mediocre and half-cooked attempt. and a fully realized film that may not be an important and relevant film but that contributes to its genre and may eventually become such a classic. We get very few romantic comedies and we are people hungry for them. Buried in the sexy humor of "Sex in the City" is the romantic but stormy relationship of Big and Carrie, and people flocked to "Mamma Mia" because they had some romance, cleverly played by Streep and Brossnam. It could have a silly musical, but it touched us because it was played with intensity and conviction. "Nights" offers us more, with the incredible talents of a woman who does a magnificent job in romantic films, Ms. Diane Lane. From his days as a child actor, we could appreciate how his talent, combined with his appreciative soul, allowed us to see the heart of the protagonists of the story. A few years ago, she joined Mr. Gere, giving us a tormented, romantic and sexy performance as the wife who is not very sure of the consequences of her actions on "Unfaithful," work that should have earned at least one Academic Award. She is back, doing a more formidable job in this romantic gem as a woman who has given up on her romantic outlook, and suddenly she realizes there may be another chance around the corner. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lane makes this movie pulsate with intelligence and passion. Your facial expressions communicate volumes about the different emotions your character suffers. We can read frustrations, yearnings, despair, anger, hope, loss and a reach that is out of reach for many of the marketable types that Hollywood constantly pushes down our throats. Here is a mature artist who has the gift of projecting real emotions and allows us to connect with the material in such a way that we are moved as we become part of the experience. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lane is such a triumphant joy to behold when she undergoes transformations from the first scenes of the film to the end. Her discoveries become ours as we celebrate with her the power of hope and love. She is able to bring back the unsurpassed joy of a passionate person, much like a teenager's, and yet she never lets you think of her character as foolish or irresponsible. His eyes are expressive gems that can move even the cynic in the audience. She is one of the stars that can do wonders with just one look. In it the classic feel of those great movies of yesterday are back. Her work recalls the intelligent and passionate work of Hepburn, Davis, Garson, women who played everyday types and made them memorable because they created complete characters. <br /> <br /> We admire these excellent actresses who recreate real life legends and are rewarded for it. Half of their work is done by the mystique of the figures they embody; however, as much as anyone can make you think, it's the roles like Lane in that movie that are a most impressive achievement because they are created from scratch, receive a personal brand and are able to reach heights without any previous material support such as as parts of theater, and the background of a famous legend whose life is honored on the silver screen. Lane's character is a woman whose experiences can be any of us. It represents our dreams and emotions with a lot of quality, class and the right amount of feelings. It is a remarkable achievement, and we should be thankful that we are still able to find such a remarkable performance today. <br /> <br /> There are some adjectives that I could use to honor your work, but I can only say that in my humble opinion, every picture of your work in this film is the testament to one of the greatest performances ever made in celluloid by a live interpreter. Thank you, Miss Lane.
