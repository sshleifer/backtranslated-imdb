I saw this movie tonight on a preview and it was fantastic. He does well in portraying issues that the average high school student is subjected to. <br /> <br /> I left the film feeling shocked and saddened and yet grateful that this film has a chance to raise awareness through its audience about such issues (bullying, rape, suicide and depression) . <br /> It's a fantastic Australian movie. <br /> <br /> Go ahead. <br /> <br /> Support him. <br /> <br /> Learn from him.
