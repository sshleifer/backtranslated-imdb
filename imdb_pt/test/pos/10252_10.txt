Cooley High was actually a comedy drama. It was a reflection of life in high school in the past. I attended Coolidge High in Washington, DC from 1976 to 1979 and much of what was on Cooley High was one thing every day at Coolidge. In fact, after the film was released, everyone started calling Coolidge "Cooley High". Getting stoned, tossing dice, chasing girls, basement parties and fights, this sums up high school life for many in DC in the past. I can not forget Motown because Motown music started and ended many times in the 70's. The successes kept coming. However, Cooley High adds a layer of humanity on the madness because when all was said and done, just like in Cooley High my colleagues and I had a lot of love for each other. And like the characters in Cooley High, there was life after high school, but there was nothing like waking up every morning and trying every day to the fullest from the first to the seventh period. Thirty years later, we are preparing to celebrate these good times. Cooley High is definitely a period piece that only improves over time because, like it or not, the only thing left of those days are memories, some good and some bad.
