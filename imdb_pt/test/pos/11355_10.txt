It's easy to see why many people consider In the Mood for Love the best Wong Kar-Wai movie. The faded appeal of the film, centered on the studied view of a relationship through an emotional touch, is a retread for the Happy Together territory, but without the hyperkinetic patchwork of dissonant film stocks and hyper- have become trademarks. of the Kar-Wai films since the Chungking Express. Like Soderbergh's The Limey, this is a different kind of curiosity for Kar-Wai; where dialogue and plot are abandoned by humor and composition in order to create a tale of two delicate lives in an apparently confining emotional stasis. <br /> <br /> It is a testament to Kar-Wai's genius that he is able to make such a simple tale that it resonates. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move alongside each other inside the same building. He is a journalist who dreams of publishing martial arts novels and she is the secretary of a shipping company. His final engagement is obvious from the beginning, but the pleasure here is the way Kar-Wai ambiguously paints such a journey with his great masters. <br /> <br /> The key to the success of the film is the use of Kar-Wai. of inner space, playing with foreground and background plans in ways similar to Polanski's works. During the first half of the film, Kar-Wai isolates Leung and Cheung in a way that the second person in a conversation is never visible. Kar-Wai is concerned about the environment and space here, creating a tight emotional dynamic between his characters. He is also saying that Kar-Wai never chooses to focus on the physicality of the Mo-Wan and Li-zhen spouses. Their faceless partners are notably absent from the film, as they are taking care of their own love affairs with one another. <br /> <br /> This is not to suggest that In the Mood for Love is a confining experience because Kar-Wai manages to flood his movie with great splashes of movement and hypnotic camera sound. There is a scene in which the slow and sensual rise of Cheung on a metaphorical staircase becomes the descent of Leung down the same staircase; his movements complement each other perfectly, reserving the scene and creating a sense of erotic duality between the two figures. Their souls have connected but have not yet physically joined. The erotic shift of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating, as two lovers of stars reject the physical consummation because of their humble fidelity. <br /> <br /> Other scenes from the film are punctuated by brief scenes in slow motion by Cheung. moving erotically through its inner surroundings, glimpsed the astonishingly beautiful trail of Mike Galasso. Cheung's dresses beautifully complement her outer space as she slowly moves around. His movements slowly accumulate in what appears to be an inevitable fusion between Li-szhen and his dream lover, although the seduction process seems to be totally subconscious. <br /> <br /> If I make it look like these two characters are more like two birds triggering pheromones in each other, it's probably not such an absurd statement. The close bond these two characters have with their inner spaces is almost as intense as their relation to the exteriors. The film rarely moves into outer space, and when the camera does this, it usually peaks through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals. Kar-Wai continues to tease us, even as lovers get close enough to touch, destroying the closeness of the couple, tossing them through mirrors or through gaps inside pieces of clothing located inside a closet. Mother Nature really seems to respond to her desire for love, often triggering a gentle shower of rain on the characters after their bodies approached. The shots of a Karung Wai waterfall allowed Leung's Lai Yu-Fai to experience a cathartic launch at Happy Together even though Leslie Cheung's Ho Po-wing was not there to enjoy it. At the end of the film, love was so inextricably linked to the act of war that a third man's love statements signaled Yu-Fai's perception that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if it did not bring him back. lover. Mo-Wan's journey ends within the confines of a ruined temple. His own emotional exhaustion parallels the political climate of his country, and Li-szhen's absence is only tolerated by the fact that Kar-Wai allows Mo-Wan to experience a kind of relief. Mo-Wan attends to an ancient myth and his secret deliverance in a temple crack leaves him able to live his days with the hope that all his loss and hurt would somehow serve a greater purpose.
