Movie watchers often say that great movies must have 3 memorable scenes to be considered really great. News of transmission does not have three, has twice that. This movie is extremely well written by James Brooks. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never been better. I love this movie for many reasons. It's great because it makes you laugh and makes you cry. Albert Brooks has several great lines and many unforgettable scenes: # 1 (laughed) "I can sing and read, I'm singing while I read," with Midnight Train for Georgia playing in the background. # 2 (laughs) Telling the character of William Hurt that "You really screwed it up," after watching Hurt's report on rape. # 3 (cries) When Aaron (Brooks) finally tells Jayne (Hunter) that he loves her and she can not do away with Hurt's character because it represents <br /> <br /> all about journalism that Jayne discovers. Finally, # 4 (laughs) who can forget the scene in which Aaron <br /> anchors the weekend news ... hilarious. This movie should have won an Oscar! It has everything I love in movies, great acting, clever script, and even a cameo Jack Nicholson!
