I will not bother you with any synopsis, you probably already know them. And I hope you're already familiar with the work of Park Chan-Wook. <br /> <br /> I totally disagree with some of the other commentators saying that "Park did not come out of the blah blah revenge trilogy." Because you know what? He has!!! The revenge trilogy differed in style in a grand style, for starters, how can you compare the melancholy and subtlety of "Sympathy For Mr Vengeance" with the frenzied and extravagant "Oldboy"? Park Chan-Wook has incredible style, but his movies do not share the same style! This has been true and remains true with the release of "Thirst". <br /> <br /> "Thirst" is an incredible image, it literally has everything you want in a movie. Chin-drop violence, good taste gore, great humor, incredible suspense and even very realistic sex scenes. The story is so crazy that in no time you can guess what will happen next. I'm very happy to say that Park is back in his best shape with this fantastic story of love-vampire-comedy of dark humor. Watch as soon as you can!
