Beware My Lovely came from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked to write about frightened women. His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase. He also did a thriller thriller from Loretta Young, Cause For Alarm, a few years earlier. The piece that Dinelli wrote was originally titled The Man and had 92 appearances on Broadway during the 1950 season. It was Dinelli's only effort on Broadway and starred Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. <br /> <br /> The roles that Gish and Boone played were taken over by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For some reason, RKO thought about eliminating the age difference. Dinelli himself rewrote his game to the screen, so I'm wondering what he thought about it. Certainly the question of frailty has been completely eliminated from history. <br /> <br /> That was not the only thing that was eliminated. All people are wearing World War I period clothing, but there is no reference at the time this story happens. I thought it was strange, and later, when the telephone company technician went to Ida Lupino's house, I noticed that his truck was. a crop of the same period. <br /> <br /> The film is almost all set in the home of Ida Lupino, where she hired an odd itinerant in Robert Ryan as a handyman. The film is a great objective lesson in not hiring strangers without reference. It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons Lupino in his house for about a day. <br /> <br /> Both leaders do good deeds even with the changes made. Films like Beware My Lovely are the stuff that a small studio like RKO did best. If this were done at MGM or at Paramount, the bright traps would have surpassed a solid story.
