Chris Noth plays a maniac who wrote a children's book as a young boy posing as a doctor threatening a community in order to push his sister's son into his school's genius position. The only man who can stop him is a policeman who plays by his own rules, and is forced to disguise himself with the help of his mute father who communicates via the oujii board. Will Rick Springfield find out what's going on? Or someone will sabotage your recording studio! Does the mentally retarded kid who runs the mobile book have clues? Watch to find out! I am not making this up!
