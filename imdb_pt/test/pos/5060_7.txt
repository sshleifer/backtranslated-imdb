An American Arab man is kidnapped at an American airport and taken to "somewhere in North Africa," where he is being tortured. The reason? His cell phone received a call from a known terrorist. The CIA decides to avoid legal means to determine if the phone call is implicit in guilt or just an error. After watching this movie, we can just pray that some terrorist does not accidentally hit a wrong number! <br /> <br /> In addition to delivery, there are several related parallel stories. One involves the daughter of the intelligence chief (secret police?) Who is torturing the suspect, and his involvement with the lover who happens to be in the night school of suicide bombers. This story is very invented, but nevertheless intriguing, especially when we see the result. The director uses a timeline switcher to attract the audience. <br /> <br /> The second secondary story is the suspects wife's attempt to find out what happened to her missing husband. She gets an old lover to help. He (a muted Saarsgard) is field helper to a senator (Alda) and soon becomes scared when he realizes that his work is not worth discovering the truth. Witherspoon is wasted in this role. All she can do is look helpless and pregnant, with a brief fit of anger. Streep is good and cold and stereotyped as the government. (CIA? NSA? Homeland Sec?) Officer who appears to be a Cheney clone. <br /> <br /> Gylenhall is also wasted when a minor analyst enters the area where he is exaggerated, although he can do the "right thing" in the end. <br /> <br /> the captivating film, if a bit faint, but I thought it added little to the subject. Certainly not to be seen as definitive, and certainly has a great interest. Like "The Kingdom," he has scratched the surface of a very complicated subject. <br /> <br /> The film strives to give us an idea about surrender, but can only end up being a "cautionary tale" about a failure 1. The goal of surrender is not to "torture" but rather to "suspect" terrorism, "to provide information, avoiding legal (and therefore obstructive) barriers. Torture, of course, can be employed, especially if delivery is out of our hands - though obviously we are not guilty in this matter - but life-saving information is vital in this "gloomy war."
