It's fun to see a young James Cagney doing his thing. He plays the role of man and woman who takes his job very seriously, stepping on the edge of a group of dishonest politicians. It is offered to the world, but maintains its integrity. He is beaten and ridden, but that is the problem. We never know if he's really in danger. They say he's in one place but still seems to have carte blanche to move around and do what he needs to do. Sometimes he's so arrogant that he does not do much to protect himself. His allies are in the police department, but almost everything else is quite corrupt. He perseveres (almost too good to be true), of course, and we pull at him. The problem for me is the lack of sustained suspense. It would have been so much better if he had to clear his name. He never falls into the depths, even when rejected by his wife to be. Still fun with the bad guys imploding. Just watch Cagney do his tough stance.
