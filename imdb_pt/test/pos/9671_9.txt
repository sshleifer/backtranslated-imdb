Seth McFarlane is a true genius. He has created a program that is witty, culturally insightful and simply hilarious. <br /> <br /> For those who find that their 'offensive' involves social or cultural topics does not make any meaningful comment, only causes 'offense', can be pointed to this quote: <br /> <br /> Peter (coming out of the stem cell lab): How long was I there? // Guard: five minutes. // Peter: Why are not we financing this?!? <br /> <br /> Why? <br /> <br /> Thank you, family guy, for not being just the funniest show on TV (with the possible exception of the much loved, much welcomed futurama), but also being too smart to boot.
