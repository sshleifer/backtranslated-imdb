I just saw the movie, it's really very good. The trailers left me with an impression of another Dujardin movie, a spectacle of a man who turned into a movie (Ã  la chartre de Nice) or an expensive and stupid French comedy. Surprisingly, it is neither. Secret Agent OSS 117 is stupid, but at least he knows it, while I always thought James Bond was stupid, but he acted like a smartass. The dialogue is witty with a lot of ironic humor that one would expect from a British film instead of French. The women and the music are beautiful. A refreshing journey into the past, when the bandits were former Nazis or Soviet brutes, the cars were brilliant, and France had colonies!
