In addition to being a clever and well-marketed variation of the currently hugely popular horror genre and a splendid formula for attracting potential new fans overall, I've always considered "Supernatural" a massive tribute to the genre through the decades. Although not always noticeable to younger viewers and / or people who are only interested in more recent horror movies, every episode contains some obvious and subtler references to classic and influential titles. From that point of view, it was only a matter of time before the writers honored the films "scary without a driver" and more specifically, the landmarks of the 1970s "Duel" (Steven Spielberg's acclaimed debut) and "The Car" . Being an avid fan of these two films, I really enjoyed "Route 666", despite its flaws and flaws. The episode opens tense and atmospheric on a remote Missouria road, where a black man is hunted down and eventually killed by a menacing, seemingly unmanned truck behind the wheel. The victim's daughter, Cassie, is Dean's ex-girlfriend and she calls the Winchester brothers for help. The brothers can not avoid two similar "accidents" before they discover that the sudden presence of the ghost truck is related to a racial dispute in the 1960s, involving both Cassie's parents and several other prominent residents of the small town. Some of my fellow reviewers here tend to label "Route 666" as one of the weakest entries in the first season, mainly because the script is very pragmatic in relation to racial issues and shows a different and more emotional side of Dean's character. He is usually the strong and silent type, while here he is confronted with unfinished romantic affairs of the past here. To some extent, I agree with the debate on racism, but this did not really bother me much, actually. The writers eventually had to give an explanation for the presence of the ghost truck, and racial conflict is acceptable as far as I'm concerned. Regarding Dean's emotional vulnerability, I can only say that it is admirable to see how writers continually try to provide depth and detail to the main characters. Dean's behavior toward Cassie casts a new light on him, in fact. In addition, what really counts in this episode is the sinisterly sinister truck and its violent attacks. It is an impressive and overwhelming vehicle, producing dazzling lights and scary noises. If you have adored the brilliant "Duel" mentioned above, you will definitely find some fun in the chase sequences depicted on "Route 666".
