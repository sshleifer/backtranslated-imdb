Return to Me is a charming gem of a movie. With a cast absolutely star studded, who can go wrong with this modern fairy tale? It also includes many, many jokes written by the very own Bonnie Hunt, who wrote and directed this film. David Duchovny is also very good, showing a different approach to his daily alter-ego in my favorite x-file program. A Great Date Movie!
