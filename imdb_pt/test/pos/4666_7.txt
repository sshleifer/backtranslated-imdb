* SPOILER ALERT !! PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE SPOILED MOVIE !! * I was originally thinking about watching this movie last weekend, but my plans eventually made me unable to take the time to see it. So my friend and I made plans to see after school today. Boy, we're glad we did it. The film begins in Italy with a planned hit with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as "Napster" [Seth Green, you'll get the nickname later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], Left Ear [Mos Surdo] and John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) plan an assault to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to the whole opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a boat chase which opens the movie up. While driving in his van, Steve Frezelli links the group, steals the gold and kills John Bridger, who is practically the leader (who is retiring) of the group. Fast for a year later, where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the best safe creatures anyone can ask for. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for his father's death when he called him a retirement pensioner) says that they found Steve (who hid himself), and want to get back to him for what he did. She initially refuses, but then agrees, and the teams come back together, along with the help of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to make the perfect assault while creating one of the biggest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is a perfect blend of action with funny pieces played everywhere. There's a joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who plays a special role) robbed him while he slept, and eventually Lyle will only respond if it's called "Napster." There's even a funny phrase in Seth's movie, which says, "He said in an interview that he called him Napster because he described his hair as if it were a diaper. He said because I was napping when he stole!" The initial and final sequences are pure genius and everything that fits perfectly. The only negative thing I can think of with the film is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He was not a big tough guy. He acted as if he was being paid and only doing the minimum (which is a fact, since he was forced to make that movie because of the contractual obligation). But even with this problem being the only real complaint with the movie, the movie is still very enjoyable, and I definitely recommend watching it. And even if you're not interested in the movie, go see Seth Green shining on the comic. He is perfect. Classification: **** out of *****
