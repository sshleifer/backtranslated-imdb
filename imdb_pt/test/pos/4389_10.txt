They loved him and turned him into a horned toad! God, it hits me every time. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. Memorable lines, "Thank God your mother died at birth; she saw that she died of shame" to "I do not understand, Big Dan." Big scenes, from the opening train scene (I laughed so hard I cried) to the bluegrass. <br /> <br /> Watch. It's good, it's great, it's funny and it's based on a famous story. Worth your time, believe me. Do not watch this if you have a weak bladder because you will definitely wet the pants by laughing.
