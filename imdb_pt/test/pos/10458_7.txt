The film begins almost painfully slowly, a "novel" (yawning) that seems to ramble off course (all part of the plan ...) So about an hour to this solemn movie is the party. It pays to pay attention to this first hour. The party is still solemn but good-humored. Suddenly the withdrawn and slightly stingy characters come to life, and everyone (you AND the characters) comes out feeling enriched by experience. <br /> <br /> Women will love this. Christians of all kinds will appreciate the deep faith shown by the characters. Not my favorite movie of all time - after all, there are no dinosaurs or laser beams - but definitely a movie that I'm happy to have seen. Not to be missed. <br /> Jim
