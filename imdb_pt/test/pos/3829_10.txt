Undoubtedly, one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well-executed suspense, with intelligent parallels from the real world (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was happening between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), punctual characterizations and the introduction of the second most hostile alien race of Star Trek after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is perilously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, though no one has ever seen the flesh. Soon, a Romulan ship appears, carrying a new weapon and a camouflage device that makes it almost impossible to defeat it. Facing the threat of imminent annihilation, Kirk must engage in an intelligence battle with the Romulan commander (Mark Lenard) to ensure the survival of his crew. Sadly, the task is hampered when one of the men accuses Spock of being in alliance with the enemy, due to the physical resemblance between Romulans and Vulcans, two races that are in fact distant relatives (a fact that is quite ironic). in retrospect, given Lenard started to play Sarek's father from Spock starting with Season 2). <br /> <br /> Always very critical when it comes to war, Star Trek enjoys one of its best hours with its most thrilling and tense take on the topic. Although the Romulans are not really based on the Soviets (the name is actually taken from Romulus, the founder of Rome), the setting is obviously inspired by the very vivid fears that American and Russian citizens had at the time any nation could be able of destroying the other with nuclear weapons (this fear gave rise to the concept of "balance of terror"). But even without the subtext, this remains an essential episode, due in large part to the intellectual battle between the two opponents, which translates into a duel between Shatner and Lenard. No need to say who wins ...
