STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an incredibly important film for our movie history. This second Mickey Mouse appearance (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film - mainly because it was so groundbreaking. That's because it was the first sound design. While you still do not hear the Mickey talk, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the movie - something we take for granted now but that was a huge pleasure for everyone in 1928. Now, if this were just an important historical film, it would be worth seeing - especially for animation lovers. However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at just how timely the movie really is. While Mickey and Minnie behave a bit strange compared to the characters we love (thanks mainly to the crazy mind and the talent of the animator Ub Iwerks), there is an infectious charm about the film. It's just lovely to see Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way. Smart and a real pleasure for the public - this movie is still among Mickey's best movies, even after 80 wonderful years.
