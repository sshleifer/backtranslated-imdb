Does anyone know where I could get my hands on this video or the movie for that. I have been looking for a long time to show my daughter to show her and I can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk. <br /> <br /> I saw this from Disney in 1996 and I think it would be the best video to show her. a movie so good that it has every kind of emotion displayed throughout the film. also has many actors who started their careers with this film. If anyone knows how to get a copy of this movie or have a copy and you want to sell it for about $ 50, call 201-566-0148. thank you
