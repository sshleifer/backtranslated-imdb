I think some luxury filmmakers were sitting down drinking juice of absinthe, grappa, aramangac or the jungle on an 80's night during Cannes or another film festival and one of them said, "Hey guys, let's make a movie where every one of us creates a world-class aria segment. " Well ... kind of worked out. Clearly someone was clever enough to select some of the best recordings from the chosen arias, for example Nessun Dorma, from Bjoreling, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD, you would have more than your money's worth. Not every director has succeeded, but more than not, and the film seems to improve with each showing over the years. My favorite is the mysteriously beautiful love duet of Die Todt Statd; okay, a young nude Elizabeth Hurley is eye candy, but the husband singing to her, the ghost of his wife, is incredibly beautiful with the love song losing only to Otello and "Gia nella Notte Densa" from Desdemona throughout the repertoire. Could the movie be better, of course, what could not have not been, but it's worth a vision, especially of you being in a hyper-romantic mood.
