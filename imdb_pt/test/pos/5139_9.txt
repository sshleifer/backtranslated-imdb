Hoot is the movie of a nice young man about a group of high school kids trying to keep a chain of pancake houses intimidating a plot of land that houses some endangered buzzard owls. The acting is very good and the new faces are cool to see. Many well-known comedians are in this movie and keep the mood almost non-stop. It's a movie for young audiences, maybe 5 to 11 years old. I thought it was a nice change of pace from the adult movies that permeate the screen these days. There is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or children. It's just a lot of fun with a constant message on how to save the beautiful places of this country from becoming more developed. If you remember the day you did not fight for a dollar, you may remember that money is not everything. Not many people over 12 will like it unless they have a crush on the old school special series.
