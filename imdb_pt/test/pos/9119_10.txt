I saw this movie in an accident. I was standing on 42nd Street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started distributing free tickets for a preview of this movie. I gave it a shot not expecting much. The promotional movie posters I I have seen on the walls of the subway station do not give this movie justice in everything. <br /> <br /> The film is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metal.I The film is a heavy and very funny comedy. If you're old enough to remember when Heavy Metal dominated the music scene in the 80's, you'll love this movie. Jack Black is an incredibly talented comedian and actor and assuming he actually wrote and performed the songs in this film, he is also a talented musician. <br /> <br /> Tenacious D definitely deserves a look!
