Last days is a very, very independent movie. And compared to many of today's most modern films, it lacks many parts. The shooting seems at times quite amateurish, the dialogues can be a little cut and the characters are not impressively complex. So do not have high hopes for this movie because, as I said, it's very independent. But what is lacking in the concrete aspects of the film can be overlooked because of the charm of the story! I can not say that the plot is exceptionally original, but the story is still beautiful and touching in many ways! It's not about being gay versus being straight, it's about faith and how you decide to run your own life! It's a silly story that makes you want to cry and smile at the same time! So to be honest, the Last Days are far from perfect, but I really loved the movie and I highly recommend it! It is very critical to the religious aspects of our society, and there is homosexuality involved - but approach it with an open mind, and I'm sure most people will enjoy it as much as I do!
