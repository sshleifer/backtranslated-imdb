WHAT AN AWESOME MOVIE !!!!!!!! I left the theater feeling dizzy. The movie I just saw was one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. I had my eyes glued to the screen. It is very symbolic, visually exuberant, beautifully filmed and beautifully told. It's basically about two people moving into an apartment and living side by side with their partners, who are supposed to be having an affair with the other partners. Assuming this, our two heroes represent what they think their partners are facing. There is an obvious repression of feelings for each other, with the use of Victorian camera work, body language, and symbolic stairs. It's a visual feast and hard not to like. Some of the stories get a bit confusing, but that's nothing. The ending is one of the most beautiful (and anti-hollywood) endings I've ever seen in my life, and visually amazing. The haunting score movies enhances the mood. I highly recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and respect. What an excellent movie.
