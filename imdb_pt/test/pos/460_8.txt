Set in Hungary in November 1956, this is the story of a group of foreigners who were trying to leave the country at the time of the revolt. <br /> <br /> Once the airport is closed, the starting journey begins on a bus taking them to Austria. Of course, they are stuck on the way, and that is where they come across the almost impeccable Yul Brynner, whose military power as Major of the Red Army was marked by loneliness, his inner struggle between right and wrong, his quest for truth and your need to feel emotions for other human beings. He was saddened by the fact that his work alienated him from his friends and enemies and yearned for social contact. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley plays the typical upper-mouth Englishman who, no matter how serious the role, can maintain an almost carefree outlook on life while Jason Robards has a stunning film premiere that reinforces why which he has had so many roles throughout his career. Deborah Kerr, as the protagonist, exhibits the grace and femininity that we come to associate with her, but manages to bring the strength and determination necessary for her character. <br /> <br /> The film is about a very stormy time. in the history of Europe, but never fails to remind us that there is something good in all of us and that you can never completely judge a book by its cover. Fabulous screenplays ensure that, despite all the seriousness of the subject, there are still great examples of short phrases and comedians that add to the film, rather than harming it. The chemistry in the game of cat and mouse between Kerr and Brynner makes you understand why they have appeared in more than one movie together. <br /> <br /> In all, a completely engaging movie that I would definitely watch again. 8/10
