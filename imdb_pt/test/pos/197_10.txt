This film won a special prize in Cannes for its acting and it is not difficult to understand why. Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov), who is in the middle of a war, but they have a fight when she learns that he enlisted in the army. Boris goes forward before Veronika can say that he loves him. Boris is shot, but his final destination is unknown to Veronika or her family. Mark, Boris's cousin, rapes Veronika, who feels obliged to marry him. Degraded and humiliated by the coward Mark, Veronika clings to the hope that one day Boris will return. Excellent camera work and wonderful scenarios by director Kalatozov. (For anyone interested in film technique, another Kalatozov film, I AM CUBA, has at least two excellent pieces - one of them is a long trail that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana and goes up two floors to a cigar factory , accompanies the window and follows the procession through a long, long avenue - all without a cut.) Excellent performance, particularly by Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (as Boris's uncle), which is even more poignant by simple euphemism. A devastatingly romantic film with a heart-stopping performance from Samoilova. (This movie is often related to the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier.)
