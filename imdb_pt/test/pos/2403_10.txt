"The next Karate Kid" is an excellent movie full of adventure and new surprises. It has a wonderful and moral plot that tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an incredible job of getting the role of Julie. I saw the actor who plays Mr. Miagee and this is one of his best performances in my opinion. The film is funny and charming and I can not emphasize enough about how interesting the film is. I definitely set this movie to 10 out of 10. I suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie.
