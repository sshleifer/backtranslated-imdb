Shortly after the "Blackploitation" era of the 1970s, CONRACK (20th Century-Fox, 1974) offered audiences a kind of discreet, heartfelt, and everyday drama. Offering a fair very different from the public (which was much more general than the films "Gansta"); be a dose of realistic realism that offered a lone counterweight to the shots. <br /> <br /> REPLACEMENT of main characters who were detectives, super flies, and megs / macks / pimps (Make your choice in terminology), was a solitary teacher, humble and meek. The scholar we are talking about is the main character, Pat Conroy; who is the first and only solitary teacher hired to take on the responsibility of a kind of old school on an island off the coast of South Carolina. "CONRACK" (Jon Voight) young people call him finds conditions at school terribly late. In addition to the physical properties of this Little Red Schoolhouse, any systematic and progressively graduated educational system was totally absent. <br /> Oh, by the way, we mentioned that additional complications to any successful educational venture were manifested in two incontrovertible facts. Those were that Pat Conroy was a stranger and he was white; almost the entire population of this offshore cay was black and very poor. <br /> <br /> PERPETUATING these unacceptable and deplorable conditions were the agents of the local council of education; the principal of the school being Mrs. Scott (Madge Sinclair) and Superintendent Mr. Skeffington (Mr. Hume Cronyn). Between the two, we are led to understand that the teacher, being the man down in the totem, is impotent in many ways to affect any kind of significant and lasting improvement. <br /> <br /> You tell a young Turk, like Pat Conroy, that he can not. (Can not anything, that 's). "Conrack" spends a year of unorthodox presentations in the classroom and is making real progress; but unfortunately, the strong-headed teacher does not yield and acknowledges the authority of his superiors. As long as he is, by law and without his knowledge, serving the pleasure of the super; he disobeys Skeffington's specific order and prohibition of taking his class children to the mainland of South Carolina on Halloween to do Trick-or-Treating; even going for the blatant act of stopping them at the Skeffington residence. <br /> <br /> Next, we see a messenger from the Western Union Telegram singing happily as he crosses from mainland Carolina to the island; where he hands the telegram to Conroy who brings news of his resignation from his position with that school and district. <br /> <br /> NOT being one to get your fired being laid, Pat sues Mr. Skeffington, Mrs. Scott and the Board of Education protesting his dismissal for being illegal. Examining impartially both the "offense" and the law, the judge asks Skeffington if there are minor punishments that could replace the fact that Conroy has been separated from the school system; for which he receives a negative response. Appropriately, the judge rejects the process with the hammer beating while saying, "It's very simple!" <br /> <br /> The story is taken to a bitter conclusion as the Conrack students see it for the continent's launch, while a phonographic disc provides us with BEETHOVEN's 5th symphony; who had played an important role in Conroy's educational agenda as well as our history. In this writer's humble opinion, the story (which we believe to be at least semi-autobiographical, even giving the main character the name of its author), was much more than a tale of a localized event. For me, my friend Schultz and myself; this is a kind of representation of a microcosm that represents the deplorable general conditions that permeate the Government Schools across the nation. (Just an opinion) <br /> <br /> As for this movie, it was just one of many movies that depict the shops of ordinary people; leading their lives of "silent despair" in the great interior of the country, which lies off the ring road DC and urban centers of business and communications located on the shores of the Atlantic or Pacific. IN YOUR OWN In a small way, this is a great movie, which would soon join 20th Century Fox's film coffers for works as good as NORMA RAE and BREAKING AWAY. (both being TCF in 1979). <br /> <br /> SEE if you still are not. Recommended by Schulz and his friend. * NOTE: * Why, it's me, of course! <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
