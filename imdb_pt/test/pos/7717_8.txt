How exactly do gay Asians cope with a culture that generally refuses to recognize the concept of homosexuality? For millions of Hindus and gay Muslims, there seems little hope of ever leading a life that is accepted and endorsed by their close-knit families. This is the main point explored in Chicken Tikka Masala - presumably named after the spicy western dish involving tender chunks of young chicken meat! Jimmy is a typical young Asian man raised in Britain by traditional parents with a narrow and selfish view of marriage and grandchildren. Like millions of others, he is led to an arranged marriage that seems inevitable, although he is completely gay and deeply involved with a very attractive young man with whom he lives. He knows the truth must be told, but he fears the consequences of it, especially since his father seems to be in terminal condition. And so he engages in a network of frauds that becomes broader and wider as the plot unfolds. <br /> <br /> The film is wonderfully sensitive and not at all judgmental or paternalistic to any group portrayed. The acting is generally excellent, although it may seem a bit difficult in some places, since the director tends to look for humor rather than let it bloom naturally. There are no prizes for photography or screenplay, but the film is made whole by the wonderful feeling expressed at the end - a feeling that all parents in the world would do well to learn.
