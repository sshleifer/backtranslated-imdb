Well done documentary focusing on two Sudanese refugees resettled in the United States. It's your basic fish out of water history with a touch of non-fiction. I found it fascinating to see how Peter and Santino lived before coming to America and how they adapted when they arrived here (in Houston, Texas). They expected a kind of paradise, but found that it is much harder than it looks good in the states. They range from hopeful idealists to more realistic skeptics. Wherever they go, they meet with bureaucrats with paper trails that most citizens can take for granted. They worry that they are more black than African Americans here and do not feel accepted because of it. One of the "Lost Boys" is able to leave Houston to go to Olathe, Kansas, where he finds the conditions a little better, but even less than ideal. There are people who try to help them and try to hurt them in this movie. They are not shown but talked about, they are the ones who put a gun on their heads and steal them, leading a lost boy to comment negatively that "all blacks in America are not good." I also found it interesting that they arrived in Houston in August 2001, a month before the World Trade Center was attacked by terrorists. I expected to see their reaction to this tragedy, but it is not mentioned. Still, despite everything, a documentary very well done, without narration. None is really necessary. The "Lost Boys" do a good job exposing the events that happen around them without any help, thank you very much.
