This is a great anime movie. It is very lively, has a good intricate plot and very good music. I understand that some may think of it as a bit long, but I think it's a good time and the animation is good traditional anime. <br /> <br /> THREE CHARACTERS: <br /> <br /> The way they use Tenkai is masterful. For example, the double body appearing in all these places increases the menacing tone of the film. Tenkai's design is also good, the way he looks like a monk and at the end of the scene the armor he is wearing. <br /> <br /> Old Andou is a realist and a very nice character. When Jiro meets him, it's a turning point in the movie. Sanpei, the Shinobi Satsuma who infiltrated the Tenkais clan, saves Jiros life twice. He sits in the background for most of the film, but he's really one of the movie's heroes. <br /> <br /> THE PLOT: The plot is good. It is traditional without being unoriginal. The historical time in which it is represented is interesting, the meiji restoration. The treasure is sought by Tenkai to restore the shogunate, while Jiro finds it to help the anti-shogunate forces to overthrow the shogunate. <br /> <br /> The way Tenkai fools Jiro is interesting and has a kind of "Hamlet" feel it. There is also a sweet irony to the fact that if Tenkai had not got Jiro to become a shinobi, I do not think he was able to kill him in the end (perhaps by firearm, but not by body). <br /> <br /> The plot with all of death makes it mostly very dark, but there are some moments of light when we see some of Jiros childhood memories. In short, it is a good plot, dark and complex. <br /> <br /> THE MUSIC: The opening theme, for example, is very good with guitar and drums. They occasionally use the one I believe to be taiko drums, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of good music. Like the one he touched while traveling to Iga's shinobi. I believe the piece is called "Numatou" and has an incredible flute in it. The flute may be a flute, but more likely a shakuhachi. <br /> <br /> The final theme "Kamui no komoriuta" is calm and delicate. The vocals are beautiful and so is the music in general. <br /> <br /> THE ANIMATION: <br /> <br /> The animation, though good, is not perfect and the blood that flows from the characters sometimes seems to be orange. The transitions are interesting and I think some transitions are very good. An example of a good transition is when Jiro and Iga's shinobi are running, there is the sunset in the background and the music is playing. The transition is simple but effective and has a nice feel too. <br /> <br /> My final words: I think the plot, the animation, the music and the characters make it into one of the best anime movies. I already saw.
