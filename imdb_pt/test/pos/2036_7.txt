ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (of four) Blake French: "Rock Star" is the story of no one who becomes a fame booster, just for realize that living your dream is not what he imagined. We've seen all this before (in better movies), but this human story captures the rock and roll world with a brutally honest and insightful edge. He receives a recommendation because of his viewing of the atmosphere. The screenplay by "Crazy / Beautiful" director John Stockwell portrays the hard-core universe with memorable images - it does not explain what it is, it shows us. "Rock Star" Originally titled "Metal God," starring Mark Wahlberg as Chris "Izzy" Cole, a Pittsburgh office supplies salesman who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers, the lead singer of the group of heavy metal, Steel Dragon. Although Chris already sings to his own tribute rock group called Blood Pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on playing only those of Steel Dragon, and just the exact way they perform them. Your group gets annoyed with Chris's obsessions and gives him the boot. <br /> <br /> This raises Chris, as well as his supporting parents and his faithful girlfriend, Emily (Jennifer Aniston's TV "Friends"). He then receives a phone call. It's the Steel Dragon band. They've seen Chris's tapes and want him to replace the freshly fired singer. In an instant, Chris launches into the vertiginous world of sudden stardom - from the greatest rock fan to the greatest rock star. Unfortunately, it's not as satisfying as he'd hoped. <br /> <br /> A true story inspired the concept of "Rock Star". An Ohio supplies salesman, Tim "Ripper" Owens, actually replaced Rob Halford, the lead singer of Judas Priest, after initially singing for a tribute band. The rest of the film is probably fiction, although most of what happens should represent the experiences of many other bands. The film details the various trials of being a rock star. He explores aspects of touring, personality differences, the danger of drug abuse and violence, struggling relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty and the extreme measures of the all producers to please the fans and maintain high popularity. <br /> <br /> I've seen all of Mark Wahlberg's films, and this is the first one that deserved my affection. Wahlberg, a former singer / model, has made films such as "Fear," "Boogie Nights," and "Three Kings," most recently Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes. I'm starting to admire the young actor over and over. Although he has not appeared in many successful films, he has had many chances and played many roles. "Rock Star" is his best film to date. I can not think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed the struggles and aspirations of Chris Cole. Wahlberg really does rock "Rock Star". <br/> <br/> Jennifer Aniston also lights the screen. She creates a chemistry-rich relationship with Chris that induces public input. It's tragic of what happens to their relationship. We care a lot about these characters. <br /> <br /> During the scenes of the shows, director Stephen Herek (who also directed "Holy Man" and the live version of "101 Dalmatians") creates an exciting atmosphere. He captures the scenes with an intense urgency and raw and unmistakable energy. The musical numbers provide the film with the best, most engaging scenes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Herek can not sustain energy and enthusiasm everywhere. At the three-quarter mark, he loses the spark when the film becomes monotonous and unpleasant. I understand where the story needs to go to portray the downside of fame, but this movie loses everything it previously had for it. In "Almost Famous," a much better movie about rock and roll, there is a certain amount of interest and life in the most painful scenes. Here it seems that the filmmakers lose their passion. <br /> <br /> The message arrives a bit late and suddenly in history. The film turns into a tale of morality that wants to provide us with a sentimental fate. The filmmakers can also stop everything, appear on the screen and say, "Now audience, the moral of the story is?" We understand the theme, but it's too instant. Chris's personal discovery must be gradual. Fortunately, all of this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, hardly enough to completely destroy a total of eighty-five minutes of a reasonably good time. feature. "Rock Star" is not a great "Almost Famous" movie, if you want a remarkable movie about rock and roll - but for Marky Mark, it's a turning point in your career. <br /> <br />
