I saw 2:37 at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and I was impressed by it! A panic scene opens this movie at 2:37 pm at a high school in Adelaide. This scene was not resolved when we got back to the beginning of the day and are introduced to teens who are getting ready for school. The audience becomes intimate with each of the main characters and explores the day-to-day issues teens face - including drugs, promiscuity, being gay, bullying, and violence. Each scene is played again and again from different perspectives of teenagers, and is reminiscent of the Elephant of Gus Van Sant. This is a remarkable film by the first director Murali K. Thalluri. It was done with non-professional student actors, and worked through 76 drafts of an unprecedented script. It features stunning performances by a number of student actors, particularly Teresa Palmer in the role of Melody. This maturing film is both intimate and thought-provoking, with an astounding and disturbing ending.
