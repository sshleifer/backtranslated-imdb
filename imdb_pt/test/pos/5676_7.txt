When I read the synopsis - 3 people lost in the jungle fighting a huge crocodile - I was not exactly attracted. It looked like the typical horror formula of a yawn of a bunch of people pursued by a monster - except in this case. there are only three of them, so we would not even have the macabre "joy" to see them being caught one by one. <br /> <br /> However, I watched (I could not sleep, nothing else to do) and turned out to be much better than expected. The acting is great, the atmosphere tense and you really do have that rare feeling of a low budget winner. <br /> <br /> Terror as it should be done. Top quality movie. Not perfect, but worth seeing. I give a 7.
