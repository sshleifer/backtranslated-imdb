... that maybe one day people will wake up. People who can resist the desire to separate each and every one, and who sees the sixties for what they were. People who can see that they were the individuals who made those times; Not the other way around. <br /> <br /> The comparison "Forrest Gump" is good. Both films look at the 60s, but "Four Friends" is about humans, as opposed to caricatures. FF deeply investigates the thing that FG (quite successfully!) Tries to condense and classify as nothing more than a backdrop. But while "Gump" shelves the 60's in an attic like old toys in a box, "Four Friends" picks up and hugs each toy, thus obscuring the lines between what you have and what you are. <br /> <br /> If you associate romance with shoe polish, you will hate this movie.
