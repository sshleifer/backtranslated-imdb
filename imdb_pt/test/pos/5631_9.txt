I rented this movie for two reasons. The first was all the good things I read about it. I was definitely impressed, and could not agree more with all the reviews I read. The second reason is because I know these guys. I do not know Mark as well as Mike. It has not changed much since the years we met. I know him as the "grim reaper" of a local Milwaukee radio station (WMSE). The way he is in this movie is genuinely Mike 100%. He once gave me a table that he made. It was a little, about 15 "tall, that said about Metallica. The strangest thing was that it had only two legs. Sometimes it's the thought that counts, and Mike always thinks of the others first.
