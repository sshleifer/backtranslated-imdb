I loved this movie - the actors were wonderful and suited their roles. The story itself was great (and true, the setting was perfect and the message about the human response to war, danger and risk was exceptional. The person who wrote the score also made the song for Life is Beautiful - Callum Blue is perfect for the role of Eric Newby.I recommend this movie to everyone who wants to see a film, story that is truly and morally uplifting, as well as a beautiful love story.
