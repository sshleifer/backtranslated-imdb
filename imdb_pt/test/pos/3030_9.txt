The last film that provided a vivid and disturbing insight into how insanity is probably was In Dreams. In that movie, you did not see insanity, you were there. Now The Cell comes with an updated and much more disturbing picture of the psychotic killer's mind's interior. The opening scene takes you to the seemingly innocent mind of a little comatose boy, and the things Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are fascinating and terrifying. The things she later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are incredibly imaginative and fascinating, most of these things have never been seen in the movie before. <br /> <br /> The story of The Cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking. In fact, it's basically the same as the story in The Silence of the Innocents. You have a killer in custody and these people have to come into your mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing their life. The only real difference between the plot's foundation is that in The Silence of the Innocents, you have to get into the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as your current victim while in The Cell you have to enter the mind of a killer to find his own victim. However, despite the sadly weak history, The Cell completely revolutionizes the psychological thriller genre. None that have been done until you get close to it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film had good direction and was extremely well interpreted. Vince Vaughn presents another of his excellent character performances (he was even good as Norman Bates in Psycho's pathetic 1998 version), and even Jennifer Lopez makes the second good effort of his career (the other is the Out of Sight). ). Nothing can be said of cinematography in The Cell to give enough credit, was imaginatively and fascinatingly made, and is unmatched by anything ever seen in film history. The Cell is an incredibly well made film, and deserves to be recognized.
