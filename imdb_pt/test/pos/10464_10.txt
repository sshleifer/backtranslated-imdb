This film incorporates the soul of modern "elite" culture, although the film is 17 years old. The permanent principle of the film is: Food is more than just nutritious matter. It is also a powerful symbol and a medium for the culture itself. The main characters literally get drunk on the best wine and food, they draw inspiration from idealistic thinking and culture, leaving aside their puritanism and table manners that deny passion. Karen Blixens uses the difference between northern Europe and southern Europe to point to her inherently different approaches to food. As the strict and rather tedious Scandinavians are infused with "Eros" from the south, the party begins. So what are you waiting for? Go watch ..... again!
