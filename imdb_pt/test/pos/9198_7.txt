I had heard some interesting reviews about this movie. I believed it was a love story, but I was not sure what the plot was. So when I finally saw it, I found myself in the midst of a love affair between the former president Isabel (Isabel Ampudia) and the addict Rufo (Sebastián Haro). So a love story but not probably what I was hoping for. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Isabel as she struggles to return to society. She does not want to go back to her neighborhood and finds herself without a home or where to go. Then, while she only experiences the first few hours of freedom after being released from prison, she encountered Rufus, an old acquittal of her who, while she was, had become an addict and lived on the streets. Having nowhere to go, and without money or a viable source of income, she decides to join Rufus at his residence: a covered area on a lonely street. <br /> <br /> The story itself is moving. It explains how the impossible relationship between Isabel and Rufo deepens until the near completion of the film. Definitely worth watching the movie. Sebastián Haro is splendid in his role of drug addict. A person being able to be an innocent and tender person and a ruthless slag. Just depending on who handles it. I believe in your role. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I do not believe in the role of Isabel Ampudia. Although the film tries to show the bitterness inside her through various scenes, she is not able to make me believe. She is, in a way, too sweet and too honest for what you might expect from someone in the same situation. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to show a love in a desperate situation. It's a nice movie. But the feeling I have when the movie ends is that Isabel, with the way she thought and act, would never have gotten into that situation. His role, partly because of the script, partly because of acting, is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I especially like the ending, and because of that I've raised my rank in one or two points. I liked its bittersweetness and the fact that it shows that at times, the survival instinct is above other, more spiritual considerations like love. <br /> <br /> In short, an interesting movie, but it lacked some punch to be a total "I need to see".
