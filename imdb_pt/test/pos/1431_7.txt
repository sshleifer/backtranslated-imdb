But quite dated today. Otto Preminger made this film without the certificate of approval that was needed then. It was enormously brave and risky, as he could have lost his investment and future. <br /> <br /> The film is not faithful to the wonderful book and is, unfortunately, hollywoodizado. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra (and I've never been a fan) playing Frankie Machine, is amazing in his performance. Someone forgets that Frank is up there, the level of realism he brings to the role of a jonesing drug addict has to be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak, eternally beautiful and talented, does not disappoint in The Role of the Devout Outsider, Always Present for Frankie. <br /> <br /> Supporting roles, particularly a young, handsome and talented Darrin Mc Gavin, are impeccable. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker, in the role of Frankie's wife, is hopelessly inept. It ranges from annoying to melodramatic and is way above the top. A forgettable performance. <br /> <br /> The cheap settings and stage settings are scary, as if a firm gust of wind blew all the cardboard paper painted on the horizon. Almost laughable at times its cheap cheap. <br /> <br /> The music was annoying, sometimes so painfully. As if every nuance of the script (example: when Louie was taking Frankie out of his drawer) had to be highlighted at a high decibel level. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. Sinatra really deserved his Oscar. appointment. Worth seeing.
