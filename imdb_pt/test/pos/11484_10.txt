I watched this movie at least ten times. I do not agree with the previous reviews. This is a tongue on the cheek and part of the acting should be blistered. Men like Paul Cowley are few and far between, women like Linda, unfortunately, are a dime a dozen. The sad thing here is that although similar relationships like this rarely lead to murders and cadres, it is a family scenario. Boy loves girl, girl does not know he exists, they grow up, man sees the woman he has fantasized about down and out and rescues her. Bottom line, she never loved him, he came on time and she used it. Thomas is excellent as the nerd but proper Paul. Your portrait is sensitive and touching. Madsen is perfect as a femme-fatale. What really thrilled me was the final scene. Paul says he ended up crying, but not for Linda, his wife, but for the unknown girl he'd seen from afar so many years ago ... and yearned for ... and loved. And I loved Thomas's close-up in the end.
