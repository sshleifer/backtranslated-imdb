I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say it's one of the few books I could not stop reading while reading. <br /> <br /> The film, however, was pretty much what I expected, lots of action, with a mysterious story. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code. <br /> <br /> You will not have to worry about being as bad as The Da Vinci Code. is all that was not. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense and less unnecessary controversy. If you have not read the book, do not worry, you'll still find it very interesting. And if you read the book, well, let's say you might be a bit disappointed, because I found many missing scenes that I was looking forward to. <br /> <br /> Overall, quite impressive movie for any movie goer every day. But it may not be something very special for Dan Brown fans.
