What I got was something better. <br /> <br /> Like so many movies I've commented on recently, I've been looking forward to this movie for a while. Especially after I saw one of Toshiaki Toyoda's other films, "Blue Spring", which is easily in my top 20 favorite movies. I loved the trailer for "9 Souls", and I thought it sounded pretty good. I did not hear anything bad about it. Now I know why. <br /> <br /> This movie begins as a kind of comedy, so during the last half of the movie, it quickly becomes something else. It becomes more dramatic as each of the characters faces their own tragedies. Each character gets only enough screen time and you care what happens to each of them. Even with 9 characters we have to learn, and we care, in just two hours, Toshiaki Toyoda does this brilliantly. <br /> <br /> After I saw "Blue Spring" I was hoping that the soundtrack was at least a little bit as good as it was in that movie. I have my wish, because the soundtrack of "9 Souls" was also amazing. The music used in each scene, more specifically the most dramatic, is simply marvelous. I loved every second of it. <br /> <br /> I was not sure whether or not I wanted to see another Toshiaki Toyoda movie, "Pornostar," but after I saw it, I went. Definitely. Also, because I read the plot for this, and I think it sounds great. I'm looking forward to it. In the "9 Souls" DVD R1, there are two interviews with Toyoda. He says he has completed another film and wants to start writing the screenplay for the next one. I can not wait for both. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. You should see this. Now.
