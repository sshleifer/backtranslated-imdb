So WWE did it. They were dumped in movies, being the first of them See No Evil, starring in their own Kane. I got this movie and did not expect it to be a great movie ... It seemed like a clich√© and it did not look anything new. To my surprise, it was not really bad at all. One viewer stated above that it's good fun B-horror movie, and honestly that's the best way to describe it. Now the question I was asking myself was how Kane would hold on ... Well, let's just say he made a jerk of the character 'Jacob Goodnight'. He sold the paper very well and actually looked menacing. But what you can expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs about 320 in solid muscle. The acting was decent, and the story was not new, of course, but we all know that. The management, as well as the cinematography, was done very well and the setting of the hotel seemed really dilapidated and well done. Considering this was directed by a porn director, I was quite surprised. I recommend this movie if you are looking for meaningless and killing things and just a little fun in general. Think of this movie as a modern day on Friday the 13th in the movie. And save space for the end too, because it's good. And stay here after the credits too ...
