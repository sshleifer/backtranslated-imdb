"2001: A Space Odyssey" was set in 2001 and the main character is HAL. A computer. That's right, a computer that speaks and thinks entirely on its own. This was done in 1968 and thinking in 2001 that it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke. If this was in 3064, a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered as dumb as this. There is nothing in this movie that provokes any kind of emotion. It causes two reactions and one is called sleep. It starts with nothing but a pitch black for well over two minutes. So the first scene we see that has some kind of lighting is the sequence "Dawn of Man". So, if it is chronologically, is the darkness before that the birth of the world? <br /> <br /> During the sequel to "The Dawn of Man" from nowhere, does a huge monolith come? off the ground, from the sky, we will never know where it comes from, but for one reason or another it is there. The monkeys go Apesh! T once they find this monolith that only man could have done, but this is the catch? the man has not yet evolved. So who did it and where did it come from? What is your purpose? The monkeys find a tool. Monkeys use bones to fight an enemy group of monkeys. Monkeys with guns are now the dominant group because they have used the mind to gain advantage. The most advanced monkeys and, most importantly, the most intelligent and innovative monkeys are the dominant group as they have taken over the water hole. <br /> <br /> We quickly jumped into space, millions of years later, where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe, and for a film made in 1968, the visual effects are impressive, but outdated. The score is legendary. The cinematography is spectacular. The issue is atrocious. There are countless takes of square-looking spaceships floating in outer space for an infinite amount of time. Once we board the ship, there is not much to talk about. For the next hour, Kubrick shows several scenes of life in outer space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, which is very annoying, and we get the message completely. The inner and outer spaceships are bulky and outdated. Remember that the first cell phone looked like? Neither do I, but that's how the future looks like in 2001. All the characters have clothes and hairstyles that resemble the year 1968. The chairs are decorated in bright red and strangely shaped because we all know in the future that we will be sitting in strange chairs. The computer screens are horrible and this is obviously prior to HDTV because the clarity is atrocious. All TV sets look like they are from 1968, so it's not that futuristic. Like all movies more than 20 years in advance, they look terrible and unconvincing. Just because this is Kubrick, we should not say, "Well, that's how you think it looks." No I would not. Just like I did not think a computer would be talking to me in the year 2047. It will not happen and if someone made a movie now, spent 30 years in time and had a talking and self-taught computer, I would laugh at the stupidity of it. Just like I did with "2001". <br /> <br /> HAL is the most lively person, shoot? I just called him a person. HAL is a computer, but he has more life than any of the silent characters in the movie and he really thinks he's alive. HAL is the only thing that is lively and he sees humans as his maintenance men taking care of him while he does all the work. HAL "reads" his lips from one of the few conversations between Dave and Frank, and he "sees" that they are planning to turn it off. It's where the only dramatic part of the movie comes in - a battle that follows between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into the larger spacecraft. Oh, the drama. Once HAL thinks he has the upper hand, Dave makes his way back to the spacecraft, proving the man's ingenuity. Dave continues to finish HAL. HAL, begs for his life as he slowly disappears, which, like everything else, seems to take forever. <br /> <br /> The final act is as tedious as the first two. Once again, the monolith that the monkeys found appears at the end. This comes from nowhere, again. Then, a baby is born in a placenta-like shell, overlooking the Earth from space. What is Kubrick saying? Is it about transformation? Dave for a kid? Is man evolving again? Kubrick is saying that this is the end of man and the beginning of ?? Whatever is this alien thing? Maybe I'm going crazy trying to figure out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think about it, the more the beginning and the end make sense. There are so many questions left unanswered, especially for the purpose of the monolith. If you can get through the movie, this should stimulate some thinking. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film strives to get where it wants to go. The first act and the third act are strong, but the second act snakes around, hovering in a place by what seems to be eternity. There are some intriguing things in the movie that will spark some thought if you give it a chance. Since the beginning of the movie makes sense, the ending works much better, even though you still do not know what Kubrick is trying to say, which I do not know.
