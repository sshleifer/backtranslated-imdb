In the line of fire, in my opinion, it's an excellent, suspenseful action / thriller / thriller from your seat! I thought Agent Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and Agent Raines (Rene Russo) looked good in the costume they wore for the presidential dinner. As for Leary (John Malkovich), he was a sick man who loved to play with Frank on the phone. He looked fine in the tux he wore near the end of the movie, though. One thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between Agent Horrigan and Agent Raines. Before we finished, I would say that all the cast and crew did a great job, I loved the ambiance, and I could not get enough of it. Now in conclusion, for all of you, Clint Eastwood fans, who have not seen this great, full of suspense and action / drama / suspense, I strongly recommend.
