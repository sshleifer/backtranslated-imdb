Burt Reynolds directed this action movie and (surprise!) He's a really good director. This film starts well when Burt's attempt to bust a drug dealer is unsuccessful, and he is demoted to the vice squad. The cast has some pretty funny scenes, since Brian Kieth is always eating something, Bernie Casey has more class than all his co-workers together, and Charles Durning loses control of his team. <br /> <br /> The deputy police stumble into an expensive call-girl ring that may have something to do with a series of murders. Sharkey spends his days watching Dominoe's apartment (Rachel Ward) and begins to really worship her from afar. <br /> <br /> Soon as they are approaching the crime leader, Dominoe is murdered. I will not give any surprises in the plot, but the first hour of this movie is great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script was very clich√©d and unbelievable after that. <br /> <br /> Why would Burt Reynolds confront the crime boss with his big secret? Of course, that makes the guy sweat, but it causes a lot of cops to be killed. And it is not believable that Dominoe and Sharkey made love after meeting each other for a day, much less while their lives are in danger. And in the end, what happened to all the cops running into the building with our heroes? Is not there a SWAT team? Also, the movie never really tells you how all the bad guys are connected, and why they have to kill so many people. <br /> <br /> There is a very effective torture scene on a boat near the end of the movie. film, which is probably the only scene in the movie that really touches the nails. It's a shame that the climax is a typical shoot-em-up. Still, this movie is certainly fun if you like crime and action movies. Do not think about the holes in the plot, and you'll have a good time.
