I just watched this (last weekend) and found it absolutely hillarious, some of the scenes I could not stop laughing at! Dennis is sooooo incredibly thick at times, and just says the hardest things ... but at the same time he's just being cool to impress his girlfriend (who's stuck anyway!) The beach scene is very quiet ... until Robbie Coltrane arrives ...! Not the best movie ever, but certainly something to think about renting on a Saturday night when you do not have much to do (like I did). You may have to look for it - I was lucky, since my local video store does that.
