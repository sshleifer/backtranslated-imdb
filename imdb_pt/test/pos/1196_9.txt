I watched because my friend said we could try, when my dad asked if we were going to watch. I did not want to because it was such an old movie, how could that be good? I finally attended with that friend and my father. My friend and I loved the movie. the songs are great, the actors were cool and we were crazy about it. I think this shows even if it's dad's time that does not mean it can not be a good movie. I bought the movie not long after watching it on TV, I put it on and sang along with the songs. I even watched with my classmates at my birthday party. It's a good, good and sometimes funny movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not try, you can not say it's bad. even if you think not, I'm not going to watch a movie of Daddy's time. try the first part of the movie, you can always stop watching if you do not like it. I really recommend it, it's great!
