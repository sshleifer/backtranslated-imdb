It's about time "Kate Jackson" had her credit for this movie .., I remember watching and trying to understand on TV .., my grandmother was in bed dying of cancer and I was only 15. I did not find it until years later that Richard died a long time ago, I miss him in the other shows / movies he's been in. <br /> <br /> I have a copy of the VHS tape yet, but it's not "CC'd" or Closed Captioned for the Hearing Impaired and that's the ONLY flaw in the movie that I can remember or know so far .. ., I could not find a DVD or VHS copy that has subtitle in English. If anyone out there knows of a VHS or DVD copy that has CC or has English subtitles, please let me know. Thank you - Cofffeenut
