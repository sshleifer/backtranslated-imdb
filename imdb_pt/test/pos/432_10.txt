I'm not a fan of musicals, but I'm a big fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin. I rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly surprised, even waiting for the grandeur of the classic director. This movie is beautiful. The shots are like moving oil paintings, something that many directors struggle, but Renoir MASTERS. I can not express how much this film transcends itself ... it's not really a musical, it has just a few well-placed musical numbers and a great end to the dance. But there is something about this particular movie that makes you feel absolutely CHEERFUL to watch it. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of foreign art films, but I'm also a meathead who loves things like Die Hard and Schwarzenegger's Movies. I get very easily turned off by things that are overly happy or in "la la land", but this film has a overwhelming positive energy that is simply irresistible - not to mention every picture is beautiful and the plot is good. 10 out of 10.
