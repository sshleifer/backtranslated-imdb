Shameless Screen Entertainment is a relatively new and British (I think) DVD-label, specializing in violent and overly violent cult films ?? mostly Italians - from glorious times when everything was possible from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s. The selection of the stamp seems to be a cross between the works of "Mondo Macabro" and "No Shame" (they are probably even lent the name of the last one) and they have already released some very rare sick Italian puppies like "Ratman", "My Dear Killer". "" The Frightened Woman "was completely unknown to me, but since the fellow reviewers here, whose views I highly value, have described him as one of the the biggest and most mesmerizing psychedelic euro-sex movies of his era, I did not hesitate to pick.This is a very strange movie and probably not suitable for about 99% of the cinema loving audiences.If you are part of the remaining 1% The style, atmosphere and content are similar to those of Jess Franco's "Succubus" and Massimo Dallamano's "Venus in Furs", but both are widely considered classics, while "The Frightened The story revolves around a rich and dirty doctor (he lives in a gigantic isolated mansion, owns several vintage cars and has an impressive collection of and artistic relics, including a life-size replica dummy doll) with a bizarre and somewhat eccentric. attitude towards women. He considers them a threat to the survival of the male race and thus spends his days kidnapping, humiliating and sexually abusing him in any way he takes off the street. Dr. Sayer then kidnaps the ambitious journalist Maria with the intention of completely crushing her feminine spirit, but he slowly falls in love with her. Only he begins to believe in real love, she attacks back with revenge. This really is not for everyone, but if you can enjoy moody and sinisterly sexy environments, bizarre landscape toys and psychedelic touches that seem totally implausible and surreal, you may consider this a superior recommendation. Is he slow, elegantly contemptuous, and totally crazy? Shameless Entertainment, fine!
