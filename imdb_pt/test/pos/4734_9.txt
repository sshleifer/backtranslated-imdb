I watched a television movie about the destruction in Waco, Texas. He was obviously inclined to claim that David Koresh was a cult killer leader, child rapist, determined to kill as many cops as he wanted and take his people to heaven on a blood-stained ladder. <br /> <br /> The film was little more than propaganda, further detailing what we had already read in the newspapers. I have been more and more certain of this since I watched the great documentary Waco: The Rules of Engagement. Not that every statement made in this film should be taken as the truth of God, but it tells the whole story rather than regurgitating only what the law has decided to say. <br /> <br /> For those who have forgotten, Koresh was the spiritual. leader of the religious movement called The Davidians Branch. The accusations of drug use, kidnapping, illegal gun ownership and rape (among others, I'm sure) raised the suspicions of local police after the enforcement of federal law. While attempting to serve a search warrant, the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) and the clan participated in a shootout that left both dead and injured on both sides. <br /> <br /> It was then that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) became involved. The communications between the two were witty, but they eventually collapsed. The FBI prepared for an invasion by attacking the building with grenades and gas. When the building burned to the ground killing many inside, including Koresh, the FBI refused to admit responsibility saying the "cult" inside must have set itself on fire. These images have been listened to by Jim Jones and other violent religious organizations. <br /> <br /> The engraving puts many masks to tell your story. It starts with a sample of the congressional hearings, perhaps the "truth", with regard to registration, anyway. What is revealing is how politicians have remained supporters, even in a difficult and serious situation like this. The Democrats were concerned about nothing more than defending every action taken by law enforcement. It was the Republicans who seemed to be open to the other side. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to relate all the new information and analysis provided by this documentary. In addition, a list would remove the opening of the film as it moved forward. An example would be the fact that the children died in the complex. Filmmakers are likely to stand side by side with the Davidians in general, but remain relatively open to both sides. In this case, the feds appear guilty of mistreating a situation involving innocent children. But on the other hand, parents also need to take some of the blame for leaving their children in this harmful situation when they could have released them to any number of local authorities. Probably the newest convicting information. arrives late in the movie and involves the FBI's claim that they did not fire on the building. This is left to the interpretation, and I will not reveal more than to say that it is disturbing and shocking what can and can not be said. <br /> <br /> Federal officials are not kept in a critical or corrupt light. more than Koresh. The biggest condemnation seems to be in the media, not wanting to tell the two sides of the story. This element seems prevalent in recent documentaries, I duly believe. It is time for the media to retell the news and leave this tireless search for what will attract the largest audience and audience. <br /> <br /> It's hard to mess up a documentary. In most cases, connecting a camera and editing interesting parts of life is common and tells a fantastic story. What few can do is shed such a new light on a subject that the way you think about it is changed forever. Waco is that kind of movie. *** 5 of ****
