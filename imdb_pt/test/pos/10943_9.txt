I think there was a lot of action in the end? Do not you think that too? There was romance, adventure as well as told me to put 9 for this movie, but the place of action was too long. I liked Reeve a little. I did not understand why he had to die. I thought one of the girls is going to die too, but my luck! No one else I liked did not die! How about you? What did you like? I've seen the movie twice, actually. And after that I bought that too. Worth it! Who do you like most? The book was very, very, very cool. And the actresses and actors too. Everything was perfect ....... What was the name of the song in the end? Someone will answer my questions too ... PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE?
