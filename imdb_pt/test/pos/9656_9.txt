This is a beautiful and enchanting epic fantasy with a lot of heart. I got lost in this sweet movie watching at Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. It is truly romantic with a touching message. The artwork and effects are visually stunning and the fact that the director is an incredible artist is so apparent. Frames are like watching moving art. He also has a strong and talented cast of actors. What a wonderful surprise to see Joss Ackland, he's just a perfect fairytale king. Sarah Douglas is great as the villain and Christine Taylor and Tom Schultz form a lovely romantic couple. The fact that the movie was made with a ridiculously small indie film budget drives me crazy. It may not be the Hollywood stuff we're flooded with, but it's a really good movie to rent and tan curled up on your couch on a rainy Saturday. Do not forget the microwave popcorn. This is my advice. Just enjoy it.
