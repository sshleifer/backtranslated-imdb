Lovely. The best time to see this movie is at some point when unhappy or sad. It's all so cute, everything, even the way the white bear secretly loves the Queen and receives it at the end, also the achievement that the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very cool. We will always be a combo with sad piano tones in some places, give a very moving result and if one watches both parties at the same time, he will see that the Snow Queen is not that bad. She just tries to surround herself with love the wrong way. On the night that this movie was here (part one) I just watched because I was bored, but I loved it a lot later and I got really angry when they did not show the next part because of the Pope's funeral. Yes, that was terribly sad for me. But when they said it will be next week, I was so happy, I recorded it and now I'm glad I did it.
