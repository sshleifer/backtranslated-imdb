Without music. Do not chew the idiot. A reasonably realistic picture of the police system in India and based on a true "meeting" expert in India, Daya Nayak. This is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolizes how many criminals the leader "Sadhu Agashe" killed - well, you already know) Brilliance exudes Nan Patekar as a relaxed and calculating Indian policeman. slightly predictable in criticism, is intriguing anyway. Another of Ram Gopal Vermas' films The Factory. Films that are decent or very good, Ab Tak CHappan snake close to very good. But still remains one of the Top 70 films released from India , commercials and art. <br /> <br /> What's great is that the story is relaxed and finally shows (in an Indian movie) how the police network works. <br /> <br /> The cast is really good But recorders are funny (although I do not know if the subtitled version will look funny) Producers are trying to launch a Cannes release, which is interesting, made by debut director Shamit Aman (I think that's his name). <br /> <br /> Once again 55 years Nana Patekar's brilliant I away from his glaring papers of the past, only shows what a good director can do with a good actor. Really good stuff. If you are interested in Indian movies and are disgusted with the absurdity of some of our guys dish out then this is definitely a relief. <br /> <br /> Again, Patekar is the guy who happily carries the film on his shoulders and synthesizes the style of the film - relaxed, funny, intelligent and calculating. Good dialogue, good acting, good direction, great. Recommendations: Gangaajal, Company of Ram Gopal Verma (both Indian films)
