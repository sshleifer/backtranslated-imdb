One only has to remember the scenes of piano music offered under the heavy German bombardment, or Boris's death with a whirling sky above his head and his last visions seemed blurred in those heavens. The very simple means - but the great technique added to the emotional weight ... Remember, 20 years before "The Star Wars", 41 years before "Titanic", and with a Soviet budget.
