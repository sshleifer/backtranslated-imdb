Not all movies are worthy of the Oscars, but let's face it, sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression. This left me smiling and happy and I could not wait to hug my own son. Anyone who has a pet (no matter what type) knows what it's like to lose one. I think most people would identify with Buddy almost losing his best friend that he has created since birth. Bruce Willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother. The boy who played Buddy had a cherub face and his sister and friend Edgar played great supporting roles. I really enjoyed the movie and it was something that the whole family could enjoy. Thank you!
