This is not a 'real' vehicle of James Cagney, since his time on the screen is exceptionally small. Frankie Darro plays tough boy Jimmy Smith, the leader of a gang of street thugs who is sent to reform the school with some of his rebellious friends. Cagney plays Patsy Gargan, a gang leader, who receives a symbolic position as deputy commissioner. When he first discovers the brutal treatment handed out at retirement school, he is required to make some major changes with the help of the Reform Nursing (Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> THE HELL MAYOR is fast and still fun after all these years. The cast is well rounded, featuring: Dudley Digges, Arthur Bryon, Farina Hoskins, G. Pat Collins and Allen Jenkins.
