I thought this movie was great, if you did not take it too seriously. Just sit back and enjoy Hilary Swank in all her grandeur and laugh when the monks go to Boston, MA. I also think this movie has a great message about self-control and inner strength. In addition, Mr. Myagi was so sweet, I wish he would teach me karate!
