Love In Limbo is my favorite movie of all time. (defined in W.A) is hilairious and has an excellent cast including a group of three gorgeous actors, Russell Crowe (as Arthur), back in the day when he actually looked hot with short hair and no facial hair. Aden Young (Barry McJannet) and Craig Adams as Ken Riddle. <br /> <br /> Ken is a high school student obsessed with sex and is expelled for selling pornographic drawings to his classmates. He starts a new job at his uncle's clothing factory and comes up with another new guy, Barry McJannet, who buys a car so he can get out and get puppies. They become comrades with the geek Arthur Baskin (Crowe) and the three guys head up to Kalgoorlie to defeat a brothel and lose their virginity ...... Watch, it's a classic !! For a long time I have been trying to get a DVD or a soundtrack, anybody let me know if you have it.
