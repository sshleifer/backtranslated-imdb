One of the genres that flourished during the 1930s was the variation of police fiction known as "The Mystery of Murder," as the addition of sound to the movies helped to translate the film more accurately than the audience experienced in the original. play. And because horror movies were very popular in those years, by highlighting the horror elements of the plot, the murder mystery movies had a popularity almost equal to that enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first films of the genre were produced). Aspiring playwright Charles Belden saw in this renewed interest in murder mysteries the chance to make a name for himself, after Warner Bros. chose the play "The Wax Works" to create the 1933 horror film, "Mystery of the Wax." Museum. "Belden joined independent filmmaker Frank R. Strayer to continue making films, and" The Ghost Walks "was one of his best. <br /> <br /> In" The Ghost Walks, "John Miljan plays Prescott Ames , a young playwright who wants to impress a famous Broadway producer named Herman Wood (Richard Carle) with his new play. Ames takes Wood and his assistant Homer (Johnny Arthur) to his cottage for a read of his play, but his car The three men ask for refugees in an old mansion owned by one of Ames' old acquaintances. Inside the house, Wood and Homer testify to the strange relationship between Ames and the owners of the house, however , all this is a plan designed to impress Wood: everyone in the house is an actor who plays a role in his murder mystery. Unfortunately, the murder committed is real, and while Wood and Homer think it's all false (after desc the original plan of Ames), the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real killer. As expected, Charles Belden's screenplay for "The Ghost Walks" features the classic elements of the murder mystery stories of his time, as we have the tempestuous night in an old dark house as scenery, the obligatory group of suspects and the touch of comedy. However, what is interesting here is how Belden makes the film a veritable parody of the genre with the many twists it puts on its story to play with the clichés of mystery pieces of murder. The dialogues are excellent, full of wit and carefree charm, and although the plot certainly misses a lot of steam in the end (it follows the murder mystery routine anyway), it never ceases to be interesting and fun thanks to its intelligent twists and especially its characters. Interestingly, there is an obvious gay subtext that, although stereotyped, is never denigrating and is genuinely funny at times. <br /> <br /> In 1934, director Frank R. Strayer was already an experienced craftsman on the poverty side of the film industry. , but his partnership with writer Charles Belden would give him some of his most interesting films, and "The Ghost Walks" was one of them. Although obviously done with a tight budget and the typical values ​​of independent film production of his time, Strayer manages to take advantage of his set and makes an atmospheric movie that fits very well with the mood and tone of the story. The pace is a little too slow, but Strayer knew that the power of his film was in the screenplay of Belden and made the most of it, allowing his cast to get the most out of his characters with excellent results. Certainly the performance is somewhat typical and unoriginal, but Strayer does an effective, though contained, work in this film. <br /> <br /> As written above, the script is replete with big lines that make the quirky characters shine, and fortunately, most of the cast plays with it in their favor. Veteran actor Richard Carle is incredibly funny as the weird producer Herman Wood, adding much charm to his character, especially in his scenes with Johnny Arthur, who plays the flamboyant secretary Homer. Arthur is the one who gets the best scenes, and he gives a hilarious performance as a cowardly but intelligent assistant. John Miljan is just as effective as Presocott Ames, nothing surprising, but nothing really bad, and the same could be said about June Collyer as Gloria Shaw (the obligatory love interest) which is just fine. However, Donald Kirke is really fun as the malicious Terry Shaw, and it's a shame he does not have more time on the screen. As usual with Frank R. Strayer's films, the low budget hurts the film badly. While Strayer does the best he can, the film still seems kind of clear at times. However, the main problem is the problem of the very slow pace it has because even when the film is filled with brilliant moments of witty dialogues, it moves at such a slow pace that it can become boring and boring for moments. It must also be said that although effective in their roles, Miljan and Collyer are very boring and mean when compared to Arthur and Carle, and whether they wish the film was more focused on the comic pair they make than the main couple. Finally, as written above, the ending is a bit weak and does not match the high standard of the first and middle part, though credit should go to Belden for keeping the creative twists to the end. <br /> <br /> It may be said that Charles Belden is an unsung hero of the murder mystery genre, since among the many horror and mystery films that came out of B Studios, dubbed "The Poverty Row" "The Ghost Walks" is among the best (Strayer's previous film, "The Vmapire Bat", despite its shortcomings. And even when it's definitely not a masterpiece of the genre, it's a great way to spend a The way you enjoy your own origin as a mysterious piece of murder.A very recommended movie if you like the genre.
