All I can say is that every time I see CONRACK, dir. Martin Ritt, DP. John Alonzo, I feel an extreme sense of inspiration and enlightenment about what the power of cinema is possible in such a simple film. <br /> <br /> The film Conrack is set in 1969. It is based on a true story. . It's a story about a white man (Jon Voight) who teaches a group of young black children how incredible the world is outside their little island in South Carolina. History puts the work of a teacher as a noble cause in changing children's lives. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend.
