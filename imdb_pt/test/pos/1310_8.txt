I've never heard of Mishima before watching this movie and although parts of it are a bit tedious, I still feel drawn to watching it when it's replayed in the box. At the beginning of the movie, we are told about a famous Japanese writer who behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku in public. As the movie progresses, you are gently introduced into the distorted logic of Mishima's mind. The stages of your life are presented in four chapters. Each chapter in itself is a mixture of two contrasting narratives, the first continues the story with scenes from Mishima's life and appears in black and white. The second narrative is an adaptation of scenes from a novel and these are staged as a play and filmed in vivid colors. There is a different novel staged in each chapter. Between each chapter, the narrative returns to the present, while Mishima proceeds toward its eventual ritual suicide. This means that drama and tension are kept to the end. <br /> <br /> I suspect many people will find this film boring and pretentious. I respect that, this is not a movie for people who want action and a strong plot. If, on the other hand, you are the kind of person who appreciates the opportunity to penetrate the mind of a bizarre man, while watching his life story told in a collage of beautiful images by Philip Glass, you will love it. I loved it. <br /> <br />
