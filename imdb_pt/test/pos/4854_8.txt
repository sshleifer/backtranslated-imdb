The first reviewer is right - In this movie, we see ourselves, snuggling to the most, being nice, trying to stay out of trouble, just trying to live our lives, and see how easily these human characteristics, so fundamental to life. functioning of society, can lead us to be complicit in a great evil. <br /> <br /> The story takes place during World War II with the radio, newspapers and movies reminding us of Hitler's attacks on Jews to underline the irony of the same kind of violent anti-Semitism occurring in America. At times it seemed a bit heavy for me. <br /> <br /> It looks more like a piece than a movie, but it's so thought-provoking that these little words do not mean anything. Perhaps less trivial is the fact that the whole plot depends on a small fact that struck me as quite implausible. Larry lived a life without events until middle-age; however, just start wearing a pair of glasses for everyone - ALL - to at first glance take you to a Jew. I willingly suspended disbelief because the plot held me going, but the implausibility bothered me throughout the film. (And frankly, I did not understand why his wife was also taken to a Jew.) Larry seemed to think so because her name was "Hart." And then when he married her, I do not know why his neighbors took her was Jewish.) In the first part of the film, I wondered if there were any elements of fantasy. Larry's modesty seemed exaggerated, almost to the point of the grotesque. Why not call the police to see the rape, even if the attacker was a neighbor? And I thought the lighting seemed to suggest something a little unreal - the red of the houses looked very red, Gertrude's entrance seemed deliberately super bright, usually the colors were almost crayon-like in their intensity. <br /> <br /> On the credits I see that it was filmed on Campbell Avenue and on Wallace Avenue in Toronto, so I plan to go there (near Bloor & Dufferin) today to check out the colors. Really :) It was good to remember that the clergy of the time was taking the evil from racism. (Remember how the pope refused to speak against Hitler, seeking only to obtain protection for the Church?) It was the same pope, by the way, that when Rome was about to be released by American troops, he asked that the first soldiers among in the city, do not be black.Check your history.) I do not remember hearing this movie before. This is a shame. Of course it is of great interest to all thinkers, to all those interested in American history or racism; is one of the clearest illustrations I have ever seen of Bertrand Russell's phrase: "Do not go with a crowd to do evil."
