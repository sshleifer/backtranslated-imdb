I consider Saboteur to be Hitchcock's first "American" film, because the story goes completely through in the US. <br /> <br /> There are brilliant scenes in this movie. Statue of Liberty Scene, Barry Kane jumping on bridge water, water fall scene is amazing. It's not Hitchcock's fault that he did not get the actors he wanted. Hitchcock originally wanted Gary Cooper for the lead roles in Foreign Correspondent and Saboteur. But Gary Cooper was not interested in making a thriller. Another reason why Hitchcock failed to get big stars was because he was not one of the top directors. Although Rebecca was a huge hit, most of the film's success went to producer David O. Selznick. For example, David O. Selznick received the Best Picture Oscar for Rebecca. And Hitchcock did not get an Oscar for Best Director for Rebecca. Hitchcock began to receive some attention after Foreign Correspondent (1940). But Universal gave him a low budget for the Saboteur (1942). Hitchcock tried to get Joel McCrea to this movie because he was willing to work with Hitchcock again at a low salary. He enjoyed working with Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent (1940). But he was not available. So the paper went to Robert Cummings. Hitchcock called Robert Cummings "a competent artist". I thought he did his best. He was a lesser-known actor who was willing to play a role when many great actors refused to play the leading male role. As for the leading female role, Hitchcock wanted Margaret Sullavan or Barbara Stanwyck to play the lead role. . They were not interested either. Then Universal decided to give the role to Priscilla Lane. I read in a book that this was one of her favorite movies. <br /> I also liked the scene at Blind Man's house. This is my favorite scene. If we listen more closely to the dialogue in scenes that happen at Uncle Philip's house, we will see how intense it is. Uncle Philip (Blind Man) was studying the character of Barry Kane the moment he entered his house. The moment Barry came into his house, he heard Barry's handcuffs. Through the conversation, he realized that Barry Kane is not a criminal. We also see your hearing through these scenes. For example, Barry hears the sound of a car that says "Is a car coming?" Uncle Philip says "2 cars, I guess". Uncle Philip was right. We see 2 cars in the next scene. Priscilla Lane did a great job in her role. She was not a big star. But I thought her performance was pretty good. Another bright scene at Uncle Philip's house is the scene in which he asks Priscilla Lane (Patricia Martin) "Are you scared, Pat? Is that what makes you so cruel?" I thought Otto Krueger brilliantly played the villain. Hitchcock wanted Harry Carey for the villain. But he refused. Harry Carey is famous for his role of Mr. President in "Mr. Smith is going to Washington". I want to mention more about this movie. But I think my post is getting too long. <br /> <br /> Every Hitchcock movie is special in its own way. I'm sure Hitchcock fans will like this movie. I value 10 out of 10.
