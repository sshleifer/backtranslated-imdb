I was looking forward to the release of this DVD (and it's accompanied by {Female Prisoner Scorpion: # 701's Grudge Song}) for some time. I really liked the first two films in this series. After just watching this movie, I would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three. <br /> <br /> All three of these films were directed by Shunya Ito. What's great about them, though, is that although they all have the same main character (beautifully played by Meiko Kaji), they are very different from the others. <br /> <br /> The first movie (Female Prisoner # 701: Scorpion) is more or less a typical movie, Women In Prison. But Scorpion's character is very intriguing - very reminiscent of the anti-heroes of many spaghetti westerns. And the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. <br /> <br /> The second film (Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41) is a true tour-de-force. It's not so much a WIP movie as most of the movie has Scorpion and six other fugitives on the run. <br /> <br /> This film (Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable) is the third in the series and the last directed by Shunya Ito. This is more of a crime drama. Once again, our heroine is on the run. But this time, she managed to maintain a certain amount of normalcy in her life (relatively speaking anyway). She gets a job, she finds a place to live, she makes a friend from the outside. But, of course, everything has to be unraveled eventually. FPS: Beast Stable has a more direct story that is told at a slower pace than its predecessors. But I thought it was engaging from start to finish. And do not worry: there's still a lot of depravity out there in this movie! But I think these films transcend most exploration films because the most disturbing elements are reproduced in a more upright tone, rather than being used exclusively for the shock value on their face. Yes, there were definitely moments in this movie where I cringed powerfully. But I did not feel they lowered the value of the story (well, maybe once or twice). One thing I really liked about these films is the continuing development of Scorpion myths. With this input character, the development is used much more extensively than in the previous two. We can see that it is much more than just a vengeful farce from the heart of stone! <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier in this review, a fourth film followed. He also owns Meiko Kaji as Scorpion, but had a different director. Without mentioning anything, I want to mention that the FPS: Beast Stable ends in order to make the sequel completely unnecessary. The fourth film is still very good, but seems to play as a superfluous footnote to a mind-boggling trilogy. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in unusual movies. FPS: Beast Stable can be enjoyed as a stand-alone piece (just like the first two movies), but I would also recommend watching the others first if you have not already.
