This is the movie that finally pushed me into the IMDb record so I could vote (and comment) on it. I've only recently started to enjoy well-produced "war" movies, and this is one of the most thoughtful I've ever seen. "Impressive" is the word that comes to mind when I think of this viewing experience. My husband and I watched this movie last night for the first time. It is moving smoothly but at the same time exciting (not a contradiction). This story in the hands of Hollywood could have become just another action-packed, action-packed Top Gun time-waster. <br /> <br /> The two main actors, Frantisek and Karel, played each other wonderfully well; and Krystof Hadek is a very "handsome" kid without seeming to exaggerate or exploit that fact. In terms of Hadek's acting ability and appearance, my husband said (ironic), "Well, he's not Tom Cruise." I replied, "Thank God!" If you enjoy a beautiful and discreet performance, check this out.
