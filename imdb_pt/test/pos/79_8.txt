Once again, the sacred house of Bugs is raped by careless people. This time, the traveling circus put a lion cage over the rabbit hole. So Bug has to get out of the hole and face Nero (which is the name of the lion), which he does in his usual hilarious style. After a slow and rocky start to the cart, it keeps getting better and better and ends up being quite hilarious.

This animated short can be found on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 3. My Note: A-
