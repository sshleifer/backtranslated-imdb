This movie needs to be released on DVD because it is the only way to buy it. I thought it was so funny because there was no real plan for it. It was not to be an Oscar-winning movie. I appreciate those movies. Cary Elwes was a very sweet Robin Hood. I can not even think of my favorite part of the movie because they are all very good. Either way peace out. !
