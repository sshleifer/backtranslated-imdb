This is an OK adaptation of Dan Brown's book. I can not say it's novel or very good, but they've made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better. The movie is very long, but in the end I was feeling that some things were missing. Sound effects and soundtracks were very good. Acting was well done, but the development phase of the character was very weak. For people who have not read the book, things can seem very fast. From my point of view, instead of trying to put the material in the book, they could have tried to make the most important scenes. What makes the book very good was the whole enigma as story combined with the excellent portrait of the Vatican. You do not see any of it in the movie. Too much haste and using time not in a good way, these are the main problems of the film. So worth watching, but could have been made better.
