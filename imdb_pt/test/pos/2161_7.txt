Check out the first 20 minutes, even though the suspense has not yet come into the picture. We got a good look at the super-secret Los Alamos few years after the big bomb test that helped end World War II. Except for security, it does not seem threatening. Notice how it is a TV technician, a normal and obvious guy, who takes us through security. Once finished, it's like in any US city, nice homes, quiet streets, kids going to school and a family TV in the blink of an eye. Later, we see little Tommy and little Peggy playing in the streets flanked by impressive facilities, separated by locked gates. The movie seems to be saying, "Okay, we're tough, just because we have to be. But basically, we're still just people." <br /> <br /> Now, I hope this has been a comforting task. message to the Cold War audience that is not yet accustomed to government "dooms-day" research. It is a clear effort of popular reaffirmation. The darkest note is when Tommy's mother (Clarke) worries about her son's mental state. He does not say "when I grow up"; instead, it is "If I grow up." This note of doubt reflects not only a reality of Los Alamos, but also national, who in 1952 had just seen images of the apocalyptic H-bomb. Note also how professionally FBI agents are portrayed, a standard feature of the McCarthy era fare. When brute force is needed, it is not them, but private citizen Gene Barry who criticizes information - an initial version, I suppose, of the "surrender" of the modern era. <br /> <br /> When the kidnap occurs, the suspense does not diminish. The intrigue is well handled with colorful Los Angeles locations that make us guess. The climatic scenes surrounding the cliff dwellings may not be plausible as a hiding place, but the view of northern New Mexico is large. In addition, the old stone apartments come to one of the most exotic settings of the decade. Also note the extensive use of the police helicopter that has just come into use as a law enforcement tool. Between an otherwise subjugated cast, Nancy Gates remains a brilliant presence as Professor Ellen Haskell. Never Hollywood glamorous, she was still an excellent actress and winning personality. I also hope this is one of Hopper's most successful efforts, and while people have grown accustomed to the nuclear threat, the film remains a revealing and fascinating document of their time.
