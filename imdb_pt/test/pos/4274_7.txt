This show is really the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British guy, a guy who is sometimes cool, and a super cool woman. <br /> <br /> Of course it's different because there's a singing, and there's dancing and some acting (we just do not see part of the performance). <br /> <br /> I gave this show to 7 because there are some adjustments that I know a lot of people (including me) would do if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is for the judges to decide who goes home. I know they want to find the right Danny and Sandy, but the US must have the power to decide who's going home. There is really no point for the singing. The person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway. Another thing I would change is to see them actually performing on the show. What is Broadway without acting? The last thing that needs to be changed is the music that the deleted people sing in the end. The eliminated Danny always sings the same song and the eliminated Sandy always sings the same song that comes out. As they sing every week, these songs end up getting annoying. <br /> <br /> I admit I'm not a fan of the movie, Grease, but for some reason I'm addicted. This show is very underrated. There are so many memorable performances and moments.
