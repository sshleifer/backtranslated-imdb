As a fan of the old Doctor Who, and after the mediocre Fox movie, I was left with doubts about this new series of Doctor Who. I gave it a chance, and I'm very happy about it. <br /> <br /> Yes, some episodes are not as bright as the others, but they are all fun, and yes, Eccleston's Doctor is far from being anyone I've had before, but ... The Eccleston Doctor is the best there is. Their performance is sometimes comical, sometimes dramatic, sometimes completely crazy, but always fantastic. <br /> <br /> That, and Bille Piper as Rose, make this series a little above the rest (Camille Coduri is also fantastic as Rose's mother), and there is a depth for this series not previously present. This series is incredibly powerful, especially considering its Sci-Fi. I mean, who would have thought you might feel sorry or even cry for a Dalek before that, how many times in the history of this series have we had moments like those with Rose's father, the emergency doctor and the 'Were you fantastic? ... so was the final speech? I advise anyone, whether a fan of Doctor Who or even a TV drama to buy this set on DVD, is really "Fantastic!". <br /> <br /> Now, just 4 episodes through the last series (and looking forward to the new Cybermen) I have to say that David Tennant's Doctor is not so good, of course you may disagree, but I do not I think his Doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in the previous series. I also have to say that in my opinion so far this series was not as good as the last, however, the return of Sarah Jane & K9 was a fantastic episode, a real gem. Not to say that this series is not good, just not so good. <br /> <br /> So whether you like it or not, and if you prefer Tennant or Eccleston, The Doctor is back, and he's here to stay. "Fantastic!" - Almost as many "Fantastic!" How Much The Doctor! -
