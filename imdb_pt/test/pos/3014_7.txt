The CELL fascinated me at first sight. I was a bit surprised by this fact, because the story of this movie is absolutely boring. If it had no story, the movie would be better. Bunuels "Un chien andalou" comes to my mind - a film without history, but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images. But THE CELL is, at first, a Hollywood movie, and only the second is a work of art. I am very interested in the next Tarsem project. Hamlet on Indian can be very interesting, especially when it looks the same as THE CELL. <br /> <br /> For Film Music Enthusiasts: Howard Shore's trail to THE CELL is absolutely marvelous, but a difficult experience to hear his very modernist style.
