First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy about movies. I saw Friends in the '70s when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I can still remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and can actually be very tame for teenagers today, but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love, and the determination of two young men to have a better life for themselves than they had at home. At the time, it was very risky to make a movie about some young fugitives who managed to set up the house and have a baby by themselves. No wonder the film and the soundtrack of Elton John are almost unknown today. The song is beautiful. It was unforgettable.
