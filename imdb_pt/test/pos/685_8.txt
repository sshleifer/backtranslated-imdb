I swear if I ever tried cocaine, I would be able to relate to this movie perfectly. Its rhythm, like the dialogue, moves at speeds that some spectators may need to stop and relax their heads. <br /> <br /> There are great elements that come up throughout the film, like that of Rob Lowe. character seems to be always losing a shoe, or as some characters continue to run spirals around their zigzag path. The story was elaborated extremely well and the direction seems flawless. <br /> <br /> The film smells of clumsy and cuteness. This is one I think I might like the most. Some moments of laughter, even if you are alone, ensure that I will certainly watch it again.
