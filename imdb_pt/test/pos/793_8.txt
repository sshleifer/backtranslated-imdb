Not everything, but most of this story is that Buster is mistaken for "Dead Shot Dan," a notorious criminal. <br /> <br /> There really is no story, just a series of adventures to show off Buster's physical talents that are incredible, and his comic timing. The 27-minute movie is basically one adventure after another involving primarily someone chasing our hero. <br /> <br /> Previously, there are two cops in their street races after Keaton and then it's "Big Joe." Roberts, a rotund cop - and father Buster is interested in - who chases him. Those last scenes were the best I thought of, with lots of clever jokes surrounding the hotel elevator where Big Joe and his daughter live. That was Keaton at his best. <br /> <br /> It's just a crazy half hour that makes little sense, but does it matter? It's Buster in his slapstick better, or close to him, and so serves his purpose: to entertain us. Just think: 85 years after this movie was made, there are people (like me) still discovering and taking advantage of these classics of silent comedy! Nice!
