I really liked this movie when it was first released, and on every occasion I've seen it ever since. Political drama is effective, if not especially new or inspired. The decades since the movie's release have shown that the desire to cut costs to the detriment of public safety is definitely not just something imagined by a screenwriter. <br /> <br /> However, I think the most impressive element of this film is the performance of Jack Lemmon. It is absolutely amazing to see him at work. He has the gift of being able to communicate so much, sometimes without saying a word. The next time you watch this movie, check out Jack's face at times when he's not saying anything. He does not need to talk (or worse, mugging) to let you know what's going through your mind. I'm calling it a spoiler, because of the impression it gave me when I saw the movie: in Lemmon's last scene in the movie, while he's lying on the floor, he feels a slight vibration. The terror in your eyes is one of the scariest images I have ever seen in any movie. It is a perfect performance, because it instantly transmits the threat that is about to occur - if Jack's character is so terrified, there is certainly something horrible about to happen. And that happens.
