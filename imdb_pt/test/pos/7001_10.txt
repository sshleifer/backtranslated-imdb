This movie is about the crew of a spaceship falling on a strange and bright planet with three suns. Among the passengers is the convicted serial killer, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), and his nemesis, Johns (Cole Hauser). While the survivors of the shipwreck are moving, there is an eclipse of the three suns. Shortly after, scary creatures begin to appear and begin to catch the crew members, one by one. During the eclipse, Riddick enters the scene, while his eyeballs were surgically illuminated, giving him night vision. The crew have to trust him to try to get them to safety. <br /> <br /> This is a very stylish movie, with the color of the sky changing scene by scene, giving it a very strange look. Vin Diesel is brilliant as Riddick, truly threatening, but forced to help people who would otherwise see him as a threat. There is also an underlying mood in his performance, which adds another dimension to the character. This is the type of paper in which Vin stands out, the anti-hero, whose character is not as one-dimensional as it appears for the first time. I can not imagine anyone else in this role, it could have been written specifically for him. <br /> <br /> Roll Over Riddick Chronicles!
