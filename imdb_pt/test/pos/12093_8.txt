Turkish-German director Faith Akın ("Head-On" and "The Edge of Heaven") follows the German musician and songwriter Alexander Hacke from Einstürzende Neubauten to Istanbul for this documentary that plunges into the modern musical scene of Arabesque city to indie rock and was screened out of competition at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Alexander Hacke is a friendly guide while traveling around Istanbul with a mobile recording studio and a microphone in his hand where he hits and records names like classic rocker Erkin Koray, rapper Ceza, Kurdish singer Aynur Doğan, arabesque singer Orhan Gencebay and pop star Sezen Aksu, as well as rock bands Baba Zula, Duman and Replikas. The director brought together a diverse collection of popular artists and groundbreaking artists of what at the time was a highly competitive list of candidates for eclectic account of modern Turkish music seen from the streets of its cultural capital that enchant and entertain even though it sometimes seems a bit rushed and out of focus. <br /> <br /> "Music can reveal to you all about a place."
