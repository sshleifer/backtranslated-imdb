In addition to being a portrait of a lesbian love story, FIRE is also a comic satire of middle-class Indian culture (?). I think this is a quality that is little appreciated about the movie. These two genres (that is, a deep history of alternative love and a comic satire) usually blend as well as oil and water, but Mehta (somehow) manages to reach balance to perfection. The behavior of the servant Jatin, the family's treatment of him, the inescapable presence of the grandmother in bed, Ashok's obsession with the teachings of a Swami: coming from a culture very similar to that of India, are things I can immediately identify as typical. They have been clamoring to be pointed and ridiculed. While developing his main subject, Mehta manages to cleverly reach this secondary theme. In fact, much of the film's humor, which provides essential relief for the heavy themes of the lesbian taboo and gender issues, comes from this seemingly common satire. The movie flows from the comic to the serious with great subtelty. <br /> <br /> All in all, brilliant use of symbolic devices (Radha compared to Sita of legend and coming out of fire unharmed and therefore pure; the whole life of young Radha's desire to see the ocean finally reached when she wins freedom). Many compliments to Shabana Azmi (Radha), the lighting team and Deepa Mehta; his not Hollywood-like talents (and not like Bollywood!) have made this movie special. One criticism: the first scenes seemed quite disjointed for me, as they did not flow very well for each other. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 9 out of 10. Nothing less for a movie with scenes so burned in my mind.
