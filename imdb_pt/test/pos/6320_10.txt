I own this movie. I am from the same city as the brother directors. But that does not improve the movie. But if one night you want to watch something not serious, and do not have high expectations, strongly recommend the Demon Summer. Yes, the lines are cheesy and the plot is tacky. But it contains key elements of a horror / comedy. I just want to see kids from a small town making a movie full of effects. And I say "angry" to the brothers Campell. They are now making more movies and continuing a long dream. Demon Summer was one of the movies that will help them start a great career with a great future.
