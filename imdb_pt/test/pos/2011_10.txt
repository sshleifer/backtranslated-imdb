This was a classic of modern TV! The story goes like this, Bob has a girlfriend named Alice. Bob and Alicia are in love and want to get married. Bob has a bud named Owen with whom he works. Owen is jealous of Alice. He likes to hang out with Bob. Now Owen walks with Bob and Alice. Bob and Owen have a secretary named Heather. Heather is very accident-prone. She is also, if you have not guessed it, it's kind of lonely. She also hangs out with Bob and Alicia and Owen. Sometimes Alicia wants Bob to have no friends. At the end of season one, Owen finally saw himself as a longtime girlfriend. Bob and Alicia were driving the night before the wedding, picking up a tiny car and then getting stuck. Out in the middle of nowhere! What happened next? What about poor Heather? Someone got married? Sorry, series is over. <br /> <br /> Not even a request from TV Guide made FOX think twice before putting it back on the air. It was a great show with a great cast. I loved Heather, too. She looked cool in those glasses and was hilarious. I really miss this show. It's like reading a good book with the ending missing ... sad.
