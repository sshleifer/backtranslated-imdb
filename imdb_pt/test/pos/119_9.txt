I finally watched the third movie in the Mehta trilogy: "Fire." To begin with, I would say that "Water" was the undisputed masterpiece at all levels. The fire then comes with the Earth just behind in order of quality. Fire: There's so much going on in this movie that I'll need some more visions to drink it all. Writing is superb, the script creating friction that starts the entire "heat" process from start to finish. when it really explodes in a fire, conflicts become a complete breakdown of relationships. <br /> <br /> Mehta is a courageous lady: she sees with a clear eye of much of what jaundice is, false and repressive about the great society from which she came. India is changing rapidly these days, but much of that is economic change. The fact that she faced such fierce opposition to the creation of "Water" after having the clean script showed that there are still many taboo subjects that Indians can not look at directly more than they can not examine or discuss. Worse, if someone like Mehta has the courage to show a mirror for these issues, she faces death threats. Thus, as much as India considers itself a pluralistic and tolerant society, the facts are not always the case. Considering that "Earth" was merely a historical scenario of the carnage of civil war after India's independence, Fire and Water point to personal, social, and religious issues, which as I say are considered so strongly (in a negative sense) Artistic dialogue is still many years away. As I write this "Water" is scheduled to be actually shown in India later this year. I'll believe it when I see it. <br /> <br /> The fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional enigma that I saw in "A price above rubies". Whether it be arranged marriages (which used to be as among Jews about 150 years ago, or as it is among many modern Indians), they run the risk of having a bad combination forced on men and women; or, simply loveless marriages ..... However, this is not the real problem. Mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to unloving marriages (Fire). I am no expert in secular or Hindu laws concerning divorce. The film seems to imply that the stigma (of divorce) is almost as bad as the sad marriage. Anyway, Mehta's film is a very moving and powerful attempt at sexual discourse that keeps modern Indian relations under investigative scrutiny. That all these three films made themselves felt in India as an undue attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mindset. Mehta is forcing the issues to be analyzed no matter how much flack. I admire her work and I can not recommend her films enough. Superb, disturbing, provocative, taboo-destroying.
