Giant Robot was the most popular Japanese TV series ever seen on Indian TV. It was aimed at kids and we saw a robot for the first time in our life. <br /> <br /> Many Indian children must have seen a machine for the first time out of schoolbooks. <br /> <br /> The series also showed a child in an adult organization battling evil. No doubt many of us who saw the Giant Robot in our childhood eager for our own robots and as a temporary arrangement, stare at our computers in the same way. <br /> <br /> This show also portrayed ideal adults (referring to Jerry, friend of Johnny and head of the Unicorn, Azuma). We grew to respect Japanese progress and still see Japan as the ideal Asian nation. BTW, at that time, there were no satellite TV channels in India and the government-owned broadcaster did not show much of the Disney cartoons. I think that's how children's shows like the giant robot were appreciated. Nowadays there are Pokemon etc, but they are not as fascinating or attractive as the giant robot.
