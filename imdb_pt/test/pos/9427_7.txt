Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) engage in an intelligence battle to control Switz's newest vision creation. Holmes wants to protect him for the British, while Moriarty is not above selling to the Nazis. While undoubtedly many fans will be disappointed to see Holmes upgraded to the 1940s war scenario, this particular movie proves a light amusement that does not invade propaganda during the war, as it might have done . . Inspector Lestrade, of Dennis Hoey, and dr. Watson by Nigel Bruce tend to steal the show as the characters' clumsy methods consistently provide delightful comic relief. The dispute between Holmes and Moriraty is colorful and well thought out to boot. Atwill goes as well as Moriarty, even if it's not as memorable as some others who did the part. While this does not provide anything especially new or exciting to the fans of the series, it is a wonderful escape from reality, something appropriate for 1942 in my opinion, which mirrors many serial adventures of 1930s films and 1940, but it has a more compact and less repetitive plot. And all this is done while still remaining true to the basic spirit of Sherlock Holmes.
