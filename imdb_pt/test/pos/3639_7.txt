I know Gerrit. He currently lives in the USA. This film is based on events from the life of Gerrit and Celeste Wolfaardt. It's a remarkable story. This inspired me to read "Cry, Beloved Country". The film is well produced. The song is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The story is told in flashbacks. You learn the stories of a white South African racist (Gerrit) and a black South African (Moses). Their lives intersect violently. The ending is not typical of Hollywood - it's extraordinarily realistic and ends with a note that encourages you to think about the characters and themes. <br /> <br /> Watch the credits - you'll get see real-life Gerrit pictures.
