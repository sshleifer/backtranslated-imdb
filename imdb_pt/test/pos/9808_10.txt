Even people who do not like the film, usually because they find the ending confusing, should appreciate the strong performance of Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello, who played the two young leaders in this film. <br /> <br /> Spoiler WARNING: At a literal level, the ending does not make sense. People who think the ending makes sense at other levels are split between those who 1) think the younger brother was killed by his stepfather or the only time Mike (the eldest boy) was dealing with the neighborhood gang or fled the point of desire in his wagon to escape the situation through death and those 2) who think that the younger brother is imaginary and his flight in the wagon transformed into a flying machine signals his overcoming of the abusive situation. <br /> <br /> I'm in favor of 2). It makes a lot of sense in terms of how many children deal with abusive situations. It is not uncommon for an abused child to divide his psyche and project the abused self into something else; a stuffed animal, even an imaginary friend. In this way, it makes a lot more sense that it is always the youngest boy who is abused and never Mike. In fact, one of the two brothers is unlikely to achieve all abuses, although this will happen. In addition, it's Bobby, the younger brother who is also the encouraging one, the one who insists they can overcome the situation. In addition, the death of a real-life sibling through abuse would have been too much for an adult with that in his story to turn into a fantasy ending like this.
