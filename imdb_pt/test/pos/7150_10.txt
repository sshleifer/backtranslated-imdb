I was surprised that "Forgive the Franklins" did not generate more buzz this year at the Sundance Film Festival. There were times when the laughter on the screen I saw was so loud you could barely hear the movie. The film has an excellent acting and a story that really does an examination of broader issues. You know little problems like religion, sex, and truth. Many comedies seem to rely on the same old improvised situations, many leave you thinking, "I know they got it out of some sitcom." This movie takes off in its own unique direction. I really think Jay Floyd did a fantastic job on a tight budget in this movie.
