I was very disappointed when this show was canceled. Although I can not vote. I live on the island of Aruba. I sat down to watch the show on Tuesday. And he was very surprised that it was not aired. The next day I read on the internet that it was canceled. <br /> <br /> It's true that not everyone was as talented as the other. But there were very talented people singing. <br /> <br /> I find it very sad for them. <br /> <br /> That they worked so hard and that dreams collapsed. <br /> <br /> It's a pity <br /> <br /> Ariette Croes
