This is a cult movie for many reasons. First because of phenomenal success as a musical both on Broadway and in London, then as a musical movie. The film is close to the play and part of the provocative play was no longer provocative twelve years later. The speech against the Vietnam War is no longer a song of protest against the war itself, but a strong song that shows how the young people of the past 60 years have succeeded in overthrowing the political establishment. Milos Forman plays with some situations in the late 1970s as narrow-minded justice, the self-centered umbilical justice of the rich or the little ones who have only one power station more than the powerless. He also plays with the racial element and sexual ambiguity he constructs all the time. The film remains pleasant and thoughtful. And of course it's such a thrill to remember those years when we had the privilege, and that was not a chance, to live them. November 11, 1969, Nixon ordering the mass celebration of the armistice of 1918, which became the order for teachers of all levels to take their pupils to the celebration and march, thus supporting the invasion of Cambodia that was in full swing. And some dare give democracy classes to foreign countries. I also remember the long campaign for Nixon's impeachment in 1973-1974 that eventually led to his resignation and swearing in of Gerald Ford, the first vice president and eventually US president who had not been elected since he was appointed vice president by the Senate after Spiro Agnew had to resign to face trial, conviction and penalty for embezzlement. Of course, that makes us think today, when in 2000 a US president was not elected by the people, but by the Supreme Court, or by a war that was rejected by millions around the world from the beginning, and even before the beginning, and was initiated against the best judgment of the United Nations and three permanent members of the Security Council. And some speak of a new world order based on respect for others. Modern Western man seems to have some trouble understanding that the world is changing and that it has changed widely and wisely. Modern Western man seems to be out of sync and need special night classes to learn that democracy wants the majority of the world to be the majority, and that the West is far from that majority, and that if the Soviet bloc had managed to understand that market economy is not capitalism but market economy can be socialist or capitalist, the Berlin Wall would have fallen, but the opposite, and that China learned this lesson wonderfully well and is at the foot of the wall that they have Scalar to learn that the socialist market economy has to lead to political democracy, but they will, like Vietnam, was able to rebuild after thirty years of aggression and war damage. In other words, hair is a perfect food for thought. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris University 1 Sorbonne Pantheon and Versailles Saint Quentin University in Yvelines
