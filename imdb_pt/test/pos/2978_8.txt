This movie has grabbed me from the start, where a sweet-looking teenage girl is shown visiting a tomb alone, so the powerful music of Elton John "Friends" begins to play as she appears walking alone through the streets of Paris carrying a bag, naively unaware of the theft of cars and prostitution happening around her. The entire movie is a beautiful, romantic collection of young love scenes, holding hands, living in the field, wild horses running wild, fields of wildflowers, sunsets, wine toast, nights by the fireplace, fun and general innocence, all set for romantic music by Elton John. It's magic. <br /> <br /> Somehow I missed seeing this movie when I was growing up. I'm sure it would have left a strong impression on me if I had seen it then. I remember the radio ad for the movie in 1971, talking about what a special movie was with Elton John's music, and the chorus of the song "Friends" playing the ad ("Makin 'friends for the world to see. .. "), but I never heard anything more about it in those days, and I never got to see it until I rented it 35 years after a video store. By now it had been edited, censored, and all sorts of unhappy people with angry political agendas used all kinds of ugly words to describe the movie. What can I say? The world has gone crazy ever since. <br /> <br /> The story is that a 14-year-old girl is forced to live with her cousin in Paris after her parents die. (It was their grave that she was visiting at the opening scene.) One day, when she visited the zoo alone, she met a 15-year-old boy, they got on well and agreed to meet the next day. The next day, walking together, the boy accidentally drives his car into a lake in a strange car accident alone. It was his father's car, he can not bear to go home to face his father's wrath, so the two teenagers start living together inside France, with the mutual past they both hated at home. They settle into an unoccupied house, the boy picks up odd jobs to support himself, his supposed friendship turns into romance, the girl gets pregnant and they manage to have a baby at home. All the while the boy's father has the police trying to locate his missing son. On a one-year anniversary of the couple's flight together, police have finally located the boy's employer through a personal inquiry, and it is said they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work. The next morning, the boy is shown leaving his house to go to work, saying a sweet goodbye to his girlfriend / wife, and happily doing somersaults while the scene freezes his girlfriend saying goodbye. At least that's how the video version I saw ends. It is an unexpected but timely end, presumably representing the last moments of happiness before the boy is taken back to his parents' home and his happy life with his wife and baby is destroyed. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as the story and the pictures are, the plot is very unrealistic and highly invented. I think it's better to just enjoy the movie as the fantasy of a young man's dream and not go further in the analysis because all logic and credibility quickly collapse when the story is examined in more depth. Why would a fully furnished and stocked cottage be left unattended with the door unlocked and unvisited for a whole year? What did they plan to do when the owners came back? Why would a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant with him? Did not they think it was unethical to use other people's homes and food? How could they expect to get needed dental care or other emergency medical care while living out of society? How could the boy have a car accident on a country road with no collision and no other cars around? Where are there near places of civilization where wild horses race freely? How come a teenager would not have sex as the main thing in mind when he catches a girl in a zoo? (The lyrics of Elton John's songs just do not fit.) Why would they strip off when they slept outside at night when it's about to cool down? And so on. The wild horse scenes are invented to attract girls, as well as the unrealistic theme of "friendship before romance," and all the scenes of washing and tickling with their predictable results, the race through the flower fields among each other, mist filters . , the scenes shot through wildflowers in the foreground, the baby ducks, and so on. It works, but it's definitely invented. <br /> <br /> Still, this is a film about youth and freedom, and that ideal has not changed since the 1970s. Today's young people are still treated as lost belongings or pets to be retrieved by the police, rather than being treated as mature human beings who have the same needs for romantic love and freedom as the adult world and the ability to be responsible when freedom. So the message is universal. It's clear why a sequel would not work: this story is about a one-year magic real-world postponement. Such a situation could never have been extended indefinitely, supposing that this could happen in the first place, and a story about real life later would not have the magical appeal of such an unreal state of existence. I really hope no teenager has taken the film seriously enough to try such a silly feat. But I also hope that teenagers who were impressed by this film in the 1970s have learned something from it and have since tried to make such a magical world a more accessible reality for others, rather than perpetuate the various hatreds and repressions of society. especially in their own children.
