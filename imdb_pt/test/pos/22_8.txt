What is worth mentioning that is omitted from the other reviews I read here is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behavior of gays in the era portrayed in the film. Although Courtenay's character is evidently gay, he is not the only one: the often talked about Mr. Davenport-Scott is the other, and the reason why he is never seen, the reason alluded to his disappearance seems to be that he has was arrested by the police for homosexual activity - a criminal offense in England at the time. <br /> <br /> We can read under the surface that this recent event has disturbed Norman, the character of Courtenay: and we can also see in a passing the observation of Oxenby, the character of Edward Fox, the rapid waiver of any connection with such a person when the law is involved: fear of association affects many of the characters, and is part of the picture the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it. Courtenay's abandonment of the end by Sir was anticipated to the end if this subtext is included: it also makes sense both the inexplicable omission of his Dresser from the list of those to whom he gives thanks. The exuberance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of desire and fear that Courtenay must "step into the limelight," as he does when he announces impending air incidents, a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous, but which is either a representation symbolic and literal of the inner torment of man. So while the drama is from the decline of Finney's lord, a large part of the tragedy of the film and the play comes from the "fatal flaw." "Courtenay's homosexuality, and makes it a film about him, as the title suggests.The direction of art, rhythm, and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another era, more distant than the eighties, and in some respects, even the second world war, the implicit portrait of a society still attached to an older moral order, and the sympathy of the character tormented and ruined by the cruelties of this order, necessarily trapped in the closed world of the theater, and the knowledge we have how much of it all would be swept after the war makes this movie even more poignant, despite all its flaws.
