It's so refreshing to see such a movie with real humor and personality instead of just a bunch of CGI cartoon tricks. This is a great horror parody that has genuine shivers alongside some really great series and performances. Their laughter is subtle but abundant. Since there is very little or no CGI, there is no need to violently shake the camera to hide the low quality effects. This makes the film immensely watchable compared to the other movies of that genre that have emerged in the last decade or so. <br /> <br /> Much nicer than the refined big-budget trash being released today in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> See.
