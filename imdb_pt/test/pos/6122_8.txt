For me, Pink Flamingos lived up to its reputation as the shocking, disgusting, disgusting, useless movie I had hoped for, which really does contain everything except the kitchen sink. We are treated with almost two hours of evil that never fails to happen: rape, sex, chicken sex, transsexuals, castration, murder, cannibalism and a horrible sight of singing the anus. It's about a strange couple who start a competition with a family of trailer trash, trying to steal their title from "the dirtiest living people". Divine (a fat guy in the drag) is an incredibly vile human being, who actually becomes painful to watch. Believe me when I say this movie is not to be quickly forgotten, especially the final scene in which Divine eats crap on the sidewalk. I always thought John Waters was super-rated and I can not say I like this movie, but it's an experience if you get the chance to see it.
