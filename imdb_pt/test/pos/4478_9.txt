My opinions do not flow with most in most cases. I tend to lean towards artistic, imaginative and different. This film was reminiscent of Frances Ford's "The Black Stallion," in which a fantasy situation is created to show off the beauty of a magnificent creature that is not readily available to see at its peak, except in these multitudes of natural documentaries. Unlike nature movies, this offering uses the best film-making techniques the industry has to offer, for a diva who creates one of the hottest super-stars (the cat) on the screen. <br /> <br /> This fantasy that describes the love relationship that develops between a French soldier (he is very good too) lost in the Egyptian desert and a female leopard that he encounters when he approaches an abandoned Egyptian temple is mesmerizing. I bought it with all my heart. If you are a little open to fantasy and appreciate the grace, beauty, power and sensuality of the feline, you should take advantage of it. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in my book was the end. It was a perfect setup for an end to Romeo and Juliet - that would have taken me to the top. <br /> <br />
