Does anyone know why this movie is called couch travel? I was just watching and still not sure why this title was chosen the movie was very funny and probably my favorite Dan Aykroyd performance that he even knocks out his performance Ghostbusters I had never heard of the movie before I saw it in a Sears store I read the back and thought it sounded good, so I bought it and when I finally got a chance to watch, I thought it was better than what I originally expected. This movie is as good as the houses of animals and the holidays of pasquim in my mind I wish that the comedies that have been released lately have been written so as this was nothing sad happens and the bad things that happen are also funny parts if someone but feel this way and I would like to read a comedy script for a movie that does not have a sad situation and send me an email to killer2511@hotmail.com
