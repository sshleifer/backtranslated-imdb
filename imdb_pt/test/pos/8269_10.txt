Just from reading the reviews of this wonderful BBC mini series reminded me how much I liked that when it was first broadcast many years ago. At the time, I remember waiting in anticipation for the next installment and fell in love with John Bowe and Janet McTeer, two talented actors that we do not see enough on TV or in the movies nowadays. <br /> <br /> I tried unsuccessfully to get several fantastic BBC dramas of the past, including the 1973 version of Jane Eyre and the 1972 version of Anne of Green Gables, all wonderful timeless classic stories that unfortunately the BBC seems have no intention of casting on video or DVD. If someone else learns, I would love to hear from them. <br /> <br /> However, we will have to make do with our memories of how wonderful they were.
