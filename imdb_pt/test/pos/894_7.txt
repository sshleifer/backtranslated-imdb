You know you're watching the softcore with the wrong attitude when poor dubbing bothers you. I'm fine with bad lip sync, but the sound mix is ​​good too. Every time someone says something, it looks like there is a storyteller. Either way, this is basically the purgatory between boring French professionalism and Joe D'Amato's heavenly movies involving cannibalism and everything. Do not get me wrong, there's a fair amount of exploration in this, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser star, and that's good because she's hot. It's a little strange how sometimes you can see its bony structure, but it still dominates its white counterpart. You can also make a cool drink set of how often she takes her kit. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good. Every place is good. One scene involves even an entire hockey team, whatever they are doing in Africa. Sometimes the plot gets in the way, and the supporting cast consists of some really despicable people, but Laura Gemser is enough for everyone.
