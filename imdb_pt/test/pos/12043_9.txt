Darr (1993) was an incredible film. In my opinion, it is one of the best in Bollywood. The film itself triggers feelings of sympathy, fear, confusion, happiness and sadness. Shahrukh's role was unbelievable, in fact he gave obsession a new face. Juhi Chawla's innocent and girlie character contrasted greatly with Shahrukh's ardent and passionate character. The role of Sunny Deol made the "nice" role look like "bandit". The fact that Shahrukh, not Sunny's, has captivated the public's attention, proves that everyone has that inner urge to seek something that is not really in their hands. Even if the film is several years old, it surpasses any recent. The song "Tu Mere Samne" was full of passion and meaning. His personality fit the paper perfectly. He should seriously consider re-starring in a similar movie.
