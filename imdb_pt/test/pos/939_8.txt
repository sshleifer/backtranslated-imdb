Brilliant Australian movie ... A bit slow at first, but once it starts you can not stop laughing. When I saw the film, I vaguely knew the plot, because I'm not sure if many people are aware that this film is based on a true story, and more particularly in particular the director and his mother (obviously names have changed). ). I only knew this because the director is a friend of a friend of my family. When I saw the movie, somehow my stepmother kept it a secret that we were to meet Matthew Newton after the screening ... Such a good gentleman (except for a particularly nasty incident with his ex)! Brillian casting also with Sam Neill and others! A great reason to continue supporting the Australian film industry
