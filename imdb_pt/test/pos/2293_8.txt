You have to have lived in Japan for some time to enjoy the beauty of this movie! I lived in Okinawa for over 2 years, and north of Honshu by 4. Believe it or not, what you see paints a very good and accurate picture of east / west mentality contrasts, both from a sports perspective and from personal relationships. A funny, funny and moving film that deserves better than the Americans who see it can judge. 8+ of 10!
