TV presenter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her radical Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are in a nuclear power plant when a serious accident occurs. Factory managers play less, but Adams filmed everything. Wells and Adams try to put it in the air, but the corporation that manages the plant avoids it. Factory executive Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) realizes that there are serious problems and tests have been falsified. He tries to convince the executives to believe in him - only they know it. Wells, Adams, and Godell think that all their lives are in danger. <br /> <br /> I saw this in a movie theater in 1979. I was only seventeen and it scared me. To make matters worse, the accident at Three Mile Island happened around that time, making the movie more real. Seeing this more than 20 years later does not scare me, but it's still an excellent movie - it functions as a mystery, an exciting drama and an exhibition about the nuclear power industry. Fonda (with red hair) has one of her best roles as Wells - she seamlessly conveys the growing suspicion and horror of her character when she realizes that a nuclear disaster could happen. Lemmon is (as always) excellent. He begins to believe in his company and at work and slowly begins to unravel when he begins to figure things out. He was nominated for an Oscar for that. Douglas is good, but he has a small part and is completely overshadowed by Lemmon and Fonda. <br /> <br /> A great movie - one of the best of the 70's. Do not miss this one!
