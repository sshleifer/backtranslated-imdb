This movie turned out to be pretty much what I expected. Of course it's sentimental, of course it's predictable. We all know the fairy tale. But knowing that when you go to watch, it's nice enough to watch. It was funny and sweet. I found it annoying that they showed nerds like kids who did not wash their hair or kids who loved math and joined math clubs and wore math t-shirts. I was an outcast in high school and did not do these things. This is much deeper than that. Having to do with many things, some of them are how much money your family has, how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and how you are willing to be for other children. Anyway, I will not go into that. I do not agree with other opinions that Drew is not convincing as a geek. With braces, no make-up and dirty hair, I do not think many people would be drooling over her. And even when she goes back to high school and loses those things. She is still wearing the "wrong" clothes, "wrong" hair and has the "wrong" attitude of being considered legal. And your other "geek" friend can be cute, but no matter, where I come from, you can still be a pariah and be beautiful. (in and out)
