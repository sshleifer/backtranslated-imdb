I'm not sure what to do with this movie, especially after seeing a great movie like La Notte. Unfortunately I saw this in German during an Antonioni film festival at the Frankfurt Film Museum, so I could not hear Malkovich's great voice. He was supposed to tie four stories about couples in Italy. However, even though he is a good actor, Malkovich can not rescue the most ridiculous of the four stories depicted here: a woman who comes to him at a seaside cafe near a store he owns and lets go as he killed his father close by. So the two go home, have sex and he leaves. It seems that Antonioni has lost the finesse of previous films (like The Passenger) in dealing with sex and replaced it with blatant nudity. <br /> <br /> No matter the plot, the movie features two things that make it eye-catching: eye and ear candy. The actors and actresses are all beautiful people, and the cinematography is wonderful - scenes in old Italian cities that contrast a bit in a tall building overlooking a city (reminiscent of La Notte). <br /> <br /> Sweetheart, though, is what really makes the movie worth watching. U2 and Brian Eno collaborated on "Your Blue Room" and "Beach Sequence", both setting the mood perfectly in the film. The songs are available in "Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1".
