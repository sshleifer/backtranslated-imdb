I love this movie. The portrait of Shehzad Khan as Bhalla a.k.a "Shut up, Robert!" It was so hilarious. Whenever he was hit during a fight scene, you could hear him squeal. Viju Khote is the perplexed Robert a.k.a "Rabbit". I love this Shakti Kapoor a.k.a "Crime Master Gogo". The dual role of Paresh Rawal is as unbelievably hilarious for his interpretation as Ramgopal Bajaj & Shyamgopal Bajaj. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor are out of this world. My brother does a very good imitation of Bhalla saying. "Relax. PLEASE relax." I love the scene where Aamir Khan puts a laxative on the food of Salman "Muscles" Khan that caused the irregular bowel movements forcing him to use the toilet many times.
