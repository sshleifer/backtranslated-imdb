This is one of my favorite books and I remember seeing this series and loving it immensely. Unfortunately I've never seen it repeated or being able to get into DVD, but it has caused so much impact that I've never forgotten. The protagonists were perfect for the roles, especially the beautiful Bryan Brown and although the scenes in Australia were not entirely in line with the book, at least they were there, unlike the film version with Virginia McKenna who lost that part completely. <br /> <br /> I agree that Gordon Jackson's Strachan character is totally different from the book, but he's still excellent. For your information "MOLEY75" "Strawn" is the Gaelic pronunciation of "Strachan".
