first real movie this year. Surprising long-range shots, sometimes with camera correction, so specific to Nordic cinema (leave aside the Dogma). A real author movie I think. Athmospherique :-) He simply enchanted all my senses and has in mind how the image gets violent and painful during the scenes when he is trying to kill himself. That's the point I do not think is supported by the whole plot. Why, if this was an ideal world, you could not die, but still you were keeping your consciousness? Either it was the real world with rules "tailored" or it was a "fantastic" world, but in this case no accident as people remembering how it was before can happen. <br /> <br /> This reminded me of Kafka and perhaps more of Huxley's Brave new world, especially in the part where sex was really available to all, since it was seen as a right to pleasure. There was a plot missing, but I think it was better this way, since you realized and felt all the strange behavior of all, the absurd and the lack of real sensations in this "happy" world. <br /> <br /> I also think the ending was brilliant. The real world is indeed a homo homini lupus, you are eaten if you are not strong enough.
