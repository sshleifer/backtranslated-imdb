I saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival and I was also surprised that it did not generate more news, because it was not only powerful and beautifully crafted but very original. The audience was totally engaged and most of watching a movie like this at a festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and take part in the question and answer session later. They literally had to kick us out of the screening room for the next movie - we could have gone on for a lot longer. The film is thought-provoking and hilarious at the same time. It will be a shame if this film is not chosen for a wider distribution - I hope it's at least available on DVD because I want to see it again and share it with everyone I know.
