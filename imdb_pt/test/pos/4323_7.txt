Woaww Is it only now that you notice the links between all the characters? Of course it's Libby! And for the guy in the hatch with Desmond, any deja vu ??? Yes !! He was the "same" guy who gave Sayid money after he killed or tortured the other soldier in episode 14 of season two: One. Well, actually it's not quite the same guy, he's called Joe in episode 14 and Kelvin in the last 2 episodes. Gemini ?? :) Who knows ?? JJ Abrams ... mmmm I'm not even sure of that :) There are hundreds of links like this among all the characters. <br /> <br /> But that was only in response to Libby's comment. <BR> <BR> I found these two episodes to be much more interesting than all season 2. Throughout that season, I felt that there were many things I lost and very few things I learned. Especially at the beginning, the first episode of season 2 is excellent, and then the 2nd is a kind of flashback of the 1st ... I found this disappointing even though I'm sure everything in Lost has a meaning. That was just one example of how frustrated I was to watch those episodes. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the last 2 episodes. I think we learned more new things in these 2 episodes than in the whole season. But all we've learned is small pieces for the next puzzle, such as the involvement of Desmond's "relatives" (sorry if I mess up too much, believe it or not, for example). So many things evoked in the last 2 seasons are still unclear or were developed once and then nothing. And there is still new material as if all the holes in the picture were not enough. We all want to see the big picture of all this, of course, but I think we'll have to be very patient. I hope there are only 3 seasons. I'm not sure I'll watch more than 3 seasons anyway. There were also many actions in the last episode. And a good moment of suspense in the end. <br /> <br /> So basically, yes, I loved this last episode ... and yes, I want to see the third season.
