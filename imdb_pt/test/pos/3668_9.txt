UNCONDITIONAL LOVE is surprisingly fun. While the plot unfolds in perhaps too many directions, making a long movie, it never fails to delight and insinuate itself. The various plots, one warmly reminiscent of SHIRLEY VALENTINE, provide ample smiles, laughter, wisdom and tenderness. Everything should not work, and sometimes it certainly works, but forgive your inconsistencies, sit back and enjoy yourself. It's a lovely!
