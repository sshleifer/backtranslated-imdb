One of the main aspects of "Malenkaya Vera" (called "Little Vera" in English) is that it was the first Soviet film that presented a scene of sex, although short. The title is important: Vera is the Russian word for "faith", identifying that punk Vera (Natalya Negoda) has little faith in the Soviet system. And, as the movie shows, there is not much faith to have in it. The opening scene shows the gloomy industrial city of Zhdanov, almost a hell on earth. When Vera's lover, Sergei (Andrey Sokolov) moves in with his family, this leads to some unexpected events. <br /> <br /> As in many Russian films, people's names describe their characters. For example, there is Viktor (remember that "victor" means winner). All in all, this is a good look at the Soviet Union while it was collapsing - and we can see why it was collapsing. Very good.
