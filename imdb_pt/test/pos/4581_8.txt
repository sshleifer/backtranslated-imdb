One can not help but admire Mike Judge for his hands in the "I've tried it" approach. With the "Office Space", almost everyone who works can associate with the characters. "Idiocracy" has exactly the same feel. One can easily appreciate the 505 years of experience of our heroes, because again, the director tried to put things on a very human level. Somewhat similar to Woody Allen's "Sleeper," this movie is very funny. Do not miss the deleted scenes as the "Museum Of Fart" is a classic. Imaginative comedy is a rarity, and "Idiocracy" is incredibly imaginative, extremely funny and a solid experience of 8.0 films. - MERK
