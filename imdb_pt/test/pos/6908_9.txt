I went to see "I Sell The Dead" by Glenn McQuaid in his North American debut at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. Since this is the second screening around the world, I did not know exactly what to expect from this film, especially for not having seen the short film that inspired this film adaptation. <br /> <br /> I'll start with a slightly more elaborate synopsis of the plot, without giving any spoilers. <br /> <br /> This movie is about Arthur Blake as he became a tomb robber and the interesting and supernatural discoveries he and his mentor discovered. <br /> <br /> The costumes and scenography of this film were excellent. I was amazed to learn that the entire movie was filmed in New York. The costumes were very accurate for the time, really bringing you as a bystander to the mentality of the time. This movie works just as well as a period piece, like a horror comedy. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the two tracks was very fluid. They played with each other with ease. The dialogue between the two was very well written, with Glenn adding his comic touch even in tense situations. <br /> <br /> The story is very comprehensive and the ball begins to roll from the beginning. I would compare this to a visual page turner, always wondering what will happen next. The characters themselves are very vivid and unique adding different emotional layers to the movie itself. <br /> <br /> All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone in the mood for some dark humor, with a bit of horror mixed in. <br /> <br /> 9/10
