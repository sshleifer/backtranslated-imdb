I thought that this movie was excellent, quirky and different than the usual film of the noncommittal cop that captures the serial killer movie. Kiefer Sutherland was brilliant as always - I really do not think I saw anything he did where he has not acted brilliantly. The dialogue was funny, sometimes illuminating the mood, and the surrounding storyline. Thanks to other reviewers for showing the link to Alice in Wonderland - I had not realized that. I would recommend this movie to any Kiefer Sutherlands fan (like me) and anyone who wants to watch a fun movie for a few hours. Too bad it has not been released in theaters to a wider audience.
