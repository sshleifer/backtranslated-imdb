This horror movie is definitely one of the best I have ever seen in my life and there are many reasons why. The plot is very good, has lots of action and great sequences of terror. The actors are not very good, but they are not so bad, but Kane is definitely the best actor, but he's always been a good actor as well. The cast is very good. like Kane as Jacob Goodnight, Christina Vidal as Christine, Michael j. Pagan as Tye, Samantha Noble as Kira, etc. I just have to warn you that the murder scenes are very disturbing, but they are very creative, but that makes it better and you can not have a horror movie without blood and blood. seems very realistic. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed not to see evil, because it's a really good movie. So make sure that you rent or purchase sees no evil because it is so great. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ********** out of ********* * <br /> <br /> ***** out of ** ***
