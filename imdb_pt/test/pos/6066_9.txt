We have just watched the last show in the SBS network and miss out on our weekly dose of the Danish Delight. My wife and I took the show after the Swedish show "The Eagle" ended and seemed, by comparison, to be a very poor replacement for our favorite TV show. Week after week, however, the show grew in me, and though not as brilliant as the Swedish show and definitely tougher in terms of everyday crime investigations, it certainly provided a really satisfying weekly meal. <br /> <br /> Before these 2 shows I really had not been a fan of the police genre and I can not say that I am now, but the two Scandinavian shows really gave us insight into life in these northern Euopean countries through from the eyes of his special policing.
