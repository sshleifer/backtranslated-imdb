The trilogies are very interesting. Some go out with a bang (Lord of the Rings), some get progressively weaker (Matrix), some get lost in the dark (Blade, Back to the Future), but some retain genius, that seemingly growing light that floats beyond the surface of its impeccable exterior. Case and point: "Three Colors Trilogy". This chapter of the trilogy, being the last, is the most philosophical and thought-provoking. In "Blue" we had a more visually stunning, more character-driven plot, in "White" it was more a light, narrative-driven story where we hear more of what the characters say than anything. "Red", however, is focused on "what ifs" and "how it comes". It questions our own destiny and focuses mainly on the past and future than on the present. <br /> <br /> This chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and takes it back to its owner. She soon discovers that the dog owner is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on her neighbors' phone calls through advanced spy equipment. All three films in the trilogies have very basic plots, but bring much more to the story. Consider in "Blue," the story of a woman dealing with the loss of her loved ones. We are constantly shown ideas about contemporary French society and how this reflects the behavior of the character. "Red" is not just about a young woman who finds shelter in the life of an older man, but also about chance, hope and fate. <br /> <br /> Irene Jacob stars as Valentine Dussaut, who at first meets the old (Jean-Louis Trintignant), whom we never find the name, extremely selfish and disgusting. Although through self-reflective analysis, and her voyeuristic intentions, she discovers that the judge would be the perfect man for her if he were 40 years younger. Irene lives in front of another younger judge, who looks a lot like the old man. This is the "what if" that keeps circulating in the movie. What if Irene was born 40 years ago? The old man would have been his perfect match. But what if the youngest judge is really his perfect match, since he looks a lot like the oldest? Valentine does not know this, only we know, and Krzysztof Kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every frame where Irene is. We are constantly hit in the face with his presence, as almost a hint of Irene's fate. <br /> <br /> I mention that the old does not have a name for a reason. This reason is because it is very symbolic for the general theme of the story. Let's compare the former judge to Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit), the youngest judge, in more ways than one. We learned that the old man had someone he loved, but she ran away. In another scene, we see Auguste heart-broken while the love of his life moves away with another man. There are constant reminders about whether or not Valentine will know this man. Even if they pass each other without realizing it every day. There is also the reason for the phone, so Valentine is a way to keep up and refresh his life, so Auguste is what leads to his heartbreak, and for the old man, it's the one thing he left behind. These three elements serve to shadow the psychology of the characters themselves. It's a kind of statement about who they are and who they are. <br /> <br /> All three "Colors" films represent a certain principle, more common in France. "Blue" means Freedom (the personal being), "White" means Equality (being accepted by more than one), and "Red" is Fraternity (to socialize, to learn). And although this final chapter is an obvious focus on the beginning of the Brotherhood, Kieslowski guarantees that he also includes the other two, to connect all three stories. For example, we see the old man trying to reach Valentine and illuminating her with his espionage equipment, which is a reflection of the principle of equality. We also see near the end that Valentine is doing a soul search and that she is more concerned with herself than with other people (she does not answer the phone when Michel calls), a clear example of Freedom. And with all three established principles, Kieslowski connects well to all the characters as well, in the final and most sincere scene. <br /> <br /> "Red" is about where you could be if you were older or younger. It is about whether or not someone is completely perfect for everyone, and whether or not a person can change their life. The final chapter of the most inspiring trilogy of all time, this movie breaks down barriers both in direction and narrative. It is not just about our modern life but about where life could and should be in our modern time. And although the film is more subtle than "Blue" and "White," he dares say a phrase of love and compassion. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine that "Red" was Kieslowski's last film, and that he died at such a young age. However, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that fits with Bergman, Fellini and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who has never been awarded an Oscar. Kieslowski, you're missing!
