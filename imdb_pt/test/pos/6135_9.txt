Like most other reviewers, I really enjoyed this TV miniseries. I did not see it when it was released, but my grandfather - a big fan of mysteries and war movies - recorded in 1989. I remember watching him in my grandmothers cabin one night and I was completely history! It has a very intriguing plot and a good mix of drama, romance and espionage. I saw many movies that were made during World War II, but none with a touch like that! Fortunately, I managed to make a VHS copy of the movie several years ago. I've watched it several times since and still like it. I would love for this movie to be released on DVD. It would be much easier to view with chapters.
