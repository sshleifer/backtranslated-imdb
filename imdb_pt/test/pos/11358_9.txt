Superb and charming. Justin Henry is gorgeous as a good-humored and mischievous Howard Kaylan, lead singer of the band Top 10, The Turtles. The real magic is the title sequence with an Academy Award by Royale Watkins. A performance that completely captures the mystic and yet the Jimi Hendrix. Not many movies, unbelievably, can find the essence of a special moment in a life and time. I would like to see this available at any retail video home store without any hassle. What is the problem? Thank you Eddie. A valuable addition to the history of the psychedelic 60's. A defined glow in the mind's eye.
