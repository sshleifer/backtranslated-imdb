I bought this Walmart DVD for cheap, thinking it would be a monstrous typical junk, but it ended up much better than expected. There is really no criticism to say about it ... it is obviously low budget but this only adds to the old fashioned extravagant fun. It's really cool and fun. <br /> <br /> It has everything: terror, sex, a big air crash and good characters. And I'd say it's very original, because it does not actually go out like any other movie I've seen. It has its own unique look, which I really enjoyed, which is why this movie deserves credit. I look forward to seeing more of these incredible "The Scare Master" movies, Brett Piper, which I've never heard of before. <br /> <br /> The DVD menu is really creative, with music playing on it. then it's perfect just to keep it when you are not yet ready to sit and watch. It also includes some special features that are really interesting. But we never get to see the director or hear it in the commentary, must be timid. This comes from Edgewood Studios in Vermont, USA. I recommend it to all horror fans, you will love it!
