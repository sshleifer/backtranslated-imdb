Much better than is usually credited, this version of "Lost Horizon" not only had good music and beautiful scenery, but also some impressive mountain photographs. A special edition CD was released a few years ago and added more than 30 minutes of previously deleted material, extra music and a lot of bonus material. So why is not this on the DVD?! Difficult to discover the studios sometimes. Certainly the roles could have been given to people who could sing better than Peter Finch, Liv Ullman, George Kennedy and Sally Kellerman, but what do you want in a movie, good acting or melodies? Singer and dancer Bobby Van is a lot of fun, Michael York is a tragic villain, and seeing Sir John Gielgud dressed as Chang may seem silly, but actually works great on screen. Trust me, you need to check out this movie - if you can find it!
