I was leaving one morning when I was checking something on TV and I came across this movie. I never remember seeing or hearing this. How fun and interesting to watch. Well, my meeting was delayed because I could not get out of this movie. There were some interesting things that set the story time and some fun things that they do not make people in today's movie because they are not beautiful. Well, there was a lot of realism about it. The performance was good for a 1954 film. Subtle and genuine actions by the characters that made me see what they would do next. That's why I ended up watching. I do not know why they do not show it more often. I'd rather watch it than some movies they play more than necessary. For history buffs, people who enjoy period films and those in movie appreciation groups will like this. "The Egyptian" has a variety of flavors that deal with many things to look at in human nature that has not changed since its arrival. What does that say about us? Those who do not like movies that take so long to unfold and tell a good story ... are not in the movies. <br /> <br /> I did not have time to rent it if it was available, but if I had the chance to see it again, I would probably vote 10.
