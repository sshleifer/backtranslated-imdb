In an opening scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) walk down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring bucolic architecture, when a woman, furiously arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, remark: "There is nothing hotter than an angry French woman." A few blocks later, they pass by an old filipina, also furious, also arguing on the cell phone, and Luca observes with a referential effect: "There is nothing hotter than an angry and elderly Filipino woman." The humor in Jeff Garlin's "I Want Someone to Eat" is best characterized by the word "everyday." The movie is a conversation. We can also be listening. Instead of going for antics, the film is based on character flaws and human curiosity to deliver laughter. Although not innovative, it is far from banal, and even if James considers himself a jejunum, we know he is fairly average, and that is what he values. <br /> <br /> Self-development is the main theme. of the movie. Sarah Silverman, who plays Beth, is excellent as a catalyst for change; she revitalizes James, and so reminds him of living a better life. Even so, achieving some idyllic dream is not the end of these characters, but rather something simpler: that they can grasp the parts of the life they love, just to keep themselves at least enough to continue. <Br /> <br /> A film about life lessons can be overdone because you can forget to connect with your audience. I want someone to eat cheese with is subtle and captivating, and while their morale can not be inspiring, it is still resonant. This is a discreet comedy, but it will stay with you.
