I absolutely fell in love with these girls. Let me tell you one thing: I am from Romania and here is just the sixth grade running bunt every day that is on TV USA I check the internet and download it from there so I am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I've become to know absolutely everything about them. I looked on the internet what is Rory's car, what are their middle names and things like this: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria. I can not understand why, but my boyfriend does not like them and I try to make him see how wonderful they are, but to no avail, but he understands me and lets me stay with my "obsession" with the Gilmore Girls. I love them. I really hope that if anyone see this they will try: You will not regret it
