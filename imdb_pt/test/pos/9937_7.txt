Opera (the American title is horror in the opera) is a bit disappointing after some other Dario films, such as Phenomena, Tenebre and Suspiria. (I still can not find Hell anywhere.) It's one of those movies that has a great first semester, but in the middle of it it's as if someone has slowly begun to let the air out of the script and logic. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is being chased by a fan obsessed obsessively. this killer starts killing people close to her in a more original way. He catches it and chokes on it and threads little sharp pins under her eyelids, so that if she tries to close her eyes, she will pluck out her eyes. this forces her to watch while the killer kills her acquaintances in a brutal and bloody form of Argento. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the middle of the film, the film becomes slow and illogical. (this is especially directed to the killer's motivations.I still do not quite understand why he is so crazy.) The end especially leaves the left field in the worst possible sense. <br /> <br /> But for the first hour or so, this is one of Dario's best films and the camera work is breathtaking. too bad could not keep it to the end. <br /> <br /> rating: 7
