I just chose this on a decent, if not excellent, DVD version of a Wal-Mart dollar. <br /> <br /> Run and buy. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that this version is the short, incomplete version thrown against the animator's desires in the late fifties, but even so, with a buck, it's an * amazing * bargain. <br /> <br /> This movie was distributed in small pieces as a series to the venue. TV stations in the early 1960s show that almost all stations operated on Monday afternoons - "Bill and Bozo", "Monty's Gang" (Channel 4, Greenville SC) and "Captain Grady" (Channel 13, Asheville) . NC - that's where I saw it). It made such a big impression on me that I immediately recognized it when I saw it at Wal Mart tonight and picked it up. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. You should get it.
