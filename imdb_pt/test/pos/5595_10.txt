Broken Silence or "Race Against Fear" 1998): Starring Ariana Richards, William Bumiller, Susan Blakely, Tracy Ellis Ross, Teryl Rothery, Scott Vickary, Marissa Rudiak, Ken Camroux, David Neale, Bruce Dawson ... Director Joseph Scanlan, Screenplay Sara Charmo, Jean Gennis and Phyllis Murphy. <br /> <br /> This is another Lifetime, made exclusively for television, released in 1998, directed by the longtime director of the TV series Joseph L. Scanlan. Inspired by real events, it is very much like most Lifetime movies, a pre-emptive tale for women, raising awareness of the predator lurking within the family (mother, father, wife, husband) and mentor (teacher, in this case athletics). ). The young and little-known actress Ariana Richards (she played the little girl in Jurassic Park) offers a highly convincing performance as the high school athlete Mickey Carlyle, who is raped by her coach, Kurt Ansom (William Bumiller) and must suffer in silence as no one believes in his story except, of course, his own mother (Susan Blakely). Together, mother and daughter struggle to put Kurt Ansom behind the bars. The movie drags on a bit, it's basically predictable, sometimes too melodramatic for the drama itself, but it's genuinely powerful in the end. The performance of Ariana Richards is the daytime soap, but she is the strongest in the cast. Her facial expressions, body language and overall performance are realistic in terms of how she, as an aspiring athlete, idolizes her coach, is in turn raped by him and now must cope with shame, trauma, and even more, in court. William Bumiller plays the part with a kind of unpleasant duplicity, although it is far from subtle. He has abused other famous athletes before, who remained silent and reached the top, and seems outwardly innocent. William Bumiller, an actor less known as the others, has never played a role like this, but does a strong and reliable performance. It's especially disturbing to see him in this role, because he is a sexy main actor in everything he does, including some lesser known movies and in the novel "Guiding Light." The only real problem I had with this movie is the way the film is structured. When the movie starts, we watch Coach Ansom rape Mickey, warning immediately that this guy is no good. But this contributes to the development and history of a weak character. If the first scene had been the sequel to the opening credits in which we see Mickey running / running in the city across a lake, we would have better character development because we did not meet Coach Ansom, apparently looking interested in success. of her athlete star, is really a nasty job and we would have seen Mickey idolizing a person she thought she knew and then received a rude awakening when she realized she was wrong about him. Director Scanlan is no stranger to the TV drama (Knott's Landing, Star Trek, Quantum Leap, The Limits, Lois and Clark, Final Earth Conflict and films like La Femme Nikitta.) In 1996, Scanlan directed another Lifetime film, similar to this one, "Stand Against Fear" (1996), he is able to convey the seriousness of the event.We are genuinely disturbed by the trainer lurking around the showers where he rapes his own student.These scenes are graphic and must be seen by people but their message is clear: sex predators and rapists are not always strangers and can take on different forms, and their prey territories may even include a secondary school. This film supports the cause of the fighting to prevent violence against women and urges women who were silent victims to witness and fight so rapists did not do more harm to others. Despite other negative reviews, this film excellent work in expressing your message and should be given to mothers, daughters, hi school students (including men and women). No matter how bad the rape is, being silent when it happens is even worse.
