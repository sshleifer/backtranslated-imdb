When I first heard about this photo, it was just called "Shepherd" and was supposed to be the movie that would put JCVD ​​back into the odds of doing something theatrical. I was very excited about the whole play. <br /> <br /> When she called herself "The Shepherd: Border Patrol," I was dancing in the form of excitement for this movie. With Isaac Fluorentine in charge of the direction, and JJ Perry doing the stunt coordination, I almost peed in anticipation. Pics were released from the JCVD ​​kicking 8 different types of ass, just like Scott Adkins playing what I thought was the villain, and I was thrilled. I thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like Lone Wolf McQuade. <br /> <br /> Then he left. I ordered Blockbuster online for $ 20 and was ready for anything. The comments of vandammefan.net kind of modified my ideas, but I prepared myself. The courier came on the 4th and I opened the package. My initial plan was to run upstairs, take my face off the cardboard carton and then smash the box into the proper dynamics for the disk to land on my DVD player. However, I looked at the case for 10 minutes, then put the disc on my device and watched the movie. <br /> <br /> By the time it was over, I was cool as a fool in the pool. Shepherd is certainly one of my favorite movies straight to the video of all time and makes Derailed look even more so with the bathroom mess it is. Of course, some of the fights got a bit short, but they were still pretty cool. The shootings were excellent, as was Scott Adkins, who should have been the villain, unlike the forgettable Steven Lord. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. Seriously.
