Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres into its head, and the most recent by celebrated director Chan-wook Park is a tale of a godly good priest who becomes a vampire. Add a tempter that leads you to stray and a cast of eccentrics and you'll have a wonderful recipe. <br /> <br /> Directed in part in a style similar to the trilogy "Sympathy", it is as sumptuous as it is dark. Avoiding the clich√©, offers some new tricks in the exaggerated vampire genre. It's an existential movie trying to capture the moral riddle of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the lust of blood. However, the film does not take itself too seriously and there is unlimited humor throughout. <br /> <br /> Our tracks play their roles to perfection, playing with our emotions and having fun with black humor. There are moments of reflection on all the moral enigmas involved in the film, but it is never a preaching. Some may find it too long and can calm down in points, but it is worth giving a chance to the end. <br /> <br /> If you like left field movies then there is less than this in recent times. Dark and captivating, it will attract a crowd. I recommend you take a chance.
