I think dirty dancing was a great movie, they tried to make it another night out of Havana which was nice, but it was nothing like dirty dancing. I'd like to see another dirty dance with the same people. without them I think it would be a mess. Often movies are made, so when they try to add more, they begin to change people and make the movies fall. I would love to see dirty dancing and having another to see what happened after they could get together. Patrick and Jennifer did so well together. This movie was made in 1997, it's time to make another. but this time start where you left off and keep the same people on it.
