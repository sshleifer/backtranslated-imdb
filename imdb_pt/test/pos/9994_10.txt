I'm not a sports fan - but I love sports flics! So why ... what a great sport flic ... this one. And the style of storytelling is very good. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for two hours of fantastically reliable entertainment, "Greatest Game" qualifies powerfully. Here is a movie that moves. Bill Paxton went to the same driving school as Ron Howard - Richie Cunningham, "Happy Days." This is not bad. Look at the immense body of good work that Ron did after moving behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Bill as Ron was a great actor but will be a superstar director if "Greatest Game Ever" is the indication of things <br /> <br /> Wonderful cinematography - fantastic direction - good acting, especially by Elias Koteas, Shia LeBeouf, Marnie McPhail, Josh Flitter, Stephen Marcus and Justin Ashforth. A must see movie not just as "feel good", nor "sports movie", this is very good cinema.
