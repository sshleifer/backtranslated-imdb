To quote Jason Connery and Mark Ryan in one of the many DVD reviews, that "flickering music" above the HTV logo was enough to make me jump whatever I was doing to stick my face on the screen for an hour. The individual stories contained in the series were excellent and the character development was wonderful. Robin of Loxley goes through a very convincing journey over the two series in which he appears, even though his departure from the program has not been planned. Marian also develops very well her relationship with Herne's two children. After languishing for many years on TV, I rediscovered the series on Sky 1 in the UK in the mid 90's and went even more impressed that the series looked even better than I remembered. This is not a television program for children, it deals with witchcraft, betrayal, rebellion and injustice. And you can do this without showing too much blood. As far as I can remember, you only see a little bit of the red stuff in the Pilot movie (Episodes 1 and 2 on the DVD). The DVDs are great, containing a variety of extras, including casting comments only in Series 3 (Jason Connery Robin) and comments from the Series 1 and 2 staff. The picture quality is very good and the remixed and remastered surround sound is incredible. /> <br /> The idea of ​​freedom is important, freedom prevails. Nothing is forgotten. Nothing is forgotten.
