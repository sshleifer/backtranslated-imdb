When I first heard that this movie would be made, I was very excited to see it. Ideas to make such a movie, however good it may have been, must have been very difficult. I was not sure if anyone could cover all of the Pope's many incredible qualities in a movie, but the movie did justice to his memory. In my opinion, the most important task was to reveal to the people that the Pope began as. For his days in Poland, until his last days at the Vatican, this film followed every aspect of his life. Thomas Kretschmann, the man who played the pope in his adult life and in his adult life, did a great job of conveying the emotion. Overall, this movie was educational but also a lot of fun.
