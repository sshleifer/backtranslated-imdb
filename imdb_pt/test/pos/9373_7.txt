Crossfire (1947) <br /> <br /> Great Message, Great Symbolism, Very Good Movie <br /> <br /> It is hard to make a total mistake Robert Mitchum, Robert Young and Robert Ryan together as the three male leaders and with the director Edward Dmytryk assembling a complicated murder and a detective wire. That's reason enough to watch it once and even twice. <br /> <br /> You may need a second look to get the plot as it is explained (much) or shown in flashback (too much), because it is a bit tricky without good reason. But that makes sense in general, and we see early (probably too soon) who is to blame, and even why. <br /> <br /> Beyond the drama, well done in typical noir lighting and filled with those short jokes that make dramatic postwar movies, there is the social message, the anti-anti-Semitic point of all this . It only borders on preaching once or twice, and it's such a good point to make us see this being done with approval and expect the plot and dramatic acting to take the front row. What they do, especially Young, who is a brilliantly laconic and patient detective, and Ryan, who is stingy in a crude and angry way (Ryan is good at it, his typecasting is reasonable). Mitchum mostly plays a dilute version of what he is famous for, and the fourth known acting force, Gloria Grahame, is a large, brief, if slightly dispensable, presence. <br /> <br /> Although the film is dominated by the sequence of events and the message, which grow as we go, it is really easy to watch only for lighting, camera work and acting, including the scene of classic fighting that opens the first seconds of the scene. movie, all done with shadows. The archetypes of soldiers presented are very deliberate, and this may be something that people at the time were very familiar with and could relate to as much as the anti-Semitism segment. The soldier in shock made him helpless (but still intrinsically capable), the unassuming modest young man (but capable as well), and the tired but seemingly capable veteran are all there. And, of course, the violent and angry soldier who is also the product of war. The latter is also a responsibility of society - even the army does everything to make up for the injustices here, not only because they are criminal, but because they derive from the weariness of a terrible and long war. <br /> <br /> Audience then, more than now, could really achieve, but it's there to still enjoy.
