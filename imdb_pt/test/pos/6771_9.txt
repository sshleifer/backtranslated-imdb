Not quite sure how I stumbled on this movie, but I'm so glad I did it. Initially, we were discouraged by the fact that it was subtitled, but even my dyslexic brother, who hates to read (especially at the weekend), liked this movie. I found the script fantastic and the way it was delivered in a dead pot way only increased the pee puddles on my couch. Not entirely sure if it's as funny for the native Dane as the comedy seems to be reinforced by the lack of tone of the subtitles and the ambiguity of the translation. I have not watched many Danish films (or any other) but judging by this film I'm guessing they are not embarrassed by the same political correction as anywhere else (gawd bless' em) making Eigel's character breathe fresh air , because let's face special needs are funny. There are so many great one-liners in this movie that make American sitcoms embarrassed.
