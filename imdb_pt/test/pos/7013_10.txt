As for most women, this movie is the best girl movie. With her hot chemistry, sexy dance routines and beautiful songs, I mean timeless classic like (I've had) The time of my life and the wonderful She's like the wind makes this movie. I love Patrick Swayze in this movie and he shows that he can sing and dance is so hot. He sings "She's Like The Wind" in the film. The chemistry between Swayze and co-star Jennifer Gray is incredible. I love all the dancing and everything that happens. But saying this Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is also great, but Patrick Swayze scenes does it. I love the songs, dancing and everything about it, but it's not Dirty Dancing. Like I said, it's an amazing girl movie. Please leave a third party because I love to see what happens to Patrick Johnny's character. Jennifer's character could have been sexier but hey Patrick does for this, if you know what I mean !!! Great movie and I'm so glad Billy Zane did not win the role of the movie. I heard whispers that he was made for the role, but they found that he could not dance.
