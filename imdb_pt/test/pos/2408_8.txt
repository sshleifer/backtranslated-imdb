I've seen this movie more than once and it's worth it. For those who enjoy martial arts and overcome internal conflicts, this is a worthy choice. After watching this movie, I wanted to be a more productive member of society because I could relate to the inner turmoil of a girl in search of acceptance and needing a way forward. Of course, Mr. Miyagi always provides his wise advice. 2 thumbs up!
