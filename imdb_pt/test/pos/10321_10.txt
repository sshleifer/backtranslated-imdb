This is the first of the Three Short Stooges with Shemp I've seen, and it's one of my favorites! <br /> <br /> This is what I really liked about Shemp when he returned after Curly's stroke, he did not try to be like Curly, he was his own character, and that's what I admire! Shemp is my third favorite actor, I like him more than Curly, but I like both Curly and Shemp. Shemp is great, he's funny, he's silly, he's SHEMP! <br /> <br /> I really loved the scene where he dropped the nickel and Moe walked into the booth with him to find him and they ended up wrapping themselves in the strands and really hurt! <br /> <br /> But what I really found scary was when Shemp had his face crushed against the glass of the cabin, he looked like a deformed Snape teacher! <br /> <br /> Poor Shemp, he had many bad things happen to him in this short, but this is typical of Three Stooges, they always have many bad things going on with them! <br /> <br /> This short is another must see for fans of Three Stooges! <br /> <br /> 10/10
