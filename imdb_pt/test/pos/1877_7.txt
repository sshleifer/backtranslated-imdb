Or if you've seen the trilogy "Evil Dead" and / or "Bubba Ho-Tep", then you should know that your movies are total sham. With "Man with the Screaming Brain", it goes all over again. In that case, he plays the American businessman William Cole, visiting Bulgaria - when are we going to see this country? when a woman kills him. So strange scientist Ivan Ivanov (Stacy Keach) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent, leaving him acting like Steve Martin in "All of Me." <br /> <br /> Yes, the whole movie is practically an excuse for sheer nonsense. Much of the real humor comes from the brother of Sam Raimi's director, Ted, as Ivanov's almost death-defying assistant, Pavel. The two men have a relationship more like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and Skipper. <br /> <br /> So, just understand that this is a totally silly movie, and you will not be a little disappointed. I enjoyed it anyway.
