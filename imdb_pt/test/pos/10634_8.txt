In the first twenty minutes, we are swept away by a number of emotionally powerful portraits: a stifling, authoritarian mother quarrels violently with her 40-year-old daughter; the love of a piano teacher (and music teacher) for his students, expressed in an unshakeable critical assessment; the joy that music can inspire in both the listener and the performer. Within this short space of time, our senses were aggressively beaten with very real characters. We are also swept away by the powerfully performed music and we show the difference between an excellent and mediocre performance with a lot of attention to the nuances. Such a material, on its own, would have been the basis of an excellent film of wide appeal. But the trend in French cinema is what it is, it goes deeper, exploring the teacher's repressed sexuality, the expression of sexual freedom and subsequent collapse within a context of passionate attraction, and the inevitable cycle of actual abuse. We are drawn to her suffering and, at least initially, imagine how much suffering may be related to the achievement of the genius, particularly in the composers she admires. The piano teacher contains graphic dialogues and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people prefer not to watch. The scenes are essential to the dilemmas the film seeks to create and can hardly be called free. A great movie may be, but the mainstream view is not.
