Ingrid Bergman, who plays the faithful dentist receptionist Walter Matthau, who has some passion for her boss, is absolutely wonderful in this film. She handles the witty replica in the script with aplomb and steals a fantastic scene where she and Goldie Hawn talk on a log booth (Ingrid's monologue is a front, but her face tells her that she believes him wholeheartedly). Matthau is a strange choice for the protagonist (he's too old for Goldie Hawn and not too refined for Bergman, not to mention he's too unfocused to be a dentist), but I liked the way he tries to please Goldie and stumbles trying to free it's a lie. Hawn (who won an Oscar for support) is as fresh and bubbly as it is today. This farce in the bedroom is not very sophisticated (and vaguely reminiscent of "Any Wednesday"), but it's a welcome relief for the noisy, teen-oriented comedies they launch today. "Cactus Flower" is a beautiful sigh! *** in ****
