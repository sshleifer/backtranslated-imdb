I really think the Black Snake Moan was a great movie that takes place in the South. The story follows a man named LÃ¡zaro, whose wife knocks him to his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten by the side of the road. Lazarus discovers that Rae is addicted to sex and was abused as a child, so he decides to solve the problem with his own hands, tying Rae with a chain to heal her of his evil. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and quest for redemption, Lazarus and Rae become best friends. I was also impressed by Sam's ability to play guitar and sing. S Epatha Merrkensen is great as Lazarus' love interest, Angela, Justin Timberlake plays Ronnie's boyfriend, Ronnie, who is underutilized in the film but does his best to give it a good performance.
