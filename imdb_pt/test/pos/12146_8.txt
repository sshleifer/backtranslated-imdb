"Classes tous risques" is one of the best films "gangsters" that France has produced. Perfect match: Lino Ventura, a young Jean-Paul Belmondo (who did "a souffle blow", Godard's thing the same year), Marcel Dalio and an excellent supporting cast, brilliant screenplay by José Giovanni - who also wrote " le trou "Becker masterpièce the same year! What a year for him! Wonderful black and white cinematography by Ghislain Cloquet. And taut action, first-class direction by Claude Sautet, who beats Jean-Pierre Melville. While the latter films the gangster movie with metaphysical pretensions, which sometimes lasts for more than two hours, Claude Sautet drives men of flesh and blood, and the presence of the two children adds extraordinary moments. pungency that Melville was never able to generate. And Sautet avoids pathos, excessive sentimentality: the last time Ventura sees his children, getting on the subway (subway) is a peak of contained emotion. <br /> <br /> Ventura portrays a whos gangster And he dies when the movie begins. He thinks he can trust his old acquaintances, but they are all cowards - we are far from being virile friendly face to Jacques Becker ("touchez pas au grisbi") that Melville should continue throughout. the sixties - sometimes aided by wicked women (the misogyny noir of the film par excellence), living in a rotten microcosm, ready to inform - we are far from Jean Seberg's simplistic behavior in Godard's "opus." Cloquet does wonders with the picture: the scene on the beach in a starless night, when the two children watch their mother die after the shootout with the customs officials, is absolutely astounding. <br /> <br /> Good use of voice-over, which Sautet only uses when necessary, so the last lines make the end even stronger than if we had watched the scenes. Claude Sautet had found a good niche, and he followed the rules "classes tous risques" very well with his follow-up "l'arme à gauche" (1965), which featured Ven tura again and made good use of a desert island and a ship.Had he continued in that direction, France would have had a Howard Hawks. In his subsequent works, only "Max et les ferrailleurs" (1971) showed some of the brightness exhibited in the first half of the 1960s. It became, from "les choses de la vie", the director of the cinema of quality who used to focus the bourgeoisie with good heart on works like "Cesar et Rosalie" (1972). , "Vincent François, Paul et les autres" (1974) or "Mado" (1976)
