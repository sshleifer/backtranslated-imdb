There was once someone in my family (not telling who it is for personal reasons) who thinks Mr. Bean is always so silly in everything he does in the comedy series. Imagine how I felt at that moment. Shocked instantly. <br /> <br /> There are more reasons than one because I love seeing Mr. Bean. Being one of the first shows on local television here in my country, where I grew up watching for the first time, is just one of those things that stayed in my head. There was even once that my friends and I talked about some of the selected episodes and we just laughed together. <br /> <br /> It's always silly, funny and hilarious in any antics as Rowan Atkinson will do in every episode. Although lately at times I can show some of the repetitions here, never failed to bring back those memories of my childhood. In fact, I daresay this is the first show that shows me about the kind of shows that come out of the UK while I was growing up. <br /> <br /> The comedy series ... definitely very wicked, like what the British might be saying.
