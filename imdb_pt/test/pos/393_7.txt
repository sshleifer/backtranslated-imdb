Very pleasant 50's western. I have this in my collection and I recommend it to Western fans. <br /> <br /> Especially the Victor Mature movie and very well done in my opinion. <br /> <br /> He is a hunter who joins a border post like a scout. Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and picked up their belongings. They all joined as scouts after their loss. <br /> <br /> Victor put his eyes on the Colonel's wife and lives life in office without much respect for the regulations. <br /> <br /> Quite convincing action but without great depth or a lot of feeling for other characters. <br /> <br /> The 1950's westerns are my favorites and this easily slips into a satisfaction. A Westerner of this kind is on the pages of the past and may never be done again. One to enjoy. Gave a 7 rating. Probably 6.8 worthy, but movies like these become more precious over time. <br /> <br /> For movie-noir fans ... "The Big Steal" "They live at night" "Side Street" are wonderful movies to be enjoyed. Bought and seen. Noir seems to resemble Westerners in a way. There is a long time and never for ever.
