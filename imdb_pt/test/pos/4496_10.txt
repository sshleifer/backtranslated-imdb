Okay, I did not read the book ???? And maybe the book was better ???? WHO KNOWS ??? // But I loved the movie. It was fun, not a little boring, nice and most of all heart painful. The friendship between the two children was so pure and innocent. These children acted so well, especially the Servant's son. Oh my God that's like the form of GOD on the face of the earth. ARGHHHH he steals our heart so easily. ********* Spoilers ************* The other friend the rich guy is a kid and his confusion and frustration can be understood. But I was angry when he abandoned and ignored his friend at a time when he needed solace. Anyway, he was just a kid and a little stubborn. I wish the film would also show the older version of the poor kid. Arghh just thinks about thinking in the end. This movie is sad. I felt terribly sad during the finale. Tears fell from my eyes. Yes, the background scores are fantastic, the scenes are WOW. The parrot scenes are fascinating. Well, there's a bit of an adventure in between. Wonderfully represented and superbly released. The kids acted so well. GREAT DIRECTION. Do not know why this movie did not get the critics WOOO. But for sure I WOO. 10/10 Must-See ??????
