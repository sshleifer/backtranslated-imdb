Married To The Mob was one of the first VHS tapes I had along with Coming To America and Grease. I still have fond memories of this movie after all these years. Hell, I still have the VHS of this movie in good condition. <br /> <br /> The Story: Undercover cop Mike Downey (Matthew Modine) is sent to spy on Angela De Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer), the wife of the dead. member of the mafia Frank "Pepino" De Marco (Alec Baldwin). He later falls in love with her after he realizes she's innocent in all of this. Angela not only has to deal with the unwelcome advances of Mafia boss Tony "The Tiger" Russian (Dean Stockwell), she also has to deal with her jealous wife Connie Russo (Mercedes Ruehl). <br /> <br /> Married to Mob is funny and still holds your interest when you're not trying to be funny. I like the little punches you take on mafia life (the mafia jealous wife, the mafia boss who does not realize he's not a girl magnet etc) and you like the characters of Angela De Marco and Mike Downey. It was the last funny episode of Johnathan Demme before he got serious and gave you treasures like Philadelphia and Silence Of The Lambs (best thriller ever). If you're in the mood for comedy, Married To The Mob is a keeper. It's better than the junk that goes into comedy nowadays (epic movie, date film, meet the Spartans, disaster film etc).
