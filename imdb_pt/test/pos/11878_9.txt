What's not to like? <br /> <br /> I picked it up again tonight and was amazed at Hugh Bonneville's capture of the essence of Philip Larkin without resorting to tics and caricature. <br /> <br /> There are many layers for depicting the complexity of the main character and Hugh brings to life. His mother's modest, unresolved problems with his father and his inability to commit to a woman. <br /> <br /> His poetry is intertwined and some scenes are captured in his recount of them to the wife of a friend whom he later proposes, but casually, almost innocently. It's not difficult to see where your attraction was for the many women who fell in love with him (and they knew each other, and they continued to see him!) <br /> <br /> Cerebral, fun, jazz aficionado, loyal friend. It is always more than it seems, women have gone beyond their baldness, deafness and myopia. And a beautiful Eileen Atkins performance as a mother is an added bonus. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
