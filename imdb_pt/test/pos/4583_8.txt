This must be the stupidest movie I've ever seen and deserves a special award. Okay, so it gets really good, logical, moody, and then quickly changes to complete and utter uh f @ rt, @ ss, stupid fuck that makes total sense. The strange thing is that I hardly laugh at it, but I think it's funny, with a very serious message. After a moment of thought why I did not laugh, the answer was very clear ... this movie is much more realistic than I wish it to be. So it's extremely stupid, but very wise if the goal was to reach people who are not "blessed" with a lot of neurons and synapses and electrolytes (huh, electrolytes?). This movie can really be understood on some level by a large audience! <br /> <br /> Though they probably just laugh. <br /> <br /> Ah, well, good try ... <br /> <br /> Now I'm editing (well adding) my comment, because I read some of the other comments. First I noticed some people seeing racism in this movie. Well, that did not cross my mind when I watched it. However, I can imagine if you are looking from that perspective, you will see some. We could, of course, debate the link between intelligence and race, but I do not think that's the place for that. I wonder if we would classify the Huxtable family here, would you complain about all of them being black? I do not think so, but I think you could ... (apart from the two wisest people in the world, half, woman, does not look all white to me, so 'what's the problem?') > <br /> Secondly, the film receives very varied rankings; from 1 to 10 and everything but a lot of polarization there, which means the movie does its job very well! It shakes people up, makes them want to talk about it and judge it. That means it's a good movie, whether you like it or hate it. After 5 minutes, it becomes very predictable and annoying indeed, but you keep watching that absolute crap. I think you keep hoping it is not so. Or maybe it's our unhealthy way of facing terrible accidents. Well, this is one for sure.
