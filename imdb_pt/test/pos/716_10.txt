I watch many movies - DVD, features and classics, you choose. The night I attended JERICHO MILE, my wife (who had ordered on the internet) said she remembered when she was in high school, that she stayed with her all those years. With some reluctance, I sat down (with our daughter and son) and was riveted from the opening sequence for the final titles. We all went. <br /> <br /> She, who remembered the original, and our children (18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was, could not believe it. Our favorite scene? Bar none, when Peter Strauss so passionately knocks his fist down and says "I would do it again!". He did not advocate violence because it was a defense crime, but it evoked so much intensity that he could not believe it ... when his cellmates gave him food to support his efforts, there was not a dry eye in our lives. House. <br /> <br /> Someone, please make more movies like this. UNBELIEVABLE!!
