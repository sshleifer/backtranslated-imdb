I really loved this movie. I thought it was very well done. The character's interaction was wonderfully well done, as was the characterization. The actors were definitely believable. The plot was very deep and intriguing. Even though parts of it are a bit slow and sometimes a little annoying, it's definitely worth watching several times. The chemistry between the three main actors was great. If you do not want to watch it for this, then at least watch it for the drama between the characters. I mean, the whole thing was just "Whoa!" It was as if I could not look away. The whole movie caught my eye and kept my interest, even through the slow parts. I loved this movie and almost everything about it. I loved the ending because it was very interesting and if you watch the movie a second time, it makes perfect sense. But I'm not spoiling anything.
