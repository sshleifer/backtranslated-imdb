Western can be divided into many subgenres. One of the widest divisions is that between Westerns of the City and Westerns of the Plains. Most of the West is a mixture of both, but at one end of the spectrum you have photos like High Noon and Rio Bravo that occur almost entirely in a settlement, rarely venturing into the real outdoors. At the other extreme you have cars like the Wagon Master where there is only one house in sight in the middle of the desert. Director John Ford usually amused himself with the "piece of the West", shooting the interiors with an emphasis on being small and confined, and then contrasting it with the open exteriors that looked exciting and dangerous . Wagon Master has a typical Frank Nugent script, with some interaction between old-timers and green youths, but still presents Ford with some new challenges. In this picture, the dangers do not come from the harshness of the landscape, they come from within the group in the form of Cleggs. What's more, the absence of actual interior scenes means that the exterior can lose its impact over time. <br /> <br /> However, Ford was a true master when it came to manipulating space. He shoots scenes from the camp or the wagons so that the frame is surrounded and we have the same sense of closure that we would have in a genuine interior. In addition, compared to his other sights, he does not actually open the space much, causing the carriage trail to pass through canyons and passes, instead of crossing the arid and empty plains. One of the few moments when it opens the landscape is when the Indians are seen and there is the possibility of a threat from outside. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master features some surprisingly effective moments of comic relief, and some great contributions from the peculiar cast. Harry Carey Jr. was turning into a good actor like his father, and this is one of his best early roles. Joanne Dru was disappointing in She Wore the Yellow Ribbon, but she seems more at ease as a character with a bit of sass, and is actually quite good here. Jane Darwell, who won an Oscar in Grapes of Wrath, directed by John Ford a decade earlier, appears here with the only function of performing a joke in which she sounds like a weak old horn. Still, with her great time and movement, she makes the piece work. Francis Ford, in one of the many dumb drunken roles he played in the pictures of his younger brother, is at his best. <br /> <br /> And now we come to lead the man Ben Johnson. Although he was by no means a bad actor, he would never become a big star like John Wayne. And yet, with his effortless riding and laid back accent, he was one of the most authentically "western" players around. And that brings me to my final point. This was apparently one of Ford's personal favorites, although it seems quite modest. Wagon Master does not have a great theme or dramatic intensity, it is simply the genre that unfolds. I think that's what Ford loved about it. It's a picture for Ben Johnsons and Harry Carey Jrs, not for John Waynes or Henry Fondas. Small in scope, but worthy of his class.
