Barbora Bobulova's portrait of Valeria in this story was both captivating and painful at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden and mystical passion presented by any actor simply by using his facial features and the use of his eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She fully believed that Valeria and I were drawn by her characterization of this role. Suddenly the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was a limited dialogue fascinated me. I was forced to read between the lines and each of the main actors used the art of body language and the emotional intent to convey a strong plot. Barbora, in particular, was visually stimulating in an almost asexual manner and at the same time in a sexy way. This comment can easily relate to each of the many emotions brought about by your performance. Underestimated in terms of dialogue, but powerful in terms of presence. I was captured by this actress delivery and look forward to much more of your work.
