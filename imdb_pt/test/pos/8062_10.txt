No matter how good Schindler's List is, I found this film much more powerful, as it is a documentary and based on real life. He details the story of the Frank and Anne family in particular. Although it is a bit slow at first (detailing your family life before the war); becomes very powerful. <br /> <br /> Due to some of the filming and field photos, I would not recommend it for children, but for adults, it illustrates the horror of the Holocaust through a young girl. Highly recommended.
