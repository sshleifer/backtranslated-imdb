Okay, "very good" does not yell at me for rent, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Campfire Tales. Although not a classic, the directors involved have an idea of ​​what suspense is. The scares do not just jump to you, but instead the directors build steadily for the climactic moments. The film is based on popular urban legends and ghost stories. The writers updated the stories very well and distorted them just enough for the family endings to still pack a punch. The best of the shorts are "The Honeymoon" and "People Can Lick Too," I enjoyed it as much as they have good suspense throughout each story. "The Locket" was a good story of ghosts and the involvement around "The Campfire" is also very good except for a few twists in the end. The only disappointing segment is "The Hook", which is good because it's too short anyway. Overall I give it a 7 out of 10. It has suspense, which is missing most horror movies today, and good casting. It may not qualify with Halloween and The Exorcist, but it's a good movie that is worth the price of a rental.
