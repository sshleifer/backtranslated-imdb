I watched the movie about 13 years ago while living in Airlie Beach Qld Australia. I had found it on the shelves of a small shop in the back that most did not bother to look for. <br /> <br /> For my pleasure I found and watched with the intention of one day owning it and being in my collection. I still have not, but one day. <br /> <br /> I like the concept with poetry and fantasy. The semi-deserted street scenes, with a bustling city of teams in the distant background, added to the visual effect. <br /> <br /> I have numerous times mentioned this movie to people who like this genre, with nothing but praise. It stayed in my mind and will come for a long time. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this movie, but only to those who are of that type. <br /> <br /> This review and the one from LA, CA can help you by choosing to watch this movie. The comments may be negative, but I found them positive if you look beyond the deprecating connotation.
