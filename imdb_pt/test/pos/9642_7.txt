I recommend that moviegoers, if in the New York City area, visit the Intrepid museum and get an idea of ​​how the closed and tight environment of life was for the former submarine crews of World War II. How much more must have been to the sailors during the First World War? Must have been really the hell down. <br /> <br /> Walter Huston and Robert Montgomery lead the cast of Hell Below, Huston as the book's captain, and Montgomery as their two-wheel free number. Both are quite believable, since naval officers and the rest of the cast, such as Robert Young, Eugene Palette, Jimmy Durante, Madge Evans, Sterling Holloway, etc. fulfill their duties very well. <br /> <br /> Silent service became more popular during World War II and beyond. It's amazing, but I could name a number of underwater images like Torpedo Run, Pacific Operation, Hellcats of the Navy, Run Silent, Run Deep and more, and you'll see the same plot situations in all of them. I think there really is a limit on the situations too. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Durante's performance is interesting. He's pretty funny and his scene with the boxing kangaroo while on shore leave is actually very funny. But I have to say that a character like him in these tight quarters is probably very necessary for morale. If you do not have someone like that to break the tension aboard a submarine, you should immediately transfer it to your ship. <br /> <br /> The high point for me, however, is the scene of the death of Sterling Holloway. Much like Sean McClory's in Island in the Sky. It will haunt you long after you've seen this movie.
