This is a short stooge that uses satire in conjunction with clowning, a rarity. As mentioned, the title and concept for this short was "borrowed" from a film the same year with Clark Gable called "Men In White". It is basically about the trials and tribulations of the inmates and their sacred cause of "duty and humanity." I've seen this recently and almost treated it as the Stooge version because it takes it a little too seriously. In any case, "Men In Black" is so well written, directed and not to mention original, that did not take anything from Chaplin or any of the others, which Motion Picture Academy named him as the best short. comedy of 1934. Some shorts called "La Cucaracha" overcame it and stole the prize. The brother-in-law of some producers must have been on the Academy's voting board. "Men In Black" mocks the whole concept of the medical profession in the same way that Marx Bros always did at that time. It may not be a fair comparison, but I can see the Marx Bros. in this short. In fact, in their long "A Day At The Races," there is a scene where there are "medical things" going on and they cause anarchy as usual. My guess is that this particular short was judged along these lines and therefore why it was stated first. Try this indeed: watch this short first and then watch "Duck Soup" or "Day at the Races" with the Marx and then see if there is not the same great quality of comedy.
