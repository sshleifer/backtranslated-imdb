This movie has an excellent premise and is really wanting to be turned into a Hollywood blockbuster. As I recall (and it's been a few years since I've seen the movie), the action begins with a London bus full of people. There is a horrible accident and a passenger dies. The rest of the film is then counted in flashback, with 13 characters who were on the bus, having their recent lives explored in intricate detail. At the end of the movie, we returned to the crash and discovered which of these animated and vivid characters encountered a horrible ending. Great stuff, a bit like a good tabloid story with accurate details and even delivered. If only it were available on video ...
