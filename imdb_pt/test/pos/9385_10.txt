This is seriously one of the best low budget movies I've ever seen. I'm not to get up and cheer during a movie, but this definitely was worth it. Obviously the premise is that there is a bed that eats people as well ... eats is a subjective term, I think, actually secretes acidic bubbles to suck the victims and dissolves them in their acid goodness. The best part of this film is that William Russ is one of the main characters. The typical family man really started his career with this movie ... and an Afro. There's a lot of nudity in this movie, so obviously not for the kids, but that should not stop anyone from watching this movie. I believe everyone needs a deathbed in their lives at some point, it's better to get it sooner than later.
