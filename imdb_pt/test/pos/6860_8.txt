I saw Anatomy when I left and bought recently and the 2003 sequence and while I watch many foreign films in various genres, you have to watch movies in their original language for sure. Not only is it annoying to know that the voices do not belong to the actors, but they always seem lively, like the whole movie was a big toothpaste commercial or something. It makes an incredible movie look horrible and I had to convert many of my friends who used to think foreign films are not as good as American movies - that they are not "Hollywood enough." In addition, the translation is never right, it's too literal and spoils the film's vibe, even if it's basically the same thing. I watched Anatomy alone the other week in German then with subtitles with my roommate because he was on his laptop and did not want to have to lose parts when he could not see the subtitles because he was typing. 30 minutes and he asked me to let him finish his work, then start the movie with subtitles. He loved it! Both films are great as intellectual horror movies! Kelly
