A group of friends collapses in the middle of nowhere (one had a flat tire, the other's jeep mysteriously does not start). One of them takes the tire to a run-down service station and is the last one anyone sees. When the remaining quartet goes in search of his friend, they come across the nice Mr. Slaussen who offers to help repair the jeep and offers refreshing drinks and shelter from the heat in his equally destroyed hermit house, which happens to be occupied. by very realistic mannequins. He goes with the pack guy to work in the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house. Before he goes, he warns them not to go out and go to the house behind his shack; he warns them about "Davy," his brother who is lurking and not all there. Of course, one of them decides to venture in search of a working phone and is never seen again. Is it Slaussen? Is it Davy? The mannequins ?? Tourist Trap has the usual requirements of terror (jiggly big boobed girl, goody two shoes girl, curiosity getting better on people and never exercising!), But it sets itself apart from the rest of the 70s genre in its twist of an end . I started feeling sorry for Slaussen (Chuck Conners is a great, creepy and exaggerated performance) at one point in the movie, and you almost see the character of Molly doing the same. This is a gem, if you can find it; I had recorded off the cable when I was younger, and walking through a used video store I saw a VHS copy that was totally overpriced, but worth it. Tanya Roberts fans will not be disappointed either. Best part of the movie for me was the scene with the soup (and crackers !!) <br /> <br /> I gave it a 7 because part of the movie was and still hard to explain.
