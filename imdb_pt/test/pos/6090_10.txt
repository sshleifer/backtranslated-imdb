I like this movie above all others. It is "multi-layered"; there is so much to see and appreciate. Each exhibit brings a new appreciation of the story line, the plot and the characters. It acted flawlessly and extremely enjoyable if you take the time to watch it and enjoy it. I love the interaction between the players; subtle relationships; the atmosphere of the period. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly scaled up as the boyfriend and Geoffrey, the wronged husband is beautifully underestimated by Colin Firth. The scene in the sandstorm where Catherine and El Masy are discussing the different types of sandstorms is one of the lights of the film and where the case really begins. The other relationship between Hanna and El-masy is yet another "layer" of the film that is totally charming (and touching). A winner worthy of so many awards.
