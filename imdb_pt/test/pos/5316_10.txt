My God, Ryan Gosling has made a lot of deep characters in his career, this is one of his wonderful acting jobs. For me this is a very deep film, it needs a lot of concentration, not because it is difficult to watch, just because you understand it if you put your shoes on this kid, even if you have everything and have a famous father who is a writer, have a mind deeper, you do not understand why he kills this poor kid, until you actually hear what he has to say and start to think, at least to me, that many things he says are true. Simple, sweet boy, very gentle, in a normal way as any teenager, but inside him suffer because he starts to look at the world in a different way, then you understand why he did what he did. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys deep drama.
