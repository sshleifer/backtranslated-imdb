The first thing you see in this movie is a static angle (which will be repeated later in the film), depicting the chaos going on (invisible to the audience) in a studio that airs news. Soon after, the typical story of Fonda's character is shown in that same angle. Do not let this fool you; the film is not about a reporter, a woman struggling to succeed in a profession dominated by men. This is just an introduction, a way to start the movie (although it will be used later). The real point for this production is revealed gradually, and the first one we see is in a deliberately long scene at the beginning. The whole movie has this rhythm; Not slow or protracted, but deliberate. It is never very fast, even in the few sequences that would normally be expected. This rhythm (especially as it seems to slow down further as the plot unfolds, as the film's disturbing and disturbing nature is unraveled) is strong, almost painful for the viewer. It inspires you, if it were possible, to jump on the screen, grab the people responsible for the leash, and yell at them to * do * something about it, to remedy the situation. Never once did I feel like lifting or taking my eyes off the screen for a moment. The subject is extremely important to be aware of, and is treated perfectly here. No over-dramatization (well ... very little, at least), just a precise presentation of the issue. The direction is amazing. The empathy felt by Lemmon's character is profound. The editing is masterful ... a scene near the end illustrates this perfectly. The editor, judging by his filmography, is greatly underestimated. The writing was excellent. The performance was great, especially by Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas (who also produced it). The lack of a score is perfect; no music is needed to improve. The end is sublime and effective. The film has some negative points ... between them, part of the dialogue is obviously and undeniably mostly exposure, a specific part of the movie, while dramatic, does not seem to fit with something that follows it. Not everyone will watch the movie because of two characteristics that are commonly (and precisely because of this) attributed to bad movies; the rhythm (which can be mistaken for being slow) and the (lack of) punctuation. It can be argued that this is a negative thing, since all should consider the points it presents, but perhaps it is better this way; dealing with the heavy subject with intelligence and respect (for the topic as well as the viewer) ... something like this, maybe should not be fed by spoon. I was mesmerized by the film and I was very surprised. I recommend this to anyone who believes that he is strong enough to handle it. 9/10
