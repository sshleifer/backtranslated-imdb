During the preface by Clete Roberts, I was beginning to think that this was a production of Ed Wood, however, what happens here is something very hard to beat. The story of crime and corruption in a southern town is told using a select cast of Hollywood Poverty Row, and this makes the film even more realistic. There are no punches here, and sometimes the movie is reminiscent of "The Well" (1951). The black and white texture gives a quality similar to news. For sure, the younger viewers will be reminded of "The Blair Witch Project", but this one is based on real events!
