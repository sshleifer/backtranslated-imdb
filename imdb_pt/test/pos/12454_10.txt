I've seen most episodes of Tarzan. Certainly, the X rated with O'Keeffe & Bo Derek, which is totally deplorable. <br /> <br /> I've seen this version several times since it was originally shown. <br /> <br /> The whole cast had memorable parts, great acting the Monkey sequences. <br /> <br /> Last night I even saw in the Spanish station and another that some French dialogue all in Spanish. <br /> <br /> As much as Hudson did not want Andie's voice he did not do anything until the end. He saw the diaries and could have hired a dialogue coach. <br /> <br /> It seems silly that a story about monkeys and a man created by them talking nonsense that Hudson attacked Andie. The plot of the movie was that she was an American cousin. The last time I checked Carolina was in the US. She was beautiful in the movies, and her eyes, and beautiful hair, alabaster skin mystified all of us, men. She did not have to resort to Bo's level. <br /> <br /> She remained as a LADY for the rest of her career and should look at this movie (half of her life behind) as a starting point. His performance, sincerity, made this film enjoyable, believable that a man half wild could ascertain his inner beauty. Great send point to Sir Richardson, he stole the movie.
