Having just watched it with my mom (who got it for Christmas) I was thrilled to find something different for the usual things I usually watch. All the stories have been detailed and you can feel a strong emotion towards each character from the beginning. Each plot is followed brilliantly, making you feel completely different things to each character. The cast is incredible, my personal favorites are James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray / LaMotte / Main. The whole thing is deep and wonderful, making a very compulsive sight, I recommend it to almost everyone.
