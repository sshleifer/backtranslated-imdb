I bought this video on VCR tape at a goodwill store for US 50 cents. I picked up some videos that I bought back for them to sell to others after I saw them, considering the cost of 50 cents as a rental. This is the one that will never come back. It is an explosion of artistic talent, color and sound. I do not know if I should call it circus, dance or both. It is greater than life itself. They will only be able to do this well for only a few brief years in their lives. These are the artists for the artists. If Gene Kelly and Burt Lancaster were alive today and saw them live, they would be amazed. I would lend to others to watch, but I know that if I do, I will never come back.
