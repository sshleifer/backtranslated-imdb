Although I think SITR is Gene Kelly's best film, but it's a great movie. I liked the music and the dance and the end of how Gene got the girl. My favorite part, however, is undoubtedly the dance of Gene with his alter ego. I love watching two Gene Kelly for the price of one. It shows the talent Kelly really was. It's a movie that I think everyone should watch at least once in their lives. So you did not see go out and find to watch it today! I'm sure everyone out there has a friend Gene Kelly who has this movie in his collection. So go to their house and get some popcorn and enjoy!
