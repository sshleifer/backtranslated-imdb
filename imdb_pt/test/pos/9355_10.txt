Crossfire is a fantastic film noir that is both a product of its time and a timeless classic. This film succeeds in addressing issues that were not brought to the screen before its release in 1947, and because it is a high-quality film that remains to this day with a good screenplay, great looks and fantastic performances from its actors. The first American film to take the issue of anti-Semitism up front, Crossfire is cemented into classic standing. Set in post-World War II America, a lugubrious whodunit develops after a Jewish man is found murdered. <br /> <br /> The story is great, its anti-hate theme wrapped up in a multi-character crime thriller, and alongside the angle of anti-Semitism are also some of the great post-World War II dialogues and themes . Unlike other mystery thrillers, the public is alerted about who is the perpetrator of the crime almost immediately. However, the story of the film is still involved because of the struggle of all the great characters involved while trying to understand the situation. Out of the great general story and themes, the entire script is simply clever, complete with meaningful messages and sharp exchanges between the characters. <br /> <br /> The captivating story of the film is performed wonderfully by the excellent cast. Robert Young is fantastic as Captain Finlay, the principal investigator of the murder case. Finlay is my favorite character in the movie, he's just a cool character - bone-dry and tough as a two-by-four and stopping at nothing to get the killer to justice. Robert Mitchum is also great in the film, very vivid in his character of the soft-spoken army sergeant, due to his excellent onscreen presence. Gloria Grahame performs a memorable performance in her small Oscar-nominated role; George Cooper also does a good job as the sick and distressed corporal Mitchell; Paul Kelly gives a sinister portrait of a bizarre character; and Steve Brodie, Sam Levene, Jacqueline White and William Phipps also give strong supporting performances. Robert Ryan ends up being the most talked about artist in the film, giving a chilling performance like Montgomery and also being nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Crossfire looks terrific. Director Edward Dmytryk does an extraordinary job of running the film and director of photography J. Roy Hunt does a masterful job with his black-and-white photo. The image of Crossfire is as dark and wet as its themes, covered in shadows with an almost brilliant tone, but also very raw in parts. Ironically, the film's great looks were not the result of hard work - or even intention. Dmytryk wanted to spend more time and money on the actors than on lighting - and that's what he did. Less lights, less preparation (around 6 hours daily) and resulted in a fantastic looking film. Not just a well-made piece of cinematic art, Crossfire is also a great example of a cheap movie that ends up being a rich classic.
