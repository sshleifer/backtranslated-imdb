A great movie. Each moment masterfully driven by Toyoda and his crew. The actors perform reliably everywhere. The visuals are astounding, beautiful and sometimes beautifully stunning landscapes of the Japanese countryside and city. The sounds, courtesy of the Japanese band 'Dig', are never overly nervous as you would expect from band-made soundtracks. It is strangely atmospheric and suited to the scenes they are in. <br /> <br /> In all, they solved everything perfectly ... Well, if they were to give some justice to the story, perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted. <br /> <br /> The true greatness of 9 Souls is the compelling story. The movie about prison may be something of a genre lost these days, and the road trip movie losing its appeal because of the way the world is getting smaller. But this story easily blends something new into these two genres. <br /> <br /> 9 convicts are given freedom and possibly the opportunity to reclaim their places in society. society will accept them? are they truly free from their dark past? and can they stay together long enough to stay alive and find out? <br /> <br /> Every convict has an interesting story. Their crimes are as varied as their apparent fates. A sense of brotherhood between them keeps the story in the drama and provides it with hilarious comedic situations. And because of the nature of its origins, violence is always something that is waiting to happen. <br /> <br /> After all this, all I can say is go take a look.
