As a European, the film is a great return to my student life in the 1980s and the experiences I lived abroad and interacted with other nationalities, although the circumstances were a little different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think he is enjoying this experience. It is interesting how the film balances the message that "we should not generalize" with the notion that for each stereotype there is some underlying truth. "For example, the Italian character is based more on the but the most stereotypical aspect about the film is not a character, but the central theme of infidelity.As a critic noted, infidelity is so crucial to French cinema as the class is for British cinema. Both the main character and his girlfriend are interpreted as not totally agreeable, which I think is deliberate and grand. , but some of the nationals have elements that can be taken as a metaphor for the perceived role of their countries in the EU. The British have an affair with an American (who is an artist - as a presi the 1980s tooth of the USA), while the French shows itself as the natural leader (when the owner appears). <br /> <br /> Although Europe is not as diverse as New York, it is amazing to see only two non-white characters. One is a Chilean woman with indigenous characteristics, who despite appearing to be the age of our main character, is not portrayed as a potential object of interest. Another is a man of Gambian-Spanish origin or a man of Catalan-Gambian origin who seems somewhat invented. <br /> <br /> One might ask why Klapisch chose protagonists from well-established EU countries in Western Europe. Although these nationalities reflect what he and I would find as students in the 1980s, I believe that exchange programs in contemporary Europe are much more diverse. The Erasmus program covers about 30 countries, from Iceland to Eastern Europe, many of whom are not EU members. I understand, however, that the choice of nationalities that are most familiar to the majority of the audience may have been deemed necessary not to distract from the contrast Klapisch wants to create between the People's Europe and Bureaucratic Europe. <br /> <br /> Despite the small complaints, a great film that made me think of going back to Europe to live. A French friend of mine, also an expatriate in the United States, captured our shared feelings in this contradiction: "If Europe were more like the US, I would leave in the blink of an eye."
