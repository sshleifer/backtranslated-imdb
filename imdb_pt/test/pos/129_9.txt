This clever, moving and beautiful film is a study of how people react to tradition (reminds me of William Faulkner's novels). <br /> <br /> All characters feel trapped by the weight of the roles they must take. and look for a way to live within those roles instead of discarding them completely. But as the story unfolds, the two wives, trapped in loveless marriages, come together. Based on the strength of their friendship and love, they give each other the courage to abandon their roles. <br /> <br /> They found that living within their traditions is not life, it is a kind of living death. : without passion, without real connection with others, without realization. Although they know that there will be a price to be paid for their rebellion and freedom, it is a price much less expensive than the sacrifice required by a comfortable and predictable existence. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderful. acting wonderfully. Almost perfect!
