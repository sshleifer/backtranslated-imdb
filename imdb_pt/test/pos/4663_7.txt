**Notice! Take Ahead Spoilers! "The Italian Job" is not the best movie you'll see all year, or even this summer. But it's worth two hours, because the colors are within the lines, knowing their limits and not trying to exceed them. <br /> <br /> What carries the film is the work of the cast. In a movie about a team of thieves, individuals should have a good relationship with each other. Without this cohesive feeling, the audience does not believe in the characters collectively or individually, and the film never has a chance. But since the earliest scenes, when men play and torment themselves while infiltrating a Venetian palace, proper chemistry is in place. <br /> <br /> The characters themselves are nothing new; they are their basic gang of criminals, containing about half a dozen players, each with a specific and defining skill. But each actor brings the appropriate merchandise to the table on their part. Mark Wahlberg's discreet attitude and humor fit in well with his part as the idealizing planner. Edward Norton provides attitude and spins his mustache well in his somber role. Donald Sutherland is the paternal figure of the crew, and he seems like the part of the smooth, old-fashioned thief who is still mentally active. Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def do not do much beyond their character's abilities, but each one preaches these parts. Statham as the soft operation driver; Green as the technology geek, with a chip on the shoulder; and Def as the man of the demolitions. Charlize Theron slides well into a part that does not ask much of her. She is mainly asked to drive fast and with good looks. That she does. None of the characters are so deep or three-dimensional, but in this familiar type of film, two dimensions are all that is needed. As the title indicates, the film has a European feel, a la "The Bourne Identity," partly because it was filmed in Venice, along with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Also contributing to the euro's touch is the rhythmic and lively music which contributes to the upbeat nature of the film and complements the cast's relationship. The appearance of the film is also a perfect match. The bright colors of all places enhance mood and heighten attitude. The Minis not only provide a fun variation on car chase but also function as a necessary plot device. <br /> <br /> The plot is more or less direct. There are a few surprises, but they are more of the swift-and-smooth-turn type, as opposed to the curved curve of the chin. Even with those, the movie accelerates. Once the foundation is established by the first act, everything progresses continuously. Fortunately there are no interruptions in the action for a novel, something that the film wisely avoided. There are not even "real life" breaks. History has its purpose and runs this course without distractions. The lack of depth of character prevents "The Italian Job" from being more than a good popcorn movie, but with all the complex details of assault planning, these superfluities would have slowed down the pace and quality of the film. <br /> <br /> There are a number of implausibilities that I thought of both during and after viewing. But the movie is so fun that I do not care. In the real world, most of the film probably could not have gone so well. But "Italian work" does not happen in the real world. It takes place in an elegant and carefree criminal world that attracts the rebel in all of us. <br /> <br /> "Italian work" is a film, in the truest sense of the word. It has no pretensions to Oscar and contains no profound moral message. It offers pure escapism entertainment and does it very well. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Maybe the best popcorn movie of the year so far. 7 out of 10.
