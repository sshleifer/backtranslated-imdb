This is a little French romantic comedy about a man who bets on another who can not stay in this castle for an hour, for being haunted. And, once the guy walks into the house, it seems a lot more like a crazed fun house or maybe like the after effects of LSD !! Although there are ghosts and skeletons, there is a strange animal zoo, strange special effects and jokes as well. It is very difficult to describe, but the visuals make the film worthy of being seen. However, understand that the self-indulgent director also had many "funny jokes" that totally fell and hurt the movie. His "camera tricks" were not so complicated, but annoying and stupid. IGNORE THESE AND CONTINUE TO SEE - better. The movie is fast, fun and worth seeing. In particular, I really enjoyed watching the performance and assault of Max Linder - he was so expressive and funny! Too bad he's pretty much forgotten today. For an interesting but very sad read, check out the biography of IMDb about it.
