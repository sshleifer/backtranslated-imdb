SPOILER ALERT! Do not read unless you're prepared for some spoilers. <br /> <br /> I think this movie got so much under your shell. In addition to the apparent connections with "Oldboy" (and other Park-wook movies), an incestuous relationship in it really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hovered around all vampiric physical action. The main actor, Kang-ho Song, is fantastic in the role of Father Sang-hyeon - coincidentally, "sang" means "blood" in some languages ​​- who really loved Tae-ju, played by OK- bin Kim. Their relationship reminds me a lot of what between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in "Badlands" where the girl looks psychopathic and the man is basically curled up on his finger. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is one thing, but the mother of the girl is completely different. As it moves, it is rigid, one-dimensional and tense, but paralyzed, it says it all through not moving, or through a blink of an eye. Park-wook really, really dominated his cinematography in this film, and owes much to Stanley Kubrick; there are many beautiful scenes scattered throughout the film, some for simple effects and others that require multiple glances and probably repeated screenings to capture completely. <br /> <br /> The music is quite popular, mainly using strings to accompany. the monorail of the main actor; It's a good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is. While he does very little and misses with it, he seems to be a very thoughtful person. While his love interest says and does a lot, his actions demonstrate very little thought behind it. In my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very disturbing movie that is not made for action, which is neither in the same dimension as most things about vampires these days; is magnificent and repellent at the same time.
