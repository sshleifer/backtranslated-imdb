If you're a fan of the early Duke movies, this Lone Star old man is good. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak and Gabby? A lot of good walking and shooting !!! I found it incredible that Duke's voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It was reported that Bob Steele was a schoolmate and Duke's friend, so the twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good and clean movies, do not miss this one. We need not ask ourselves about hidden meanings or try to discover underlying themes. Sit back, relax and enjoy a western movie of one day and simpler time. It's called entertainment staff !!!
