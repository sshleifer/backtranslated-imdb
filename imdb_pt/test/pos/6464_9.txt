This is an excellent film that addresses the issue of racism in a delicate and balanced way. Great performances throughout, but absolutely exceptional acting by Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> He makes this movie breathe and live. His portrait of a guy who fights against discrimination and violence is simply mind-boggling. His performance is strong and delicate and subtle at the same time. Truly worthy of an Oscar, Poitier had to wait (because of his skin color) for many years before the brilliance of his acting was recognized by the Academy. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes also had a great performance, withdrawn, troubled and realistic as it became his trademark. He and Poitier contrast inimitably the forces of cowardice, courage and human transformation with friendship. <br /> <br /> The film is both enjoyable and at the same time deeply astounding in his portrayal of racism in the USA. The irony is that this somehow mirrors the realities under which Poitier had to work.
