I'm always impressed when a director (and this case director / screenwriter) picks up classic text - and makes him come alive. Of course, Shakespeare's text can give you shivers even when hammered with self-importance, but to see a production in which true inventiveness makes wonderful words even more - by providing context or nuance not found in the directions of the stage is simply inspiring. There are many troubling things about the game. It's a racist piece about racism - and it's still going on. I never accepted Jessica's desertion from her father without any acceptable reason. I have never accepted the position of self-righteous hypocritical Christians. But brilliantly, there is a text prologue that helps us understand the times and politics in which the story goes, and fortunately much of Jessica's part is cut short. <br /> <br /> The text is quite stripped with many cuts cut. But, I just noticed a line that was cut off the moment I expected to hear - and was replaced by a look that said it all. This economy and judicious editing gave us an exciting film - not just a feature film. <br /> <br /> And finally, there is a justification why Antonio is so loyal and generous to the unworthy / unrelated. Bassanio - you can almost feel Antonio's pulse start to run when he sees Raphael passing in a gondola, or coming for a visit. But it's as subtle as that - no more. I was bewitched. <br /> <br /> There were many other highlights. I felt that the arguments during the trial were devastating. And the suitors' judgments are hilarious. <br /> <br /> Add all this to the glorious cinematography and costumes that resonated with the times, and you will understand why I can not wait to see you again. And again.
