I've never seen a movie like that; I did not plan to see it, but it was the turn of the TV channel. I'm mostly a science fiction movie observer, but I'd be more than happy to add this to my collection. It starts as a one-sided movie with a simple love triangle, so it becomes something a little different (I can not say more than that, but it involves two guys and a girl. It does not project as you'd expect). Also, this movie starring Hugo Weaving from "MATRIX" and "THE LORD OF THE RINGS" in a role I would not have expected ... very funny face. This movie is playing on HERE TV, but if it has no satellite, it's worth renting. So take a chance; You will not be disappointed.
