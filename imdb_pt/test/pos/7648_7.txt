I really did not know what to expect from this movie and found myself being pleasantly surprised. I got him because I recently stumbled on Norman Reedus and I'm trying to find more movies he's been in. <br /> <br /> I'm not big on movies or movies, but I have to say this involved me in a few minutes. Probably because I could not stop figuring out exactly who was rushing who. This film is sleek and fast, with a story that is believable, thanks to the fantastic location and performances. <br /> <br /> While I was impressed with most in the film, I must say that Dagmara Dominczyk was simply excellent. Take a chance, it's a very fun movie.
