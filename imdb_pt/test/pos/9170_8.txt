I have to admit that I liked this movie much more than I expected. Will Smith has that clean charm that you can not help liking. The plot was a little twist on things from basic romantic comedy, somewhat reminiscent of Jane Austen's "Emma." This guy Kevin James has a real flair for comic timing and physical comedy. I've never seen his TV show, but he was very well presented in this movie. Amber Valletta was good enough. I do not remember why she was a rich celebrity in this movie, but if she was to be an actress or model, the cast might have left something to be desired. I liked Julie Ann Emery and wanted her to have a bigger part. But, keeping the best for the end, Eva Mendes stole more or less the show. Her beauty and charm, and just the right amount of detachment, had glued me to the screen whenever she was there. I hope to see more of her in the future. This movie is definitely worth checking out.
