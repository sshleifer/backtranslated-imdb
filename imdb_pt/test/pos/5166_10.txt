This is a great movie and I would like it to be released on DVD for people to buy. It's hard to try to catch him on TV all the time. As you do not know when one of the stations will decide to air it. Can anyone tell me what the file company does so I can write to them and see if they will be released to the public? I just took the last hour and a half yesterday and I only got to see it once last year. My sisters and I are looking at all the stores that sell videos. John Denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot is great. They released some much older movies and I think that's great, but there are some that they did not put out and I think if we could get in touch with the producers and express our requests, we could put some of them on DVD.
