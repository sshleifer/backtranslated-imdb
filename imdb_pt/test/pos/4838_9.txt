This was a very strong look at the bias and group mentality. The cast is made up of excellent actors doing a remarkable job. The scenarios are beautiful and a bit stylized. The art direction is top notch along with great cinematography. The story is tense and shows how prejudice and fanaticism can flourish easily. It is disturbing for its realistic and pro-royal violence of a fairly typical community. I was very impressed.
