I first saw this movie at least thirty years ago, and it remains one of my all time favorites! It's a classic - the intriguing plot, great characters, suspenseful and shocking final twist (all set against the backdrop of the breathtaking Monterey / Big Sur coast) never grow old. Roy Thinnes plays Johnny Brant, a captivating character who becomes more mysterious as his true identity unfolds. The acting is great and believable; the spectators get caught in the web that develops between the work-bound husband, the disenchanted wife and the strange seducer (Thinnes as Brant). I've been looking for a copy to buy for years - I think TV movies are not released on video, unfortunately. Great movie, see if you can find it.
