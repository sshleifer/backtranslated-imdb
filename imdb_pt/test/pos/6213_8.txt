Let's get this out of the way, so those who are checking this page looking for information on anything related to the word "Breasts" (and you know who you are, googlers) can move on: this is by no means pornographic. On the contrary, if this has any value as masturbation material, then, frankly, the filmmaker did not do a good job, since the goal is to keep him in the subject and in the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and the society and health and so on. In fact, I'd be a bit wary of anyone who came across it on DVD or, if I ever played it again, late at night on HBO or Cinemax and used it as a means to pleasure. You can also go to the grocery store and pick up a couple of ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them and, well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> No, this is semi-serious movie. making for late night viewing, but it should not be just for the early morning types. This is intimate in configuration, but not in tone. All women, in all their variety of shapes and sizes, and races, and even with a man played with fake breasts, have something of value to say, from the life experience in the most direct way possible. If I say semi-serious, it's due to the various small segments that the director feels she needs to play, with the archive of old videos about puberty, sex and breasts and super-rare cartoons with flying butlers. about. This is not a problem, but a feature: we need some small visual segments between these interviews. <br /> Nothing is retained, and we see it as feminism in a liberating way: they do not need to cover themselves, and even if they choose not to take off their tops and shirts and bras, they are still open, as it may be on a natural part of the body that is an object of sex, surprise, comfort, discomfort, curiosity, motherhood and, unfortunately, cancer. In the latter part, there is another bold step when we see a woman who survived cancer with only one breast. You know that you have become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who somehow went on to live a semi-normal life with a breast (the most bittersweet moment is when she says if a fairy godmother said she could have a wish have two full breasts, she would have to think about it), and you do not snicker or go "eww, disgusting". This is the test, people. <br /> <br /> It is not filmed under the best circumstances, but again, for the TV, it is edited at a tight pace. It is never monotonous for a moment, and we never feel that someone is holding on, especially when a man can hear the harsh truth as if the breasts were not really erogenous, or that a flat chest was very attractive to some men. Breasts: A documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and naked breasts and minds and hearts. If this is worth a session "I was alone" then, well, more power for you, I think, although it is not the intention.
