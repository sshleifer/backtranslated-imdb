If you're even slightly interested in the War Between States, it's worth watching this movie. It's a great historical story. There are no sabers, no accusations of cavalry, no carnage - just the story of a sad group of Union soldiers entering the ranch of a confederate woman and her son and taking as much as the conscience of their captain allows. This amount goes up and down as events unfold, affecting their sense of humanity in conflict with their sense of duty to their men and their cause. Ultimately, it comes to a compromise that any of us would be difficult to put on top. <br /> <br /> I thank you for the historic treatment of the war in Kentucky, a slave state that tried to remain neutral, but ended up choosing to remain in the Union under mysterious political circumstances involving the detention of certain lawmakers. About half of the Kentucky soldiers fought each side, but there was never much treatment of what it was like to have lived there in those days. This film makes a great contribution simply in the "look and feel" of time and place.
