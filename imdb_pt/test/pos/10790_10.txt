Never having seen an Oliver Stone movie before, nor any movie starring Eric Bogosian, I did not know what to expect from this film. Having toyed with the idea of ​​buying it for a while, I finally got it for free as a supplement with a Sunday newspaper and was extremely impressed. <br /> <br /> He tells the story of Barry Champlain, a talk-talk. host who can be incredibly rude to their interlocutors, often putting them in their place before they realize what is happening. Although this is what made him a popular radio host, he also earned him numerous enemies. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film was immensely impressive, with not an insane actor. Eric Bogosian is brilliant as Barry Champlain, the troubled radio host of interviews with Alec Baldwin, performing a strong performance as the head of Barry, Dan. He also presents the voice of Michael Wincott (and my appearance for wanting to see this). <br /> <br /> The story was very well written because, despite his arrogance, you feel that Barry is more about his troubled life is revealed and you see how vulnerable he really is. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone as it is captivating and, most importantly real on several levels, two of which being that is was inspired by the life of an interview radio presenter and the fact that you actually get presenters of radio programs, and callers, like the ones that appear in the movie actually. <br /> <br /> High recommendation and 10/10 <br /> <br /> Yes, your Squire
