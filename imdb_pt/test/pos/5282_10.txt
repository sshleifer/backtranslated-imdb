It is rare for a movie to take you far into your world and leave you wanting once more that the credits roll. Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo is one of those films. <br /> <br /> The film is the story of a young goldfish named Ponyo who wants to become human. She swims to the beach and is found by a boy named Sasuke, who promises to take care of her. Ponyo's father, an ecologically obsessed wizard named Fujimoto, tries to prevent Ponyo from becoming human in order to maintain the balance of nature, which turns out to be upset when Ponyo finally transforms into a little girl, causing a huge typhoon. <br /> Ponyo is a very rich movie. It is full of wonderful fantasy, lovely characters and genuine heart. What the director Hayao Miyazaki did here is to tell a simple little story, and at the same time create an authentic movie magic. <br /> <br /> Ponyo is a lovely experience. The love between Sasuke and Ponyo is very pure and true. In addition, the environmentalist within Miyazaki is still as evident in this film as in all his previous works. Miyazaki shows the dirt and grime that falls into the ocean in an almost startling way, not to mention that Ponyo's father is on an obsessive mission to cleanse the world's oceans. While the story is simple, Miyazaki manages to add this extra layer to provoke thoughts with proficiency. <br /> <br /> The film is a beautiful work of art, each cell drawn by hand looks like a wonderful pastel painting. The film looks very different from many other Studio Ghibli productions, but the art is still as spectacular as it once was. The underwater scenes are simply beautiful to see, Fujimoto's fortress at the bottom of the sea is highly inventive, and the sequence in which Ponyo crosses the fish jumping into the typhoon to reach Sosuke is iconic. <br /> <br /> Of course it's thanks to their wonderfully executed characters that make this film a memorable experience. Sosuke is a boy who acts more than he really is, and the energetic Ponyo is a laugh a minute. Each character is so enjoyable and highly memorable. <br /> <br /> General Ponyo is a wonderful experience, enchanting in every way. Although the film can be sold as a children's fairy tale, I believe that many adults will be dragged into the fantastic world along with their children. While the film may not have the density of some previous work by Miyazaki, here he keeps it pure and simple, being true to himself, presenting a movie that is funny, exciting and fun, all in one. This is a magnificent movie. <br /> <br /> I give Ponyo a perfect 10 out of 10!
