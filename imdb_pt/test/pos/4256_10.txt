If you have the chance to get hold of this lost jewel (for many years), I doubt you'll be disappointed. PS has a strange mix of social satire and ultra-legal blaxploitation - even hints of slapstick, but it's so strange that it was not just ahead of its time, nothing has been seen since. <br /> <br /> I strongly disagree with people who say the film is dated, especially with Spike Lee's "Bamboozaled" (SP?) a few years ago, that it was a failure to try to capture the same message. Robert Downy's direction is brilliant, allowing many of his actors to improvise, the film gets better as he goes, and the arrogant jokes of hitting or missing one -liners who are as forgiven as those found in a comedy by Mel Brooks, for non-PC "I can not believe they just said that 'fun.' Favorite pieces, commercials. of black and white representations of the advertising agency for beautiful colors (perhaps 16mm) and shies away from it. <br /> <br /> I refuse to suggest any spoilers, but if you have the chance to see the version in DVD, be sure and watch the interview with Downey (but leave it for after the movie). My vote 10/10 - most underrated movie of the late 60's, early 70's. Thank you. Prince.
