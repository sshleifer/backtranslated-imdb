In fact, I first watched One Dark Night at the theater and wrote a movie review for my high school newspaper. I loved it then and I still love it. The plot revolves around two people. First, a woman learns that her father has telekenise after death. She then has feelings about her father's strange powers, even at his death. The mauseleum in which he is buried is the scene of the other main person, a high school girl doing anything to come in with a group of girls who just want to torment her and dare her to stay in the mauseleum all night to join the group. They come back at night to scare her and find scares for themselves. The cast is led by Meg Tilly with supporting roles of Adam West and one of my personal favorites, Elizabeth Daily aka E.G. Daily. Check this out if you like 80's movies and cheesy horror movies, you will not be dissatisfied.
