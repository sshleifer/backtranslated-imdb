We see at the beginning of Little Dieter needs to fly Dieter Dengler, the subject of the film, an obsessive-compulsive. Or at least that's what he seems to be always opening and closing doors and with his large stock of food in the basement. In a way, the director Werner Herzog establishes a central question, so to speak, about why Dieter is like that. Well, in fact, he's not necessarily obsessive-compulsive as he's just, well, prepared. And why should not he stand behind the life he lived? In addition to the juiciest, darkest and most exciting and frightening and simply astounding survival story that is at the heart of the picture, the background story for Dieter is also fascinating. Dieter's own childhood, for example, was already arduous from the start, being in the post-war Germnay, poor of a family without much food or prospects, eating wallpaper for "the blue of the walls." But enter into a passion, a non-productive desire (which, of course, is part of Herzog's bread and butter and the love of man in his films), which is flying, and to Dieter there was nothing more to do . What it ends up leading to, after becoming an American citizen, is more than he could have haggled. Dieter is one of Herzog's most persuasive, quirky and compassionate figures throughout his career, a man whose memory is marked by brutal memories of his time as a Vietnam prisoner of war, though at least he provide some of the most compelling narratives in any documentary of the last 20 years. Ironically, the narration comes through - unlike The Wild Blue Yonder - mainly in Dieter's many and many expositions on some of the minute details of his time in the different prison camps (torture tactics, insects, brutes, bastards violence and threats as with the marriage tale), and leading to the most interesting and sad parts with his best friend Duane. They escaped from the prisons together, but found that their journey to Cambodia would not be so easy. Now, for most of the time, the conversation does something fascinating, which is when Dieter goes through his stories and occasionally plays (in the fashion that Herzog could only do, with Dieter already being handcuffed in middle age and all through the jungle ), one can imagine all this in the mind. Everything becomes even more vivid to try to get these little details and the intensity of all together in a form of reality. That Herzog keeps these parts simple, and knows when to retain Dieter in his responses, makes him even more important figure of interest. He is never totally 'normal', but unlike a Timothy Treadwell, you will not think of laughing at him either. So together with his hero (whether war or not, it is difficult to say, as Dieter contests this claim by saying that those who died were the real heroes, typical, but perhaps true), Herzog stylizes his film with a mix of old films detailing the life of Dieter (the period of World War II scenes and post-German debris). is always a captivating vision, and with Herzog stands out in its time and montage with music) and in capturing the images of Vietnam in aerial views of jungles and fields. Herzog is also very wise not to inject much politics into procedures, there is 'I was used by the Americans' or whatever is thrown into the mix. There is even a sense that Dieter does not hold a grudge against everything that happened to him, which is exactly what happens in wartime (and, of course, he was throwing bombs at people on his plane). Now, through many of those harrowing - and even in the smallest parts involving what happened in prisons, restrooms and food remains - it is always distressing - fortunately, Herzog maintains a controlled mood level as well. One of my favorite scenes in the film, where Herzog is separated for a moment from Dieter, is when he shows a "trainee" movie used for American soldiers to show what should happen if they are abandoned in the jungle. .with all the equipment they could have, including a knife, a pistol and a very fast helicopter to get around (and this is put into a hilarious narration work). <br /> <br /> Yet even the moments when one laughs only brings to mind the absurd moments in a time of absolute crisis, and how one can never really imagine what it is like to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by people who will do anything to keep that person as a form of wartime guarantee. Dieter, in addition to knowing that flying and airplanes are the only way of life he would like to have (and Herzog ends the film on an elegantly dark and elegiac note where he flies over a large field of airplanes), knows what it is that has survive at all costs. Yet, as in many of Herzog's leading films, there is the almost unalterable spirit that will remain enduring if it is strong enough, even through horrific moments (Dunae's fate) and problems to the rescue. the helicopter (he's an American, or a spy, they ask about the helicopter). Dieter is a talented man and gave Herzog a fantastic, tragic, creative, well-done, though perhaps too short, tribute to his life. And, of course, that spurts me even more for the upcoming Rescue Dawn drama.
