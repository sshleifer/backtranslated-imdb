I hate to admit it, but I did not think it was one of Hitchcock's best yet an exciting climactic thriller. In a remake of Hitchock's 1934 film of the same title, Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart)? the man who knows too much - and his wife Jo McKenna (Doris Day) are on holiday in Morocco with their son Hank (Christopher Oslen) when there is a misidentified identity case and stuck in the network of a murder plan. The conspirators go to extremes to prevent them from interfering in their plot: hijacking their beloved Hank. <br /> <br /> I found it surprising that Doris Day, who I usually associate with the comedies Rock Hudson, was cast in a Hitchcock. movie. As I watched, I soon realized that it was more of a family movie than Hitchcock's other works (example: Psycho) and she had the ability to sing "Que Sera Sera", which she did beautifully. She was well cast as she and James Stewart had chemistry, which helped make the couple believable. <br /> <br /> In comparison to the other works of the great director, I believe this is not so good, but it is still extremely family thriller / entertainment mystery. There is also the added bonus of Que Sera Sera, which turned out to be a big hit for Doris Day. Well run, well represented. A good movie.
