This was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid. It had everything - music, stories, a talking squirrel and giggling daisies. I wanted to be one of those hippie girls singing and rocking on a swing. I'm 35 years old and I grew up in South Jersey, but we have three channels in New York with our cable connection, and I think it was on Channel 11. They do not do shows like this anymore (I know it sounds so old), and I'm surprised that I grew up with only 9 channels on our TV, but I always found something cool to watch. I just talked to someone else who actually listened and watched this show. She is three years younger than me and grew up in North Jersey. I would love to see this series on DVD, so I could show it to my 5 year old daughter, and she could see what silly (but great) things her mother used to watch! I just found a VHS tape of a few episodes, and a CD of the show's music on ebay, and I bought them, even if they were a bit expensive. I can not wait to get them to relive the great memories!
