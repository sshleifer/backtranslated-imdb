This is a very moving film. This is a story about a special bond between a child and his grandfather. A villager (Arun Nalawade) brings his grandson, Parashuram, to the city to treat his eyes. But come to know that Parashuram (Aswin Chitale) has some rare eye cancer and has to undergo an operation and will lose both eyes. The film is about the emotions and the turmoil they both go through and how they accept the whole thing. The film avoids any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. Although the film is in Marathi, language is not a barrier. This proves that in order to make a good movie, you do not need songs from usual items, superstars and masalas. Excellent performances. This is India's entry to the 2004 Oscar. I hope you receive the nomination at least. Would evaluate 10/10.
