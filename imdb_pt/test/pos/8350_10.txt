Lady and the tramp ii: scamp adventure I think it's a good movie but I think the first lady and the movie tramp is better because it's the original and I think the original movies compared to the sequeals is better . Lady and Tramp II take off after the original, but this time it's Junior's turn, Lady's and Tramp's (scamp) girl always hates being treated with things that have to be done with him, following the rules of the house, taking baths all the time and things nice and easy, the scamp gets angry and runs away with a bunch of dogs that are left on the loose. Scamp meets another dog named Angel, both get along and make the father and mother of the scamp, making an Italian meal (Spagetthi and Meatballs etc). Afterwards, Scamp realizes that he is loved by his family, especially his friend, who is the baby back and Angel joins the family. I give this movie 10 out of 10.
