People who know me say that I have a weakness for animated films. To be fair, these people are right MEYERS My weakness is for exceptionally well-made animated films like this vintage family movie by Max. and David Fleischer. <br /> <br /> You may be thinking, "Well, if it's so good, why did not I hear about it?" Fair question. This movie was released the same week as the attacks on Pearl Harbor. The inevitably bad timing made the film sink in relative obscurity. But things are getting better because it was finally released on DVD under the title "BUGVILLE". <br /> <br /> It's funny that the movie has gone through all this because it mirrors the real plot. Although some people claim that the film is trying to send an environmental message (ugh), I personally think the main idea of ​​the film is perseverance through adversity and difficult times (after all, the country barely managed to get out of the Depression at the time). Our grasshopper hero, Hoppity, desperately wants to help his endangered community. Problem: Every time he tries, whether out of ill will or out of luck, he fails miserably ... and slowly begins to gain the disdain of the very people he is trying to save. Although he does his best to maintain a positive outlook, he occasionally breaks down and it is only through the encouragement and support of his friends that he gets up and fights the good fight. Just a healthy reminder that when all is said and done, no one is really self-sufficient. <br /> <br /> "Okay," you're saying. "It has a good message (two actually). Does it really do EXCEPTIONALLY WELFARE?" <br /> <br /> My answer: Partly <br /> <br /> It's not just the message that makes this movie special. It's the characterization. This is one of those movies where you can see the personality of each cast member in their animation. You hardly even need the lines. A good way to summarize everything is "energetic" or "lively". Many movies used the point of sale, "lovely cast of characters." Whenever I hear that phrase, it always makes me think of this movie. <br /> <br /> Case in question, the bandits: Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito. Many movies have "lovable" villains, but I do not think you're going to find it as entertaining or captivating as these guys. Forget the design of 3 Stooges from the 60's. Swat and Smack are the closest thing to an animated version of Moe and Curly (but unfortunately not Larry's) that you'll never find. Virtually all the funniest moments somehow involve that awful pair. Yes, they are not good, but you still care about them. That's the kind of power you just see from a really talented writer, director, and team. <br /> <br /> The film has two short jokes about racial stereotypes (Native Americans and Chinese). I do not think they were meant to be malicious; but they are there regardless of that. They did not bother me, but it would be very unfair of me not to warn anyone who would potentially be bothered by them. <br /> <br /> So if you share my weakness (and I think you do), give this one a go.
