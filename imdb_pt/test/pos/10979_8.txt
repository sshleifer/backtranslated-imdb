I watched the movie last night without knowing anything about it (nothing else looked interesting and I had a Buffalo Connection for this movie - UB graduate). It was a very nice film. I enjoyed the pace (picks up after a slow start) and history. Well written plot and good character development and relationships. Highly recommend for anyone who likes to watch movies that have interesting stories. I found myself talking about this movie after a few beers - most discussions do not last more than a few minutes.
