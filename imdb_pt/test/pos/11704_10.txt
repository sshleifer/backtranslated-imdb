Crackerjack, starring Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy - both cast members in the early 1990s, on the comedy show "The Late Show," Bill Hunter, an iconic Australian movie star and John Clarke, who still regularly watches on Australian TV side of Brian Dawe. <br /> <br /> Crackerjack is a 30-year-old guy (Jack Simpson, played by Mick Malloy) who pays his annual membership at the local bowling club to get some parking spaces for which he uses and rents to others as cheap internal parking. <br /> <br /> The club falls on hard times, and pulls all resources and members together, Jack, receives a phone call telling him to appear in the next set of Saturday cups or lose membership (and hence, the space of your parking lot) <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the rest, but the movie is funny, light and contains everything a good Australian movie should do. <br /> <br /> If you're not Australian, then some of the jokes and humor will undoubtedly confuse you, whether or is an Australian - do yourself a favor and sit down at Crackerjack .. Now available on DVD, I already have my copy! <br /> <br /> 10/10 .. Amazing movie! <br />
