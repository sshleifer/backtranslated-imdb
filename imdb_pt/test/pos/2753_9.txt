The show is great. There are no words to describe it. Wonderful song. Incredible dancing. The editors could not spoil it, not because they were not * so * bad *, but because the program is really * that * good *. <br /> <br /> Editors are compulsory cutters, you can not see a scene without a cut for more than 15 seconds. It's okay to show multiple angles, but these guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remember how many cameras they have every five seconds on average ... They can shoot the beginning of a jump with a camera, cut it in half and show the rest at a different angle. <br /> <br /> No matter how hard they tried, they could not ruin that wonderful show. It is a must for lovers of dance and music.
