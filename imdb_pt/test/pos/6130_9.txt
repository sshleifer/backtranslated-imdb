"Pink Flamingos" is a cult classic. The plot of this film revolves around the challenge of Divine's supremacy as the dirtiest living person. "Pink Flamingos" contains some memorably repulsive scenes like a sex scene with a chicken and the scene in which Divine eats. the dog is freaking fresh.Yes, the movie is shocking and funny at the same time, but the biggest laughs come from the lines of the actors.Check out especially this Divine line: "Kill everyone now! Condone murder in the first degree! Cannibalism lawyer! s ***! Filth is my policy! Filth is my life! ". Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. Yet his slogan, "An Unclear Exercise" should be taken seriously and even those who are accustomed to movies today may find this rock hard for the stomach. Highly recommended.
