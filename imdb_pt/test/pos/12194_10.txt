I've seen this movie counting the times now and I still can not get sick of it. It's like a fucking drug. I know a lot of people do not like it, but there's something about it that draws me. Each performance is spectacular, but Aaliyah is the one who steals the show. She not only played the role of Akasha, she became this. His body movement and beauty were captured exceptionally well. It is also good to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an Egyptian queen (no, I am not a bias against white people, I am one). It is true that one does not know what color the ancient Egyptians really were, but this was a good change. Stuart Townsend made me completely forget about Tom Cruise's portrait of Lestat and Marguerite was again on strike. After all, it was a good time at the movies. For those who have not yet seen, do not forget to watch it with an open mind and do not take it too seriously. I mean, it's a movie about a vampire who becomes a rock star. Take it like that.
