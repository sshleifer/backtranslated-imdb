I can differ from many people in this forum, but I like to watch Mind Of Mencia. The reason I like Mind of Mencia is that the host is not afraid to speak his mind or explore stereotypes. Carlos Mencia does what we all do with our friends, but are unwilling to admit and then some. <br /> <br /> Mencia has no problem making jokes about any race, religion, gender or orientation. While he gets a lot of attention for this, it's a breath of fresh air in these politically correct times. Mencia does not mind if he offends someone, but he is not racist and even makes jokes about his own race. <br /> <br /> The typical format of Mind of Mencia is this: there will be a fun open sketch of a person or recent event. Mencia then goes out and does a stand up of 5 or 6 minutes where he talks about various problems. The show then has two separate skits divided by commercials. In these sketches, Mencia does various things, such as making fun of people, giving personal opinions with a funny touch, or simply parodying people, events, or movies. At the end of the show, Mencia goes out for a minute with a final piece or something else to say. <br /> <br /> People criticize Mencia for exploiting stereotypes and say that his statements are overly offensive. Carlos only does what everyone thinks about certain races, but is afraid to say. As far as Mencia is offensive, he's just saying what he thinks. I do not see anything wrong with that. <br /> <br /> The show is not perfect. The skits can not be put together in the best way, and sometimes Mencia goes over his jokes. For the most part though, it's a show where the comedian says what's on his mind, no matter what the consequences and presents on a humorous subject. So if you're not scared to laugh at stereotypes and see someone speak their minds and often say what you wanted to say, then watch Mind Of Mencia. However, if you take offense easily, you should not watch this program because you will be offended, or worse, you may even laugh.
