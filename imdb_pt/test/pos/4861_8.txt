First they came to the Communists and I did not say because I was not a communist. So they came to the Jews, and I did not tell them because I was not Jewish. So they came to the Catholics, and I did not, because I was Protestant. Then they came to me, and at that time there was no one else to speak for me. <br /> <br /> Assigned to Rev. Martin Niemoller, 1945 <br /> <br /> When confronted with intolerance or injustice, the easiest thing to do is nothing - talk and you run the risk of becoming an object of contempt. But when does enough become too much? Global anti-Semitic sentiments allowed Hitler's genocidal policies to thrive, and equal doses of fomenting fear and ignorance made it possible for anti-communist purges of McCarthyism to destroy thousands of people's lives. Inaction makes a person no less guilty. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman is a chameleon of a man: quiet and indescribable, it blends seamlessly into the environment. Lawrence does not like to get involved - when he witnesses an attack on a young woman, he does not tell anyone and takes care of his business. His world turns into chaos when he buys a pair of glasses and is mistaken for one of them. Lawrence's vision of the world and his view of it is changed forever. <br /> <br /> Although the subject of this film is not new, its presentation is definitely unique. It is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice when placed within a given context - Lawrence is more concerned with the assumptions that he is Jewish than with the views of his aggressors. He believes that if he corrects this "supervision" that all will be well, without realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand. Whether playing an intriguing (the only thing I liked about "Fargo") or a sheriff of a cool guy, William H. Macy's roles are linked by a common thread - his characters share a subtle, deliberate countenance that gives them substance. Macy preaches Lawrence in the smallest detail, and says more with a furtive look or a tremor in his voice than a dialogue page. By showing, instead of saying, Lawrence is able to share his fear and perplexity with the viewer. The support cast brings the story together. <br /> <br /> Laura Dern is attractive as Gerty, Lawrence's bombastic woman with a past. Trailer park rough, yet another wise world, she also felt the wrath of prejudice as the result of "a mistake" and unwittingly exacerbates Lawrence's situation. Michael Lee Aday (aka "Meatloaf") is scary as Fred, the prototype of the next-door countryman, in equal parts of ignorance and venom, rallying neighbors to his virulent cause. In the middle of the chaos is Finklestein (David Paymer), the focus of aggression, and the voice of reason that raises the important issues. The picture of Paymer, even if delivered, makes Finklestein not become a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to generate sympathy, making him one of the strongest performances in the film. <br /> <br /> The tight edition and the closest cinematography make clean images with few distractions and blend an air of claustrophobia with the small town that the US feels - is both comforting and disturbing. The deliberate use of two-tone hard lighting to accentuate the malevolent aspects of the piece and the carefully marked soundtrack, are powerful without being overwhelming. Finally, the set and costumes recreate the feel of the time, an essential component in the film's message. <br /> <br /> The "unconventional" approach of "focus" to dealing with prejudice is sufficient reason to recommend this film. Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and appearance of the movie as bonus added.
