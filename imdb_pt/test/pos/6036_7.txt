My first 'Columbus'. I really liked it. Great format, and the extremely good character of Peter Falk ... wonderfully peculiar, he can take his place next to Poirot, Miss Marple, and also Marlowe and Rick Diamond. I can see why this series has such a following. <br /> <br /> As a professional musician, I have to say a few things. First of all, a conductor who only produces these pedestrian performances of the most basic examples of the repertoire (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Strauss Waltzes, Beethoven ...) will never have a house like this or such fame or cars like that much less be called genius. And the driving that the actor does is as bad as being ridiculous. No orchestra would take him seriously. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of little things too, like the Eine Kleine Nachtmusik rehearsal (why rehearse it when they just did it for TV? Any orchestra musician could touch it in their sleep anyway .. .). His instructions to the group are completely meaningless, and when Columbus asks Blythe Danner what "fancy" means, she says it's "Latin." It's Italian, as is the vast majority of musical instructions. <br /> <br /> And finally, neither of the two great musicians would have the following interchange: "Touch something." "What should I play?" "Chopin." Music is their work and passion, they know well. Something much more specific would be asked for and offered! <br /> <br /> I know. I should get out more ...
