I ended up enjoying this movie, but it was not the easiest to pass. What makes the movie great is the music and the scenery. The songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented. Great work was done to show different settings for Rom people. <br /> <br /> However, the viewer was not guided enough. A deeper history of the Rom people would have been cool. Only a fraction of the spoken words received English subtitles. In addition, more explanations about the settings and who they were and some of their challenges would also have been appreciated. It would have helped if there had been a narrator also explaining customs, clothing and music.
