I watched this show until my puberty, but I still thought it reflected a lot of situations that worried us when we were teenagers, even though it was a family-oriented show. Until the mid-1990s, it focused more on young adults and their situations. <br /> <br /> That's why I loved Step By Step. I mean, it offered situations for all ages and, unlike many shows of its kind, generated expectations. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest; this was not an extremely funny program, no, but there were some situations with which you could feel related but just funnier. <br /> <br /> There was an extremely good charm between Patrick Duffy and Susan Sommers. Duffy rocked! Sommers was tender and really funny. I was in love with Stacy Keegan because she was extremely sexy (loved her legs) and spirited. But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with her character Cody. He was the man back in the day! Oh, the memories. Nowadays, this show has not been able to properly fit the new generations and that is why it should be kept in the vault of memories. That's it, just memories. <br /> <br /> Thank You Footsteps for making my puberty funnier.
