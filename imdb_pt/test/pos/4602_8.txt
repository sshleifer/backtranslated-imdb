There's no other word for it ... Fox dumped it, no marketing of any kind. No one in the country, other than those who are looking forward to this movie, knows something about it. All red flags flew. It has to be a mess, it can not be anywhere near as good as Office Space, right? Wrong. Although Office Space is not, this movie definitely has satirical bite and wit. It is an ignition fault at certain levels, but who is to blame is left to the mystery. <br /> <br /> Based on what is being shown in theaters, I can say that IDIOCRACY is a good movie. It's funny, sometimes funny. It is effective, sometimes resourceful. What is not, as far as I can tell, is finished. Let's see something coming from this movie again, whether it's a prolonged cut or re-scans. Alone, it can be hilarious. Sometimes it's brave. <br /> <br /> Leaving the theater, looking around the mall, I was surrounded by advertisements and billboards, commercialism and stupidity. It's not exactly like a 1984 dystopia, but this movie paints an ugly future for our culture. And there does not seem to be much that anyone can do about it. Anyway, go see this if you can and try to find out what happened that was so specifically buried.
