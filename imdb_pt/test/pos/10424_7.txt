This was a great soft-core movie for both men and women. Lots of nudity / sex, but without the general presentation you will usually find. They could not have done a better job in the cast, since the whole set was impressive. Believe me personally, if you want to get your wife in the mood, get something with Bobby Johnston! And I'm sure the lovely Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell, and the rest of the women would do that to any heterosexual man. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do, please PM me! I would love to know. The photo was much better than usual. That was the story. Predictable, but sweet, sweet and romantic. At worst, it was not one of those troublesome predictable murder mysteries filled with blond women with huge, fake breasts. I give this 7/10!
