The award-winning Akin Head-On / Gegen die Wand movie portrayed the attractive chaotic world of a self-destructive but dynamic Turkish-German rock star named Cahit (Birol Ünel). This documentary is a follow-up to Head-On and explores the variety of music that can be found in Istanbul today if one were as energetic and curious as Alexander Hacke, a German avant-rock musician from the group Einstuerzende Neubauten (who organized the soundtrack and performed some of the music for Head-On) and enlisted the assistance of a film crew and speakers from Turkey provided by director Akin. You get everything from rap to more traditional Turkish classical music with rock, Kurdish music and Turkish pop in the middle. It is as chaotic and open a world as that of Cahit, in which the East is the East and the West is the West, but the two somehow meet. As Istanbul itself, which stands on the border between Europe and Asia and unites the two worlds, remaining sui generis, is a melody that includes Turkish pop, traditional Turkish songs, Kurdish laments, Gypsy jazz musicians and street performers (Siyasiyabend ), lively and unusual scenes of life in the streets of Istanbul, and some talk on camera about the synthesis and some personal and musical history of singers and musicians. Working at the London Grand Hotel in Istanbul's Beyoglu neighborhood, where Cahit stood at the end of Head-On while searching for his beloved, Hacke wanders around the city with staff and equipment interviewing people and recording their music. <br /> <br /> Does it start with a bit of high rock by the band "neo-psychedelic" Baba Zula? these are musicians with whom he joined while he was playing the Head-On score and he's here for the absent bassist - and by Turkish rappers (including brave women)? causing some seniors to leave the theater early on and miss the predominantly melodic and easy-to-hear sounds that make up most of the film. (The narrative excesses of the Head-On were tempered periodically by musical interludes performed by a traditional Turkish orchestra sitting outdoors on the other side of the Bosporus.) Hacke gives us the opportunity to meet and listen to performances by some of the best known live Turkish singers, including Müzeyyen Senar, an eighty-something lady whose elegant and aged musicians recall the way the great Egyptian singer Umm Kulsoum used to perform. Hacke causes Orhan Gencebay, a film composer, to make a ground striking about the long neck oud on which he wrote all his songs, and convinces the now elusive Sezen Aksu to make a special performance of one of his most famous, "Memory of Istanbul". Is this a blow, as well as the lament of a beautiful Kurdish singer Aynar recorded in a bath whose acoustics are spectacular, if only they could refuse the heat? the faces of the singer and musician flow with sweat. There is also a young Canadian woman, Brenna MacCrimmon, fluent in Turkish, who sings traditional Turkish folk songs with expression and fervor. The sound mix is ​​of high quality throughout. Someone would like to see a sequel; many great examples of Turkish classical and folk music were necessarily left out. <br /> <br /> The film was released in the summer of 2005 and screened at festivals in 2005 and 2006. It opened at the Angelika Film Center in New York on June 9, 2006.
