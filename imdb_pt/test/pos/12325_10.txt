I've watched thousands of movies in my life and I believe this movie is the most "perfect" movie ever made. By perfection I mean the narrative, the plot, the acting, the staging, the camera work, etc. (This is a lay opinion; I have no experience in film production.) Many movies have perfect scenes, like the bartender filing a report with the cop in the movie Fargo. (Actually, this scene could be very short). In The Dead every scene is done to perfection, making the entire movie perfect. Maybe, John Huston sold his soul to the devil to make such a movie. I hope Daniel Webster got him out of the contract!
