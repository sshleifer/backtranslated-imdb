I remember watching this when it was done and thinking it was brilliant back then. Watching for the second time almost 20 years later, I still think Traffik is brilliant and much better than the US movie that was based on this drama. <br /> <br /> It should also be seen by all who see tomorrow tomorrow the politicians who think they can win the war on drugs, as the issues raised in this film are as pertinent today as they were in the 1980s, and unless they change their policies, they will do so in another 20 years. <br /> <br /> Well written, well done, beautifully rendered and superbly filmed. An intriguing drama that entertains and brings to light some of the harsh realities of the criminal drug trade.
