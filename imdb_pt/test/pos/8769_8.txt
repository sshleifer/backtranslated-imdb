Alfred Hitchcock's "Saboteur" (1942) (not to be confused with another Hitchcock movie, "Sabotage" made in 1936, which has a completely different plot) is not the greatest Thriller movie. It does not have the depth of "Vertigo" (1958) nor the atmosphere of Rebbeca (1940) and certainly does not have the emotional impact and talent that can be found in "Notorious" (1946), but what Dose is emotion, adventure and a nail-biting climax. The two clues, admittedly, are rather weak. It is easy to understand why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the role of Robert Cummings and Barbara Stanwyck for the role that was taken over by Priscilla Lane. In addition, the patriotic speeches that Cuumming says (which were written by Dorothy Parker) dated poorly, and the encounter with the circus troupe is poorly done (the beard on the bearded lady is clearly false). However, the last half hour is the tip-top view of his seat, the climax at the top of the Stature of Liberty is very well done, and the film is a clear predecessor of "North By Northwest" (1959). The two villains, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd, are very good and the beginning of the fire in the Aircraft Factory is an excellent sequence. This is not the best movie that Hitch did, but it's one of the funniest.
