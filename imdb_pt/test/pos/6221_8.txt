All Risto Jarva movies are worth seeing. Some such as "Jäniksen vuosi" and "Loma" are the best films in their genre and have achieved a status of classics in the history of Finnish cinema. <br /> <br /> Most people formed an impression of actor Antti Litja through Jarva. movies. Litja starred in three of Jarva's films, which became box office hits and movie reviews. It is good to see that the idea of ​​"Jäniksen Vuosi" still lives in commercials (I think it was tele.TV operator Sonera add where Litja was walking on the mountain fell in Lapland with hare in his Everibody arms who saw the movie knows what I'm talking about.) "Jäniksen Vuosi" It's a beautiful movie with great actors and good movie locations - like the famous little town in Lappland, Sodankylä, where the best Film festival in the world is held - the Midnight Sun Film Festival. I recommend everyone go there in June - but remember to warm clothes and raincoat :)
