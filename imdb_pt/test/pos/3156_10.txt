USA The movie looks like this: You take a nap on a hot Sunday afternoon. It's great to close your eyes and let your worries drift away. Soon you are lost in one of those intense lucid dreams where you know you are dreaming but still can not wake up - not that you want to. You go with the flow, and soon you are in a kind of strange story of Alice in Wonderland, complete with characters you do not think you could dream of. They are telling you all sorts of crazy things about war and peace while they take you on a journey into the past and into the future. <br /> <br /> The dream starts to get heavier and you feel you are going down a path that you can not control. Maybe you want to wake up, so you try to open your eyes, but you can not. Now there is destruction and sadness and confusion and scary voices telling you what could be true or lies. You are seeing images that flash and change and then become clear, but do you still want to see what your brain is creating for you? <br /> <br /> Finally you are lost in a world of myths and realize that the end has come. The end of the world and the end of the dream. Ended. What do you wake up to? What do you do next? <br /> <br /> You may write this dream because you know that dreams like this do not happen very often - and when you do better, pay attention. <br /> <br /> Or maybe you break a beer and forget the whole thing. Bad idea. Do not forget
