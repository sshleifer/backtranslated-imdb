William Haines unleashes the story of an impetuous cadet who thinks West Point will actually be something now that it has arrived. Haines' spectacular comedic performance was his hallmark - one that made him one of the biggest box office stars of 1928-1932 and one of MGM's biggest stars. Joan Crawford and William Bakewell are also well. And although this story may seem banal now, it was a great success, putting Haines and Crawford into a history of college football (a 1920s national craze). After Haines expels his big mouth very often and is almost thrown out by other cadets, he performs a wonderful performance as he swallows his pride and enters the big game against the Navy. Even with a broken arm, he wins the game for the Army and regains his place at West Point. It's easy to see in this movie and in Show People (with the always underrated Marion Davies) because Billy Haines was a big star of the time. He needs and deserves to be remembered!
