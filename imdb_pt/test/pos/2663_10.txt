I write this comment only after hearing of Stanley Kubrick's death. It is a great loss, and I write about 2001: THE SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it is Kubrick's consummate film, the one by which he will be most remembered. It is an image like no other, not just revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way movies are conceptualized. It was probably the first 'art' film in the US and inspired names like George Lucas and countless other writers and directors. <br /> <br /> In addition to its visual greatness, the reason the film raises so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, their co-writer, had a vision, but we never figured out what was going through their heads. Of course the "message" is how the technology of the future will take humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. The end of 2001 is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to Earth. It does not make sense to many, but the most demanding viewers will understand. <br /> <br /> Although 2001 does not have the bad mood of DR. STRANGELOVE or ORANGE CLOCKWORK, or contain strong and eccentric characters who fill their previous works as PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would have liked to be remembered more for that. If anything, HAL will be your most memorable, dangerous, murderous and artificial character. It took about half a decade in a time when Hollywood was still producing boring musicals and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was an independent director who made great movies on his own terms, in his own time and for all the others to marvel. He will be missed.
