I just got the Hardware Wars DVD in a shiny new package, looking irresistible. Stuck on my DVD player to find a huge amount of extra fun stuff. The extra content on the DVD is even bigger than the movie. For those of you who (shame!) Have never seen Hardware Wars, it's a fantastic parody of Star Wars (from Episode IV, of course). Appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuum cleaners, and a waffle maker) replace Ty-Fighters, X-wings, R2D2, and the Death Star. Instead of Princess Leia, we have Princess Ann-Droid, complete with the Cinnabon hairstyle. You get the point, I'm sure. Crazy madness, and a fun ride for any Star Wars geek (like me!) <br /> <br /> Now, the DVD - wow! A commentary by the director, in which he basically leaves for the film, making fun of himself and the project. An interview with Fosselius on Creature Features (remember this?!) And hilarious "cut director" and "foreign version" of the movie (all jokes, of course). Anyway, that's great. I loved Hardware Wars in the theater, and I'm very happy to have the DVD in my collection - between MST3K: The Movie and Thumb Wars!
