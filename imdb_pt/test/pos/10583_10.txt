I just bought this movie last night, and I love it. Everyone did very well, especially Ryan Dunn and Bam Margera. The whole plot was great, and as Dunn said in the DVD extras, they seemed to be reliving it all again. This movie made my first place in my favorite movies! I can not stop repeating scenes repeatedly, only to see again. I've never done that with any other movie. I would definitely recommend it to other people to watch, because it's such a great movie, and if you like Bam Margera, it's a perfect movie for you !! The little mounts that they show between each scene are great. I think these are my favorite parts of the movie. They are very sad, especially with the band's music 'HE', which of course is my favorite band.
