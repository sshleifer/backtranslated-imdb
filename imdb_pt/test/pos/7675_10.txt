The many comments made by others have been very informative and I participated in their calls for the release of Porgy and Bess, the 1959 film. In early adolescence I joined a discography club and this album was a. the ones I chose to enter. I knew that some of the voices were dubbed, but only Robert McFerrin was recognized on the album. Recently, my daughter bought a CD from Austria, I think. The quality is excellent, so I'm confused about why it's available in Europe by CBS Records, Inc when I was not lucky in local stores. <br /> <br /> In fact, I've never seen the movie, but for years. They asked local video companies to get it. Now I know why it was never available. <br /> <br /> I add my voice to others who defend the heirs of property and rights and that they agree to release it, however imperfect they may be - the beauty of music and history has reached so many of us who would never have had experience otherwise. <br /> Trudy
