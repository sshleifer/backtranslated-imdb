What would it be like to be accused of being subversive? This is what this movie explores through the eyes of 2 characters, one of them being the accused subversive, the other being the interrogator. It's a scary journey from start to finish. This movie is not for everyone and if you do not fully understand political governments, you will never understand the movie, as 90% of reviews here prove.
