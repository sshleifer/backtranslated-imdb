If you step into the Gemini Effect looking for a pure cinematic experience in Hong Kong, you will be disappointed. This is not to say bad, but it is NOT a traditional Hong Kong action movie that runs in the same style as Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. It's decidedly silly and juvenile, so if you want a good dose of serious action in Hong Kong, look for a John Woo or Yuen Woo Ping movie. This movie has a lot of criticism for its nonsense and I thought the first thing I should do would be to explain what you are getting into since it disappointed many purists. <br /> <br /> For non-purists and those with more indulgent tastes, Twins Effect is a delightfully silly kung-fu comedy. I liked it a lot for a variety of reasons, not least, it's wonderful women who get their act together in a double act of quite funny comedy. I believe this is the first movie of the kind they've been in, but they jump, kick and fly like experienced pros. <br /> <br /> The patently ridiculous plot is treated with much care and attention. and the film is consciously written, causing many movies to laugh aloud. Comedy is really the most prominent thing here, and it's a subtle and gentle comedy, as dependent on words as inanimate objects that fly to the Stephen Chow. It has to be said that the slapstick is a lot of fun too. The sequel to the disco dance vampires is a total classic. <br /> <br /> Action is a mixture of two genres really. He sits between the wire fights and swords of Jackie Chan's "period drama" (which comes closer to the end) with a mix that is sometimes always exciting to watch and occasionally launches some genuinely innovative encounters. <br /> <br /> All this is great, and the movie is a lot of fun all the time. Despite this, there are some points of contention. For example, Twins Effect is in many ways much more Westernized than kung-fu fans are accustomed to, the inevitable comparison with the Blade series is definitely a good example, although Twins Effect is honestly much better than Blade has ever achieved, especially for combat action. Personally, it was also a shame to see the great Anthony Wong (the hissable villain of John Woo's classic Hard Boiled) so underutilized, but it's unlikely that the younger audience will see this or actually know about Hard Boiled or his other films, so this is just a personal complaint. <br /> <br /> If you watch it with an open mind, you're probably going to enjoy it a lot like I did, but you should be well aware that it's a COMEDY, not a kung-fu movie on the wall. Keep this in mind and you'll be fine.
