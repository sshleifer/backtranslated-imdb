Who would have thought that a non-disabled actor could act as realistically and immensely powerful as a person with a disability in a movie? Probably someone. But no one, really anyone, could ever compare their expectations with the incredibly emotional and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film. <br /> Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a house for the physically disabled. people. He has the Cerebral Paulsy and, as we were shown early on, he has a major problem in communicating. So it's really a lifeline when fellow disabled Rory (James McAvoy), who knows how to speak normally, understands him. Thus begins a friendship that depends mainly on communication (ironically). <br /> <br /> In a hilarious scene, they manage to leave the house for themselves. After Rory was rejected, with a good heart, Michael filed a request to move to his own home. Rory, who already had a bad name with the "judges", would be his interpreter. <br /> <br /> But problems soon arise. They willingly chase after a girl they met in a pub a while back, wanting her to be his assistant to do the little things that matter. She is at first reluctant; she does not know these men, but it seems they could be harmless; So, another friendship comes along, but not necessarily a good one ... <br /> <br /> Besides being moving, however, this movie really depends on the actors. But that's not a bad thing. For a non-disabled actor, you see Rory, although he can communicate properly, frustrated with the way he is completely dependent on other people and has no real life of his own. But the real star for me is Steven Robertson. He acts with so much emotion, longing to fit in and sadness / happiness, that really makes him win the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Excellent. <br /> <br /> Total: 5 out of 5
