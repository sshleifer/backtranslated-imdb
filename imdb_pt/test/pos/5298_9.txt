I have the strong impression that what you think of this film will depend heavily on your frame of reference. If you've never seen a Miyazaki movie before, it will probably confuse the movie with you. If you've seen a Miyazaki movie before, then it's probably going to confuse hell with you ... but you will not mind! That's because I thought the first time I saw one of your animated films, I tried very hard to figure out what was going on and why - and it impacted my pleasure in the movie. Now that I've seen almost every Miyazaki movie, I see the bizarre and absorb everything - enjoying the beauty of it all. In many ways, these films (at least for Western audiences) are like drugs - many strange and beautiful images that do not always make sense, but which are great to watch !! Of all the Miyazaki movies, this may have the most unusual and incomprehensible plot - even more than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. But as these and many other Studio Gibli movies, if you just sit and watch, you will be rewarded with a fabulous tale. But because it is so difficult to describe (and others have already done so), I will not even go there. <br /> <br /> As for the work of art, it is very typical of one of these Japanese films, there has been a remarkable change. There was a very extensive use of what appeared to be crayons for the back. This was not a bad thing at all - the lovely looking like a pastel was very nice and unique. In a way, it seemed that a little bit of Bill Plympton's art style was infused into a typical Miyazaki movie. With a high frame rate, exceptional character animation (which imbues them with lots of personality) and an excellent "surprise factor", this is an exceptional film for all ages. Although clearly designed more for the younger crowd (especially TOTORO fans), it is a little scary here and there (during storm segments), but there are many good things for adults. As an adult (at least in chronological order), I loved the cute things and I applaud the other world of the movie. <br /> <br /> A great movie - among the best in Miyazaki. I do not give 10 because I'm hesitant to do it - and I enjoyed a bit more of the other studio films (particularly TOTORO). But that does NOT mean you should not rush out and see - do yourself a favor.
