I thought this movie was highly underrated. The subject seems like it would be a little weird, and I was delayed at first, but since I was watching the movie, it did not look weird. I was intrigued by all the different possibilities the story had to offer, and could not wait to find out how that would end. Once it turned out ... I thought about it for a long time afterwards. I was pleased with everything about K-Pax, from acting and history and the scientific elements and psychological issues to the end. It's not a particularly optimistic or happy film, although it makes you laugh from time to time, but I found it especially fun and thought-provoking. We own now, and intend to watch this many times.
