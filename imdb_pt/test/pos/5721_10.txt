The shows of a man by John Leguizamo are unpredictable: Mambo Mouth showed his intense characterizations and great timing, but the material was medium, Spic-o-Rama also performed the first, but this time the material was funny, Freak is a classic followed for their disappointing Sex-o-holic. But his stuff on Freak show his genius and when he's in the limelight, he's peerless. <br /> <br /> The semi-autobiographical look of Freak on a young man's journey has power and resonance I do not think he is not even creator wise on. By allowing us the chance to see his soul, Mr. Leguizamo gives us the opportunity to project our own life into his and there can be no greater gift than an interpreter can give. The willingness to let go of 'the Wall', expose and share is terrifying to most actors - they use characters to hide - but JL goes full throttle and cheerfully crushes any pretension. Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor were our best cultural observers / comedians / actors because they spoke from the heart about what they noticed in society and the truth provided sharp humor. Combine this with the great impersonator gift of a great actor and be in the moment (not to mention a sense of humanity) and you will see that John Leguizamo has the power to do the same. At least in Freak it does. From birth to its first great break and every moment that changes life in between, the viewer sees our host and other characters in their most intimate moments while experiencing the pain, hope, and humor that comes with . Looking drained and lean, muscular and tight, JL is sweating at the end of the night, having offered his crazy life to an audience; The fluid work of Spike Lee's camera captures the actor's nuances to the last wave of the lips and the slow blink. The scenarios range from drinking with his father fueled with machismo (when he was 9 years old) until he saw A Chorus Line with his gay and deaf uncle; the cruel humiliation of his first girlfriend when he undressed, eager to have sex. A first nightmare sexual encounter with a great German in the background of a Kentucky Fried Chicken follows a failed attempt to get a "drunk lapsed catholic" at a bar on St.Patty's Day. Climatic in a serious confrontation with her mother and father, it is here he shows his true genius: he plays a scene between these two characters and he and his brother with a dramatic / humorous intensity so strong, you forget that you are watching only one person. There are no costume changes, bad wigs, lighting tricks or makeup. Just an actor giving it all. It's just incredible. Other actors / comedians who stand out now are Eddie Izzard and Chris Rock, but they do not plunge themselves as deeply as John Leguizamo; this is not a criticism, even from a distance. I love their work, but the Freak is different. It is moving in a non-b ******* way. It's the best show of a man out there and no one will be able to touch him for a long time.
