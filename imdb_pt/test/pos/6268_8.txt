God Bless Joe D'Amato ... I love Italian horror, cheese (film-wise;)), science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> This, admittedly, was a little harder to watch, but another fun BAD movie. I like how people preface a negative review with "I usually like bad movies, but ..." No problem, this was a bad movie for people who love bad movies. It's one of my best bad movies. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keefe was a poor man of Conan, but what fun. Who can not have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb, a hangglider, and a rubber monster? It's good to hate this movie if you only like Hollywood as "Titanic" or "Pretty Woman", but if you really mean it, TRUE love bad movies, check out this one. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a beerbust or when you have a couple friends around and looking for some tasteless fun. <br /> <br /> My rating 8/10.
