This movie is about a deadly poison that is contained in small glass globes that is used to kill. This is apparently done to hide an espionage ring with the intention of stealing plans for a new American bomber. Now much of this plot has been repeated in other films by Chan, THE JADE MASK and THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS. In addition, it was first used in MR. Wong, a detective - they all had exploding glass globes - an element of the plot that was obviously overused. It was interesting in MURDER ON NEW YORK, but by those later films it was a little pass√©. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the rest of the film was recent and the plot worked very well - with a cool conclusion where of course, the culprit is revealed. However, no plane could fly the way it did - especially in the 1940s. Such extreme dips and fast climbs were very foolish outside of this already obsolete plane. <br /> <br /> By the way, in a small role as a doorman you'll see Frank Coghlan Jr. - the same actor who played Billy Batson in the series CAPTAIN MARVEL. According to IMDb, Coughlan is 93 and retired from the film industry.
