This Columbo is unique in that we do not really know the exact outcome until the end. Our favorite Dark Horse Detective suspects a pair of identical twin brothers to kill their rich uncle; each one points the finger at his brother. In a mystery series where crime is shown at the beginning of the drama, this turnaround could only reasonably be used once or twice, and that was Columbus' time. In addition to this wrinkle, this episode fits well with the others in the series. It has a lighter tone than some, with a very funny performance of Jeanette Nolan as the meticulous and loyal maid who does not like Columbus.
