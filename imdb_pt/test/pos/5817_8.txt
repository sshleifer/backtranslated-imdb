Minnie and Moskowitz is the most pathetic and inelegant love story I have ever seen. Between Minnie, a disillusioned curator at the museum whose abusive married boyfriend leaves her and makes her even more tense and confused than she already is, and Seymour Moskowitz, an attendant so desperate for attention that she spends her nights going to bars and restaurants aggravating people , there is a chaotic and disenchanted game from the beginning. Just like so many combinations we see every day. In almost every love story, there is a man and a woman, the man being confident, funny, or classically hot or attractive in his own way, whose shortcomings are charming, and the woman a wounded soul that there could be any man she wanted me to pick this guy because there's just something about him. These films make everyone feel so good because the characters incorporate what every man and woman wants to be, not what they are. Minnie and Moskowitz, instead of indulging in any hint of fantasy in the novel, portray people who may be more common than the attractive and confident people with so much experience in the field. What is the story behind the love affairs of the ugly, frighteningly clumsy, lifeless and jobless man we all face, or the woman so affected by insecurity that it's hard to talk to her? <br /> <br /> The film is not as fascinating as Cassavetes' Faces or Opening Night, but it has that fascinating quality that Cassavetes has always fought so hard to render, which is a rampant depiction of people under the ego that lies behind of himself in almost every other film. Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassel, delivering surprisingly pitiful people, are hardly sympathetic. Moskowitz almost drives us crazy, let alone Minnie. He imposes himself so strongly in his life, the dates are an explosion of our inner voices that respond to the blinding and inept restlessness of encounters we have been in, rejections we all swallowed and arguments we all had that we knew were our own faults. I admire a movie like Minnie and Moskowitz because, as the trademark is of the films that Cassavetes directed, he identifies with 100% honesty. Our egos play no role in the company of their characters, therefore, a tremendous achievement achievement for the actor.
