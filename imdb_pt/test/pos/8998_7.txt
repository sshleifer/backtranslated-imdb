First, let's call this movie what it is: 1. It's a well-being movie with a message. <br /> <br /> 2. The acting is fine, the dialogue is a bit better, the production value is very good. <br /> <br /> 3. Rugby scenes ... barely passable. <br /> <br /> But here's the trick: this is not something Hollywood invented, and it's not trying to be a fiercely accurate portrait of the sport. Instead, it's a good representation of mostly real people, under real circumstances, and a real plot. Of course, they could have done a better job, actually rethinking the sport, but my vote: it does a good job at what it proposes to do. <br /> <br /> (And fwiw, I can not think of many American football, baseball, hockey or football movies that are true to the sport. <br /> <br /> Come on ... Bull Durham? > I'm not a rugby player (I was a fighter) but I graduated from Highland, I attended '86 -'90 and occasionally trained with the Rugby guys. My brother-in-law, David, however, was one of the original founders of the Highland Rugby Club in 1976. (His younger brother, Billy, played the following year, as far as I remember. highlandrugby.net that addresses the history of the team. <br /> <br /> By the time I was there, the club had been around for over a decade and had long been building a reputation for excellence. I thought the rugby guys I knew were a little "out" in the head but I think I could have been a bit jealous. They were devoted to the belief system that Gelwix promoted. With regard to the issues of "cultural mixing" that were raised, it may be interesting to note that while I was there In the 1980s, one of city ​​was closed - South High School - and its students distributed between the other three SLC primary schools. To be honest, the Highland pre-80 was pretty white ... I have a picture of the 1977 team that shows an all-white club. South High, on the other hand, was a much more racially integrated school before closing: I had a couple of South friends who joined the team, a Tongan, a Samoan, and, as I recall, there was a flock of island nation . players who joined in '88 -'90. I do not think anyone questioned the team's credibility in adopting Maori traditions (or other cultural traditions): if there was one thing that was obvious about these guys, it was they walking on the walk. <br /> <br /> And as for the strength of the team when compared to the best high school teams in the world: yes, it is true that US-Rugby, on average when taken as a whole, does not stand particularly well against the best somewhere else. There are exceptions, but hey - it's a simple fact that Rugby does not have the prominence or exposure needed to develop the many traditions of excellence in the US that emerge in other countries. <br /> <br /> With that said, judge Highland on its merits: <br /> <br /> - the only team * to qualify for the US National Rugby Championships every year in the history of 25 years organization. <br /> <br /> - a record win of 392 wins, 9 losses. Read this again ... most successful coach in any US sport in history. <br /> <br /> - Regular international tours. <br /> <br /> - some convincing victories against some legitimate international teams. <br /> <br /> Are they the best in the world? Maybe a few years, probably not most ... but they are very good on a consistent basis. And it is disrespectful to the game, when Highland Rugby could be the best ambassador of the sport in the USA.
