E. Elies Merhige's Begotten is a surreal representation of mankind's treatment of religion. There are a few different ways of interpreting things, but the plot itself is simple: a god escapes, and from his corpse, the mother earth sprouts. Mother Earth then felaciona the corpse of the god after death and then impregnates with what remains of her seed. After that, she gives birth to a messianic figure who trembles, presumably in childhood, but possibly with terror as she is brought to life on Earth. All this happens in the first 15 to 30 minutes, and after that, the rest of the film consists of robe figures dragging the messiah (who is shaking incessantly) into a desert landscape. The dressed figures just stop to brutalize the messiah, and then continue to drag him around. <br /> <br /> There are a few ways to interpret this, depending on your level of optimism and your worldview. It can easily be interpreted as a grim nihilistic atheist allegory about the total lack of apparent power that Christian "deities" can be perceived as having in a modern society that only invokes their names to further their own selfish goals. Or you can interpret it as a postmodern pro-Christian allegory in which you see the film as mankind has so distorted the message of Christ that its original purity and innocence can no longer be relevant in a world where this message and image are inadequately used to endorse everything from interpersonal violence to war to totalitarianism. <br /> <br /> The visuals of this movie are phenomenal, and you will not see anything like it, period. If you can, watch the original VHS version, I recommend it. I'm not sure if the visuals were changed on DVD, but I saw clips from that broadcast on YouTube and the effects were seriously reduced. In the VHS version, Merhige reached TOTAL BINARY CONTRAST. That is, basically there are no average tones except for a few grains in some photos. In addition, this film offers the rare opportunity to see PURE white and PURE black, and the result is impressive, hallucinatory and quite unsettling. This film makes Film Noir look positively faded and mediocre. The shots undo themselves in a surreal way that resembles Un Chien Andalou without imitating it completely, for an effect that has been called a Rorschach test. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the film can certainly tempt the patience and commitment of the viewer. There is no dialogue for beginners. The only sound throughout the film is a fairly constant cycle of chirping crickets, occasionally splashed with the gurgling, deadly shrieks of dying deities, and a sleepy amelodic synth texture. Personally, I think the film is more appreciated by listening to experimental industrial music like NIN's instrumental remixes of the Downward Spiral era, more abstract sounds / experimental music like F * ck Buttons and Odd Nosdam. Also works great with apocalyptic black metal. Basically any music with extreme textures and / or hypnotic rhythms. This is one of the most incredible and versatile aspects of this film, it is PRIME for postmodern recontextualization, how to design it during a vanguard music performance or compose avant-garde music to accompany it. <br /> <br /> Once the figure of the Messiah is born, there really is not much change to the rest of the movie, which means that you are basically sitting for at least 45 minutes or more of the figure of the messiah being drugged in the wilderness and spanked. It looks very beautiful, but really there is nothing new unfolding. This helps to cement the intentions of filmmakers to communicate that for thousands of years people have been using the name and image of Christ for personal gain, but they can be tiresome for a casual spectator or for someone with little attention. Basically, if you're looking for a modern horror movie with suspense, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a unique cinematic experience, and you do not really like Hollywood movies, this can be your quivering messiah.
