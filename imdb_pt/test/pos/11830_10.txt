A rich young man, raised as a SON OF GODS, must confront his Chinese heritage while living in a White world. Although the premise on which this film is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility and plot secret when revealed at the conclusion of the film does everything that preceded it slightly ridiculous, the story still serves some decent entertainment and good acting. <br /> <br /> Richard Barthelmess has the leading role as the Eastern sweet-natured whose life is terribly complicated because he seems Caucasian. Barthelmess maintains the tone of his serious performance throughout, looking closely at the average distance (a mannerism he developed during the Days of Silence) whenever his character is indecently misused. He makes no attempt to replicate his classic performance in D. W. Griffith's BROKEN BLOSSOMS (1919), and this is for him. Beautiful Constance Bennett is the daughter of the millionaire who makes Barthelmess miserable. She is beautiful as ever, but her behavior does not favor the viewer and her terrible illness on the last roll is mercifully kept off the screen. <br /> <br /> The multi-talented Frank Albertson has a small role as Barthelmess. improvised friend. Serene E. Alyn Warren and stormy Anders Randolf interpret parents very different from the stars, while Claude King distinguishes his brief appearance as the English author who befriends Barthelmess. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize little Dickie Moore, uncredited, playing Barthelmess as a little kid. <br /> <br /> The original Technicolor of the flashback sequence has faded over time into a reddish tint. The shot that appears to be southern France, on the other hand, looks suspiciously like Avalon on the island of Santa Catalina on the southern California coast.
