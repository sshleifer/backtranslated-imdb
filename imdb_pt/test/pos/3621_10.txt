Incredibly hilarious Italian Rootsploitation mid-70s with lots of non-consensual S & M, lesbian sex, gratuitous racial cruelty, etc ... Few redeeming cinematic qualities except for the rather cool theme song with dubby drums and "African" flute. Shiny Sample Dialogue: White Slave Owner (for White Plantation Manager): "You're so dumb, I bet you forgot to question that midwife!" <BR> White Plantation Manager: "Not only did I question her, I did it so well that she died before I could get any response from her!" <br /> <br /> All black actors have 70 afros, and say "yes, dough" out loud. The female protagonist has sex with everyone in the plantation. 10 stars for fans of sleaze without taste.
