The film did not have any help in terms of promotion: if there was an advertisement on TV or radio, I did not see it. The only newspaper ad that I saw was its opening weekend: a photo of Andy's B & W as Val-Com, behind prison bars, with the headline: "WANTED! Runaway Robot!" (which was also the poster in front of the 3 movie theaters I saw - NOT the beautiful colorful poster on this site, with head shots of the whole cast, and Crimebuster cartoon - which really was NOT SO GOOD - - They should have used an action scene from the movie itself - do not they have a beginner photographer? A poster should help a prospective audience decide if they want to see the film - there were SO MANY people who could not come up with their exhausted choice, and wanted to know what it was Heartbeeps - and that poster did not help! This somber picture, and the only other photos provided to the roles were so indistinguishable in black and white that they were There was no trailer for the movie: just a slide in a theater, consisting of the word "Heartbeeps "inside a heart shape, with a Cupid's arrow through it, and one that was a totally black image: just Andy and Bernadette's voices saying" Val-Com! My pleasure center is malfunctioning! "" So it's my; do you think we should tell our owners? "That does not help people who were not aware of the film. <br /> <br /> During filming, Andy told reporters that he could not eat, once his plastic lips were applied, so he "carried". I did not know what Bernadette did: but at the time, I wondered why they not only sipped the protein drinks with long straws, or ate astronaut-style puree foods through <br /> <br /> Phil-Co, the baby robot, seemed to have been the forerunner of the Johnny-Five Short Circuit, with the same eyes and similar face.I have been trying to find out if they had the same designer , but it did not help.I have vintage magazine articles on the film, and the design team was immensely proud of their work, and were going for a special award for their innovative device to create unscented "smoke" for the Catskill cigars. Shortly thereafter, LucasFilm did NOT use this device, although they should have done so, for the Jedi Return scenes with Jabba the Hut: a man created "steam" around Jabba, blowing cigar smoke in a tube, playing what he needed was a glass of conha that and he would be a happy man. I thought the use of real tobacco products by Lucasfilm was insensitive to people who were bothered by the smoke. John Williams, who had recently succeeded the late Arthur Fielder as the conductor of the Boston Pops (which, THEN, was a success - but never recovered from Fielder's death, and is now a Shadow of his old glory), was using the show to promote films with which he provided the music. He had premiered the track "The Empire Strikes Back"; and you would think he would have helped Heartbeeps by playing some numbers there? The only thing that critics liked about this movie was Williams' score - it was not yet available for purchase! I saw a vinyl album in 1982, with half Heartbeeps, half of another movie - but it disappeared. I just saw the CD listed on the site tonight, and I asked. If I can get a scanner and time to type articles, I would like to create a Heartbeeps tribute site. I liked the movie and I do not care what the dissidents say! The only problem with the film was that, by the end, everything was messed up, in logic: the robots fled the factory to have the freedom to decide their own destiny. own choices; however, when the scam owners tell them that Phil has to go to the factory, have a "purpose" programmed into him, they do not even question him; they just look meaningfully at each other and walk away. Along the way, each adult loses battery power and "dies." They're not really dead, since they're robots, and they just need new batteries, but they're treated like "death", with little Phil crying over them and rolling away. So what was the POINT of this? Phil never goes back to the factory and gets "a purpose!" And, of course, the junkyard owners COULD have led them or given them all battery recharges, with spare batteries; but the real point was to have this poignant scene, where all the robots would wear out, and Phil would cry. <br /> <br /> In the end, Val-Com is a golf instructor, and Aqua-Com is - I'm not sure what. Catskill is an ENTERTAINER - what ELSE is it supposed to be? I'm not sure they made that clear. Old-timer owners seem to be calming down, lying on lounge chairs, drinking lemonade from Phil, their "bartender." The new "daughter" of Val and Aqua, Philsia - I think the name is - perhaps Sylvania - does not seem to be much more than a table lamp. <br /> <br /> Films are missing, which is sad - from photos I suppose the missing material includes a sweet scene where Phil is having a Christmas, with Val gifting it with the wheel of a car ; Aqua is providing a horn; Catskill took the fireman's helmet to give to Phil, as we have seen; and they have Christmas trees. I do not know if some lost footage provides a better logic, or if writers simply could not think of a better crisis / resolution. The film was trimmed to 72-75 minutes, to pair it with other flawed films. No other reason besides that. For a DVD, I'd love to be in the making, as I want to see interviews with the cast / crew and John Williams, and the interview with Merv Griffin. The making-of footage; and reissuing and restoring the lost images to make them better.
