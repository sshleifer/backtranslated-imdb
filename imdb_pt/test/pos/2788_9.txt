As a former Erasmus student, I really enjoyed this film. It was so realistic and funny. It really caught the spirit that exists among Erasmus students. I hope that many other students will also follow this experience. However, I wonder if this movie is so interesting to watch for people with no international experience. But at least one of my friends who never participated in Erasmus also liked it very much. I give 9 out of 10.
