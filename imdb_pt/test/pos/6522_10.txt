Fred was such a good show. It was simple, but somehow very addictive. I still remember the days when I watched it on Kids WB Saturdays, but the Kids WB did the unforgivable. WB has become like that older relative who tries to act "hip" and "cool funky". * Shiver * They have become like that relative who tries to act cool, but the attempt is a cheese disaster. They pulled Coconut Fred's Inland Salad Fruit and all the other good shows to put on some of the tasteless shows I've ever seen Na my life (Johnny Test). The only thing that keeps me more watching KWB are the occasional bits of old shows and the anime in 4kids. It was a big mistake to pull this show off the calendar. This brings me back to my first point ... BRING BACK !!!
