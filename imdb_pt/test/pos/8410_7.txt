<br /> <br /> It is common knowledge and has been said before: no one can interpret Scarlett and Rhett as Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer (no longer Kilmer having divorced ex-husband Val Kilmer) plays her own Scarlett and although this is a sequel and not a re-make (God-forbid !!!) she still can not rise for the occasion (her voice sounds bad on several occasions, she has brown eyes [Scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even Vivien Leigh's eyes were green] and her vocal power was not up to work either. to flirt (as she did in SCARLETT, the novel and GWTW of course) and to be a great flirt as Scarlett is, you would probably need a sharper voice like Vivien Leigh. <br /> <br /> I suppose I'm comparing Kilmer to Leigh a little too much, but when someone has such a masterful role as Leigh did with Scarlett, you just can not help but criticize any new candidate for Scarlet.Timothy Dalton should not have any accents due to the fact that both Rhett and Ga Margaret Mitchell was not there. I had none. His performance was never truly noteworthy (except perhaps his interpretation of evil, conniving King Phillip of France in THE LION IN WINTER) and he gives very little (or no) freshness or vitality to his Rhett. <br /> <br /> The highlights of the cast are most notably Tina Kellagher (an actress born authentically in her deliverance) as the tragic victim Mary Boyle. And then, of course, there's Sean Bean as the cool, calculating, not to mention almost demonic and evil Lord Fenton, Mary's enemy and eventual Scarlett rapist. One thing I could not forgive the writer was the fact that Scarlett is raped in this movie (a fact that never occurred in the novel; Lord Fenton is cold and disreputable among the Irish in the book but he is far from being cruel Another omission of the novel, but read for the film is the character of Belle Watling, horribly interpreted by Ann-Margret in a special guest, that we could all have lived without, seeing how the book was such a bestseller without needing any help from Mrs. Watling. <br /> <br /> For a movie itself, the SCARLETT is very good but not exactly in that place in terms of being GONE WITH THE WINDs Another actress was highly needed for Scarlett and Rhett. br
