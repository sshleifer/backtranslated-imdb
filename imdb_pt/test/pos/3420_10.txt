What was the quote from Archbishop Tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this movie was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years it makes me ashamed <br /> <br /> everyone is human and everyone has the right to live your life in peace and harmony <br /> <br /> live and let live <br /> <br /> if anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank you <br /> <br /> this movie must be shown much more publicly as true events as horrible as these shown in the film must be known to everyone, hoping that things will change sooner or later.
