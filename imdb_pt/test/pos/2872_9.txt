Finally a real horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I'm a horror fan and I recommend this movie, but it's pretty bloody. I'm not a big fan of wrestling, but Kane really took the whole thing out of the monster. I have to admit I did not want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me into it, but I'm really glad I did it. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others on the whole enough horror movies remake is enough. I think that's why this movie is getting good reviews. It's a refreshing change and takes you back to Texas Chainsaw (first), Michael Myers and Jason. And no crap CGI.
