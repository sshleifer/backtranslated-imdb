Ray is one of those movies that makes you stop. You really think about what you heard or thought about what you read about this man and did not even come close. During my first Ray remark I forgot I was watching a movie, I felt like a peeping tone watching this man's life through a window. This movie is so appealing that it creeps you in and it involves all the emotions you go through on an emotional roller coaster and when it's over you do not want to do it again anytime soon because it has that kind of emotional impact that other movies are missing. Jamie Foxx deserved his Oscar and with good reason, so his performance is spectacular and should be considered the standard for anyone who wants to take a bio photo soon. This movie is as good as its theme, both deserved the classic and legendary titles.
