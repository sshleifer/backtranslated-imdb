Beauty in Trouble (Kráska v nesnázích) is not a great title. Can not all descriptions of this movie capture what it really is? An adult fairy tale. A poor girl is courted by a prince. The "girl", Marcela, played by the stunning Anna Geislerová, has a beauty of Isabelle Huppert, with red hair, face and figure seductive, sexual and infinitely fascinating. She has a husband's louse, but they have a lot of sex. Children hear the love through the walls. It's rough and passionate, since working-class sex seems to be often portrayed in the movies. But it is also for us to recognize that this is what unites them in an incompatible marriage. The husband, a professional car thief, is finally arrested and thrown into jail. As she entered this marriage we do not know, but she is not exactly a high-class person. But she is beautiful, intelligent (we assume) and loves her beautiful and resilient children. She deserves more. And she can get the life she deserves - eventually. (no spoiler!) She is forced to return with her mother after her husband is sent to prison. Mom has a horrible second husband (read the ugly stepfather). It's a real horror show. It borders on being a child abuser to children. He is obsessive with the clean but bland fart on the table, all the while demanding good manners and decorum from the kids. He is a miserable low-class social. Mother bears him, as Marcella's husband, at least he is sensual - hideous but excited. Ambivalent, confusing and layered characterizations are what make the film so powerful and interesting. These characters have flaws, some seemed to be driven by the class, some by the innate character. These flaws and character details are charming in one minute and despicable in the next. The public really has to negotiate a conflicting feeling of class, sexuality, ambition, commitment and the role of a woman as mother and wife across the rapidly changing terrain of history. At the bottom line, as in many films like the wonderful Icelandic film Thicker Than Water (Blóðbönd), children can be the victims. What is right, in the end, may be the best for children? Our future It is a theme that has been developing lately in films ranging from the Pan Labyrinth to the Children of Men. Foreign cinema is recognizing in intricate moral histories that life is confusing, brutal, unjust and, as adults, we must act together to pass on something worthwhile to the next generation. If we give in to our most basic instincts, we can lose ourselves and the world in the process. The extraordinary and complex and colorful characters in Kráska v nesnázích speak of the qualities of what a man does. who directs a woman, what embodies hope, what is class - is the economic status of the character's fabric? The film is richly human, embodied by the last two shots, which moved me in a way so subtle and intelligent that comparing this to an American movie seems unfair. Americans sometimes seem to have no desire to consider that the paradoxes of human nature do not offer fixed resolutions. But here, dangerously voiced in ostentatious adult fairy tale, are interesting moral questions. Do not be fooled by the simple story; This is a great movie.
