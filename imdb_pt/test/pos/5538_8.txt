I just wanted to write a quick response to all the people who give this movie a bad review because they think it's not funny or boring. <br /> <br /> Here's the trick --- the movie is not meant to be just a comedy. There's some depth to that. Like many Demme films, he deals with people who live in some strange corners of our society who are trying to figure out how to create a fulfilling life for themselves. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the home movie and video industries do not handle subtlety and leave it in the "COMEDY" drawer. It's funny, but a lot of humor is off-beat. However, the heart of the film is not about the mood, but about the people in it. <br /> <br /> It may not be one of the biggest movies in the world, but it's solid and fun. <br /> <br /> And the cast is one of those that shows why the cast is an art unto itself. Michelle Pfieffer is great and this may be the movie that showed that she had some skills to increase her beauty. Mercedes Ruehl is a big joke and manages to chew the stage in the way that only she can, in a role that demands this. Play Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack in smaller roles and the talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaak and you have a great cast that here, as always, makes a big difference. <br /> <br /> Matthew Modine is fun but the most important thing is that he is one of the greaties of this movie. Hot, cute and sexy. <br /> <br /> Sit down, wait for the unexpected and let the movie get you where it wants to go and you should have fun.
