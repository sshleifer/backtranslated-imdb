I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always enjoyed it very much. This Can-Can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre, like Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly musical, but in French way. And a Jean Renoir good tribute to his time, his friends, lovers, songs and dances. It is at the same time a chronicle of the show business of that time, full of affection and French humor. It is also a clear tribute to Impressionism (people who like Impressionist painters will like this photo). It is particularly a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and, of course, to the father of Jean Renoir, Pierre-Auguste. You will find a trustworthy and splendid colored recreation of some Renoir masterpiece. Excellent casting, scenery, sound effects and music. Even tells us about the creation of Paris Moulin Rouge, obviously it is a story of fiction (and not very original by the way, as it falls into the moral well know that the show must continue). But the production of Jean Renoir is great. <br /> <br />
