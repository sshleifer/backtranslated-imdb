Valley Girl will always have a special place in my heart: I would say this is certainly the best of the sex comedies among teenagers of the 80s, but that's a compliment to the back. This is a good movie, period. It is very specific in time and space - almost twenty years later, this is a wonderful snapshot - but its story remains timeless. (That's just Romeo and Juliet, without death, after all!) Nicolas Cage is wonderful, showing all the early promises that he seems to have squandered an exaggerated crappie. Deborah Foreman is the revelation of this film, and I can not believe she does not have a bigger career; someone rediscover it FAST. This is sweeter and gentler than most films of the genre - the required nudity seems to be played out by contractual obligation - and while not innovative, it's certainly good to see this kind of movie that respects your characters and does not crucify your movies . young, rude girls for fun - even Foreman's crew of poor friends, barely driven by peer pressure, are never portrayed as villains. (In fact, her friend Stacy, forced to bend over with Cage's friend Fred, amuses herself despite her protests, and stays with Fred in the back.) That will take you back to the '80s if you were there, but this is still very good today. Warning for those unfamiliar with the movie: DO NOT watch one of VH1's seemingly continuous displays - rent it in its unedited glory. Otherwise, you're missing out on some of the most powerful and time-specific dialogues in the movies. And you can not write about Valley Girl and not mention the fabu soundtrack of the 80's melodies - most of them by wonders of a hit, which are not only integral to the sense of time and place in this movie, but thematically well. chosen. See - amazing little movie! Fer shur !!
