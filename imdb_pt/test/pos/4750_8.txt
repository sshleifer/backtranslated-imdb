This movie is a classic movie of the 70's that for some reason was sadly ignored. It is basically French Connection with Bullit. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider plays the head of an elite group of detectives known as "Seven Ups" One of his men is discovered during a dis disguised and dead. <br /> <br /> Scheider and his team must find their killers. They engage in a battle with the Mafia. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie has to be the pursuit of cars, obviously included to profit from the success of Bullit. However, this car chase beats Bullitt because of its length, speed and pure excitement. It's a breathtaking roller coaster ride that ends unexpectedly and spectacularly. Do not miss this little gem !!
