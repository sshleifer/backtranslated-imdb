- A group of thieves led by Mark Wahlberg steal a gold vault in Italy and fortunately for them, the assault is successful and they escape without major problems. Before the group can celebrate, however, Steve, played by Ed Norton, decides that he wants the gold for himself and pulls a Cout De 'Ta into the group and shoots one of the members. He and his accomplices leave thinking the group is dead, but fortunately the group is not dead. A year later we went back to the story when the group tracked down Norton and decided to steal the gold back and spend the rest of the film with plans to steal the gold back and settle accounts. <br /> <br /> This was a surprise to me, it had all the ingredients to be a typical forgettable summer movie, but it was really memorable and a lot of fun to watch. What I like is how clever and thoughtful the plans of the movie are, and how the film looks realistic. Watching the trailer would make you think it was an irrational action movie, but in fact there are only two action scenes in the movie and they are really well done. The last action scene is a long 20 min. scene that has one of the best car chases ever made. I like how real the chase is and how everything is done old school style without the aid of CGI. I personally enjoyed this car chase more than the full CGI chase in "Matrix 2". I remember watching videos of music by director F. Gary Gray and always realized how well they were done and thought he would be a great filmmaker. It turns out that I was right as always and he proves it here. I can not wait to see what he does with the sequel. <br /> <br /> -The actors do a decent job too, with Seth Green being my group's favorite. The other thing I loved was John Powell's great soundtrack, ever since I heard his soundtrack to "Robots" this year I'm a fan of him and I pay close attention to his music and the guy is very good. He does a great job avoiding all the typical cliches of the summer action movie and provides a very well done score. I have not seen the original on which this is based, so I can not say how well it compares to that. So, yeah, this is a great popcorn movie that really has a brain. unlike most of the junk from the summer movie coming out. It has great characters, is funny as hell and has an incredible score by John Powell. If you love assault movies then you will love this <br /> <br /> -You know if I was in the group they would call me a handsome microphone
