As another reviewer for IMDb says: "... imagine 2001: A Space Odyssey in the Desert" and you would not be far from a brief summary of what to expect from this piece of cinema (I hesitate to use the word "movie"). A lecture on philosophical views on creationism, the myths surrounding the existence of the humanities, the before and after, who was, what is and what will be. This for some perhaps a "2001" in the sand, but they approach different philosophical views, one on evolution and the future, hope and potential for mankind, while Fata Morgana itself is a somewhat more metaphysical journey. I just hope I can convey it effectively enough. <br /> <br /> Herzog's style is not to like everyone, and those who are not from a branch of cinematic vision can, and probably will, find this extremely difficult, and may not see until the end after 72 minutes. Merging a montage of images from the Sahara, including villages, villagers and various other places for a somewhat surrealist ending, multi-genre music and an almost mythical narration, Fata Morgana is severely slow but ultimately highly rewarding. <br /> <br /> Opening with a montage of several planes shot of planes landing for almost five minutes, you already get to the introduction of the film immensely confused, and the feeling that this will not be as something you've seen before echoes of course in your mind. Divided into three sections, creation, paradise and the golden age, the Fata Morgana tries and juxtaposes the images of the natural beauty of the desert with the man made of instruments that contaminate it. Their three segments are narrated by different people, each belonging specifically to the specific section they are expressing, and give extra emphasis to the long montages of soliloquy and the desert. <br /> <br /> Fata Morgana is a film that deals with the existence of man in our land. He looks at the natural beauty to which the Earth was designed and at the same time observes the potential beauty within us, most notably shows us our negative contributions to the world we live in. Each scene was purposely constructed, using what can only be described in the context of this film as "The Holy Trinity of Filming" in images, words and music. Each part of these three parts provides something remarkably for each scene, but when assembled they create something larger than the whole of their parts, they create unbridled beauty and deep thoughts in our minds. I will not be able to make this movie the justice it deserves with mere words, maybe if I had photos and a score, and I know this will not be appreciated by the masses, but that's deep and I will not use the film. term "art film" because this is simply art. This is moving art that moves the mind and stirs the soul. Whether or not creationism is your desire is irrelevant, because this film is about intelligent design.
