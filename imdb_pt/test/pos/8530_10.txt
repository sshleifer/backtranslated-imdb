Well, first of all - I'm a big horror movie buff, but nonetheless - I'm really sick of all those damn American horror movies. They are all about the same thing - blood and violence. It's not even scary. Well, there's nothing wrong with blood and all that - it does not bother me - but that's not what makes a scary movie! That's why I find this movie fun - it's fun to see a satire that's making fun of koncept's "mainstream horror". American splatter / gore-movies, they should not be scary, just funny. This is OK. But when they are supposed to be "scary," this usually gets pathetic. However, there are some great American horror movies (Poltergeist, Psycho, Birds), but in the end it's all the same. That's why this movie was such a relief. Evil Ed is not just a cult movie - it's a classic! I can not wait until master director Anders Jacobsson makes another damn splatter movie! Until I have to watch Evil Ed again - and again - and again! But I do not care - it's such an amazing movie!
