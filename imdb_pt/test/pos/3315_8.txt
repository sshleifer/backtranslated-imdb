I watched the first moments in TCM a few years ago, but I stopped after 15 minutes. I saw this listed on schedule at the Stanford Theater in Palo Alto, and I swore I'd do it 40 minutes by car. Stanford is an old-fashioned movie house that starts every movie with the curtains still closed. Yes, they have curtains. They opened when the fanfare of the Fox logo began to play. When "The Best of Everything" appeared in huge pink letters scattered against the New York skyline, I knew I was right to wait. <br /> <br /> I've filmed this movie. There were so many little moments that increased the film's appearance: When Hope Lange enters the publishing office for the first time, the titles of magazines published there are recorded on the glass (The Teenager and Elegance); The flamboyant apron of Joan Crawford she wore to be able to serve her guests at her party without messing up her clothes; the way the camera bent to indicate how Suzy Parker was going crazy (it was almost lateral at one point); as Hope Lange continued to live in that empty apartment she shared with others, although obviously she was making a lot more money than at the beginning of the movie (I think it was too scandalous for a single girl to live alone). <br /> <br /> Hope Lange was so beautiful; so was Suzy Parker. What about Mark Goddard in a non-speaking role? I fell in love with him as a kid watching Lost in Space. <br /> <br /> Seeing this jewel on the big screen led me to plan another journey to Stanford to see The Old Dark House. In fact, I bought a soda and popcorn at the concession stand and was surprised when the clerk asked me for two dollars.
