Few argue that the director of animation master Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to have this ability. <br /> <br /> (Many are focused on John Lassiter's "incredible" ability to steal other movies, turn them into gorgeous puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius ... but I digress.) < Miyazaki gave us film after film that deals with important mature issues (usually ecologically themed), and has a clever script. that even the most tired viewer who would normally despise any movie that was animated could thoroughly enjoy it had the chance. Still, Miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these films - children. <br /> <br /> That said, I can not think of another filmmaker with that ability. Where else are you going to have a movie where a three-year-old (my nephew Link) will be seated throughout the play, enchanted, a 7-year-old (my niece Amber) loving it all alone (and able to enjoy the "star") power "of Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, a 12-year-old boy (my nephew Aaron) whose criticism was" of course it was good! Everything Miyazaki-san does is good! "a 32-year-old animation fan tearful by the powerful directing and beautiful animation (er, that would be me), and a 58-year-old woman (my mother) able to connect with her mother's characters (and me I'm betting the older chats as well) and loving the "cuteness" of the child And that's what I respect most about Miyazaki-san He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the ordinary filmmaker On the surface, "Ponyo "can be seen as a simple story about a little fish girl who has a taste of the human world and wants to join him and the friend she does there, a little boy names. ske (a bit like" The Little Mermaid "), Miyazaki fills her film with intensely strong female characters.Ponyo's mother, Soske's mother, the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with their own minds and extremely strong. /> <br /> The girl who takes the cake is Ponyo. Once she decides she likes the human world, she simply uses her own will to fulfill her dreams. Her father is trying to keep her innocent and keep her a magical fish, but the young Ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human simply by her own determination. <br /> <br /> Once human, she joins her friend, Soske, whom she loves very much (though perhaps not as much as the presumed one). Soske is invited to be the man of the house (at age five) when his mother, Lisa, decides to help people in the nursing home, where she works during a typhoon that was inadvertently caused by Ponyo in her quest to become human. Frankie Jonas (yes, he's a relative of the Jonas Brothers, can we just get over this, please?) It gives perhaps the best performance of the movie as the young Soske (which is good since he has more lines). Your character is also strong but is also very respectful and friendly - features you probably will not find in a childish character on this side of the Pacific. <br /> <br /> In the end, Ponyo's father, Fujimoto, must deal with his daughter's decision and her strange wishes of the wife to allow her to be human. He expects Ponyo and Soske to "remember him fondly." And again, Miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the "villain" stereotype. Although Miyazaki has (for some reason) received some criticism for it, it is, honestly, what makes his films magical and yet relatable. No one in real life is completely a "bad person". All humans are various shades of gray. And that's exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. <br /> <br /> And then there's the animation itself. At a time when CGI certainly would have helped with copious amounts of effects in this film, especially water, Miyazaki chose to incorporate NO CGI. Certainly the hand-drawn animation was colored by digital means, but each film was hand-drawn and I, for example, was extremely grateful for it. The character's animation was extremely fluid, and there even seemed to be some lip sync going on (quite unusual for an anime movie). The backgrounds seemed to be rendered with crayons and had their own effect on the audience. This is how animation looks - and how it should look. <br /> <br /> In the end, I found Ponyo completely enjoyable. Certainly not the best of Miyazaki (in my opinion, this honor is still maintained by Kiki's Delivery Service), but it's still a fun 10-star movie for the whole family.
