This movie is not for those who expect a martial arts extravaganza. As for historical accuracy, I will leave that question to those who are better informed on this subject. I thought the performances were wonderful. Gong Li never disappoints as the ingenious and (initially) loyal consort of the king of Qin. Fengyi Zhang showed a lot of flexibility portraying a ruler descending to madness. He chose the "Hannibal Reader" route rather than resort to complaints. For me, the best performance was by Zhiwen Wang as the Marquis supersmooth. The character looked very oily, but in a subtle "Sir Humphrey Appleby" - Yes, the kind of way. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is the highlight of this film. The scene in which the Marquis and his men entered the palace was breathtaking. There are also a number of wonderful battle scenes. So this movie is highly recommended on the big screen.
