First of all, let me tell you that this movie is not for everyone. It has a very strange subject. A spinster who lives alone and lives a boring life discovers a young man in a park across the street from his home. She notices him sitting in the rain and invites him to dry and warm up. The man does not speak and the woman assumes that he is deaf and dumb. Still, she is fascinated by him and sexually interested in him. He finds her strange and continues her silence, although we discover later that he is not mute and that he tells his sister everything that is happening between him and the woman. I will not give the rest of the plot. If you can find this movie, watch. You can not take your eyes off it. What makes it so interesting? Well, it's totally unique. I've never seen anything like it and watching these two together is very uncomfortable. Especially when you find out what this annoying and obsessive spinster is capable of. You will not soon forget.
