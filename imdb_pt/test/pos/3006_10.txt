I loved this show. I was hoping to go out on DVD .... never has. Does anyone know how to make the program available on DVD? I got in touch with Lifetime TV and some others and nothing. Please let me know if there is a way we can have this series on DVD. I'd be the first in line to buy it. I really got addicted to this show. I do not understand how a lot of other TV shows are available on DVD but not Any Day Now. I'm sure there are plenty of us out there who would love to have this series on DVD or even on VHS. I thought about getting in touch with the producer. Has anyone else out there tried to contact someone for this information?
