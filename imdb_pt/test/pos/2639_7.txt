Quick times, it's not. But check out this movie, it has a heart. Pour a drink and enjoy. It is loaded with a series of newly started stars. Sherilyn Fenn has her first appearance credited on screen. Chris Penn, Lea Thompson, Eric Stotz, Jenny Wright, Rick Moranis, etc. - they all look so young. Oh, and if you look closely, the cop's wife is Nancy Wilson, from the rock band Heart.
