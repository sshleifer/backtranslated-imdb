This short was in part four of the "Short Cinema Journal" - a movie I rented from Netflix, but that seems to have originally been a series of monthly films for people who like mediocre modern short films and love having the DVD full of commercials. So far, I have tried two of the Journal's DVDs and was furious with the horrible way the viewer needs to navigate the disc to watch the movies. Talk about an overly-produced and overly complicated way of doing this! While I have and will continue to see as many short films as I can, I really doubt whether I will worry about the newspapers because of these factors. <br /> <br /> Now it may be because I did not like the album, so much that I was not favorably prepared for this short animated Portuguese. This is definitely possible. However, even if this is the case, I feel that the other reviews were very positive about this simple little movie. Some of the artwork was really nice - I liked how the simple black-and-white drawings suddenly turned into three-dimensional environments as the camera came out of a distant plane and plunged into the city below. This was lovely and took some work. But as for the story about a cat that wants to go to the moon, it has not done anything to me. <br /> <br /> IMPORTANT UPDATE - I saw this movie again on a DVD titled "Cartoon Noir" on May 5th. 09 It was a rather nasty collection of art films. However, this time I saw the cat and moon story with an audio track and a totally different boy that made the difference. Instead of Portuguese with subtitles, there was a French narrator who spoke English in the style of Film Noir. While I usually hate dubbing, this time really did the movie. The narration of the Portuguese version leaves much to be desired if you do not know the language or do not understand the subtleties. Unless you speak the language, try looking for the other version (as long as you understand English).
