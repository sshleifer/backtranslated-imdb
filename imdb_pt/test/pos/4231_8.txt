the first Child's Play was a small and original horror film. as expected, however, the 2 horrible sequels seemed to mean the end of this franchise. <br /> <br /> Well, when I heard they were making a 4th call "chucky bride" I just rolled my eyes and muttered a "... when will they learn." <br /> <br /> But when I learned that they had gotten a great director, Ronny Yu and a solid cast, including the awe-inspiring Jennifer Tilly, my interest in it cheered up. <br /> <br /> This movie is extremely well done. She has a great sense of humor, highly stylized graphic violence, great photography and the incredibly sexy Jennifer Tilly exhibiting her most impressive things during the first half. (I must add that she is also a fantastic actress). <br /> <br /> She holds her tongue firmly on the cheek without straying into exaggerated territory. the effects of the doll are great and the verbal interaction between them is invaluable. is more of a horror / comedy than a direct terror, but humor is welcome and well integrated. <br /> <br /> I've heard they're planning a Son of Chucky. if they can match the quality of this movie, maybe this franchise has returned legitimately. <br /> <br /> rating: 8.5
