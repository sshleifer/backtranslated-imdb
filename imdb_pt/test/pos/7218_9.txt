This film is a brilliant retelling of Shakespeare's classic love story, complete with "eccentric sex, body piercing and breakup". It follows the same spirit as all the other Troma movies [except Combat Shock ... This sucker was depressing], but it's not just for Troma fans. Anyone who enjoys lowbrow visuals and a hilarious script will surely fall in love with this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not expect pretentious and artistic crap like the R & J version with Claire Danes and Leo DiCaprio; this one knows it's a silly movie and takes your mood out of it. The acting is also surprisingly good, and you can feel the pain of Sammy Capulet as he tries to put his brain back in the head. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack, which contains many original, high-energy bands like The Wesley. Willis Fiasco, Supernova and The Meatmen are also four stars. This film must be seen by everyone, because it remains true to the original story while still replete with the gore / sex trade humor of Troma's trademark.
