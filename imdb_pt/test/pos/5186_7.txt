This is a catastrophe film set in London. Starting multiple hurricanes, super storms and tornadoes in Scotland are shifted to the east, down the coast of England and then south. After several hours of heavy rain, the London barrier, above the River Thames, is about to run over and opens the way to disaster. Then a colossal wave of gigantic waves in the east causing devastation and lives of millions of Londoners are in danger. At the center of the story is a climatologist (Tom Courtenay), a climatologist who tries to save London from the effects of the giant wave, trying to convince the authorities that the city's dyke was unsafe, as well as a naval engineer (Robert Carlyle) the wife Samantha (Jessalyn Gilsig). They are trapped in the barrier and fell into the sea. On average, the government's secret headquarters ruled by Nash (Joanne Whalley) under the direct orders of the deputy minister (David Suchet) attempt to control many displaced and prevent more dead, approximately 200,000. They have a little time to save London from total catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Perfectly acceptable drama-disaster with good acting. Magnificent Tom Courtenay as a climatologist who predicts the great catastrophe and Robert Carlyle and Jessalyn Gilsig as ex-matrimony rekindling his love. The film features stunning flood scenes brought to life by the extraordinary special effects of the computer generator, better than the classic 1970s, such as 'Earthquake, Inferno Towering' and similarly to 'Armaguedon and the day after tomorrow'. Although not a clear denunciation, we know that the flood is caused by the greenhouse effect and global warming that the ozone hole causes. The film is well directed by Tony Mitchell. I would recommend this movie to people who like disaster movies. Other adaptations on the floods are as follows: 'Flood (1976)' directed by Earl Bellamy with Robert Culp and Barbara Hershey; 'Hard Rain (1998)' directed by Mikael Salomon with Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater; 'Flood: The Rampage of a River (1979)' directed by Bruce Pittman with Richard Thomas
