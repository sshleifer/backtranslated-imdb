I have a letter from Mrs. Knight, who went to college with my older sister. In her, she talks about the difficulties of making this film. She herself was pregnant - an interesting conjunction with the plot of the film - and the novice director was insecure, quite green, and having great difficulties with all decisions, logistics, etc. They were on the move all the time, and it was a very difficult shoot. <br /> <br /> The film, however, with a strong debut for James Caan, remains effective and affecting. It is a great showcase for the talent that Mrs. Knight has shown throughout her career - on television, in the movies and on stage, where she won Tony for "Kennedy's Children." <br /> <br /> This movie has aged well.
