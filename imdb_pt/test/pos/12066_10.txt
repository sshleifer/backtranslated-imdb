This show is coming up brilliant. It's a modern day Married ... with children. The scripts are witty as they are sprinkled with clever sarcasm. They are also realistic, dealing with issues that many teenage parents face today. Beyond the burden you may not be the greatest father in the world, and how is the best way to deal with it? However, at the same time, it manages to keep the heart light and fun. That, with all the drama and action of television these days, is a very nice and welcome change. It is something that you can sit in front of for 30 minutes and relax, laugh and relate. It's not the most hilarious comedy in the world. will still make you laugh at least a handful of times an episode. Michael Rapaport is brilliant at leading like Dave. It fills the big shoes that the highly sarcastic script requires and then some. He and Anita Barone (Vikki) have fantastic chemistry and differentiate very well. This show has a strong future if it is marketed to the right audience and placed at the right time. Also, if Fox release it on DVD, the following will be stronger and bigger. (As is a classic example with Scrubs.)
