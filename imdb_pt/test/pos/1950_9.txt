Vaguely based on actual events, "River's Edge" is a film, much in the style of David Lynch, about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends, but nobody does anything about it for a long time. With top acting by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper, we are able to forgive the average acting of everyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a boy, Tim (Joshua John Miller), falling. a doll off a bridge (# 1 murder). Tim then hears someone shouting, as he looks up, he sees Samson (Daniel Roebuck) standing on the bank of the river with his girlfriend's dead naked body behind him (murder # 2). Samson eventually shows the body to his friends. All of which are horrified, not only because of the murder, but also because the victim, Jamie (Danyi Deats), was a friend of theirs. Despite all this, no one goes to the police. You may think this is unrealistic, but that is what happened in real history. If you are familiar with the story of "Alpha Dog" (2006), you will know that the same thing happened there as well. Through all of this, Layne (Crispin Glover) is working to keep Samson safe, though no one (including Samson) seems to worry about keeping him out of harm's way. As time goes on, we learn that Feck (Dennis Hopper), a middle-aged senior who catches drugs for local teens, also killed a woman before (# 3 murder). From here things begin to approach Samson and his friends and eventually everything is revealed but not in the way you might be expecting. <br /> <br /> In the film we learned about three murders, each with a different reason, a different reaction and a different effect on those involved. When Tim leaves his younger sister's doll off the bridge, we are never told of his motive. However, we see the reaction of the younger sister. She cries and screams while her mother comforts her. Later, her older brother, Matt (Keanu Reeves), helps her put a cross in the yard in memory of her doll. Jamie's murder horrifies everyone (except Samson, who is apathetic to the whole situation, and when asked by Layne why he did this, Samson responds with: "She was talking shit"), but they do not cry or sob, run away and to continue their lives trying to forget what had happened. In Feck's situation, he did not kill his girlfriend out of hatred. We never really know why he killed her, but we see that Feck is not proud of what he did. He even mentions that he is sorry and that she loved her. From this we see the different ways in which we can be affected by death. In the movie, it's easy to identify with teenagers because they do not know what they feel or how they should feel about their friend's death. In the same way, we, the public, do not know how to feel, because we do not know Jamie. We are obviously saddened by death and realize that Samson should be arrested, but we do not feel strongly about Jamie as an individual. <br /> <br /> There are several similarities between "River's Edge" and "Twin Peaks". (1990-1991), especially in the overall feel of the film. I wonder if Mark Frost and David Lynch were thinking about "River's Edge" when they were creating their series. After all, Tim Hunter went on to direct three episodes of "Twin Peaks". <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover's performance as hyperactive and frenetic Layne is an Oscar-worthy performance. Always in a hurry and always worried about avoiding Samson being caught, Layne is an intense character who seems to be at high speed. If you've seen Crispin Glover in any movie, you know he can deliver a line like no one else. It is always a pleasure to see you introduce yourself. The other great performance on "River's Edge" is Dennis Hopper. His portrayal of Feck, the smuggling drug dealer who has a leg and an inflatable doll he calls Elly, reminded me of a more stylized and humorous version of Frank Booth, Hopper's character in David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" . "(1986) River's Edge is a great movie and I believe it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic when in reality we need to stand and speak against the evils of the world.
