This short is one of the best of all time and is proof (as with most of Charlie Chaplin's works) that sound and color are not requirements for quality work. In fact, this drawing uses (and may have begun) some of the jokes and devices that have become standard in animation in later years, such as celebrity caricatures (including the previously mentioned Chaplin.While the characters are silent, they "talk" with the use of word balloons as well as in comics.Because Felix started in newspapers as a comic book, this device is natural.The atmosphere and style of the short is completely harmonious with that of the comic strip, adding another dimension (literal and figuratively) and makes this short a delight to watch. When it's worth taking the time and effort to get in. Very highly recommended.
