If you are looking for a movie with fantastic music, cool cast and a plot that is not difficult to understand; FAME is for you. <br /> <br /> I have several scenes that I love in this movie; some make you laugh, others make you contemplative. The edition I think is wonderful, very fast and fun. Shure, maybe there was more potential in the whole thing, the whole story is somehow on the surface; maybe a few characters are involved. But I do not care, because the real stars are ... <br /> <br /> the musical scenes! One of my favorites: the sequence of the hot lunch jam. This piece is so raw, funky and filmed in a special way (handcamera style in "music-hell-breaking-loose"), it's just electrifying! I miss that raw energy in today's music clips; the only similar energy that I found perhaps in Bette Midlers "the Rose", all the filming shows. It's about capturing something "wild" that is "really" happening, and not making it just perfect; take by take. <br /> <br /> So, FAME is a wonderful nostalgic trip for when synthesizers where heavy and walkmans are not available. I recommend it once a year; certainly not for everyone.
