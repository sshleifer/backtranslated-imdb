I saw Conrack on a night that I could not sleep and I was never so happy to have insomnia! This story of a young white teacher who takes a position teaching poor black children on an island in Carolina is a great advertisement for teaching, and simply to help each other. Defined in the early 1960s, with civil rights issues, Vietnam and Vietnam. everything that came with the 60's, forget that the Peace Corps and many young people made a difference to help the underprivileged. Concrack with his open teaching style is interested in these children as people, and encourages an honest interaction in his life. class that scares the power it is. Most of it was that Jon Voight said they had a 20 year reunion and 18 of those kids became teachers !! It's enough to make you think that we as human beings can have the chance to survive on ourselves, perhaps, hopefully. Watch this movie.
