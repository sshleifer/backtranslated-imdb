For those who like comedians, you must have heard of George Carlin. He's really one of the best live comedians, so you should know him. <br /> <br /> But he is dead, God rest him in peace. Or hell. He did not much believe in religion, so he could also choose Hell to live eternity. HAHA, just kidding, do not take it seriously! <br /> <br /> It's bad for you !, It's one of George Carlin's last works before his death ... <br /> <br /> I, one of his best works, a must for any fan and an almost best of all George Carlin jokes. Not a best-of ... but it's really fun. <br /> <br /> There are less political and religious jokes. It's just for fun! <br /> <br /> The issue is very good. It's not a show, so there should not be a quick exchange of shots ... the slow fading to another shot was well done. Fading is the best choice in terms of editing!
