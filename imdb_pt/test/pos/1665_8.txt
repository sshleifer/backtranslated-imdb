The fact that after 50 years is still a highly watchable film, says a lot about it. It's smarter and more interesting than almost every recent movie of the same genre that you can find, and it has a certain sense of innocence for it. I'm not a big fan of this kind of movies, but I could watch the whole thing without getting bored, which makes it a good movie to watch with someone who does not necessarily share their taste with movies. I liked the black and white palette, the excellent cast, the clever scene that makes you guess what trick they will pull next, and the end like everyone else. Observing the sequence of the assault makes one realize the power of silence, unfortunately so underused in today's cinema.
