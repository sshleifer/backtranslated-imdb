A wonderful cast played in modern mystical romances for intellectual adults. Yes, they also need a love story to stir up those hidden desires without the Hollywood fluff. All this under the masterful direction of Antonioni and Wenders, who love to trap their characters in exotic locations and have them overshadowed by the environment with long shots. It is great to see that there is desire in the middle-aged crisis sector.
