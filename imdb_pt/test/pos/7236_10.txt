Tromeo and Julieta (1996) is another jewel in the Troma Studios film archives. Like the Toxic Avenger, the Troma War, Nuke's Class in High, Terror Firmer and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. this movie is an instant Troma classic. James Gunn updates Romeo and Juliet by taking a medieval tragedy and reinventing it as a modern street punk drama. If you have ever seen or read the play before it changes, except that it has been "tossed". <br /> <br /> Lloyd Kaufman adds his distorted vision to the screenplay and makes it a very enjoyable movie. The actors deal with the script very well. I was amazed at how well they performed the dialogue, far better than some big budget Hollywood actors, using a monstrous budget and expensive sets. I really liked this movie. Lloyd Kaufman does not disappoint because you know what to expect from your films and other Troma productions. I'd rather watch one of your movies and have fun than watch an expensive and tedious movie with paid actors, little scripts, lazy directors and those lousy C.G.I. special effects. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. If you like fun movies with extravagant special effects, top acting and inspired direction, then this movie is just for you!
