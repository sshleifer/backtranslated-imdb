This movie came out about the same time as Pretty Woman. Although the general theme is the same: the rich man finds and learns to love a poor working class woman, the characters of Romuald and Juliette are much kinder and worthy of our time with them. I've never forgotten them and I consider the film superior to Pretty Woman in many ways. Juliette is a remarkable woman and the clever ways she helps her boss overcome her problems will make you clap. The final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines in romantic comedy. Romuald's efforts to win Juliette's love outnumber the insignificant Pretty Woman climbing scene hundreds of times. Watch this movie, it will warm your heart.
