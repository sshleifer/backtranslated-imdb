A rare and long role of Kinski as Crazy Johnny sex outlaw that is sought after in San Francisco. Kinski's character is obsessed with raping women a sexual predator in the old west who has nothing but stealing, raping, and killing in his mind. This movie may be a big disappointment to many Spaghetti Western fans, but not to many fans of Klaus Kisnki. Overall, there were two things, a great performance by Klaus Kinski and a great soundtrack by Stelvio Cipriani. <br /> <br /> Another story that needed a lot more work to be imposing, but still fun to watch! <br /> <br /> It would be good to see this movie redone in the future. Since most of the old movies are being redone nowadays.
