This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who is passionate about photos and was scared when he unexpectedly identified with one of them. The unbelievable story of The GUY that was most scary when the heroine was deluding herself as much as the male villain. Geez, is that what life made us be? Do people deceive themselves about the perfect face by imagining how perfect that face should be on the inside? "Toto, I do not think we're in Kansas anymore."
