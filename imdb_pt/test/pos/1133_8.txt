I recently came across this show when the ABC family had a marathon a day before the premiere of Season 2. I remember having previewed for the show in 2007, and thought it would be short-lived, and not very well written because I was on ABC Family. <br /> <br /> Never doubt an ABC program! This show surprised me in the best way possible. Not only is the show well written, the stories are realistic, funny and enjoyable. I was expecting a lot of conversations about relationships, something like "this guy dated that girl who gave me away for the boy ... etc." But this show is anything but! The characters are attractive and you really feel a connection between them all. There is a lot of chemistry between the actors, and they can really make you feel like the stuff is happening before your eyes. <br /> <br /> Do not doubt this show, it's really nice to watch .. and get hooked;)
