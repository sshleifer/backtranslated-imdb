This movie has just been screened on Channel Seven - Australian TV - today. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was very interesting how the Nazis treated the Russian Jews as ruthlessly as anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Kellie Martin did a great job, and her tears and frustration as "Frusia" were quite convincing. <br /> <br /> The Holocaust is a part of our history that we should NOT FORGET. Schindler's List was not the first - and not the last - report of survival and courage in that five-year nightmare. My family is Dutch, and I always applaud the filmmakers who want to keep the candle alive, telling the courage of someone to stand up and help those who were being abused, raped and murdered for being "Jews."
