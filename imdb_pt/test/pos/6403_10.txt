This series, though idealized and fictional, has the strangeness, malaise and good heart that come from living on an island. <br /> I lived in a remote part of Hawaii for a few years. and met some quirky, quirky and fun people in some remote (not touristy) areas. Every time I see the reruns of this series, I fondly compare my memories of off-the-beaten-path experiences of Hawaii with the memories portrayed and fictionalized in Key West. <br /> <br /> This series is not reality television. I hate reality shows. <br /> <br /> It's the time when people were still writing creative TV shows. Give me a "young writer" who is inspired by "angels in the spray, magicians in the palms and elves in the shells" any day.
