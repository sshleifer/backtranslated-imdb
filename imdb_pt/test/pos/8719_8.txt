Another "oldie but goody" from the same era as "Out of Towners" is "Cactus Flower" with a great cast: Goldie Hawn, in her first pre-facelift, Ingrid Bergmann in one of her last and always funny Walter Matthau. The story is about a dentist who pretends to be married in order to have an excuse not to marry his girlfriend, which leads to the need to introduce a fictional wife to the trial. He persuades his maiden receptionist (Bergman) to take on the role, leading to several comic disasters and surprising romantic twists. It's in the same vein as the comedies Doris Day / Rock Hunter. Fans of those - like me - will like this movie; if not, do not bother.
