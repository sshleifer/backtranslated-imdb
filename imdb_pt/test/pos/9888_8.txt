I saw this movie last night at Phila. Film Festival. It was an interesting and funny movie that had some nice and moving scenes. Peter Falk was excellent as was the rest of the cast. They were credible and played their roles well. The film may have gone a little long and the conclusion was good. The audience laughed at the right places. The family dynamics were great, and although they were Jewish families, they could be Italians, Irish or whatever, including Greek. I recommend this movie if you are interested in laughing at a subject that is not often handled this way. IOT makes you think about the consequences of your actions and how they affect others in your life and those that are not clearly in your life.
