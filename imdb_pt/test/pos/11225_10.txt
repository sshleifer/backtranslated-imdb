It is a rare and beautiful spectacle, an allegory of death and transfiguration that is neither lazy nor insipid. A mature and courageous work of insight, Northfork avoids the artrusa distinction, refusing to belong to a type. Contrary to the most memorable and accomplished film to make an obvious comparison, Wim Wenders's Wings of Desire (1987) sustains an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum that ranges from the mundane to the supernatural. This story of eminent earthly and celestial domains in the West holds the literality of the fairy tale that marked its German predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels who fluttered their wings with obsequious sentimentality. Its celestial transcendence, whether it is inspired by a sad faith or driven by a feverish dream, never separates with crud and rot. This firm foundation results in great credit to the writers and directors Mark and Michael Polish.
