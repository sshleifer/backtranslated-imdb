I love this movie, one of my all time favorites. Ann Blythe as Sally O'Moyne is sweet and smooth. She believes that praying for Santa Ana will solve all her problems and her friends. The sub-plot of the wicked man coward to get his father's property is funny and clever. Your brothers are the kind of brothers any girl would love to have. In addition, look for "Aunt Bee" as your mother, a strong Irish who does not leave the house and who brought the family here. They do not do that anymore, for sure.
