For unknown reasons, this beautiful masterpiece has not received well-deserved recognition and has been greatly underestimated by many American film critics. So it's easy to understand that I've encountered a lot of trouble trying to find this movie. Finally I watched and it was so beautiful, sincere and poignant that for the first time in my life I watched a movie five times in a week after getting the tape. The story is focused on the friendship between two boys Erik and Dexter, ages 11 and 12, who are very different from each other, but are becoming the best (and only) friends. The beauty and sincerity of his friendship were shown in the Cure as sincerely and naturally as ever. There are so many beautiful, heartfelt and poignant scenes (particularly in the river) that strike the heart and can not leave any human being indifferent to them. The film is also full of incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism, (particularly strong with Erik's shoe) which also greatly enhances the visual impression of such a beautiful work. The story, written by Robert Kuhn, is well written and unlike the overwhelming majority of modern Hollywood products, virtually every scene, every sentence and every sentence in the film is significant and brings something important about characters and relationships between them. Peter Horton, who, as I know, did not have much experience in directing movies before, showed his great skills and talents in that area. Cinematography is also great with perfectly selected locations for the film, but the most important is the perfect acting, which with all of the above makes The Cure one of the best films of all time. Both Brad Renfro and Erik and Joseph Mazello as Dexter have created a wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and magnificent chemistry between two main characters. Only one of those films (I have not seen most of his other works) is enough to name them as one of the best actors of his generation. Annabelle Sciorra also performed well as Dexter's mother. It is terribly sad that such talented actors are not widely recognized, while countless overrated stars enjoy enormous publicity and huge salaries. Finally, it would be unfair not to mention the incredible soundtrack written by David Grusin, and the fantastic music of Mark Cohn (one of the best songs I've ever heard in movies), My Great Escape. So all I can say about The Cure is a simple word? great. In any point of view, this film is a beautiful, sincere and inspiring work of all the people involved in creating this masterpiece. I have to credit all the people who put their hearts and souls in the movie and in Universal Pictures, who among countless commercial projects of formulas has found a way to make such a beautiful movie. But this type of film rarely reaches theaters, and often the studios themselves do not realize what gem they have created and can not provide their marketing campaign. The only minor downside to The Cure for me is its short duration (only 97 minutes). <br /> <br /> I do not want to write more about the film because it is simply impossible to put its beauty and sincerity into words, so if you have any opportunity to watch The Cure, rent it or buy it and you would not disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. Sorry for my bad English.
