The case history of 'Mulholland Dr.' is known: what should have been another tour (after 'Twin Peaks') in the field rivaled the TV series ended abruptly after completing the pilot. It was too risky and distorted for producers to risk an investment. Lynch used all the footage filmed and cut and began new shootings to finish a completely new film. The result: One of the most impressive film experiences of this decade, which can be ranked among the best works of David Lynch. His previous films "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet" or "Wild at Heart" remained indifferent in an annoying way that took the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the storyline happening here. 'Mulholland Dr.' is a jigsaw puzzle where pieces are missing, others are obviously taken from 'Eraserhead' and 'Lost Highway', but it never seemed to be an unfinished work. On the internet I came across many instructions and essays to explain this movie. I am now aware that it loses its magic when you try to decipher it completely. All these detailed explanations of the solution are not only wasteful but also the questionable attempt to provide an answer where such a thing is not completely necessary. Imagine this scenario: a small child is dissecting their teddy bear to find out where the bear's secret and specific is. Is it because you want to destroy his toy? The secret is in the teddy bear or indeed in the heart of the child? Transferring this to 'Mulholland Dr.' this means that innocence is one of the most important conditions for observing and appreciating it. <br /> <br /> David Lynch manages not only to imagine the surface of human behavior's life, but also to deal with everything beneath it. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that is not said; emotions that are often repressed. 'Mulholland Dr.' has the intensity that requires a cast that completely calls into question the substance. Actresses and actors who are ready to disinterestedly follow the director's visions.Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts and Justin Theroux solve their task in such a stunning way that you would not want or could not imagine another cast. While your acting at first seems to be a little overlapping, you will soon realize that this stereo typing is defined for the purpose of manipulating the viewer and confusing it as soon as the red wire of the film is visible. <br /> <br /> When you claim the criterion of a movie well done in being able to get lost and delve into what you see on screen, Lynch was able to make a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifests the status of David Lynch as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present. Like every filmmaker who goes beyond limits, he is confronted with criticism and ignorance. This will disappear once you find the individual key to the world of Lynch movies. 'Mulholland Dr.' Is it more than just a sleeper? is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema. And in addition, the film is a reward for Hollywood, in form and content, which in that distinction was hardly daring before.
