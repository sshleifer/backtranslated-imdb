I think it's the kind of movie you love or hate and I'm not the type who likes artistic movies. My mom rented "mullhuland DR" the other night and I almost ran out of the room, ha. But I love this movie. We recorded "The Beat" one night when we just let the tape roll and we made a great movie that way by accident. Save that tape and watched a lot. I finally got the VHS to add to my collection. I watched many times and at one point copied the poems. I even tried to preform a scene for my high school drama class. She had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut the swearing. She refused to let me do this. If that could upset my drama teacher, that has to be good :) Honestly, she never treated me the same way after that. <br /> <br /> I liked the acting that came out very true and honest. It was not clean and polished, but it was better than that. It was true for life, how one would actually behave and show emotions not like Hollywood does. It was great to act especially for who plays Rex. <br /> <br /> The story was original. Not only are the characters drawn to his world, but so are you. Not your typical person meets inner city children and saves them through the movie of knowledge at all. Simply caring and friendship make things a little better. <br /> <br /> The only thing is that even in the 1980s there was more armed violence and things less simple like throwing stones, but that little bit of innocence did not disturb the movie. <br /> <br /> I think we need to see. you will love it or hate it, but either way it makes an impact and it makes a good movie that you will remember and talk about later.
