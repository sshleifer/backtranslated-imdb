I love these young people trapped in a movie house horrors. Not just because I'm a big fan of Linnea Quigley-Jill Terashita, but because it's so much fun and really scary at times. <br /> <br /> The special effects are incredible, especially the Linnea scene with the lipstick and until the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed. <br /> <br /> Plenty of nudity provided by Linnea and Jill, lots of humor, cool soundtrack, loud body count, etc ... By the way, if you have ever seen this, try to buy / watch version no rating that has more gore and some scenes the nominal version is missing.
