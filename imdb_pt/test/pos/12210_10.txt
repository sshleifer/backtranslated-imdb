I'm new to this, so stay with me, please. I'm a big fan of Surface. I thought script and computer graphics were exceptional, as good as any science fiction movie I've seen in the movies. In February, the TV guide said Season Finale, the show host said something about the effect of "... and now to the end of the season of Surface." End of the season, not end of the series! I could not wait until autumn to get here to see what would happen next. So autumn arrives here and is nowhere to be found! If NBC is not going to pick you up, what about Sci Fi or the US? It seems to me that Bay Watch did not last long on ABC and then the US got it, and it was for the gang hunters! (I bet ABC was crashing) Ha! If not a series, then at least a mini-series, to give us all the closure of loyal fans. What happened to our guy stuck in the church tower? Was the creature in Nim the Jackal? Did he have a good spert? The cloned guy comes to our side? There are so many unanswered questions. Thank you for hearing me babble!
