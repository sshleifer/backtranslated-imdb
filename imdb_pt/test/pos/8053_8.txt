Born in 1946, I was about eight when I watched this film and left a deep impression. Not only scary, for lack of a better word than this movie haunted me for over 50 years. The mafia bully played by John Larch was terrifying. The only scene that lingered in my mind during those 50 years was the death of the little girl and the indifferent cop calling her a "little n ----- child." These words were replaced when the movie was recently shown on TV, maybe there were two versions of the movie or someone felt compelled to change that heartbreaking scene a little bit. Accurate or not, the film went very far from formulating my opinion about the South and even today the closest to me. Came to visit a southern city is El Paso. What support may seem extreme, but there is a bit more to the story. When the movie was shown recently, it became clearer why it haunted me for years. With the news as starting this movie it gives the impression that what is being shown is fact. The film is supposedly made only a year or two after the incidents depicted, adding to its realistic credibility. The horror in the film is not provided by creatures or aliens, but by people living in our society at the time. The recent exhibit helped to make clear the impact it had on my 8-year-old mind. When this movie left, the only school I ever attended was attended by African-Americans. The victim looked like a girl in my class. It was like seeing a real murder. It made a horrible scene that much worse. Maybe no one will find this comment useful, but it helped me.
