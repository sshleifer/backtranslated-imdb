Fulfilling fantasy with ships navigating through clouds with cannons, evil conspirators, strange landscapes, manipulations of time, great scenarios, void of reality, perhaps like Never Ending Story or something of Merlin. If you like this, you will love it. Christine Taylor is beautiful. The sword fight is false. The music is delicious. Good wins, they kiss, all is well, and the cook is satisfied.
