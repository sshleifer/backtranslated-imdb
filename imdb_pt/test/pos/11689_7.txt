Wow. At first I thought who wrote these things! How difficult is this choice between a man who offers you and your children wealth, respectability and security, as opposed to a husband who offers you only oppression, abuse, degradation, and poverty. However, our choices are not always as clear as one might think. In fact, the rich gentleman was all a woman could aspire to and yet ... her husband's attraction, his sexual desire for him was almost irresistible. What to do, what to do ?? As a spectator, you have become as confused and misdirected as she is. Anyway, what I really came across on this site was my admiration for Engish's voice, I thought, although it's actually the voice of an Irish singer in the movie. Looking at him, I discovered that he is Glen Hansard, whom I had never heard of before that day. What a find I'm so grateful. Wow, what a voice! What a day! Thank you BIFF!
