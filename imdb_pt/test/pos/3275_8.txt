Okay, maybe Posse does not compare to other popular cowboy and western movies. But that's because it did not have the FINANCING that those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce such a story, focusing on African-American historical involvement (and NO, servants and "moms" are not historical involvement), Hollywood will not be very supportive. And believe me they were not. Producers and actors sacrificed a lot of "out of pocket" expenses to make "Possession," just so the story could be told. I think it's just commendable. Possession may not be Oscar material (and they also do not like black media very much), but it's a start. It's fun, and it introduces us to the black cowboy, a character that most of us are not familiar with.
