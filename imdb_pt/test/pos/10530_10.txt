Brilliant work. Wonderful actors melt away like brave and brave characters. All the unforgettable parts in an action thriller more than intriguing and captivating. The cast is perfect. Both on the side of the stars as: Armand Asante, Bernhardt, Kier, Denier. But also for new faces. I was very impressed with the young actor who plays the gang member of boys - Mustafa. You trust each of the Turkish gang. Very convincing is Michael Barral and all followers of white power. I admire the music beat of the main theme of "Children of Wax". This soundtrack is a charming mix of Turkish, hard rock and Udo Kier's buzz? And at the same time, Children of Wax, "a tale focusing on racial conflict. Intolerance and brutality between skinheads and Turks.
