This is a difficult movie to watch, and it would have been even harder if I had known that the lead actor was killed in his house by the police at age 19. Pixote (PeeWee) is a street kid in Sao Paulo who gets caught in a roundup unleashed by a murder in which he had no involvement. He is committed to a juvenile prison where he witnesses the brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens try hard to believe does not exist. When he finally escapes, he and three companions survive by the only means they know, which is crime. What makes the film so exhausting is that both Pixote and the actor who portrays him clearly do not want to be the characters that the circumstances of life have made them. Pixote tries to trust and love and relate, but there is simply no room in his world for the gentle side of human nature. One is left at the end desperately wanting to do something for the Pixotes of the world, but what? Building prisons for children with taller walls is certainly not the answer ...
