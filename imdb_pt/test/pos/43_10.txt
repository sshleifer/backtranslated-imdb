One of the best, Lackawanna Blues <br /> <br /> Great movie, great cast, great music, this is one of those movies that is so good that when you finish you want it to continue for another 90 minutes, I'll get this one here oftentimes. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that grabs you from the start and twists and beats you emotionally throughout the movie. The cast is extraordinary without the slightest hint of anyone being uncomfortable in their role. You get the feeling that it's really there taking all this in. Very careful was given in the scenarios, costumes and music of the period. The relationship between the characters we encounter is simple and complicated as the movie continues, but Mrs. Merkerson's consistent performance is so powerful that the film ends before we come across the wonderful mismatches. Choosing someone who is not "babysitting" is an injustice because we have great performances from great veteran actors, including: Jeffery Wright, Jimmy Smits, Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo. But it's Marcus Franklin, Macy Gray and Merkerson who make it a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> The movie moves quickly and is short by today's standards, but it is undoubtedly one of the best movies you will see this year. If you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally, pull your heart, lift it cheerfully and hit your feet at the same time, then this is the movie for you. I showed it to several friends and everyone wants my copy, which says it all, the movie is good. Check it out for yourself. <br /> <br /> danceability-1, Amsterdam Holland
