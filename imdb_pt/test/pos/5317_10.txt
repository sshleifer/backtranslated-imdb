This film was a masterpiece of human emotions and experiences. I think many people are caught up in Leland's apparent mental illness as the plot, but I was drawn to the relationships of many of the characters and what they reveal about the strength of human emotions. Much of the movie's message is that we never know good without evil, which is a bit of a clich√©, but what makes this movie so good and original is that it eloquently portrays the overwhelming and devastating force that evil can have. , whether you see evil everywhere as Leland, or are experiencing the total helplessness of an unrequited love or a relationship that simply will not work, no matter how bad you want. This movie shows how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie I've ever seen, and it's as depressing a movie as it is good.
