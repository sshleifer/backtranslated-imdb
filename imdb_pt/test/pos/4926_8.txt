I love this movie ... it can make me laugh! = ^ _ ^ = Which is kind of hard to do. This movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations of all time. It does not distort characters like other movies out there. Everyone is in character and has a role to play! <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Buster and Babs down the river after a flood (courtesy of Buster), for Plucky going on a trip with Hamton (hilarious things), Elmyra running torturing animals (as usual ), Fifi following his passion for an autograph, and Shirley and Fowlmouth going to the movies. <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, I did not like Buster. and Babs segments a lot, although they had some remarkable dialogues and jokes. I have to say that the Plucky and Hampton "Holiday" parties were the best! Hamton's family is HILARIOUS! I especially like Uncle Stinky. Fifi in the hotel was also hilarious. I love the participation of actors during this scene. : D <br /> <br /> Probably the most famous part in this movie, again IMHO, is when Fowlmouth and Shirley are in the movies ... LOL! You have to see it to enjoy! And when Hamton and Plucky cross the tunnel to make a wish ... :) <br /> <br /> Although this movie has moved slowly during the Buster / Babs parts, the rest is pure gold! I rate this movie 8/10. Show this to your kids one day ... or even for adults - WATCH THIS MOVIE! You will not regret.
