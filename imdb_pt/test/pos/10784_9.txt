WOW, a masterpiece of a movie not to be missed. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what this movie was like when I started watching it late at night. I did not discover it was a Stone movie until after the movie when I went to IMDb. Watching, I was hypnotized. The cast, especially Eric Bogosian, is simply superb. One of the best scripts and camera work of all time ... The film attracted me and kept me in a trance until the end ... I did not dare to blink for fear of losing something ... Amazing as a small budget film can be so captivating and well done, while big budget movies that feature tons of action and computer generated special effects can be incredibly annoying. Do not miss this movie ...
