Style over substance. But that's the style. "The Cell" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, history hardly supports visuals. <br /> <br /> Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) enters into the dreams of her patients by artificial means to discover and help them overcome their phobias and obsessions. A new patient, who has fallen into a coma, is brought to his attention by the FBI. He is a serial killer who drowns his female victims and then puts their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his unhealthy fantasies to find and save his last victim. <br /> <br /> Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and plays for this production. Each dream sequence is like a moving nightmare painting, from landscapes to costumes. <br /> <br /> But the plot suffers from the lack of history of its characters. Stargher is the only person with a full background and he is the last person you want to worry about. Without it, you basically have a movie that only moves in the present tense, which is a pity, since the film is so visually stunning and genuinely scary. Lopez is wasted, but she is not as incredible as an actress, although she is as beautiful as ever. And Vince Vaughn? I do not even know why he was chosen. This is not his forte and he tries hard to boot. He tried very hard to become his character and showed. Stay with the comedy, Vince! Even so, this movie is so visually scary that I still watch this movie with the lights on and I can never fall asleep soon after.
