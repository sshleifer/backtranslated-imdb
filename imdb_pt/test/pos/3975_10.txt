The best thing about the American bakery "bakery". I found the humor and plot to be a much more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. Also on the appropriateness of the content I found this acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I really enjoyed this movie experience. When the first movie came out I read a lot of negative reviews and I did not go to see it while it was still in the theater ... Now I regret that decision. The film far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialogue / script and overall quality. I give you two thumbs up!
