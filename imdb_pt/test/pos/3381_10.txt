After getting addicted to the miniseries "North and South", I could hardly wait for the continuation "North and South II". Then, years later, came Book III, "HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III". FINALLY, the last installment came to the ongoing saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so caught up in this series that I recorded every part of the TV and managed to get family and friends addicted and I watched again, every time someone new wanted to see them. My tapes are old and I long for this trilogy on DVD. If you have lost Book III, you are not satisfied and do not know how everything happened. Do yourself a favor and demand this set on DVD!
