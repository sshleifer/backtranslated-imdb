"Uzumaki" happens in a small Japanese rural town, where people go crazy. They go mad with vortices and spirals. The crisis is worsening because people are turning into snails and vortices appear everywhere. "Uzumaki" has to be one of the most bizarre and original horror stories I've ever seen. The plot is really clever and the bloody scenes are really funny because the movie does not take itself too seriously. "Uzumaki" is beautifully photographed and the use of color is top quality. The characters are friendly and there are enough shocking surprises to satisfy the fans of Japanese terror. Despite some hilarious scenes, the overall tone of the film is very somber. "Uzumaki" is not as good as "Ringu", "Ju-on" or "Audition", but if you like Japanese horror movies, you will not be disappointed.7 of 10.
