If this film is examined closely, it is a bit sad. It is detailed enough to address very real problems of children growing up in poor and dysfunctional environments. However, it retains its comedic value with witty performances from Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones. The sadness lies in the struggles and dysfunctions of the mother (Carroll), who can not truly help her children, not because she does not want to or tries, but because, of course, she does not know how. Remember, this is a comedy, but if you have never seen it, or if you have it, watch this movie and see the humanity in the characters. Good movie.
