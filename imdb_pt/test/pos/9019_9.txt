Well, I usually watch movies for one of three reasons. Unfortunately, there are no Transformers in this movie, so I can recommend it only in comedy value and pretty women (read girls) <br /> <br /> Yeah, it's funny, I know this because of the number of people in the movies who was laughing on a regular basis throughout. Personally, I loved Laura Fraser, that IMHO is FIT!
