The main reason I loved this movie is because IMx (previously immature) was in it. They were in House Party 3 when they were 11, but now they're all grown up! I was a bit shocked by some of the things they were doing in the movie (almost ready to tear my hair out), but I had to realize that they were not my boys anymore. I think Chris Stokes did a good job considering it was his first movie.
