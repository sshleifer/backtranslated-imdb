OK ... you need to calm down! This movie is not so bad. I saw it for the first time last night and I fell in love with it! I have to admit that I was never a fan of Lee Lee Sobieski, but she grew up with me in this movie. I think Josh Hartnett is handsome, but come on ... Chris Klein is the most beautiful man I've ever seen! He made this movie better for me. Come on girls .. when he has no shirt and will get water I know his mouth fell. Yes, I know that at first he is an idiot, but in the end he realizes how he acted and learns to be a nice guy. If he had not come at the end ... then I would have been angry. I think a couple of lines do not have to be said, but after all, it was a great movie! I definitely recommend it!
