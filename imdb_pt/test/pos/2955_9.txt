This is definitely one of the best documentaries I've seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw "catch the friedmans" not long ago and I have to admit I thought that was better. <br /> <br /> The story is not unbelievably shocking, but it's a major exam of imprisoned personalities and a relational cold. war. Block skillfully guides the viewer through schedules, family filming and interviews after the fact; your interview style is sensitive and persuasive, and your insights are clear and measured. <br /> <br /> 51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships of more than 40 to 50 years of social change, the social consequences and the potential for redemption.
