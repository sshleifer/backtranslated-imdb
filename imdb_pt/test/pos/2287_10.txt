This is an excellent little-known movie. Tom Selleck does a great job playing this movie with the Japanese 'Clint Eastwood'. I would love to see if this movie has already come out on DVD, there are some points that have clearly been cut. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) clearly had some parts cut off. It would be interesting to see more of Japan in the film. The baseball sequences are by far the most realistic of any baseball movie, I'm sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players. I love uploading the tape of this movie at least once a year. The best scenes involve the lack of hat tip after Tom is attacked in the big game, and an intensely sensual scene of Tom taking a hot bath with Hiroku. Dennis Haysbert also does a great job, it's nice to see that he's finally getting some recognition, not just in baseball movies (he was also in the Major League).
