A beloved and dedicated priest from a small town volunteers for a medical experience that fails and turns him into a vampire. <br /> <br /> Physical and psychological changes lead to your case with a wife of your childhood friend who is repressed and tired of her mundane life. <br /> <br /> The priest at once sinks in despair and depravity. When things get worse, he struggles to keep what remains of his humanity ... The vampire movie should have been extinguished now thanks to the poor efforts of the Twilight and Underworld franchises, but the director injects new blood in vampire history, putting simple things in perspective. <br /> <br /> These vampires have reflections, not prey, but still feed and die the same way. Making the main protagonist a priest really opens a can of worms to question the acts. The priest primarily feeds to become better, but when he finds the unrealized wife, carnal instincts settle. What makes this movie intensely erotic is that when the couple consents for the first time, they are experiencing something they have never done before, passion forbidden, which makes the setting more sensual. Chan-Wook adds some of the humor needed to the film, but this is only done in the final third of the film. movie. We see the daughter lift her mother in the chair in front of everyone, and when she realizes her own strength, she simply lowers her chair and moves on. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> And the final act would not be out of place in a movie, or even the three Stooges as the couple struggle for survival / death, respectively. <br /> <br /> The CGI is subtle and fantastic, and the scenes with them jumping from one building to another are so graceful that you might be watching the ballet. <br /> <br /> The vampire genre seems fresh and vibrant after that, but more importantly, it is the eroticism and intensity that most vampire movies are missing out on today. It's violent, but from the director in question, I would not expect anything different. <br /> <br /> A really interesting story with fantastic characters and beautiful cinematography.
