I was surprised to enjoy this movie since I was in the movie school "check your brain at the door and enjoy it". However, this movie touched my heart. I have friends like Emily with mental retardation. I have friends like Evie not socialized. And I was in Evie's place, chasing away the opportunity out of fear and devotion to others. Amy Madigan's disappointment at her daughters was almost palpable on the screen and in the embarrassing moments in which she tried to approach. the gap with Evie was raw and painful to see. And maybe I'm dense than most, but I've never seen the turnaround with Evie's father. Usually, I usually deal with these things quickly. <br /> <br /> My reservations are similar to those of other people posted here. I thought Christopher Lloyd's nice and friendly character (a very different role for him, I thought) was underutilized. What happened to him when he realized what was happening to poetry? He, like James, would try again ??? Second, the ending, as it was, did not seem to solve or accomplish anything. I did not expect the pieces to be picked up and all the ends were well tied, but I felt I was at odds with the characters, that there was no real healing going on here or any real healing efforts being made. <br /> Otherwise, exquisite and lyrical and disturbing, and for some, very, very true.
