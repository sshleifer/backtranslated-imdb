Aaron Carter plays the pop star (J.D. McQueen) in this film (surprise surprise). This is a typical movie where the protagonist (Jane) has a great passion for JD McQueen, the pop star (as well as many other girls), but she is the lucky one who spends the days with JD and forms a relationship with him that is more like a fantasy. J.D. has to go to a public school to maintain his math degree to do his summer tour. The problem is that J.D. is not good at math. He meets the smartest person in school (Jane) to teach him. Jane falls in love and falls in love with J.D. J.D. in return she falls in love too, but JD spoils everything and has to fix everything to win the girl and do the summer tour. The movie is definitely worth watching. Aaron will be a great actor !!!
