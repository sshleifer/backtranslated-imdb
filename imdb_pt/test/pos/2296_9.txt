Many of the comments seem to treat this movie as a baseball movie, but I feel that this is only minor. It's really about living in Japan, and it really is successful. <br /> <br /> I spent some years living in Japan, and I suppose the reason why this movie was not too good is that you have to have tried Japan to get it. I was watching this with a traveling friend who had never been to Japan, and he noticed that many of the events in the film were so ridiculous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief. My response was that these events were the absolute truth and no retouching about life in Japan. I think this movie definitely deserves to be seen, especially if you lived in Japan or are interested in it.
