While the songs and dance numbers in general are not as strong as many would want to be, the story and message of the movie is still there and resonate loudly above the simple musical numbers of the 1970s style. Keeping in mind that this movie was made after the Hollywood musical had almost died (with few exceptions being rock musicals), the audience that went to see it did not like the fact that it was a bold attempt of something that had not been done so far. The public that sees you today will tend to judge you against the movies and musicals of today and, perhaps, the great musical ensembles that have passed. But doing it with this movie, or whatever, is an injustice to the movie itself. <br /> <br /> There are some good musical moments in the movie. The first is Bobby Van. Mr. Van took over his role as Harry Lovett shortly after the closing of a two-year Tony nomination (for best actor) of the Broadway revival, "No, No, Nanette." He's been a man of music and dance for a long time and honestly the only one in the cast who was truly talented and experienced in musicals. He never misses a step in his "Question Me An Answer" and rightly so ... he was totally at home like Harry. Other nice numbers are made by Olivia Hussey when she greets the new visitors and while the lyrics are weak, James Shigeta shows her strong voice in the song "Family" as well as a well-done staging of the complete play. See the movie for what it is ... a fantasy about a place where you never grow old, hidden in the mountains covered with ice and snow of Tibet, found by a group of innocent people of today's struggle of any modern culture. Take this and compare it with reality and you will have a film that falls short of a goal. But ... take this film to the message of love and peace and tranquility and brotherly love and you will have a warm and refreshing and positive message. <br /> <br /> For some, this movie may seem tacky to others, a welcome release from the frenetic pace of reality. For the first, try not to judge and just enjoy the message. For the second, you discovered the secret of Shangri-La!
