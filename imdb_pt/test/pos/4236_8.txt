I would say that "Bride of Chucky" is a "return to greatness", but the series has never really been good. Very good # 1 was, # 2-3 were disposable, and I think this fourth installment is equal to or even better than the first film. And contains the best subtitle / slogan: "Chucky Gets Lucky". So it does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, that completely rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager'. Tilly did not just create a presence; she added much needed humor, story, drama, tension and a great partner for Chucky. And as much as I liked her on the show, she can not have all the credit: the props (watch the first 1-2 minutes for horror honors), writing, internal jokes (again, Pinhead) and Chucky's lines were great ("Actually, if it were a movie, it would take 3-4 sequences just to do it justice." Fortunately, Chucky and the series gave up Andy's "Hide the Soul" quest, and only solved by a new path out of his body.He joins with his ex (Tilly) whom he transfers to a "Bride" doll and a couple of teenagers from Bonnie & Clyde (Really, Heigl?) To recover this pendant buried in Chucky's human corpse.This is for any fan of Chucky, terror horror fans of the 1980s or even for those who have never seen any of the previous Child's Play movies.It's funny, dark, harmless, bloody but not over and despite Tilly's literal 20 minutes, it's always good See you. After all, you hardly see her playing poker. (Note: Sure, I got the reference from Superman? Hackensack, NJ.)
