Ted Danson was a great choice to play Gulliver. Although his past is mostly comedy, it shows here that he can do drama as well or maybe even better (though there is a lot of humor in it). Hard to turn a blind eye to his American accent, especially since his character is supposed to be English, but that's just a small thing. <br /> <br /> All villains are equally well-meaning: James Fox, Edward Fox, Peter O 'Toole, Warwick Davis, John Standing, etc. Despite the fact that most of them are small or giant people, they are 100% credible in everything they do and their motivations are very clear, for example. the incessant suspicion of Gulliver's Lilliputians, Grildrig his (giant) dwarf's hatred for usurping his position as a court jester, Dr. Bates's attempt to have Gulliver proven insane so he can marry Mary. Mary Steenburgen is as good as Mary Gulliver (another seventeenth-century English character with an American accent, but it does not matter). She's a deeply tormented character because she's been waiting nine years for her husband to come home, and when he finally does, he's talking about little people, giants, a flying island and talking horses! Mary, despite the strong fantasy element of the story, is a very believable character. <br /> <br /> Special effects are especially breathtaking when one considers that it was filmed on a television scale at a time when CGI was in its infancy. It looks very realistic when we see a man 6 feet high walking through a city full of people 6 inches tall. <br /> The Cameos are also great: Omar Sharif, Richard Wilson, Sir John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ned Beatty. All the great actors who create a strong cast of support that complement Danson's excellent acting ability. The Houynhnhms and the Yahoos are probably the most effective element in history on the side of satire: a society of talking horses that have none of the vices that humans have while the Yahoos are primitive, disgusting beings are mated with strength and name their leader depending on how disgusting he is. Their study of Gulliver and Mistress is also very well done and shows the differences and similarities between humans and Yahoos. <br /> <br /> The best version of "Gulliver's Travels" by far and one of the best miniseries of all time.
