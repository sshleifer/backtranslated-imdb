"Opera" is a great movie with wonderful and imaginative images. An opera singer (Cristina Marsillach) is being pursued by an assassin who forces her to see him kill everyone he knows by tying her and sticking needles under her eyes. of the needles comes from the fact that Argento does not like it when people cover their eyes while watching their movies. "For years I have been bothered by people covering their eyes during the most difficult times in my films.I film these images because I want people to see them and not avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking away.Then I thought "How would it be possible to achieve this and force someone to watch the most horrible murder and make sure they can not avoid eyes?" The answer I took is the core of what "Opera" is about. "- says Argento. suspense, wonderful cinematography, and brutal, bloody murders. A face is stabbed in the throat with a knife causing a gushing wound, Daria Nicolodi takes a shot in the eye while I ooking through the magical eye, etc. For someone who has not picked this up yet, Highly recommended.
