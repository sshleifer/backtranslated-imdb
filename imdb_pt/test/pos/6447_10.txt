I was wandering through my local library, browsing through VHS tapes, when I saw a movie that made my mouth drop - Waterbabies. I've been hoping to see this movie again - it's been over 22 years since I've seen it (cable movie channel around 78-79). I had remembered many details - Grimes in particular. My son, who is 4 years old, and I watched. <br /> <br /> He agreed with me that Grimes was "not cool," and the best way for me to describe it is that he did not love Tom. He accepted that. It was amazing that I still remembered some of the songs too! They stayed in my head for 22 years - which means they had to have some memorability, huh? <br /> <br /> It's a good movie for children, with parent guidance in case of questions about what the kids had to do. go through that they were not nobility / society on time. That's what all kids face daily (except for some lucky ones), and while we try to film Disney coats, making them more pc for kids nowadays, that does not mean that cruelty did not exist - or not yet. I liked the animation. It was not Disney, no. I do not think Don Bluth ever touched a brush in that film. <br /> <br /> But there's a lot to do. David T plays two roles! (I really like it!) James M too. The waterbabies are cute. You feel sorry for Tom and you feel for him. So Billie herself is extraordinary in the multifunctional part she's playing - it's as if her eyes were magical! I'm a big fan of WoO, TLW & TW, and company (AND LOOKING AT HP!), And I filed it along with that kind of movie. Yes, he jumps in the water, but not because of suicide. He jumped because he trusted the lady in black - she'd been showing up with him all along. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good movie! If you have children, get a copy of the rent. If you find a buyable copy, let me know where! Ian liked it! Dee
