I liked this movie. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, so I could not comment on similarities between this and other films of this genre, but I found this film quite captivating. the plot, though somewhat obvious, had some genuinely scary / tense moments and the acting (particularly of the main female role) was not bad anyway. <br /> <br /> Overall I'm a bit surprised at the low rating of this movie stayed. I watch a lot of movies (working at a video store tends to help) and this really is not as bad as people seem to think. I have some criticism though. The final call of the policeman was terrible, almost exaggerated, the dead girl in the bathroom seemed to be sleeping a bit (probably the amount of tequila she mentioned she drank) and the reaction of the children to what was happening instilled in me I hope they were finally dead <br /> <br /> I hope this helps some people
