I was impressed with Nurse Betty all the time. It has a great set of characters, an original storyline, and an ending that I should have seen coming but not pulling the strings from your heart. <br /> <br /> If there is anything about this movie that gave me the most was the interaction of Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. These two are great and it warms my heart by seeing that Rock is not going to fuck Big Hollywood like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, there really should be no more need to criticize his work. Hell, Kiss the Girls was assisted with him in it. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellwegger does the best she can with her role, and Kinnear is good as her obsession. <br /> <br /> Sweet movie with a nice touch of gratuitous violence to satisfy the blood thirst of the male. 9 ot 10 <br /> <br />
