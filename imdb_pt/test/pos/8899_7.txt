Asterix and the Vikings is the first animated asterix movie in over 12 years since the "Asterix Conquers America" ​​of 1994. It also has the honor of being the first digitally-colored asterix animation, which makes history in much more exciting to see. <br /> <br /> All scenes from this film are reproduced sharply in bright and cheerful tones that closely follow the color schemes of the comic books on which it was based. The characters 'drawings are also relatively close to the comics, for good or ill, preserving the characters' simple but unique appearance. Being simple in terms of character design, this allows more time and effort to be spent with real animation, which by the way outperforms many other large-screen animated movies. Character movements are very fluid and have a quality that seems far beyond what a modest budget would usually produce; there is always something moving in all the scenes and no evidence of the animation cuts from customary cost cuts. 3D computer images are seamlessly incorporated with traditionally animated 2D art. If anything, the shading style makes 3D elements look more like traditional comic book paintings than CGI models. <br /> <br /> The plot takes much of its elements from the comic book "Asterix and the Normans". where your main fault is. As an adaptation of the said comic, "Asterix and the Vikings" takes many liberties with its original material. Longtime comic book fans would undoubtedly find much to dislike about the film's history and its lack of adherence to the source. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, one can see this story as really fun if taken on its own without comparing its source material. Well-written, well-written jokes spice up the optimistic script. The funniest parts were the numerous pop culture references and jokes in 21st century modern life. Mobile communications, the shopping channel, commercial airlines and even sports cars are very successful. Excellent chemistry and cast acting (I saw this in English, by the way) although some voices like Cacofonix I find really annoying (but I think that's part of your character). <br /> <br /> If there is something to criticize about history, it is the lack of "asterix". This story seems to be more like Justforkix's story of teen romance and "coming of age" with Asterix and Obelix merely playing supporting roles. This gives a very great sense of staleness, since many of the elements of the story are the main items of such teen films. Derived and clichéd at times, only the witty comedy and the traditional elements "Astrix" (the Romans, the pirates etc) manage to save this film of falling in simple mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Although not the best installment in Asterix's animated movie library, it is certainly one of the funniest, best scripted and the most beautifully animated. DVD seems a bit difficult to find though ????????
