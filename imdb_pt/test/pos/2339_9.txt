All rising filmmakers must watch this movie - it's like a masterclass in producing digital movies itself. Some of the scenes seem to have been filmed at much higher production figures than they really were. It is very encouraging that such a well-crafted job can be done at a low budget. The acting is very good, and the characters are very interesting, particularly the lead actor (John Kielty), who can play a teenager in trouble while still being very nice. Her beautiful but faded mother was also very well portrayed, and the relationship between her and her boss was very intriguing. This is a very peculiar and interesting piece and I will be looking for something else made by the same team. The director is certainly one to watch.
