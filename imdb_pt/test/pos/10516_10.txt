Bridget Fonda has let me down several times over the years, but she caught my attention in BREAK UP. It is true that the story is missing critical details in various places, but I continued to examine Fonda for clues as to what was significant in the story and she did not disappoint me. The look in her eyes in the last scene, as she gets the courage to literally put one foot in front of the other toward her uncertain future, is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of face acting of all time. I fully believed in her, possibly because I know and admire several "harsh" women who have survived similar abusive situations. And they did it without becoming man's enemies, but this is my own hopeful projection of Fonda's character in BREAK UP.
