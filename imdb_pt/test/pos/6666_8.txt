Kevin Spacey again chooses a winner with K-PAX, a captivating film that expresses deep revelations of human existence through the naive point of view of the Prot character, and at the same time unquestionably wise. <br /> <br /> It's fun to try to work "whether he is or not" as the plot unfolds and the character of Robert Porter develops. However, some may find the ending a bit unsatisfactory, but in reality it could not have been otherwise. <br /> <br /> My few problems with the film revolve around the rather caricatured and simplified portrait of mental patients. I was surprised that the movie plot shows a lot of intelligence and I do not feel like I would have missed anything by being more honest about how people with mental health problems behave. <br /> <br /> That said, I realize this was a film and not a documentary and the film itself is exquisitely filmed and the story unfolds at a pleasant pace. <br /> <br /> Bridges is great and Spacey offers languid and relaxed performance, more like a stand-up than an alien. <br /> <br /> A good movie that will make you talk to your friends.
