I was five when the show made its debut in 1958 and later was a regular spectator. "I Love Lucy", "The Real McCoys", "I'm Sorry", "I Love Lucy", "I Love Lucy" enjoying the first season of "Donna Reed" on DVD and watched the first two episodes. Donna Stone is shown as an intelligent, well-educated, caring, serene and problem-solving mother, similar to June Cleaver and in contrast to Lucy Ricardo. In episode 2, I especially like how Reed becomes a surrogate mother, trading her dress for sweat and boxing gloves, while teaching her son how to physically defend against a much bigger bully. While none of the neighborhood moms I grew up with, including mine, met exactly the idealistic standards portrayed by Mrs. Reed, it is heartening to see good manners and smart decision making prevailing at the end of the day in contrast. to today's accepted standards of vulgarity, selfishness, and indifference among neighbors. I can not imagine Jeff and Mary Stone being told by their parents that trespassing on their neighbors' backyards is fine, leaving a dog outside to bark all day is acceptable, or telling his mother to "shut up" in a supermarket in front of everyone.
