The twelve of the ocean are probably better than the eleven of Ocean. I know most people would disagree, but I really liked it more. After three years, it was good to see the class come back. The reason behind the robbery is a bit more inspired the second time around. I see why they stole from Benedict (Andy Garcia) in the last film. This movie they have a little more motivation the second time around. The twelve of the ocean are more fun and colder than the eleven of Ocean. With a special participation of Topher Grace saying "I just got into that new Dennis Quaid movie" and other things. I think Ocean's Twelve is probably the best of the series. The plot: A year after Ocean's Twelve, Terry Benedict (the guy they stole in the last movie) is back and says that if eleven does not give him back the money they stole, he will call police. So Danny Ocean and his gang go to Europe, where Rusty meets his former cop girlfriend Isabelle. After she meets him again, she begins to follow them. In addition, the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are. With many funny scenes like when Tess (Julia Roberts) goes to Europe and pretends to be Julia Roberts, Ocean's Twelve is a very clever film. It's cooler, more fun and more fun than the Ocean Eleven.
