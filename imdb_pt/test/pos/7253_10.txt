This has to be my favorite movie. The script is sharp and thrown to the limit by an excellent Miller and Carlisle fantastic! Sharp wit, excellent narrative and unpolished Hollywood; a totally immersive movie you got for the bad guys! Stott stands out again as the hateful Chance, while Liv Tyler really beats her other lighter performances like Rebecca hungry for excitement! The soundtrack may not be known by its name, but anyone who has ever seen Top Gear, watched football or saw any TV action sequence is probably familiar with it, particularly due to Craig Armstrong's 'Escape' which should let it never work again! The soundtrack in the first game may seem out of place in a fantasy / action / comedy drama, but a re-watch shows that it is perfectly at home in giving the script is drama. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this movie is that it is not shown enough on TV! Where is it? Really great, sharp and stylish - you will not regret watching it - over and over again! (Exit to connect the DVD player!)
