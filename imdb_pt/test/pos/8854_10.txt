The Thing is a milestone in film production and remains one of my all time favorite movies. Despite the film's roots in science fiction, it is ultimately a horror film that brilliantly balances traumas with psychological trauma. Today, more than twenty-five years after its release, special effects stand out as an example of brilliance and effect. Rob Bottin underwent a complete physical collapse for his art. It would be impossible to do the same movie today, because Studio would certainly insist on climbing a female character or a Paul-Walker type. <br /> <br /> An American male science team in Antarctica is thrown into turmoil. when an alien life form capable of absorbing and perfectly imitating other forms of life infiltrates its field. Their mutual trust disintegrates as they become increasingly insecure about who is real and who is an imitation, and this scenario of 'body robbers' sees their numbers gradually diminish as one by one fall victim to The Thing. When cornered, it manifests itself as a different nightmare creature, the metamorphosis always horrible and convincing. <br /> <br /> The helplessness, isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men with no exit from their situation and no possibility of helping to reach them is ably sustained. The long hours of darkness and the blizzard provide a gloomy backdrop to the unfolding terror. Director John Carpenter has carefully selected a team of brilliant actor-characters and each team member fits perfectly into the role they play, be it the young street chef, the old wise doctor or the bitter, cynical helicopter. pilot. The point is that no one here comes close to being an all-American badass superhero with blondes and a six-pack and the real strength of the film is thanks in large part to this glaring realism. The people who suffer on the screen are recognizable in our daily lives. The Thing remains consistently pleasant and affecting even after repeated visions. I've seen the film on over twenty different occasions and my astonishment at the quality of the direction, acting and special effects are unshakable. My girlfriend prefers the spin-off of the movie - The Faculty - which is a good and solid entertainment, but much more gay and melancholic. She still loves and recognizes The Thing's brilliance however, and thank goodness for that ... Because I could not stay in the company of someone who did not love this movie. <br /> <br /> A classic and then some.
