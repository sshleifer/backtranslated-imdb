I'm now watching "The Big Chill" on DVD. One of his actors is Meg Tilly. I searched the IMDb, which led me to read Meg's biography, which she mentioned and reminded me of Meg's sister, Jennifer Tilly, whose filmography included "Key West" which was one of my wife's favorite shows. So I read all this discussion of reviews. <br /> <br /> Wow, I really loved this show too and I agree with all the feelings about the strangeness and uniqueness of the characters and situations. <br /> <br /> Like most others, I wish it were on DVD or otherwise available. <br /> <br /> The last reviewer says he watches reruns, so I wanted to know which network, channel, day, time is. <br /> <br /> So if anyone knows how we can watch "Key West" episodes, please let us know.
