I had not planned on seeing this movie, however, I was not disappointed when a friend dragged me along. Although there are no real surprises here, guys do reasonably well with their obviously modest budget. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the trailer, you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and there's a pretty constant stream of jokes here with a couple of classic moments, with the high point being probably an excellent flashback for what the guys were in the 1980s. Also, I read elsewhere that the ending was a disappointment, but I found it refreshingly different from what I expected from this genre. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will not change your life, but you have enough laughs there to keep you entertained all over.
