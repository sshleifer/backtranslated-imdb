This nice little movie demonstrates the solid virtues of a time, place, and kind of masculine strength that we no longer have or even want to have. The Saint is a paladin with only the best motives, not to speak of polished vocabulary and diction. There is no need to increase the volume or read the dialog. George Sanders is so charming and discreet that all that talent, intelligence, physical presence and, above all, masculinity, seems almost almost normal. Some normal! George Clooney can not begin to dominate the scene as Mr. Sanders does (and does without Mr Clooney's assault). He could play a sniveler (Witness The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Rebecca), but when he was good, he was very, very good. Truly, a man for all reasons and seasons.
