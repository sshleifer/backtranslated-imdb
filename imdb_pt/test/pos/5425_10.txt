Richard Condie is a Canadian wonder and must be shared with the world. Whether for early work like "Getting Started" and "Snit", nominated for an Oscar, through "The Apprentice" and "La Salla" digitally made, Condie is an esteemed local hero. But no single work puts a stamp on his career as "The Big Snit." And did I mention that you were nominated for an Oscar? Darn tootin '. "The Big Snit," although clearly a message carrier dating back to the 1980s (the short turns around nuclear annihilation of the Cold War, but do not worry it's hilarious as hell), carries with it a greater meaning, as does most of Condie's work in a discreet way. While the planet flees to protect itself from Armageddon, a couple argue about their annoying habits (in Condie's true fashion, he chases furniture while she scowls - literally). And do not forget to watch again and again, because there is always something to look at. Condie carries this face with lots of visual jokes and memorable phrases of effect. <br /> <br /> I strongly encourage this incredible piece of animation to be traced. In Canada, it is usually seen in a National Film Board video, which includes other stellar short films (including the equally funny "The Cat Came Back" by Winnipegger Cordell Barker). The Americans just need to dig a little more, but keep it up? the reward is worth the toil.
