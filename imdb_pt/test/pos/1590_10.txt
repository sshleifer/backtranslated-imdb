Enjoy every moment of this languid show with music to match (Mahler's 5th is beautiful, but listen to the vocal portion of the 3rd symphony so well used in this movie). There are many aspects to this film, but the main theme is the overwhelming force of beauty, its spontaneous nature, lack of logic for love and worship. I'm also a fervent Bogarde fan and I believe he was rarely that wonderful (try it on "The Servant", though). Note: I recommend several views.
