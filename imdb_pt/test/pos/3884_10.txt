Jeff Garlin's movie is full of heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, your on-screen character is hilarious; but in addition we can see both the heat and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes history universal. While the film chronicles your character's love, success and weight loss dreams, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of your life to the screen in funny and moving ways. The simple joys of food, friendship and try again, once life has disappointed us, are all themes. The use of music is creative and contributes to the many pleasures of this film. Any fan of Jeff Garlin's TV appearances should see!
