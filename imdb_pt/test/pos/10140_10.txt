This movie reminded me of the live dramas of the 1950s - not like the recent "Failsafe," which looked more like a feat than anything else, but a TRUE moral drama that is both engaging and thought-provoking. Anne Heche is more than credible as the army officer having an affair with her superior, played by Sam Shepard, and Eric Stoltz is wonderful as his lawyer defending her against the military establishment. I found myself waiting for his case to begin, even though they looked so good together. This movie is apparently based on a true story, and it is a relief to be asked to think about real problems for a change. <br /> <br /> Directed by Christopher Menaul, who also made The Passion of Ayn Rand (with Stolz) and the Prime Suspect series, this is a movie with style and panaca and is absolutely worthy of being seen.
