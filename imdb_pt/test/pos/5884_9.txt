So many great talents have been used in "The Best Years of Lives Out", the result has to be something miraculous. Think about what your director, William Wyler, faced; in the aftermath of a military victory over statist powers that had committed abominable crimes and engulfed the world in battles, he was making a film that argued that US leaders were profoundly anti-individual - that they "wasted the best years of life ". the lives of those drafted or deceived in the struggle against war - which, since it ignored the rights of individuals, were for nothing except arguments about the degree of slavery that men should exist. "There are beautiful scenes of Julia Heron, the cinematography of Gregg Toland and a screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood, author of" The Road to Rome "and other defenses of individuals against tyrannical ideas. The ironic title was used to attract the talents of actors such as Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O'Donnell and Hoagy Carmichael for a large but thematic drama. The clever plot was the experience of you "couples" after the soldiers (three featured) tried to return home to a "victory culture". His bitter experiences and his perception of his own need to fight against what was happening in the homefront puts a strong and sober counterpoint to the conventional notion being sold that "all was well with" America. " March and his wife have a terrible time adjusting, and he is drinking; O'Donnell's youngster, Harold Russell, has hooks instead of hands and wonders if life can be worth it, and worst of all is that Andrews's wife hands him over to a guy with money and he loses years, causing employers to ignore or deny their rights to a job. His individual merits, to have even what he had before he was ripped from his life and pushed into the arena of risk - for nothing, and loss of all he has ever had. The movie's breaking climax comes when each of the three have to face on eed to fight again, each to his own happiness; and all three can find the courage to keep fighting - each for their own happiness, which is now being threatened by a curiously anti-ego, indifferent anti-reality, and a non-American from the United States. Wyler's direction, especially of the scene where Andrews is sitting in the cockpit of a disabled B-17, alone and the scene of Russell's wedding is really wonderful. This is a most powerful film and a great one on its own terms, a men and women can agree for once. Hugo Friedhofer's music and Irene Sharaff costumes increase their brilliance. One of the best and most unexpected films of all time, in stunning B / W.
