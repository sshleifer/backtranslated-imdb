A good story, successful with unexpected character twists, for example. vicious killer gangster Bryan Brown teaching his son macrame. Although successful as an action drama in which you expect the good guy (Ledger) and his gilrfriend to succeed, he also has a hilarious ironic black humor, for example. bank robbers who become "winners" of radio competition and their reaction, busker revenge etc. It's worth watching.
