I first remember bumping into this zaniness of brothers Zucker and Jim Abrahams in the early days of Comedy Central. In those days (the 1990s) their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k, complete with a bearded host. <br /> <br /> Captain. Frank Drebin (played by Leslie Nielson) is a process first created from the merger of several stereotyped protagonists of police television programs (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show), cooked in a jar full of plots and well-known scenarios of television. This is distilled, 3 times to produce the purest police officer each did. Forget Simon Pegg on the Hot Fuzz (for now, save it for later). Frank Drebin is clueless most of the time, a terrible driver, a terrible shot, macho but sensitive and vulnerable. He is a master of police investigation methodology (a.k.a - ask Johnny, Leathery's old cobbler). That does not make him a bad cop. Cops are lucky too. Captain Drebin (realizes that he is a captain here) perfected it. Along with his partner, Nordberg, and the rest of the force, he perfectly parodies the police drama over 6 gold episodes. <br /> <br /> The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialogue and civil citations. Most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly. The magic never came from the vision jokes, though. At its core, there was a meaningless and serious-faced conversation and foreground activities, with crazy things taking place in the background. The films can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best jokes in this series. Think of Monty Python and now for something completely different ..... <br /> <br /> If you liked Airplane 1 & 2, Naked Gun 1,2,3, or Top Secret then you will love it. <br /> <br /> I've always liked the series better than the movies, even though I've seen the movies first. Because? 2 words: No O.J.
