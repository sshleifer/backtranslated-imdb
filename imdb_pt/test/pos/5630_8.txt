I am proud to say that I am a student at UW-Milwaukee, where parts of the film were filmed. Yes, I recognize Mitchell Hall, where I did a film class, possibly the same course as fellow student Smith. <br /> <br /> That's where I learned about "American Movie". Our teacher told us about it shortly before its release. To be sure, I was intrigued, but for some reason I postponed seeing him for several months (he must have done very well if he was still playing, at least in Milwaukee). <br /> <br /> When I finally got to see him, I thought it was a fun documentary. It's not a masterpiece - it's a little too long - but I find Mark's passion and commitment inspiring. I hope this film signals the beginning of bigger and better things from him. Maybe your next "Northwestern" will propel you to fortune. Who knows? <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (away from home) <br /> <br /> 108 min / Released by Sony Pictures Classics
