* Could contain spoilers, read only after seeing the last season of episode 2 * Think about it. The guys from the north pole? Earth's center? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about "did we lose it again?" So, was there another abnormality? Of course that was when the plan fell! I think the whole island is a setup. Created by her father. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for? <br /> <br /> So basically it's an island in a magnetic shield. All this is false. All the signs are there. False beards, false doors, false remedies, false observation stations, with fake bundles of air leading to nothing. It's a real project, and because of the final scene at the end of Season 2 I know you have to do something with Desmond, your girl and your father (and probably Libby, she's weird, maybe she has something to do with the plane Oh, now I'm leaving. <br /> <br /> Also in this episode, Henry Gail tells Michael to go to some coordinates, and he will find their rescue. This is probably a kind of door in the magnetic shield. "once you're gone, there's no turning back" <br /> <br /> I think it's pretty obvious despite the myriad questions I still have and hopefully get answers for next season. If you remember what we learned in season one and season two, I'm sure we'll have a lot of answers in season three. <br /> <br /> I can not wait. <br /> <br /> Can anyone agree with this theory? I hope to hear from you...
