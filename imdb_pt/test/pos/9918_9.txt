If you do not like Italian horror, you will not like this movie. Vanessa Redgrave was scheduled for the movie, and she left. One of the actors was crushed by a car, I was engaged to get married. , but at the end of the photo that was finished.My father died during the shooting ... all sorts of things. " -Dario Argento in the production of "Opera" <br /> <br /> I was really impressed with Argento and the film he made here - especially against those distressing circumstances. The whole mystique of "Macbeth" and his curse on those who try to stage the piece add incalculable volumes to the "Opera". <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Argento deploys some of its most intelligent (and targeted to the public). tricks. A young opera singer, Christina, is chased by a violent psychopath who forces her to witness a series of brutal murders. When you record several sharp blades on Christina's eyelids, the killer makes it impossible for her to close her eyes: "Take a good look, if you try to close your eyes, you'll destroy them. He has worked hard to build the fake "Macbeth" opera on the screen, and his hard work pays off. Add to this a number of unspeakably brutal killings, an incredibly tense chase sequence, and the genial use of POV to portray a certain character Redgrave took it, thanks to God) and you have one of the best Italian horror films ever created. <br /> <br /> That said - it's still Italian horror.Why Christina never seems to tell anyone about these brutal killings is beyond anyone's comprehension.Some scenes may be difficult for certain viewers, but personally I felt more tension about Christina and her eyes than any of the assassins The end of "Tenebrae" had my stomach twisting more than anything in "Opera", but that's probably just me. <br /> <br /> And the last five minutes ... Argento wanted, he filmed, and he's fought to keep him in the movie. Absolutely no one likes it, including me, but it's not enough to ruin the rest of the movie for me. It remains one of the best Argento films to date. <br /> <br /> 9/10
