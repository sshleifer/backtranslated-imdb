The main reason to watch this photo is to savor the brilliant performance of S. Epkers Merkerson. Merkerson dominates this film with his tremendous presence as a nanny, the woman who believes in doing good, no matter to whom, without ties. This actress clearly shows a range that is incredible. <br /> <br /> Thanks to director George Wolf for bringing this cast of some of the best American black actors together. This group ensemble under your direction needs help to create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place. <br /> <br /> Of course, none of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson had not written his wonderful piece. Working with Mr. Wolf, perhaps the best theater director of this generation, they opened the play in a way that evokes this not-too-distant past where a child lives under the influence of Mrs. Crosby when her own parents are not close. to take care of it. Crosby becomes the adoring mother of little Ruben; in a way, he represents his reward for having lost his own daughter. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no time to develop some of the characters, since the action focuses only on improving the relationship between Nanny and the young. Ruben, played with so much charm by the young Marcus Carl Franklin, which is natural. The only thing that could have been done differently was the voice narration that is sometimes intrusive, because it does not clarify or justify what is being seen. Frankly, just by observing the players' interaction, it is self-explanatory. <br /> <br /> In the background there is always music. It does not matter what hard times these people are going through, but the nanny's house is full of laughter and that glorious song that takes us back to that time. <br /> <br /> In addition to Mrs. Merkerson, other notable performances are given by Terrence Dashon Howard, one of the rising stars of the moment. Mos Def, Jeffrey Wright, Marcy Gray, Louis Gossett Jr., Delroy Lindo, Rosie Perez, Carmen Ejogo, Jimmy Smits and the rest. <br /> <br /> Ms. S. Ephata Merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience. In "Lackawanna Blues," she clearly demonstrates that she can do whatever she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma.
