"Blind Spot", one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of ​​three strangers looking for a mysterious man who had loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the brokenhearted boy from Los Angeles. His diary notes, which we hear in voice over narration, work well with the look and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and the drama of revenge in new directions. He also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the scary environment of lost love. There is a dreamlike quality in various sequences and the images are saturated with a strange sense of tension. Weird. Thriller. Beautiful to look at. Definitely worth seeing. I would really like to see it again. Periodically I check if the blind spot was distributed. I can not wait to see the movie again in the movies or on DVD. <br /> <br /> Davide Pepe 08/13/2005 Bologna - Italy
