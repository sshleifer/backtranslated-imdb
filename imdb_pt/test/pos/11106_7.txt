Late at night on BBC1, I was on my way to bed, but curiosity awakened in a contemporary Irish film, so I stayed to watch for a few minutes and then stayed to the end. I have to admit that the main attraction was the only English actress, Kelly Reilly, who is amazing to behold. <br /> <br /> This is heralded as a dark comedy that is one of the hardest things to do. . It must be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughter so you do not know why you're laughing - for me, Martin Scorsese's After Hours (1985) is the best example. Dead Bodies is more black than comedy, but the story swings and descends toward another darkness. I did not see the latest twists in the tale as some other posters here did, so I was appropriately surprised. <br /> <br /> As a snapshot of the Irish film industry in 2003, everything seems pretty decent; It does not look like they spent much on production, so they had the chance to get their money back. The script could have been much sharper, but the acting was very good. Glad you have seen, failures and all, why I do not think I learned much about Ireland today, especially their methods of policing!
