I have not seen this movie for 30 years, so I do not know if I would like it as much as when I was 12 years old. At the time, though, I loved this movie. This is a great "chick-flick starter" for young pre-teen girls. Be careful with the ending, however. There are hard tears and emotions. Looking back, from a perspective of 2008 (with much more knowledge of child psychology, politics and political correctness), I think it would be interesting to watch again. Indifferent Patty, abusive parent, indifferent mother and favored sister contributed to make her vulnerable and hungry for companionship. Patty was sad when Anton left. She was heartbroken when he was killed. The anger that was directed at her later was shocking. After all, she was only 12 years old. <br /> <br /> What I've retained is how this movie taught me that even "enemy" soldiers are people too. Not all German soldiers were hateful Nazis. When I was older, I watched TV shows like Hogan's Heroes and The Rat Patrol, which also indicated that the "regular" German soldiers were not the same as the Gestapo. <br /> <br /> The "regular" soldiers were recruited. . The Gestapo was handpicked among the volunteers for their special attitudes of hatred. I believe that one of the privileges of being a Nazi was that they had special tasks and therefore were not going to battle. His specialties were interrogation and torture. <br /> <br /> Later, during the cold war, I thought of Russian soldiers and remembered SOMGS. We were taught that the Soviet Union was "bad." But the reality was that the Russian soldiers were unwilling to destroy America. They had a job. Their government probably told them that our government was willing to destroy their way of life. Which, to a certain extent, was true, since the US fought to end communism. <br /> <br /> The lesson is still applicable today. The German soldiers were not the same as the Nazis, just as the Muslims are not the same as Al Qaeda.
