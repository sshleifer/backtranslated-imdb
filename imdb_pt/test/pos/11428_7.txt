If you want to see a movie starring Stan Laurel from the comedies Laurel & Hardy, this is not the movie for you. Stan would not begin to find the character and rhythms of these films for two more years. If, however, you want a good farce of Rudolph Valentino's BLOOD AND SAND, which was made the year before, this is the movie for you. All the stops are taken out, both in physical comedy and on title cards, and if the film is not held together by a character, the plot of the Valentino movie is used - well, more or less.
