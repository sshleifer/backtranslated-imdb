I had never seen a movie like this, not so funny. I laughed at my damn ass and watched over and over again. In fact, I'm watching now. Chad from CKY is also beautiful. Anyway, if you've never liked it, blast it, you have no taste. The film involves Ry (Ryan Dunn) having just broken up with his girlfriend turning to Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon DiCamillo) to help figure out exactly what she did with "Rake Yohn," and Raab's help (Chris Raab / Raab) They do just that. <br /> <br /> The fender bender scene and the Cactus scene on the Record Bin were hilarious.
