Big Fat Liar is a great watch for children of all ages, even adults. I had a lot of fun watching this movie and recommending it to kids 10 years old or younger. The laughter never ends and the adventurous plot is very good too! Frankie Muniz is funny and Marty Wolfe is hilarious! Overall, a movie made for kids to have fun and have fun.
