I'm a great former security guard, former rugby player and former boxer, and I love this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not "Mystic River". It's a piece of fluff. But there is room in life for the down, and when that down is filmed in a captivating way, well represented by attractive and friendly people, cleverly planned and full of good dialogues, there is even more room for it. <br /> <br /> I'm not the biggest fan of Tom Selleck. But he's good at it. As well as Julianne Nicholson (loves her bald head and freckles), Ellen Degeneres, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott (That thing you do!). <br /> <br /> The scenery is cool, the weather is optimistic, there is heartache and melancholy and farce and even a little redemption. <br /> <br /> Any (male) reviewer who said this movie is, let's say, not perfectly confident in his manhood. In the meantime, I'll keep picking up chunks of it without apology whenever it shows up on the handle.
