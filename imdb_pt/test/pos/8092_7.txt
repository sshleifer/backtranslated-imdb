This was the first image of Chaplin and the results are mixed. The film is a scathing satire of Hitler and Mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatic lifestyle, especially in relation to the persecution of the Jews. It was bold and early for 1940 and it must have made a lot of people squirm. <br /> <br /> When compared to Chaplin's earlier works, this is rather pale in comparison. The sweet and funny style of his silences, in my opinion, is far superior to his first talkie. There are many nonsense bits that creep. If this was a silence, it probably would not have happened. <br /> <br /> I find one of the funniest moments to be the moment of the musical barber and the dance of the globe. One of the most touching moments is obviously the speech at the end. <br /> <br /> The Great Dictator is an effective and sometimes moving film that is a very important part of Chaplin's history and the history of cinema. It's flawed, but Chaplin is in great shape.
