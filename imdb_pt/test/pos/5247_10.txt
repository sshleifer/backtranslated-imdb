Contrary to the comment posted directly below, The Big Trail (1930) was not filmed in a three-camera process "much like the later Cinerama." This was the end of Napoleon (1927), a totally different film! The Big Trail was filmed simultaneously in the 35mm and 70mm versions (Grandeur), and both versions are shown on the Fox Movie Channel from time to time, so it's easy to compare with each other. The Grandeur version (broadcasted in letterbox roughly its original ratio of 2-1) is most impressive cinematographically with its wide-angle panoramas, but suffers from the same problem that affected the first CinemaScopes, a lack of close-ups forced by director Raoul Walsh because of focus problems. Scenes involving individuals rather than crowds or long shots are much more effective in the standard version because the camera can get closer to the players, thus gaining a greater sense of involvement for the viewer. Looking at both versions simultaneously, one gets an accurate idea of ​​which Walsh photos he chose to shoot in close-up, in the standard version, but failed, in the Grandeur version. There are also some sequels involving El Brendel: a shell game with Ian Keith, and some business with his wife and an idiot, which are in the Grandeur version, but missing in the standard version. <br /> <br /> The record, The Big Trail is the only one of the three Fox Grandeur movies that survived in its original big screen format. (The other two are Fox Movietone Follies from 1929, Completely Lost, and Happy Days, which survives only in standard format.) Other studios have also experienced wide-ranging movies at this time, but the only other one that still exists in both formats is The Bat Whispers , shot in 65mm and 35mm, and released by United Artists. Other large films were Billy the Kid of MGM (1930) and The Great Meadow (1931), Danger Lights of RKO (1930), and The Lash of WB (1930), which can be seen in their standard format versions in the Turner Classic Movies. Kismet, of WB (1930), was also filmed both wide and standard, but seems to have completely disappeared; there are rumors that they are lost. <br /> <br /> Why did the big picture fail in 1930? Theaters were reeling under the impact of the stock market crash of October 1929, and the rising costs of installing sound equipment, and thus were adverse in taking on the additional expense of installing new projection equipment and new larger screens for accommodate only a handful of films, photographed on a variety of different systems that were not always compatible with each other. It would not be until 1953, when Fox, now Twentieth Century-Fox, would try again, and this time succeed, with the introduction of the wide-screen CinemaScope.
