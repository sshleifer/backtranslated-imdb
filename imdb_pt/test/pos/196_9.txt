The aftermath of World War II almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema. In the early 1950s, film production came close to a complete standstill (only nine feature films were released in 1951), and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored, and often censored, by the government. After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, the filmmakers received more artistic freedom with their photographs, although many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic, and propagandistic stance of the war that prevailed in previous years. It was not until 1957 that the director Mikhail Kalatozov and the writer Viktor Rozov became bold enough to produce what is widely regarded as the first post-Stalinist Soviet masterpiece, "Letyat zhuravli / The Cranes Are Flying," a of the best representations of war I seen from any country or period of time. Not only was the film praised for its artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union, but international recognition would soon follow, and Kalatozov's film was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival. Cranes are Flying is both an invigorating visual feast and an audacious and humanistic portrayal of war. Unlike many Soviet war films of the time, it was less limited by the archetypal figure of the traditional hero of wartime and more concerned with the futility, brutality and, indeed, the inevitability of the conflict. Love, as a cinematographic concept, is often idealized as a notion that somehow conquers all and resists endless difficulties, yet the reality is substantially less romantic. In the film, two lovers, Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), separated by the advent of World War II (widely known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War, 1941-1945), undertake to marry after the war. but the tragedy denies the couple their desire. Taken to treachery by the endless torment and uncertainty of waiting, Veronika agrees to marry Boris's cousin, Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin), a handsome but unworthy young man. The film may end with the proud victory of the Soviets, and a patriotic banner parade, but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmingly overshadowed by the bitterness tragedy of our young protagonist, who wanders disinterestedly by the celebrated crowds. Perhaps the most notable feature of "The Cranes are Flying" is Sergei Urusevsky's dynamic and inspirational cinematography, which realistically captures the chaos and confusion of warfare, not necessarily in shooting and screaming fights. of dead comrades (in fact, only one of the film sequences joins Boris on the Eastern Front), but from the perspective of family and friends who are left behind. In a particularly impressive, often quoted, camera follows Veronika as she frantically searches for Boris in a crowd of departing recruits and their families. The handheld gently follows a bus girl, pushes through the crowd beside her - capturing momentary passages of loved ones saying goodbye to her sons and husbands - before unexpectedly crouching over the crowd as Veronika disappears into the dust of a squadron of passing army tanks, a breathtaking movement that offers amplitude and urgency to the dramatic episode. Urusevsky acquired his shooting experience as a military cameraman during the war, and obviously fell in love with the narrative possibilities of manual photography: "The camera," he once said, "can express what the actor is unable to portray: his inner sensations The cameraman must act with the actors.
