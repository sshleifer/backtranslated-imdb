I watched Cold Mountain and the English patient again this weekend. The first is a Civil War melodrama about Inman (Jude Law), a Confederate soldier who deserts the army to return Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) a girl he barely knows. Both films were affectionately directed by Anthony Minghella, who does an outstanding job. Although Cold Mountain is very good, it could have been a great movie with the right cast and less folk dialogues from the inside. <br /> <br /> Romantic epics need a convincing heroine. The English Patient, had Kristin Scott Thomas, who was perfectly cast as the clever, seductive and beautiful Katherine Clifton. The main problem with Cold Mountain is Ada, who looks silly and dumb and does not have that quality that would make you believe that Inman could get obsessed after a kiss. As the actress Kidman has a limited reach, she usually plays stern-faced women who face adversities with stoicism. Kidman was also too old to interpret the love interest of Ing√©nue and Law. The film needed a young actress who could interpret charming, warm and vulnerable. To someone who supposedly endured hardship and almost starved to death, she seemed ridiculously well fed and overly dressed. Kidman was so neatly tidy that it looked as though she'd spent three hours being groomed for each scene. Michele Pfieffer in his youth could have played the role perfectly. Even Natalie Portman would have been an improvement. <br /> <br /> Renee Zelleweger was more suitably dressed, but her lively performance chewed the stage, but maybe she was trying to make up for Kidman. Jude Law was in his own silent film in the role of Odysseus, but played his part well. Ray Winstone was excellent as the London / South villain. During the Civil War, people were probably not very well educated by current standards and perhaps spoke in monosyllables. However, if you watch the BBC adaptations of Dickens, Austen or Ms. Gaskill, all are articulated. Maybe this is not realistic, but it would improve my entertainment.
