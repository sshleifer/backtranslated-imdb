A fun joke, full of silly, if not cruel, pranks. Not the best of the movies, but definitely worth watching. David Niven and Stewart Granger are their usual lovely selves with Granger as an especially delightful and resourceful gentleman. Ava Gardner as wonderful as ever, with such a delightful character that is absolutely iresist√≠vel. The plot is typical, but full of humorous surprises, especially about the unconventional relations between Granger, Gardner, and Niven.
