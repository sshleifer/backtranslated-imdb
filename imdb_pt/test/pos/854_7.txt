This was a surprisingly very good movie, and an interesting idea .. However, it was just a bit disappointing that the 'Twist' was a bit predictable and a bit too early in the movie. As he watched, he began to get a bit bizarre and confused to such an extent that the only reasonable outcome was the inevitable turnaround in the story, but it certainly did not ruin the flow of movies. There have been superb performances, there has never been a monotonous and boring moment, so it is very worth watching this. It kept me interested until the end, and for me there are not many movies that can do that these days. I recommend people watch this wonderful movie.
