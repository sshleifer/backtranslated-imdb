After reading all the comments about this movie, I'm still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full-screen version restored on DVD. Yes, the story may be a bit inaccurate and certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd Fox movie made at Real Cinemascope and the production values ​​deserve only a restoration and distribution. I saw this movie in second grade and it sparked my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visit to Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of the movie in a child's imagination, huh? At school I read the book and promised myself someday to make that dream trip. Now, it is true that this film was done in the "old school" style, which means that the Egyptians were portrayed by Britons with pink skin and blue eyes. However, has anyone seen the current HBO "ROME" series? Everything old is olde again. One can not imagine why, today, we are still playing actors like the aristocrats of Mayfair in the Roman tragedy. No actor in Rome could pass for an old Italian. That said, the AMARNA period in Egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in the history of mankind. This film is immensely attractive (to borrow a word from NEFER) for its historical information (BEER! SURGERY SURGERY! IRON!) And its stunning cinematography and punctuation. I have a terrible DVD version in Taiwan that I watch several times praying that one day a true restored widescreen version will be available. To anyone interested in this subject I recommend the historical novel "A God Against the Gods" by the author of Counseling and Consent. If any of you movie fans know how to get in touch with Fox to encourage them, please let me know!
