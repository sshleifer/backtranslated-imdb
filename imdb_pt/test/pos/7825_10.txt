It's typical of people who complain about something when they have nothing on it ... So this is about a gay man who falls in love with a heterosexual woman. First of all ... This is a true story, so you can not say it is not credible. Second, written by a gay man, then the whole thing about it being against gays is just plain stupid. Personally I think this was the best love story I've ever seen. And I'm very gay pro. I think this shows that true love is about personality, not just looking and sex. And there is nothing against who is gay, hetero or bi unlike so many other shows. Maybe we in Europe will work harder because most of the TV here is a bit deeper and makes you think more than American TV ... Also, we do not fear when it comes to showing certain things. <br /> <br /> If you want something funny with one of the best in England (Lesley Sharp) and you want to see a decent and believable love story without much sap this is for you. I know I love it.
