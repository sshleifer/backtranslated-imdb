Wow, Stella Shorts are great! Many state patrons and Stella, the TV show. I never knew that Stella could have been better than the Stella TV show or even the Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I also never knew what short comedies could be good. My favorites were Pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods and David arranges a meeting with his lost cousin a long time ago, Greg. I think, above all, David was the funniest. It's funny when it does not make sense. I like the music in the shorts. This is something I pay close attention to. They always had good musical taste. I wish they would still make short films, or that, or bring back the sitcom. I hope they continue to make a good, funny comedy.
