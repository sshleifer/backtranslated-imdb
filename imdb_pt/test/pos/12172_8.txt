First of all, I'm from Munich, where this movie happens, and believe it or not, there are guys like Erkan and Stefan, including the silly dialect! I've known your comedy show from the beginning and my biggest fear was that the movie was just a montage of your already-known jokes, but it's not! Jokes are developed through history and make, in a special way, meaning. But if you do not like Erkan and Stefan, hands of this movie. All others - worth seeing!
