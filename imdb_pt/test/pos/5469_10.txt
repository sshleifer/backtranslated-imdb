Almost no information is available on this film or its broadcast dates. After an exhaustive and continuous search, I found the DVD available for 3.99! Release date, February 28, 2006. Try Yahoo / DVD and video. In order to get this information, I will continue to state that this is a well-made movie with a true and fascinating story about a mysterious carpenter who builds a very unusual staircase in a church. It is a chance to see William L. Peterson before C.S.I. turned it into a star. Also prominent in the story is the venerable Barbara Hershey - does anyone remember when she was Barbara Hershey Seagull? I have to keep writing to publish this. Thanks to previous reviewers for taking the time to recommend this somewhat obscure TV movie that obviously leaves a lasting impression on many.
