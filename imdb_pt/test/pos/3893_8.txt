Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows that he can do more than just act; his writing was very good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as Private Detective. The biggest strength of the film is Macy's work, which reminds us of his role as Jerry Lundergaard of Fargo. He has numerous scenes in which he is extremely funny as a viscous, manipulative and deceptive character. It's nice to see him being a weasel, and for a while, I was glad things were working out for him. *** of four.
