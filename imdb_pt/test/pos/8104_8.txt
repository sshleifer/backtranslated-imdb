This ingenious and innovative comedy packs many invaluable moments and great sense of rhythm, albeit a long time. Chaplin's satire, with several classic scenes, he has a double role as a Jewish barber and the dictator Hynkel, an offensive portrait of Hitler. So the barber is mistaken for the Hitler tyrant and successful events happen. Funny and extraordinary acting from all cast, such as co-stars Jack Oakie as Napolini (Mussolini-equal), Henry Daniel as Gasbstich (Himmler-equal) and Billy Gilbert as Herring (Goering). Chaplin's first film is brilliantly photographed by Karl Struss. This splendid film contains numerous fun scenes, the funniest of which are as follows: 1) One in which during World War I the barber-soldier and a co-pilot are flying in a plane turned aware 2) Adenoid dictator Hynkel making exaggerated speeches including a braided microphone 3) Hynkel playing with a huge balloon in the world 4) The Jewish barber shaving a man who fits Brahms 5 Hungarian Dance 5) when Hynkel and Napolini try to keep your body taller than the other in a barber's chair; Hitler banned the screening of films for the Germans because of his satire and put him on his death list after his proposed conquest of America. The film is co-starring Paulette Goddard, the third of his four wives, they were married in 1936, although no announcement of the marriage was made after the Great Dictator was finished. The photo was released in 1940 when Chaplin survived a moral scandal over a paternity suit, but the House of Anti-American Activities was the signal for the US refusing to re-enter England and fled to Switzerland.
