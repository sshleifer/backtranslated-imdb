Another "end of the world" movie that begs for comparison with the abysmal "Day After Tomorrow". Following the same type of structure as the DAT, but with a distinctly Japanese style. How do you get out? That depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama. <br /> <br /> I found that little human touches to be what makes this movie appealing for most of its 2+ hours. Also frequent title cards explaining some of the sciences. The effects are probably the best I have ever seen in a Japanese movie and they compare pretty well to anything out of Hollywood. Many of the disaster scenes are really horrifying, although human carnage is often off screen. And that's one of the drawbacks. While the terror of thousands of onscreen deaths, as in the recent "War of the Worlds" may have been too much, we also do not realize the chaos of a whole nation collapsing in the ocean. Some scenes touch chaos, but for the most part this part of the story is barely touched. Regardless, this movie works on many levels and is much more realistic then DAT, which is to the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the story is based on a clich√©d plot device and another plot device that would be at home in the 1960s in the Japanese land in danger "Gorath" movie. After the reasonably good and mostly realistic science leads to disaster, this makes for a bit of disappointment. The sudden stop of the film for a pop love song also does not help (unless you like the song), which made the final " exciting "a bit difficult for me. <br /> <br /> The direction is good and the art design is excellent. The acting is also good.
