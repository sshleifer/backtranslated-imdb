I'd like to thank you for giving me the chance to be one of the first to actually see the movie. It really grabs you. John Paul finally manages to see the light and make a life for himself, far from being tied to the ropes of his mother's apron. <br /> <br /> I imagine there must be so many families nowadays in the same position (especially with children leaving home older, but I would not say they are wiser) with very sad parents who have no life themselves and make their lives a misery. <br /> <br /> I think this movie definitely should have a bigger audience. I would also say that the other actors have also played bright parts. It's such a profound and moving film.
