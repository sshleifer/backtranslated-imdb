The three short films included in this collection released in 1959 are Chaplin's eternal classics, nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize as well. Chaplin's score for these films and the structure added as intermediate sections between the shorts are also well done. The problem with this build is less, though annoying. The shorts were stretched to fit the frame of 24 ps speed of contemporary films, while the shorts themselves were filmed at 20 frames ps This result is abrupt movement that does not look very appealing, and yet it was an excusable solution, given the limitations of technology the current version of the DVD is not restored, the films look dirty in 1959 and are still stretched. There are separate restored versions of these available classics, even on DVD, and it would not be a problem restoring the image, but unfortunately this was not done. <br /> <br /> A secondary complaint required a lot of space in my article, but I say again a small complaint, it should not detract so much from the experience, although it has undermined a point in my rating. The shorts are still worth '10'.
