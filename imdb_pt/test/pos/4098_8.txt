I saw this movie when it was first released in 1973 and I loved it. Since then, I've been looking for a video, but I've never met it until now, 33 years later, when I asked Moviehunter. Sorry to say you can not handle it. This glamourized version simply can not rise to the production level of 1937. I love the soundtrack of Burt Bacharach, that is, if I listen to it by myself, and even bought a CD of it, but to my taste, it does not lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. It just does not fit. Michael York is lost here. Sally Kellerman does a good performance, but Olivia Hussy is simply ridiculous and not worth dragging through the Himalayas. The best performance is Charles Boyer as Chief Lama.
