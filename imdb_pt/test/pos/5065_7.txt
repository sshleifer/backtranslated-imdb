RENDITION's reviews were generally not favorable, so I waited until he moved to the local discount theater to see him. The film tells the story of Anwar El-Ibrahimi, an Egyptian-American scientist who is taken off his international flight and taken to interrogation after a strange coincidence links him to a recent terrorist attack in an unidentified North African country. Not as bad as I feared, it's an interesting and thought-provoking entry into the "head-ripped" thriller genre. <br /> <br /> The film finally asks tough questions about American methods of intruding information from political prisoners: It is crossing the previously unchurched line of (openly) employing torture on terrorism suspects, something that our country should be doing? Produce useful information that helps save lives? If so, at what cost? What kind of monsters do we create when innocent people are made prisoners and tortured? By sanctioning the use of torture, what kind of monster do we, as a country, become? It's always disappointing when a movie with such provocative material is sloppy with some of the details that make great movies great. For example, I'd like to empathize with Anwar's wife, who spends the whole movie trying to locate him, but the only identifiable personality trait she's given is an advanced state of pregnancy. RENDITION also seems to imply that Arab women who do not agree with the arranged marriages of their parents are just asking for trouble, and there is an ill-conceived scrapbook maintained by another of the film's main characters, which conveniently spells out all the details in detail. the information that his love interest is simply urgently needing at that particular moment. I laughed out loud, when the moment should have been filled with dread. <br /> <br /> The film features good central performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and strong (but very brief) appearances of Hollywood veterans Meryl Streep and Alan Arkin, as well as impressive shifts by Omar Atwally as Anwar El-Ibrahimi and also of actors Moa Khouas, Zineb Oukach and Yigal Naor, all of whom I would love to see in future films that have nothing to do with terrorism. Good luck to them. The five stories more or less follow perfectly, until the filmmakers enter a light but effective twist, which alludes finally to the never-ending cycle of carnage that violent terror attacks engender.
