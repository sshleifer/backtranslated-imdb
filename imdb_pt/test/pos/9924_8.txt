Dario Argento is a slow-moving filmmaker, following the iconoclastic efforts of Deep Red and Suspiria; he is not a filmmaker to always care directly about silly things like "plot". That may be his least responsibility (but, to me, apparent): he will not let a little thing like common sense ruin his plan for his elaborate murder sequences, since his killer can go through any kind of elaborate setup being invisible, until revealing the point of the POV tracking shots of the said psychopathic killer. But it's thrilling to see a filmmaker take a chance, a pure Italian aesthetic paving the way in the soul of a Hitchcockian warp (actually, as a note of interest, if anyone recently watched Scorsese's short film in which he took three pages of a non-filmed Hitchcock movie, which also occurred in an opera, Argento slammed in almost twenty years, probably without knowledge of the text). It's also blatantly 80's (CD players and heavy metal and hair, oh my!) And with an absurdity that makes everything more palatable to swallow. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: a Macbeth opera is being produced with highly stylized pyrotechnics and trained crows. There is even a talented and promising star replaced at the last minute, Betty, played by Marsillach. But a murder takes place during the premiere - interrupted not by that, but by a falling light - and now the murderer is after Betty! She can not go to the police (how can she say the opera is really cursed?), But would that matter in the face of a murderer who does not give up? It is probable that someone has seen premises like this in other films Argento - a girl being chased by a murderer - but that is how Argento, like De Palma, builds and executes his sequences, and adds a flavor of his own to add touches of bizarre humor. (the bursting of the ravens to attack the killer, and the subsequent version of pointing at the formation), a type of styling over the Leone wing (the bullet through the magical eye through the door probably inspired a similar shot in Kill Bill 1) the sadomasochistic inspiration with the pins glued into Betty's eyes, more than once! <br /> <br /> Argento puts her actress through the clothes press, and she's crazy about it, even when things seem to just get into the territory "what the heck" (I was throwing my hands almost saying I give when she is taken by the secret passageway for the little girl, as if suddenly we were in Aliens now). And through this dark genre material, Argento maintains dense, cool violence, suspense as much as the one with opera music coming straight from a stereo system speaker and a cinematographer who may have drunk a bit (and with reason!) during some scenes, the way they are filmed and vibrate for a heart beat. It must be considered rubbish, but any limitations of the genre are overcome by the director's courageous attitude, this despite a foolish end - more silly than anything that preceded what came before him (thank you little lizard) - and an attempt to break the curse Macbeth, which unfortunately does not seem to happen in real life on the set of opera. 8.5 / 10
