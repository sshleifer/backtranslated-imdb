This was one of the first color films I saw in movies when I was a kid. It's good to remember that. The girl, Liz Taylor, who later became a beautiful woman, starred alongside the fine little actor Mickey Rooney. The content of the movie plot is good for all ages, goodwill and behavior. The good ethics of Velvet's parents, particularly his mother, is something to be reckoned with. Our generations must be well educated and this film can help in that purpose. Velvet loves horses and pilots, and Mi Taylor (Rooney) took her to an international horse racing competition in England, where in the end the young Velvet won but was disqualified for being a woman.
