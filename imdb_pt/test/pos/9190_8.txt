Fado is a sadly bluesy style of Portuguese gypsy music that is heard repeatedly through the film. As explained by one of the main characters (Igor), this also means fate. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's the fate that unites the two main characters, Paco and Alex, and unleashes the problems that follow. <br /> /> Overall I liked it a lot. It starts as a drama / road movie 'on the down and outs' and builds a thriller / thriller. <br /> <br /> There were two things that I found unrealistic that prevented me from giving it a higher level. classification (I gave an 8). The first is the main point of why Alex delivered things. Was she so desperate for money that she sold her passport for an insignificant amount and then handed things worth thousands to a stranger? His explanation was not convincing. Also how did they get through the gate, where were the cops?
