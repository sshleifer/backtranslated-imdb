Yeah, I know my title sucks. I could not think of any other title. x] Ice is a brilliant episode of the first season. Very interesting idea and good acting too. The bogeyman was really scary in my opinion. I've never been a fan of insects, so all episodes of insects are scary to me. x] Anyway, let's go to the good and bad things about this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: The parasite thing. Impressive! <br /> <br /> Scully finally trusting Mulder. Awww ... <33 <br /> It was a good idea to put another parasite in the ear. Although if someone told me I had to put this thing in my ear ... I think the whole cabin would be dead. <br /> <br /> The Bad: How did the dog stay alive for so long? <BR> <BR> <BR> How Huffman did not get these black spots? Or maybe she did, but nobody saw him ... Conclusion: Very good episode, especially for Season 1. 8/10
