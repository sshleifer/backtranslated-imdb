There is not much plot for this movie. There is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for negligence. Not much more than that, but ... NO MATTER! <br /> <br /> It does not matter because you have some real actors giving your life dialogue, and because of the cast you have some hysterically funny scenes and even if you're not laughing, you have a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Matthau plays Charley, whose wife recently passed away, and who finds herself in the object of desire of several women in the hospital. He is happy to sample everything on the menu available for him. So he meets Anne Atkinson (Glenda Jackson) who is a patient at the hospital at the outset (their first scene together is very funny) and then they meet again on a television discussion board, where they disagree on almost every topic which is discussed. <br /> <br /> Charley begins to like Anne, and vice versa, except that she is very big on monogamy in the men in her life (her husband was a cheater) and they decide to shoot her - two weeks of fidelity. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything else, but I want to mention the chemistry that Matthau and Jackson have on the screen. She is generally not the first person anyone would think of in a middle-aged romantic comedy, but her touch with comedy is very light and enjoyable. She is accompanied every step of the way by Matthau, who is more charming than ever. He does not have to play Mr. Sensitive or Mr. Macho to get the girl, he just has to be himself. <br /> <br /> Art Carney is a mutiny alone as a practically senile doctor. The scene where the ashes of the baseball team owner are buried in the home plate is invaluable. He also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with Richard Benjamin. Richard does not have much to do in this movie and, most of the time, he's just the straight man with Carney and Matthau; the role does not overwhelm his considerable talents, but he had to have fun doing this comedy. <br /> <br /> Very recommended ... 8/10 <br /> <br /> PS. FYI - Matthau presented Jackson with her first Oscar for Best Actress, and Jackson presented Best Actor for Art Carney for her role in 'Harry & Fool'.
