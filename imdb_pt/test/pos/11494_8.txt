I loved this movie! He has a big heart and great bones. I stumbled upon it by chance and I had no recollection, not even a clue, of that promos movie or reviews or word of mouth. I remember reading many years ago a journalist who commented on the value of watching movies without being tainted by the pre-judgment of reviews or by the false speech of the promotions. And this seems to be the most common source of critics' negative reaction to the film: it failed to meet the expectations of being a comedy, a slice of life or a directed character. I had no expectations about the movie, so it was comical - but I only laughed once or twice - not a comedy; it was about a person, but so eccentric that it was not a slice of life; was about a character, but the character was so optimistically optimistic and confident in his life instinct that it was not the distressed sentimental melodrama so typical of the "serious" American movie - as I wrote it, I realized that the writer / director Lisa Krueger managed to mock of this American sentimentality in her husband! And very skillfully too! And Kreuger was able to maintain the cloying and sentimental end of the screen when the rebellious husband, not prodigal, came back with his tail curled between his legs. Bravo, Mrs. Krueger, bravo! (Now I'm going to watch this movie again as it's getting better and better as I think about it.) Graham's performance as Joline is brilliant. I loved how subtle, but completely, she was able to portray and convey an intelligent awareness of her committed commitment to honoring his words and deeds - she knew that by keeping her word with a band, or friends, or husband, she was preparing to ridicule. and / or deception in a world incapable of honoring commitment as she was able to do. But even with this force, she was totally connected with humanity and embraced with a totally committed heart its frailties and failures. Joline's character was incredibly well-represented, and I left the film surprised to have no recollection of nominations for it. Ok, not so surprised, as American awards tend to go to women in "serious" roles, full of anguish and the proper amount of nudity that this film did not have. What has gotten so much better, it was the heart of this woman's discovery in herself with the help of new friends and a self-deprecating shaman. <br /> <br /> I admit to being a bit of a soft touch to eccentric characters. who manage their peculiarities, remaining honest and faithful to themselves as they move through the minefield of what is understood as "adequate" social behavior and "acceptable" interpersonal discourse. So, if people must conform to normalcy in their world, this movie will not be to their liking. And this was, it seems, one of the common lines of criticism. <br /> <br /> And I'm always a sucker for a good play on words when it raises questions of human behavior and ethical / philosophical values. Until this movie I had not made the emotional connection between being committed (with a cause or honesty or something) and being committed (with a madhouse). At what point does a person's commitment to a personal sense of truth and action in life become a path to insanity? This seems like a simple question, or one that is easily dismissed as rhetoric. But that's it? And yet few of the critics - I think perhaps two, commented on this aspect of the film, directly or indirectly. <br /> <br /> A lovely movie. 8/10. <br /> <br />
