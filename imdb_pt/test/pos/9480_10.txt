The first time I saw this DVD, I was not just happy about the fact that it was the first time in decades that the band has released anything but also because the DVD itself is extremely loud. Jimmy Page obviously can not live with quiet music, I guess. I must say that during the show at the Royal Albert Hall, they expanded 'How many times' and 'Moby Dick' for a long time. Other than that, it was exquisit. My favorite song of all time is now on this DVD. Trampled underfoot. It's the one or "In my time to die". In that song, Jimmy really plays this thing well. Ever seen Randy Rhoads play? Well, Jimmy plays like him, except his guitar is smaller.
