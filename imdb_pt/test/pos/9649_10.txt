This is a very long film, in fact. But it is very beautiful and a good example to show why cinema can be considered art. An easily told story can not be expected in Les Amants RÃ©guliers, but every scene, every silence here counts much more than a hundred dialogues. Playing, different, perfect in his photos and soundtrack, showing why the closure brought by cinema as one of its main features has become the greatest innovation in any dramatic representation. Someone who is accustomed to this type of film, where everything is said, and the action happens all the time, will be tiring. But it's worth watching, to discover other possibilities of feeling a story.
