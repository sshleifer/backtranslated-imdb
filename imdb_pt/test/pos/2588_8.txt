We have just seen this film being screened before the launch at the Norfolk Film Forum (VA), and there was general agreement on two issues: There were excellent performances in a first-line drama by the two leaders and by others: and secondly, the marketing for this movie will only bring disaster. We saw a sinister poster with suggestive currents and comments, suggesting some kind of sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, while the film has a real depth and some thought-out ideas. What is sad is that people who are looking for pornography next will be drawn to see the movie and will be disappointed because it will be very "heavy" for them, while people who really like it will not be dead hands when they enter the theater. showing it. What a pity. A good wasted movie.
