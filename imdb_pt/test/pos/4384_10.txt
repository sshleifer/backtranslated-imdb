'The Brother, Where Art Thou' is a cheerful retelling of Homer's Odyssey, set in the 1930s in Mississippi and unbridled with splendid strangeness that is the hallmark of the Coen brothers. Three unfortunate condemned men flee to find a treasure - and more than their share of adventure - in this delicious film. George Clooney is in good naive form as the trio's chatty and lovable leader; but the real congratulations go to John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as their goofy but adorable comrades nicknamed "Dark-Backed Boys" by Clooney's character after being baptized by total immersion in a river. The three cut a record according to the nomination of home-made pen for money, and unwittingly became night-to-day sensations with true 'rock star' status. The film is accompanied by music and enough songs to almost qualify it as a musical. And there are some incredible feats of making movies here: the scene in the KKK Rally is a true doozy, and it is so similar to the scene when Dorothy's friends rescue her from the witch's castle in 'The Wizard of Oz' almost to cinematic plagiarism. And what an incredible plagiarism job it is! Without revealing the ending, I must say that the climax of the film is one of the most exciting sequences to film in recent memory (along with the spectacular end of Magnolia, another of my favorites). 'The Brother' is a must-see, a perfect 10!
