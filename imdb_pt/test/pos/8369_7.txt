This is not the best movie you can see, but it's still very refreshing. Of course, it has its flaws, it has moments of humility and, at the same time, it is unlike anything you are used to and it is funny in a way that only the French can give you. You may recognize a little of the masterpiece Amelie, when you see the opening. I give it 7 out of 10, but I still recommend it if you're tired of the usual tiredness you can rent on the videostore.
