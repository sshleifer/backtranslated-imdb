GUTS OF A BEAUTY is a little better than its predecessor, GUTS OF A VIRGIN. Although this movie is not really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first part, I found BEAUTY a little stronger and better united than the VIRGIN ... but then again, that's not saying very. <br /> <br /> BEAUTY begins as a fairly rough and straightforward exploration film. Some Yakuza cats are holding a young prisoner and begin to rape her brutally. As this evil is happening, the guy in the head tells the girl that they did the same to their sister and sold her as a slave in Africa, and they will do the same with her. They then shoot her with some drugs and rape her a little more. Somehow, she walks away and ends up in a clinic where the nurse there hears her sad story. The rapee ends up going crazy with the stress of their previous experience and commits suicide. The clinic worker, driven by her story, decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the low-level guys and trying to hypnotize him to make him kill the Yakuza leaders. The whole plan backfires, so now Mrs. Vigilante-Clinic-Worker is exposed to the same treatment that our original rapee has - only worse (some rather rough rapes follow along with the prerequisite collective rape ...). She is also drugged, but the drug has a strange side effect on our apparently unhappy victim ----- she turns into a horrible hermaphrodite DEMON BLOOD !!! (not sh! t, that's what really happens!) That's when BEAUTY really takes off with scenes of insane killing - including a very stylish bust rape that looks like a cross between ALIEN and a bad porn, and my favorite - a head-demon-vagina-swallowed by the head (complete with demon vagina-slime ...) that has to be seen to be believed ... <br /> <br /> Definitely some promising things going on in GUTS OF A BEAUTY, but still feeling very disjointed. BEAUTY almost looks like two different films are forced to unite in an unsupported way. Still, I have to give credit to the film - the rape scenes are very rough and misogynist, and the murder scenes are totally out of reach. A solid 7/10 for another crazy "J-horror" classic.
