I have read many different opinions and reviews about this film and understand why many people have mixed feelings about Ponyo, be it plot, animation, dialogue and so on. And I think the simplest way to respond to that is that it's a movie for a much younger age group. A much younger age group than Tonarino Totoro. Being a Miyazaki fan like most surfers of this site, I expected the wonderful animation, musical composition, complex storytelling. , the great constant development of characters, how the story intertwines with today's society, etc etc etc of a typical Miyazaki movie with which we grew up. And to tell you the truth, I did not quite understand what the heck this story should be or what the heck was going on for an hour and twenty minutes (with twenty minutes in the movie), that this movie is NOT for deep thinkers and for the Ghibli-ists, but for the young and the young and the happy Japanese. In addition, I believe this film is based on simplicity and creative animation; straight-up style of Ghibli Studios roots. <br /> <br /> The fact that a villain was not present really surprised me, as well as his father and maybe that crazy typhoon. But in addition, this movie is simply entertaining; stimulate the mind of a young man, and make happy good feeling moment. That is all. <br /> <br /> The animation goes back to the mid 80's era of the Miyazaki movies, where very specific details were not a major focus, unlike Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) and the second. I admire the simplicity that kind of created a little nostalgia when I watched Ghibli films like Tonarino Totoro as a child. The reaction and movement of children are very similar to those of children, and much of the body language of Studio Ghibli is very noticeable. Studio Ghibli has added some creative moments and scenarios that they can only do with their wonderful animators, but probably will not take the Ghibli-ist ritual in reverence. <br /> <br /> The Japanese dialogue also sounded very child friendly and many scenes and dialogues are very, very relative of what Japanese children and mothers would say and act. The song, if very hoppy and "cute", I think you could say (similar to Totoro) from start to finish. Even the darkest scenes do not seem assertive. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is unique. Just about every aspect of this movie is for kids. And I waited a full 80 minutes to realize that. Frankly, I've never seen a movie told or shown as Miyazaki did. It is comforting to see that Studio Ghibli can still tell a story to a wider and different audience, and still retain that trademark of Ghibli.
