Sometimes I really wonder? When I look at the comments here, it seems that most people saw a movie completely different from me. I just saw ... and I liked it. Not on the way, which made me happy, but in the way I have seen a good movie! <br /> <br /> The film needs a little patience, yes. And yes, the main character is really boring, but I'm sure it's by intention. <br /> <br /> It might really make a difference if you watch this movie in a movie theater or at home. Most people watch movies at home as if they were listening to elevator music. This movie definitely does not fit as background noise. <br /> <br /> And no. Good direction does not mean having five laughs or explosions per second. Good direction means following your subject and keeping the story and the actors together. And while that does not work perfectly, at least I think it works very well. <br /> <br /> I liked the photography and the scenery, even if they join the surreal sometimes. The opening scene is really special. <br /> <br /> I also liked the acting ?? Guillaume Depardieu is not playing Pierre. He is acting like a Pierre who is playing a role! Pierre is not the romantic hero he so much tries to be, he is a presumptuous and hypocritical idiot, a weakling who by and by all the people he says protect. That even your love of truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by your continuous lie and not even once asking questions or explaining to yourself. <br /> <br /> People are wondering where this or that person came from and other things: character that is seen by more than two scenes is left unexplained, there is enough information scattered throughout the film at all. <br /> <br /> And even the strange building starts to make sense as the target practicing is seen: Remember that Isabelle has fled a war zone - and obviously this is a haven for combatants in a civil war , probably Bosnia (which was still happening when the film was produced). At least it is what is insinuated by the story that Isabelle tells Pierre when he meets her for the first time and the scene later when Pierre shows Isabelle the book with her father on the cover, which is surrounded by books about Bosnia.
