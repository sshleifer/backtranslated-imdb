Regard of Flight and Clown Bagatelles, played by Bill Irwin, are some of the funniest (both in terms of physical comedy and verbal and visual jokes) I've ever seen. My father recorded this special when it first aired in the 1980's and my family has loved it ever since. We quote it constantly back and forth. It is a pity that copies are not readily available for purchase. I have a bad copy of VHS that I purchased from a specialist distributor a few years ago, but Mr. Irwin's performance deserves a proper DVD treatment with a restored version of the original performance and interviews with artists / producers as well as more examples <br /> <br /> Bill Irwin's talent deserves more exposure to the general public than in his limited release appearances. I share "The Regard of Flight" with friends quite often and although I am always greeted with a bit of skepticism when I mention it is a mixture of antics and vaudeville, I have yet to see anyone come to see it without loving it. . In the case of the powers that happen in this IMDb listing, please consider releasing this and other works by Bill Irwin.
