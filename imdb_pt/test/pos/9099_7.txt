For those who love "Wayne's World" ... "The Blues Brothers" ... and hell, even "Raiders of the Lost Ark", you'll find much to like (but probably do not love) in "Tenacious D: The Pick ". of Destiny, "a fictional epic about the formation of the band JB (Jack Black) / KG (Kyle Gass). Two unemployed losers with a love of rock n 'roll face a dilemma when KG's longtime mother stops sending him rent checks, JB and KG make tracks for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after a music shop clerk (an inspired Ben Stiller) tells about the head reed (a string of lively tapestry gives the past). Along the way, our zeros are faced with a strange dent (a Tim Robbins game), Sasquatch, stoner security guards, fraternities, and Satan himself (Dave Grohl ironically) in a climax sequence that has to be seen to be believed (and preferably played in high volume.) Rarely do I watch comedies in the theater, but "Pick" is an extremely nice change of pace ... may not reach 11, but it sounds a crude and clever melody for a good 90 minutes And the songs are inspired. in low-level hilarity. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10
