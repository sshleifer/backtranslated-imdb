It will soon be 10 years since this movie was released .... still makes me laugh .... If you like this movie, try the new Hera Pheri .... it's so hilarious. And my favorite piece of the movie must be when Salman realizes that he has no more bullets in the gun while he has the upper hand and has everyone at the point of the gun ... and he really says it out loud !!! U just want to beat him .... but you know you can only do this if you stop laughing !!!! Fantastic movie .... 10/10
