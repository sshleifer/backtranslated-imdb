A distressing masterpiece on the sheer madness and despair of war, Fires on the Plain (Nobi) will not please everyone: this is a war movie in the truest possible sense of the term, which does not even use the waving flag . patriotism or saccharine sentimentalism. Nobi cuts deep, is ugly, dark and gloomy as few things ever committed on celluloid ever will be. This is the war behind the cannons, without triumphs or heroes, without moral victories or defeats, only a handful of thin, terrible-looking men scattered across a land ravaged by war as penitents fleeing a great disaster. The characters defy moral judgment because they are creatures besieged by a great misfortune, a misfortune that does not allow questions of a moral nature. War and survival. Putting the will of one against the other in a battlefield arena. The loser is simply removed from existence. Tamura, a soldier in the Japanese imperial army, is dismissed from his platoon and ordered to report to a nearby hospital on account of him coughing up blood and not liking the rest. of the platoon. He said never to return and instead commit suicide by hand grenade if the hospital rejects him. What are you doing. The hospital is nothing more than a shack made of wooden planks and the hospital surgeon simply tells him that if he can walk, that's fine. It's in that shabby hospital excuse that one of the film's most agonizing scenes occurs. As the area is bombarded by American planes, doctors and those who can walk and support themselves flee from the hospital to the forest. Moments before the hospital is torn to pieces, the thin, crippled figures of the sick and wounded crawl out of it in all sorts of postures, dressed in their sick white robes, as if the building were some kind of animal vomiting guts and dirt on the land. <br /> <br /> This is Nobi's biggest hit; the blatant and meditative representation of the suffering of war in simple yet evocative images, without melodrama or pseudo-heroism. Soldiers cross a swamp, cross the mud to their knees, cross the opposite bank and enter a field only to discover enemy tanks hidden in the forest, with lights shining like evil eyes as they examine the darkness. A procession of wounded, dirty, and half-crazy soldiers, crossing a road, falling to the ground to the sound of enemy planes. Vultures celebrating on a pile of corpses. An abandoned village. A mad soldier who believes himself to be Buddha seated under a tree, covered in flies and his own excrement, offering his arm to be eaten by Tamura when he is dead. These are the images that Kon Ichikawa conjures up for our eyes, ruthless and inflexible in their pungency, but honest and crude. <br /> <br /> Nobi does not rush to get anywhere. He is content to follow Tamura's travels through the war-ravaged land as he attempts to reach the Palompa regrouping center and observe the madness and obscenities of war. The film traverses the slime of the horror of war, slow and monotonous, as well as the characters that follows. The final thirty minutes with Tamura taking refuge with two deserters who feed on "monkey meat" are the closest that Nobi gets to adhere to conventional narratives and are no less powerful in that regard. Surprisingly photographed in black and white, with great cast performances, and Ichikawa's confident direction, Nobi is not only among the best war films to be made but also among the best in Japanese cinema.
