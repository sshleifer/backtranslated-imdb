Even for science fiction, this movie is a movie that is a little out there. Okay, more than a little ... My first thought after watching was that I had just lost my mind. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie waiting for another Darko. Darko fans will never like another Richard Kelly movie because of their weird cult patterns. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it. <br /> <br /> Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'deeper meaning' of the first time you watch them. To be honest, I had to watch The Box twice before liking it. <br /> <br /> The deeper meaning (to spare you from a psychological sociological side) Humans are selfish, we make decisions that can destroy our lives and we do not open e-mails without the sender's address. Scary old summary tells Cammeron Diaz if you push the button I'll kill someone you do not know and give him a million dollars. Of course she pushes and as promised by the scary old man gets a case of money. Then the movie plunges into the unusual. To spare my fingers from typing ... By pressing the button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings in an experiment designed to gauge the morality of the human race. <br /> <br /> I liked: The disposition of the film to ignore the generic guidelines of the film. Is different. It's intense. It has a deeper meaning (though its material philosophy). Lets you guess. IT'S NOT A Hollywood FINAL! <br /> <br /> I did not like it: Why would some being with the technology to inhibit another way of life create such a ridiculous scheme? What god as a foreigner has the patience for it? Diaz was good, but was there a need for the country's accent? They live in Virginia. <br /> <br /> I give 7 because Kelly did not pay as much attention to detail as in her other films. Good overall movie.
