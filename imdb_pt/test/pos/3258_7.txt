"Two Hands" is a hilarious Australian gangster movie in Sydney. I bet the tourists never imagine that Sidney and Bondi look like this movie: all bodies sweaty, night oppressive and gangsters with nylon shorts and jandals. Heath Ledger plays an amateur boxer with an eye on becoming part of the local King's Cross boss gang. He looked quite magnificent in his green wife beater and blue-print budgie smuggler. A sweaty tattooed body becomes him. I've always knocked him down like a "Home & Away" kid, and he's in that soap, which is a bit sweaty than the insipid Neighbors of Weetbix. The film really pays off for its combination of sardonic humor and unpleasant violence - the drowning scene should give me nightmares soon. Totty Awards: Country girl love interest brother city and streetkid tattooed.
