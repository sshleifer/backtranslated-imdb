Several weeks ago I lost my beloved companion and friend of fourteen, a golden retriever named Sasha. When I got home from the animal hospital, alone, after making one of the most painful decisions of my life, my teenage daughter sat next to me. . and we talked about this episode of the Twilight Zone. I may be wrong, but I remember a line that Arthur Hunnicutt said, when Satan was trying to fool him into hell, but his dog could not go with him. . and his dog, in turn, snarled defiantly at the doorman who was trying to trick the old hunter into "coming in." . that it would be "hell from heaven if dogs were not allowed," and the spirit of the old mountain man and his dog decided to walk away from the gate (of what they thought to be paradise, to wander alone for eternity). What a tearful moment when they meet a "good old" field boy "on that eternal path, only to find that he is an angel, sent to meet them, and" certain neighbor, of course dogs are allowed in heaven. " <br /> <br /> I will confess that I cried while I talked about this with my daughter as we mourned the death of our dear gold. <br /> <br /> Rod Serling was indeed a genius, a voice who in the early sixties spoke against racism, hatred , "know-nothingism", and was a profound inspiration for me to become a writer. This episode, over forty-five years, conveyed a message of comfort to all of us who have lost a dear friend. a copy of the next time there is one of the Twilight Zone marathons or buy it.There will be some tears, but comfort as well.As always, thanks Rod, for everything you've taught us ... even now.
