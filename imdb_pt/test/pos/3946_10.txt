The weakness of this comes from the confused narrative, tangles arising out of nowhere. But that did not really matter, because I still liked that. Once you truly accept that the movies are not taken so seriously, you will like it even more. It's basically a love story, confusing at first, but as it evolves, it's really worth something. Of course it has been done so many times before, but the complicated version of it is quite inspiring and touching. <br /> <br /> The over-the-top fantasy and cgi was overwhelming at first, but I still liked its purpose. And people stopped complaining about how he borrowed from other movies !! Guess what we know !! And that does not really matter because his goal was humor and entertaining. Sometimes people have to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start screaming. Comparing this to Hollywood standards is totally stupid and ignorant. It's a totally different style and target audience. As far as I'm concerned, some of the best films I've ever set eyes on are producers and directors from the East. There is its 4 police story, Shaolin football, kung fu races, dragon tiger gate, legend fist, hero, crouched tiger, etc ... I like one like this movie and haling from the Philippines, USA, England, Libya and now Australia, I will always be interested in these types of movies. Now try and judge my perception, but I warn you that I see things from the point of view of those 5 countries in which I lived. So you better be so experienced and open-minded.
