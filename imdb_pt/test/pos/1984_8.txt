ATTENTION: PLOT SPOILER <br /> <br /> The ever-abnormal films of David Cronenberg are certainly an acquired taste. Fans of his previous films will probably like 'eXistenZ', but it's definitely not one for scruples. All the usual elements are here. A game capsule made of skin (hooked on his back), buckets of blood, a bone gun and a manic mechanic, to name just a few. The result is good in parts, bad in parts, and simply odd in others. But one thing the film has is undeniably originality. <br /> <br /> Despite the excessive use of ?? strangeness, this proves that virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people. In the movie, a character kills someone by saying that he was "boring" (assuming she was still in the game). But it leaves the question of whether this really happened or whether it was an occurrence in this incredibly realistic game. "eXistenZ" leads to a conclusion that can be answered in several ways. <br /> <br /> Despite some extra gadgets and gook, it was simply his classic 'Was it all a dream ?? or was' twist. It's a smart surprise and answers a few questions, but saying that the whole movie is leading to this moment is a little disappointing. With only 97 minutes, it could have been a little longer as well. In a peculiar way, the film raises moral questions, but responds in a violent and inadequate way. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here in her first major role in a long time. But your character does not have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a nice character. Jude Law, on the other hand (equipped with a curious American accent) is good as your average Joe sucked into this abnormal world. We see the film through its perspective. <br /> <br /> `eXistenZ 'is far from flawless, but it certainly is a cinematographic experience to be remembered. There are tons of weird features to match the similar styles of David Lynch (what comes next? - be consumed by a question mark?!?!?!). Definitely not to everyone's taste, but it is gratifying enough to recommend. My rating:
