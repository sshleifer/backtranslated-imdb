On the way to a country house to hear a new play being read, a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright get stuck in the mud. They arrive at a nearby house and end up at the playwright's fiance's house. If you can not guess that murder and disorder are about to happen then you are not paying attention. <br /> <br /> This is a good entry into the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny liners wandering through it. The cast is excellent and they are more than willing to have a good time with what is good stuff. <br /> <br /> I would love to say that this is one of the best of the genre, it should have been, but for me something happened on the way that made me lower the rating to only seven out of ten. I can not tell you what it is, it's not right anyway. Maybe it was the feeling that I knew where I was going from the beginning, or maybe it was something else, I'm not sure what, but there was something I could not shake that made me like this movie, even though I wanted to love it. . He just stopped being great and somehow fell short. <br /> <br /> That being said, I suggest you see it. After all, it's a very witty movie, which entertains fully, though it just failed to be great.
