I have this film with my BBC Jane Austen Collection (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and I did not like it at first. It is completely different from the others and lacks, at least I thought so, one of the qualities I like in all the other Austen films: cheerful good sense. The nightmarish scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sewed her fingers was especially disturbing. <br /> <br /> I still do not like to watch the sewing scene, but I love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamy. As she sews: "My only known ... ripped my dress." This movie is now my current favorite in Austen. I watched 7 or 8 times so far. The acting, in my opinion, is incredible. The way I notice a good performance is when I see myself looking up at what I'm doing (sewing, although not my fingers together, hopefully, or boondoggling or whatever) in order to watch the character deliver his lines. It's the turn of the expression, the cast of posture, that makes words come to life - it's what makes a good performance, as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Well, I watch almost every part of "Northanger Abbey" because almost all the actors play their roles with such charisma. Peter Firth is amazing as Mr. Tilney, the perfect blend of Bathian Fop and true male hero - you're not sure until the end whether he's after Catherine's money or not. I love his touch of the accent (Welsh?). Mr. and Mrs. Richards are charming: The combination of their behaviors-especially Mr. Richards's loud voice, lending counterpoint to their intelligence and wisdom-makes them so real. General Tilney, as the hard-hearted father who can be a killer, is also fascinating. And Captain Tilney, the smiling old man who is so clearly enjoying himself-and the sister and brother who work with money, whose names I can not remember at the moment-the two are so perfect, both smart and clever . <br /> <br /> The other reason I love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all Jane Austen adaptations. I know this was one of Austen's weaknesses (well, it's all about me): although all her novels are love stories, it's hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end. And if they're not really in love, then what's the point? All the other adaptations I've seen (apart from Olivier / Garson's first) have cold fish kisses at the end if they kiss. I do not like sex in movies, but it is necessary to have a sincere kiss in the end. And the final kiss in Northanger is a challenge. <br /> <br /> The over-the-top approach to costumes, music and lighting works just as well, as far as I'm concerned. And the script is extremely clever - the way we are educated about the Gothic novel, the high age in Bath, the normal creation of Cathy, etc., is very well done, as is often the case in BBC productions. Besides, I like the part where the little black page makes the wagons. And the Marchionesse, I think, was an entirely appropriate and very intelligent expository device. <br /> <br /> Some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what Jane Austen intended to do at Northanger Abbey - she intended to make Fun Gothic romance, not promote it. But I do not think she wanted to put "Mysteries of Udolpho", etc. She was just making the point that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction. And this point is made when Mr. Tilney berates Catherine in her mother's room. Besides, General Tilney was a villain, though prosaic. That point should be made, for sure.
