My brother left me addicted to Carlin in the '70s. I've always loved his observational humor. That is, looking at everyday things and finding humor, how to ask the question, "Have you tried throwing away an old trash can?" You can not do that! They keep bringing it back to you! " And ask questions like why the word kill is more acceptable than the word "F", while it makes sense to the mayor with the discussion. <br /> <br /> However, during the 90's his material was less funny and more angry. What he seemed to be doing was holding a mirror to the face of society and saying "take a look!" At this point, their shows were less of a comedy show, and more of a complaining session. But in all fairness he always made a tremendous amount of sense. He really made you think. <br /> <br /> Here was Carlin old and new. It starts about the fun that could have gotten old and then crashing the state of the world. Again, making perfect sense. <br /> <br /> This was his best since "Jammin 'in New York", and how it turns out to be the last. <br /> I think 'The Shootist' went to John Wayne, or 'A Prairie Home Companion' to Robert Altman, 'It's Bad For Ya' is for George Carlin. A fond farewell to a true great icon. Love him or hate him, I think he will be remembered.
