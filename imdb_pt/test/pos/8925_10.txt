I'm a pretty white gay man of 55 years. As I do not watch TV, I watch at least 250 movies a year, mostly on DVD. I make notes on every movie I see and rate them. Since December 2003, I have seen only five movies up to eighteen. So I rated eighteen better than at least 700 other recent movies. Mr. Bell is too modest in his comments at the movies. Eighteen is a great movie. And it also resulted in two "first" for me. I watched the movie for the first time and was fascinated for the last half hour, something that only happened to me three times before. (Five minutes into the movie I knew it was going to be very good.) When Jason started reciting Whitman, I lost, and then ... The Kiss. Well, this is one of Film's big kisses, and that scene between Filmdom's most pungent and unforgettable scene. When Pip puts out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I applauded. I applauded. I love happy endings. I cried. <br /> <br /> So I watched the TLA previews and trailer and thought, "Okay, is that $ 800,000 or more Indie really great?" So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that only happened three times before. And eighteen burst my socks one more time, more so. So I watched the documentary "The Making of EIGHTEEN" and was completely delighted with the cast and Mr. Bell. <br /> <br /> So, I thought about watching the EIGHTEEN again with the Director's Commentary. I've never watched a movie three times in one night. After the third time, at three in the morning, I learned that I had just experienced a Great Movie; Eighteen now occupies the 10th place in my Top Twenty Films of all time. And in the small universe of a great gay film or gay subtext, we have Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive and Maurice. Thank you, Mr. Bell! Eighteen is brilliant and totally accomplished, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully poignant and unobtrusive score, excellent cinematography, a fun, moving, wholly appropriate and humble music. I can continue but I will not gush much more. <br /> <br /> This movie should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture. The performances, without exception, were wonderful. Gill's lovely, sensual voice was a startling epiphany. And Sir Ian McKellen? Nuf said. Eighteen years is the reason I go through over 200 mediocre movies to extremely horrendous (some in the $ 150 million range) a year, to find that treasure, that exquisite, magical, unique and enchanting, perfect "egg Faberg√©" involving an unforgettable heart. <br /> <br /> Finally (I promise), my second "first" - I had never posted any commentary on any movies I've seen. Thanks again, Mr. Richard Bell! Breathtaking genius. Give this man 100 million dollars for your next movie! He made $ 700,000 in one of the top 50 films of all time. If I had money, I'd give him $ 75,000 a year to cover the expenses and match the funds raised for the next movie. Mr. Bell is already a great director at age 31. Can you imagine him at 45 years old? <br /> <br /> Sage and witty, tender and brutal, balanced, moving, discreet but daring, creepy and thrilling, mesmerizing, astounding, unforgettable: EIGHTEEN, A MASTERS.
