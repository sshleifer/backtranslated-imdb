If you have already been, have a friend, or a child who is or was to skate at the same time, then watch this movie!. I've seen it several times and get something new every time I see it. It reminded me why I started skating first (a long time ago). It reminded me of what skating brings to a person and I discovered that it will also help a person who does not understand why skaters, well, skate. Of course there is a very dark side to the whole seen, that the film touches lightly. But it tends to focus more on what's in the center of the skating. Just a person on a board, doing this because they love doing it. This movie was so inspirational to me that I'm now skating once again (I'm 32 years old) and I have not been so happy with myself in years ?? .. Give a gift, you will not be disappointed.
