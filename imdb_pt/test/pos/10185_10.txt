The three-part series ended last night on PBS, which I believe is its first major exposure to an American audience. The richness of its text and the unique quality of its filming are high points. It seems very new to see and hear a piece of action employing the vernacular of Georgian England, with Jane Austen's cinemas being the prime example of this form of discourse. However, it is the scope of drama to overload the senses that makes the singular language fit perfectly into each scene. This daring exposure to an old reality is evocative of literary giants like Tolstoy or Shakespeare, while entertaining in the manner of a maritime saga of C. S. Forester or Patrick O'Brian. The universality of the basic human condition is at the center. <br /> <br /> Narrator Talbot played by an actor with the almost perfectly appropriate name of Benedict Cumberbatch (certainly not even Dickens managed to beat this!) Alternates between indigestible jingoism. and extreme vulnerability, an active tour de force. In fact, I can not remember among this very good cast any misstep of interpretation. This is a tribute not only to the actors themselves, but also to the director. <br /> <br /> The most impressive element, however, is how life aboard a man of war en route to Australia in the early 1800s is presented. This is especially true in how the movement of the ship becomes almost a character in itself, something that sea stories rarely take into account except as a backdrop. Anyone who has ever experienced the evil de mer personally will instantly recognize it, and will appreciate even more how hard it must have been to re-create in the context of filming. <br /> <br /> This is not a fanciful Pirates of the Caribbean. . Some effort should be spent on understanding their nuances.
