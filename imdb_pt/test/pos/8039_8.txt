Christian Duguay directed this little spy thriller early in his career. He plays on TV fairly regularly, albeit with some incredible scenes of violence and sex sadly trimmed. I finally got to see the theatrical version on a $ 3 tape from the local video store. Marine officer Aidan Quinn is recruited to represent the notorious Carlos the Jackal and gets a little involved with the role. Donald Sutherland Ben Kingsley plays Quinn's superiors, with Sutherland a true fanatic and Kingsley as the most balanced. The first half of this entertaining movie shows Quinn being trained and indoctrinated. The second half puts him on the field, making love to the Jackal's wife and shooting with several enemies. The idea is to make the Jackal look like a turncoat to the Russians, and let them take care of the most notorious killer in the world. Things do not happen exactly as planned. Sometimes I almost expect the cast to come out laughing at some of the tacky dialogues, but they're all very straightforward. In the end, this is a great suspense that deserves your attention. The ex-lover of the Jackal teaching the very proper and very married Quinn to torment her, lick the blood from her face and then fall on her, alone, is worth the price of admission.
