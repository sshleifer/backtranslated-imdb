When I first saw "Before Night Falls," Javier Bardem had just been nominated for an Oscar. I thought "he has!" He did not do that. I watched "Sea Inside" last night. Please give it to him this time ... This is an actor. Convincing, touching, emotional, brilliant. See also "Los Lunes al Sol" and you'll understand what I'm talking about. He is an absolute chameleon and I swear it is not just the result of makeup work. This movie is so beautiful, so well done, the characters are so real. Congratulations to Alejandro Amen√°bar (what about an appointment as Best Director?). I also have to mention the makeup artists. I can not think of another word, but magnificent. I really hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves. As far as I'm concerned, it already has ...
