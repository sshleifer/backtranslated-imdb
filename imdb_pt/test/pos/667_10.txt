Anyone who has ever put that criticism as "in bad taste" is not always there ... it's so funny, cool and fantastic that you can watch until your eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he's done in the rest of the series ... everything is as good as Morris's standards. If you think it's "awful," "nasty," or "sick," then I can only think of one thing to say to you, "go to hell." thank you. had to be said! I think the way so many people complained was a complete joke ... I would like to make a shout out to all the people who actually did this: "Do not you have anything better to do with your time? What are you trying prove? "Thanks for reading my heartfelt comment on the subject ... Congratulations
