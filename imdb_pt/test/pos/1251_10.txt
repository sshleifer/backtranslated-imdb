It's so good to see Bruce Willis come down from his throne and let us see that he really is a talented actor. He shines in this film as the almost 40-year-old image consultant who has totally lost contact with his inner child - until he meets him face-to-face. This is one of those rare movies that does not talk to the public and really offers something for the whole family. It's about taking care of each other, keeping a little of the child inside you and realizing that you do not grow exactly the way you thought. Willis seems to be building an impressive track record of working with kids (just watch "The Sixth Sense" with Haley Joel Osment), and he has great chemistry with Spencer Breslin here. There is good photography and music, and the ending is wonderful and uplifting. A great movie to watch with all members of your family.
