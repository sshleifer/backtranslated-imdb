This is one of the most underrated movies of Bruce in my opinion, its an amazing thrilling movie with a clean story and an amazing performance by Bruce Willis !. All the characters are great, and I thought Willis and Spencer Breslin were great together, and Bruce Willis is just amazing at it! This is definitely one of Bruce 's best comedy performances (The waaaaaaaaaamabance thing was great) and I thought it was very well written and did well, plus the ending is especially cool!. It's very nice and cool as you can see the character change of Russell (Willis) throughout the film! plus the end was very good. I think this must be larger than 6.0 and it's one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen! Plus, there are many amazing moments everywhere. All the characters are extremely nice, and also has a pretty cute love angle story that well, plus Bruce and Spencer Breslin both had some really funny lines (Holy Smokes!). This is one of Bruce's most underrated movies in my opinion, its an awesome thrilling movie with a clean story and an amazing performance by Bruce Willis and I say a must see !. The direction is great!. Jon Turteltaub does a great job here with great camera work, and just keeping the movie at a very fast pace. The acting is excellent! Bruce Willis is amazing as always and it's amazing here, he gives one of his best comedic performances, it's hilarious they had a wonderful chemistry with both Spencer Breslin and Emily Mortimer, had some funny lines, and was dead on all through the movie, he went one of the main reasons I liked both of this movie! (Rules of Willis !!!!!!!) Spencer Breslin is fantastic as the younger version of Russell, he was very funny and did not get on my nerves once, he is one of the best actors of the child out there! Emily Mortimer is good as Amy and was really cute I liked her, she had decent chemistry with Bruce too. Lily Tomlin is funny as Janet, I liked her a little. Jean Smart is good with what he had to do, which was not much. The rest of the cast is good. General not to be missed! **** out pf 5
