almost 4 years after the events of 911, if asked what comes to mind that day, most people would probably comment on such things as the sight of falling planes and the collapse of twin towers, the number of people being killed, acts of terrorism and heroism, etc. all who were alive at the time will never forget that day. however, for most of us, the memories, while on the move, are not on a personal level. now comes an extraordinary film that gives everyone who has not lost a friend or family member a chance to get involved on a personal level in just what we lost in 911. This is a movie that needs to be seen.
