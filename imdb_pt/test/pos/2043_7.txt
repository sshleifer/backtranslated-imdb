I was happy to find out that at least now this movie is starting to get the appreciation it deserves (just see those votes). No first-class action like "Die Hard" or "Lethal Weapon", but still something like a solid 7 out of 10: good script, good actors with chemistry work and a director who knows what he wants (unfortunately this was director O Harlin's latest good movie, "Deep Blue Sea," managed to get to "a good roller coaster ride," but "Cutthroat Island, and especially," Driven "are well-deserved failures!) Personally I think the turn-off The box office may have been the "woman as an action star" - well, give her a chance, because Davis does a performance above normal. And, after all, this movie does not focus so much on the "female". "side-by-side, but in good deed, buddyism (Jackson as a helper gets a lot of space here, plus his share of action- and about a thousand murderous kiddies!) and in the plot (by Shane Black, the writer of" Lethal Weapon "and" The Last Boy Scout. "The last of which as a movie is on many levels much like this ... the theme, the enred the smart, also as good as underrated!) Overall: if anyone has not yet seen this, be sure to rent it for the next quiet Saturday night!
