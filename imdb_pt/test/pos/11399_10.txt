One of the things I like about PT Anderson is that he has the guts to take the talent that most people pushes aside or pushed aside and makes them stars. Case in point, a failure ... Burt Reynolds delivers a great performance in this film. And if you prove that Adam Sander could be a great actor (Punch Drunk Love) was not enough ... here comes Mark Whalburg ... like you've never seen before. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of people go through. "Boogie Nights" because they are anti-porn, or just flat out hate the adult industry and can not ignore this aspect of this movie. But below that is a great story about characters losing everything and struggling to recover. There's a beautiful movie ... and it's a pity many people see it.
