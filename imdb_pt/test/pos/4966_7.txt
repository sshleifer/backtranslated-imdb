I wish I had known Ida Lupino. When people ask who you are, if you could have 6 extraordinary people from the 20th century for dinner, well, for me a person would be her. I think she is now one of the great personalities unknown and undisclosed in the film industry. His life story would make a great TV movie (Hey, Mr Bogdanovich ........). Ida Lupino has been the driving force in many fascinating noir films of the 1940s and 1950s. I remember being saddened to see her reduced to a horrible role in a horrifying AIP movie that is the late 1970s. bitten by a large worm in the kitchen sink. Ugh I should have contacted her when she died, not too long after ... more on the part of the worm as well. From High Sierra, Roadhouse and the extraordinary RKO thriller On Dangerous Ground, Ida Lupino was often the lead producer and actress. Later, with her husband Howard Duff, they produced many now timeless noir dramas that are still very engaging today. One of them is JENNIFER, which I think is the last copyrighted movie by Monogram Pictures. Monogram formally changed the company name to Allied Artists in 1953 and JENNIFER has both company names in the opening credits. This is a top haunted house thriller equally as scary as The Innocents and The Haunting did 8 years later. Really creepy and scary, this tiny movie is exactly the kind of really good movie that Ida Lupino did and was responsible for. Try and find ... you will always remember this and how I feel, much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress / producer.
