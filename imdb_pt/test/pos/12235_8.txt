I can not argue with other comments that the story line focuses more on the romance between the characters of Mary Martin and Allan Jones, much like "Showboat", than in the life of Victor Herbert. But in the 1930s, would this have been a box office draw? Instead of the Life of VH, perhaps it should have been the Music of VH. There is plenty of it. <br /> <br /> For me, the excitement of the film came close to the end of the film when Susanna Foster sings "Land of Romance". It's been more than a decade since I got this movie for the second time at a local "old movie" theater. At first the audience was stunned; then exploded into spontaneous applause. I remember the shivers rising and falling down my spine. My trivia recollection recalled the information provided to an inquiring audience by a local journalist when the film first appeared in the late 1930s. "This note reached by Miss Foster was far above C." She may not have had four octaves to Yma Sumac, but the teen then certainly had a reach!
