I've seen this movie about 50 times and it does not look like I'm going to get bored with it. I always watch with my best friend and it has become a tradition for us to watch almost every month. every time we see this movie, we get really excited and laugh and we cry in front of the TV together and we sing all the songs out loud and in the end we always dance. Now we pretty much know the whole heart dialogue and watching the movie feels like seeing our own old friends on TV. <br /> <br /> this movie is perfect! Even though I have to admit that the story itself is a bit extravagant, but the characters, the dance, the music and even the place where everything happens, make you forget all that and you begin to believe that things like that really happen and that the song "all you need is love" actually has some kind of meaning. <br /> <br /> I'm a normal person and I'm not very serious about this comment, but I just can not wait until next time we can see Dirty Dancing.
