This is the second film about 1985, the other was "The Wedding Singer". While the 'Wedding Singer' was portraying the pop side of the '80s,' Rock Star 'is all about metal. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band to some famous rock act of the time and Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend. When your fixation rewards you, your whole life changes in one day. <br /> <br /> The story is not very dramatic and just scratches the surface of the life of a rock star. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it's full of Rock'n Roll! The music is fantastic and the concerts are conducted brilliantly! The whole concert feel is very well captured, since they used real audiences (no cgi here). Great direction and a brilliant performance of Marky Mark, who acts like a true metal face! <br /> <br /> 'Rock Star' is all about fun and if you had anything to do with the old metal scene, you'll love this movie! <br /> <br />
