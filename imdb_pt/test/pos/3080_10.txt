I thought this movie was awesome and I laughed so hard I had to see it twice to get the pieces I lost while I leaned holding onto my stomach! The reviewer who reviewed this movie for this site challenged anyone with an IQ about shoe size to find this movie funny, well my IQ is about 135 ... I challenge that person to question me and then eat their own words! This movie is brilliant and if the critic above were not such a boring idiot, he could smile for the first time in his life and take things as lightly as they are made. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers were so imaginative! EVERYONE, when watching any movie about that period of time, will notice the men in pantyhose and realize how different it is to today's costume and how fun we would find today's male population if they wore tight fittings every day! The idea of ​​devoting a song to butch men dancing in pants was as fresh as someone can not laugh !!! (In addition, seeing hip-hop rappers doing ballet is always hysterical - as a dancer too, I did ballet and hip hop and danced with men who had to do both ... I still shiver every time !!!) /> <br /> I love this movie, if someone has not yet seen, do not listen to the critic above ... watch and decide for yourself !!!
