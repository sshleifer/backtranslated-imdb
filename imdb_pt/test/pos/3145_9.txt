I saw this last night at the 7th Annual Film Festival in New York - a rather tumultuous place that has settled for this sweet and touching film of two women. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two - one, older and older. blind, the other, a twenty-something person who helps her with her correspondence - is cleverly established, and her depth is readily apparent. <br /> <br /> There are no automobile pursuits, explosions or mind-boggling special effects. - just the sometimes difficult, but rewarding, task of humans approaching to help and be helped. <br /> <br /> See if you can!
