The movie 'Nightbreed' is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. Overall, I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but there is something about this movie that is more atmospheric and unlike any other horror movie I have ever seen. Many horror movies I've seen that I enjoyed watching, however, as they are based on horror, I know the stories are unrealistic, as they are fictional so I can not take them all seriously. Nightbeed, on the other hand, is a unique horror genre as it has a sense of realism that I've seen in many other horror films. <br /> <br /> This movie story about how a man is murdered and ends up living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would have of a dreamy nightmare , since it is a very original and original plot. Most of the horror movies I've seen are all fake, but as Nightbreed was incredibly sophisticated and brilliantly directed with superb acting, especially by Craig Sheffer (Aaron Boone) incredible special effects, great lighting and fantastic dialogues, I found this movie with a sense of depth and maturity without any parody of silly terror that many other horror films have. Nightbreed, besides being horror, has elements of suspense, romance and action, all beaten into one. If you have not watched this movie yet, I recommend that you watch it, as I rate it 10/10.
