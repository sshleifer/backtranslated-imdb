This movie is great. Best acting I've ever seen in my life. Ingvar E Sigurðsson is the best Icelandic actor and, of course, Hilmir Snær and Bjorn jörundur. Great music and sound. Hard and cold reality about the struggle of a man who has many problems and the people in his life. Black humor mixed with great acting and this style of European art films, works, comes together in one of the best Icelandic films of all time. I tell you, "Watch this movie, you will not regret it." I gave it 9 stars. If you see an Icelandic movie in your life ... See this here
