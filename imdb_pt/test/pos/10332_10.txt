This film is a piece of study for my English class, but its depth and meaning surprised me. Since we are looking closely at all the facts and characters of this film, its interesting tale of love, hate, war and prejudice. Well Recommended! <br /> <br /> Story: A girl named Patty Bergen finds a fugitive prisoner of war, she then hides him in her house of spectacles in her huge gardens, and when they get to know each other, they begin to see the qualities of the others and win each other's love. Patty's father despises her and treats her like dirt. Anton (the prisoner of war) almost blows his disguise to protect her, but Patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone.
