THE AFTERNOON SHIFT was an interesting achievement for the HBO movie that took a detailed look at the ensuing power struggle between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. This fight is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who do not know the story and are aware of where Letterman is now, it may be interesting to know that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as the host of THE TONIGHT SHOW more than Anything But Letterman discovered that his dreams were being diverted, as Leno had one of Hollywood's most powerful agents, Helen Kushnick, in his corner and working tirelessly to get his client's job. It is not often that we see behind-the-scenes Hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment, but for fans of these nightly superstars, this film provided a fascinating insight into a very turbulent period on late-night television. According to this film, Letterman was pretty much promised the job by Carson himself, while NBC promised the job to Leno and that's where Helen Kushnick came in. The film features Leno as a milquetoast that allowed his career to be manipulated by Kushnick and feigned. Ignorance of some of Helen's manipulations of some of NBC's greatest power players and features Letterman as a savvy and experienced businessman who, despite having Carson's support, was barred by NBC and Kushnick. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck credibly recreate Letterman and Leno respectively, but it is the clear performance of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Helen Kushnick who keeps this film bubbly. Bates commands the screen in one of his best, if not as well known, performances as the venomous Hollywood agent who eats executives at television studios for breakfast. There is also a wonderful twist of Impressionist Rich Little like Johnny Carson, but it is mostly a fascinating story and Bates' performance that makes it worth checking out.
