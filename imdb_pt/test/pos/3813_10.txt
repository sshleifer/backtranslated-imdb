Obviously, the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this is done very well. <br /> <br /> He's very funny, intelligent and somber. This story brought back memories of the kinds of girls I loved as a child. <br /> <br /> In addition, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other films, many comments about how hot she is on youtube. In this video. <br /> <br /> Of course there is some Burton influence here, but I would not say that Brad is trying to fool you. <br /> <br /> He's just jumping up and adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate. I like what he does and he does well, nuff said!
