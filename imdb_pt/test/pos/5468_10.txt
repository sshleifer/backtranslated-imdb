I have not seen it since 1998 and yet I can not get it out of my head or stop recommending people to find it so it shows the impression it caused. <br /> <br /> Just a wonderful story. <I just hope to see the ladder at least once in person ... I did not know much about Mr. Petersen before this movie, because I had not seen any of his previous works, but his subtle acting in this impressed me and I think his Grissom's interpretation in CSI just shows more of it. He knows enough to let the character shine instead of the actor shine, which makes him a lot better than an actor. <br /> <br /> I can not remember enough about the "bad accents" to comment on, but I must say that I always liked Barbara Hershey in all of her roles as well and I thought she also did a job phenomenal in this movie.
