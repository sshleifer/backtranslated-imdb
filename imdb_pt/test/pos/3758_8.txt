What a surprise. A basic imitator of the classic comedy 'The Nutty Professor' is just plain cheekier. The funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is frankly hilarious as retentive anal Dr. Jekyll and the crazed sex of Hyde. <br /> <br /> The only really funny scene is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says, "How dare you take it advantage of my innocent daughter. "<br /> <br /> Jekyll replies," But sir, I'm moving forward with the operation. "<br /> <br /> Lanyon responds back," Oh well, in that case fu * * your brains out !!!
