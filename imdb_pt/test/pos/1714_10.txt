For those with access to the BBC or CBC, this proved to be spectacular. Like Battlestar Gallactica, this is a rebuilt show from scratch. But in the case of Dr Who, they saved the best parts. I can not believe I'm saying this, but .. this is by far the best Dr Who. This has none of the cheap production values ​​and sometimes slowness of the old show. The acting is very good and there is a real sense of continuity and history. The new Doctor is easily equal to that of the great Tom Baker, and the writer (former leader of QAF) seems to have made even the smallest characters come to life. <br /> <br /> I know ... I'm gushing. .but that should be on every geeks sci-fi list. I just do not know why you did not get here ... Whatever you do ... if you ever loved Dr Who or science fiction ... check it out !!!
