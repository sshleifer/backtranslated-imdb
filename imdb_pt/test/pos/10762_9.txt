A bright and sensitive film with interlaced wefts. As a general warning, the film gets quite dark in the middle of the road. As sudden as it is, this is a change that I found appropriate for the themes of the film, particularly the comparison of the Ishkanani with the filthy rich, and (as Finn says at the end) how each person makes up the tribe. and how the whole tribe is reflected in each person. <br /> <br /> Anton Yelchin (Finn Earl) is spectacular in this film. He is probably best known as Star Trek Chekov or Kyle Reese in The Terminator, but he has been in a multitude of movies you've probably never heard of (Alpha Dog, which is another brilliant performance from Yelchin House of D, Hearts in Atlantis, to name a few ...) The point is that this kid really takes this movie and makes it his own. Other excellent performances by Diane Lane and Donald Sutherland are what drives this movie to a level, from excellent to excellent.
