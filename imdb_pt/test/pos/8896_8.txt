As much as I hate to disagree with the original poster, I found the Asterix and the Vikings very good, and a big step up from previous attempts to cheer up everyone's favorite Gaul. <br /> <br /> For someone who is not familiar with the famous comic book. series, the show would be difficult to follow, but for those of us in the know, it is a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> First, the animation is far superior to previous comic book adaptations. You can tell that they took the time and effort to really regain the look of the comics this time around. As mentioned, there are elements of other Asterix titles in the film and I can see how fans of these titles may seem confused or a bit disappointed but I was so caught up in actually seeing one of my comic books childhood favorites faithfully represented on the screen, any fears I had were minor in comparison. Small spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> Asterix and his faithful friend Obelix travel north to rescue the nephew of the chief of his village, who was captured by the Vikings. The Vikings think that for the boy teaching them about fear, they will be able to fly, thanks to some ill-formulated advice from the druid of their village. In the process, the boy knows the daughter of the Viking Chief, Abba, and they fall in love, etc etc etc ... If my explanation sounds complicated, do not worry ... The plot is easy to follow! Definitely a great buy .. You can buy this DVD through Amazon France, but be warned .. Your DVD player probably will not be able to play it. I had to change the region setting on my computer to view it ..
