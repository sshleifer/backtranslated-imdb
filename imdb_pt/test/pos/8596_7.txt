I've never read a novel by Jacqueline Susann, but I've also seen Valley of the Dolls, based on another of her books. On both occasions I thought the film is probably better than the book and will improve with age (certainly contrary to the books). The reason is that a film focuses more on a specific style of fashion, design and patterns of behavior. And in this aspect the Love Machine offers a lot. The design of the setting fits perfectly into the story. And all the characters fit together too. They are perfect in the way they complete a well balanced overall picture. They are superficial and do not develop, it's true, but in this film I would not want it to be any different. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings reprises the role he played in Antonioni's Blow Up. And it's more than a rip off. He is a fashion photographer, looks visibly aged and seems to start to go a bit towards the seed. Robert Ryan reprises the role he played in Max Oph√ºl's Caught, he is Smith Ohlrig once again, greedy, bored and boring, uninspired and uninspired. It is possible that Ryan did not want to be in this picture and act accordingly; on the other hand, he could have thought much about his part and then given a carefully studied performance. What happened, that fits the picture. Dyan Cannon is great (fantastic wardrobe!), She dominates all the scenes in which she is and is involved in the two highlights of the film: the burning of a luxurious bed and the overthrow of the character Hemmings with an Oscar statuette. <BR> <BR> The title, The Love Machine, of course, means ironically. Robin Stone is a kind of Barry Lyndon of the pop era (incidentally, the film is a bit kubrickysh). That he chooses a TV station to get to the top seems to be a mere coincidence. He sees love (meaning sexual favors) only as a means to personal progress. There are quite scary signs of a troubled sexuality that is not explored in the film. Homosexuality is handled very casually, probably not the standard for the mayors' films of the period. The open cynicism of TV executives need not fear comparison with other good films on the subject, such as A Face in the Crowd or Network or Truman Show. They are producing crap, they agree with each other that it sucks and they know they are going to make a lot of dough out of it. <br /> <br /> I do not regret spending the odd 108 minutes with this movie and would not be surprised if he got a following cult, provided the chance is given (ie a DVD release).
