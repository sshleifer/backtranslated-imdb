This is easily one of the best films of the 1950s. Otto Preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them. Frank Sinatra gives his best performance and Elmer Bernstein's score is dynamite. From the opening titles (from Saul Bass) to the hysteria of drug addict Frank, the cold turkey, this is a fascinating movie! With Kim Novak (giving very good performance), Eleanor Parker (giving a very poor performance) as well as Darren McGavin as the reptilian pusher and Arnold Stang as Frank's friend. Beware of bad impressions: this movie is in the public domain, so some copies are quite difficult.
