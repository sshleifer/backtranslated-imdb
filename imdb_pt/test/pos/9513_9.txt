As a show, it's hard to blame Nihon Chinbotsu. The Japanese people have benefited from their intimate relationship with the sea, and the concept of the film implies that a whole world and a way of life at risk - thanks to its volcanic heritage. From the point of view of reality, it is a little silly to have a drama in which the whole of Japan disappears under the waves; Why only Japan? <br /> <br /> So let's assume we have the reality of cinema, fueled by the show (and the popcorn), and some may find this quite affectionate. Compared to adventures with Japanese radioactive monsters, this seems more mature and better stimulated. The emotional element is underestimated and really works. (It gets lost a bit with the exaggerated theme song at the climax, though.) Is Nihon Chinbotsu Credible? Probably not, but the exciting eruptions and relaxed pace provide more enjoyable entertainment than a night stands.
