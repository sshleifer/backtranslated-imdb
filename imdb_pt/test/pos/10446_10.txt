"The Last American Virgin" along with "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" is one of the last great teen films ever made. It is a tender tale of envy and unrequited love set in the early eighties. Much criticized by critics that it was a trivial attempt to recreate the magic of the "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," these same critics do not acknowledge that the two films were filmed at the same time in late 1981 and released only at short intervals. one from the other. In any case, studios would never allow such a bold and uncompromising portrayal of the issues with which many male adolescents are confronted when they reach their sexual maturity. Especially considering the poignant discovery the protagonist, Gary is confronted with in the end. American pie that is not. The story revolves around a trio of male adolescents, and their mostly unsuccessful sexual activities. Gary is the least successful of the group, hence the slogan LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN. Secretly, Gary covets Karen, who is involved with Rick, his best friend. Rick and Karen start having sex, and Karen gets pregnant, only to be dismissed by Rick, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility that is before him. Gary slips into Karen's aid, which leads to the unexpected conclusion mentioned above. Overall, as a movie, I think it was a comedy hit, such as a commentary on the sexual dilemmas of young men, and a remarkable tale about age, which deals with issues like envy, unrequited love and abortion, which are so relevant as today as they were more than twenty years ago. In addition, there is one of the most rock songs ever made !!!
