It's very easy to find out why The New Professionals was a failure, at least in New Zealand: not only followed in the footsteps of the original, it followed the Bodyguards, who outperformed the show considerably with their boss-and two-agent formula. Commander McIntyre was a late-day George Cowley: tough on his team, but someone who would defend them to death against others. The shadow that the show did was enormous. <br /> <br /> Well, not as big as it should have been in the UK. Here, I was networking in prime time. It was even marketed in the promotions as "They are the professionals". Someone obviously noticed the difference. We were lucky not to have this show released in different regions at different times. <br /> <br /> It was the high production values ​​that sealed the deal for me. As other reviewers have noted, it followed the great British one-hour actioner tradition, but mixed personal elements at the same time. There is a slight tendency for something to develop between Liz and Ian, though this has never distracted the person from the actual plot. Most episodes were based on inflammatory diplomatic incidents, the kind of thing that helps Spooks to appear from time to time. <br /> <br /> Unlike many 2000s shows, the plot was not sacrificed at the cost of extravagant photographs or more. Stylish steering. Directors like Christopher Young kept up the pace and did their job. They made use of good places, making bodyguards thinner than if they had been thrown on back roads and alleys. It was contemporary, today would be fine, and it was one of the best examples of British action in 90 years, showing that the UK can still do better than any other. <br /> <br /> Maybe except for the Germans and their Cobra 11.
