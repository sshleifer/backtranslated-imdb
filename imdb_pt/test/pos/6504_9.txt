Wonderfully funny, inspiring feature of the turntablism pioneers. DJ Shadow and Q-Bert are amazing in this fantastic documentary. Take a look at almost every top DJ, crediting their success, thanks to Herbie Hancock's classic Rockit, and archive footage of some of the most complex turntable routines of all time.
