* Minor Spoiler * Inhabited is not scary, but it is scary. It's an interesting 'little' story with good acting and great special effects makeup. <br /> <br /> Basic storyline: A little girl blames the strange things that happen in the new home of her family and accompany the theater of her fairy friends. <br /> <br /> The movie wasted no time, but the end could have been more involved. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to those who expect / want hardcore horror, but I recommend it to those who want a chiller and not necessarily a thriller.
