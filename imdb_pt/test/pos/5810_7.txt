Hammer House of Horror: Witching Time is set in rural England on the Woodstock farm where stressed-out musician David Winter (Jon Finch) lives with his wife actress Mary (Prunella Gee) and is currently writing the song for a horror film. One night, while looking for his dog Billy David meets a mysterious woman in his barn, calling himself Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn), she claims to be a witch that has transported 300 years in the past for now. Obviously a little skeptical, David has a hard time believing her, so he locks her in a room on her farm and calls her doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) to examine her, however, once he arrives and they enter the room Lucinda disappeared. Charles tells David that he drinks too much, but in the next few days strange and disturbing things begin to happen to David and Mary ... Witching Time was episode 1 of the short-lived British horror anthology. produced by Hammer Studios for TV and originally screened in the UK in September 1980, the first of two Hammer House of Horror episodes to be directed by Don Leaver (episode 13 The Mark of Satan being the other) I really enjoyed it. As a series Hammer House of Horror dealt with several different themes and were all disconnected from each other except on behalf of and unsurprisingly watch time is a sinister and effective tale about a witch, Anthony Read's script benefits from little 50 minutes of odd duration and moves at a good pace. The character is very good as is the dialogue, there are some cool scenes here and I liked the way it never reveals if David and Mary are going crazy or not. I think it's a well structured, fun and reasonably scary horror TV show that I enjoyed more than I thought. <br /> <br /> Being made for British TV meant that the Hammer boys had a lower budget than normal. if that were possible, and as such there are no dazzling scenes here, as in his best-known films of Frankenstein and Dracula, although the contemporary English scene gives you a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a bit more. Another restriction based on TV is that the levels of exploitation are lower than you might expect, there is some nudity and nullity, but not much, although I did not care much, since the story here is very good. It's well done for what it is ... Hammer's experience in his films has probably helped to make it look very good, the acting is also good with the favorite genre Ian McCulloch making a small appearance. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a good start to the Hammer House of Horror series, as a 50 minute piece of British TV is very good, now why do not they do more shows like that here?
