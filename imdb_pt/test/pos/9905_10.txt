It was a rare pleasure to see "Check Out". I was touched by the characters, I laughed a lot of the wonderful script and was deeply moved by the genuine emotions magnificently portrayed by this cast and especially by Peter Falk. In fact, one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children, where he tells of his life experience, his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his future life is so profoundly real that it is at the highest level. level of the best Oscar-winning performances. He is an accomplished actor who excelled in this film. The writer offers a combination of literary knowledge, timing, a gift for dialogue and hilarious situations that made me laugh out loud in the theater. I highly recommend "Checking Out" to everyone who wants to enjoy superbly acted quality stories.
