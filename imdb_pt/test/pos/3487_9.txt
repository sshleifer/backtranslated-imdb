A very giallo de suspense of the director of "L'Anticristo" (1974), this one begins with a brilliantly treated sequence involving a priest, a girl and a broken doll. However, the main story is about maniacal (David Warbeck) a traumatized cripple to kill her for his money. The plot, although not original, is really suspenseful, the acting is good and there are several skilful and bloody murders. The score by Francesco de Massi is quite effective, some of which can also be heard in "The New York Ripper" by Lucio Fulci (1982). Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!
