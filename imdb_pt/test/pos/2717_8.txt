Our family and friends really liked this movie. The subject was well treated by the director with great performances of Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances of the other cast. The climax was built well, but to the end, it was far from being called "good." Are we still trying to understand what the director was trying to convey? Did they have few ideas or was the end beyond the understanding of ordinary movie lovers? A better ending would create a lasting impression on the audience and increase the number of visitors. However, this should not take away the credit that is due to Konkana and Shabana Azmi for relating so well to the characters!
