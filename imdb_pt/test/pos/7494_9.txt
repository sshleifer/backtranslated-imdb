It's a very good movie, with some amazing twists, a good cast and a great script. Just a few stupid snippets, like the Rasta scene (this guy is a pro?), But that has already been commented on. The fact that I heard only one guy at work mention this before, and did not have many opinions or comments to continue, made it even more fun. This has a higher score than maybe some people think it deserves, but I have to take into account the low budget and the good effort of the cast. It makes me angry that some films are made whose budget is equal to the GDP of a small country, with a sensational release, good reviews, an Oscar-winning director and / or actors, and end up being so disappointing, with actors sleeping in their roles. and an uninspired direction with predictable story lines and a story with such huge holes that Sandra Bullock could drive a busload of bombs through her. (Examples in my opinion are The Terminal, Castaway, Matrix: Revolutions) Extra points are awarded to the wardrobe department choosing great clothes for the cast, especially Paulina Porizcova, who wears a rubber dress in a scene, and a jacket with nt "on the back in big letters on another! A sex scene that shows her tight ass and a good soundtrack are added bonuses! And PLEASE, enough with Tarantino's comparisons, this did not remind me of a movie of Tarantino in everything .... and Tarantino lends virtually every idea he has ever had of other movies! Even if that is your opinion, we are saying that once a certain film or book is written or directed in a way, no one Can you use the same ideas again?
