I was "hooked" to this movie by my flight instructor and now I wonder how the hell it was out there for almost five years before I finally figured it out. If you have some love of flying, especially an attachment to World War II planes, this is an absolute must see, far superior to the pathetic "Pearl Harbor" and up there in rivalry with the famous "Battle of Britain" filmed more than thirty years ago. There are times when you feel like you're flying wingman, literally dodging the cartridges of your leader while you enter the Me 109 or He 111. As a historian, this film touched me deeply, is about the situation faced by tens of thousands of Polish, Hungarian, Slovak and Czech Welshmen who in 1939-1940 fled their homelands, arrived in England, fought with the utmost bravery for the survival of Western civilization, and then were abandoned Inhumans by "us" after the war, when they were arrested by the Communists when they returned to their native lands. I stayed at the top of Monte Cassino in Italy and I was taken to tears by the cemetery by the Polish troops who invaded that mountain that the British and Americans could not take. I also traveled to Prague (the most beautiful of cities) and studied its history. Your story of abandonment, I believe, ought to be a lesson to us even today about the obligations to allied gallants. <br /> <br /> But back to the movie. If you love to fly, see that. If you are interested in the WWII aircraft, definitely see. Undoubtedly, the most brutal, direct and terribly fast air combat scenes ever played for the movies. And yes, if you're still looking for a touching novel, there's this too in bleak detail. Bill Forstchen Professor of History Co-owner of a replica of World War II "warbird" P-51 Mustang "Gloria Ann"
