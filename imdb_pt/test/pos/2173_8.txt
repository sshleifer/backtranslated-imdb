Colonel Chabert is one of the best adaptations of the novel for the screen I saw in the movies. It combines the realism of French cinema with an excellent characterization, from Depardieu's lost Chabert to Fabrice Luchini's proud lawyer and to the complex widow of Fanny Ardant. The film has a wonderful dimension, as you would expect from a director of photography like Yves Angelo. The characters keep this movie going and although a bit slow at first, they gain pace and are a good movie when they come to an end.
