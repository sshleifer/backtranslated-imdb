The history of pre-unified China should be popular. The hero of Jet Li made the assassination of the popular king. <br /> <br /> This is another story made a few years earlier. He stars the incredibly beautiful Li Gon (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2046, Miami Vice) as the king's mistress, who was sent to recruit a murderer so the king could defeat him. She recruits Fengyi Zhang, but falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> No matter, he is not able to complete the mission anyway, as the king knew about it beforehand. I suspected he knew it too, but that was the way it was. <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful story with massive military operations and of course another chance to see Li Gong.
