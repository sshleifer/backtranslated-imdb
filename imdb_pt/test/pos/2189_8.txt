Well, I'm not the biggest fan of Sondheim in the world, so even though I have the cast album and I have listened a few times I've never seen this show and I have not seen the Tim Burton movie version either. I felt I wanted to see something more faithful before seeing the Burton and giving it a shot like a movie. This version is not a film, it's a play filmed with some of the original members of the cast, including Angela Lansbury's most important performance as Nellie Lovett. This is one of those performances that is like a channel to the heart of Broadway magic and the theater itself. She must have had so much fun with this role. Sweeney Todd himself is not portrayed by Len Cariou, who did it originally, but by George Hearn. Hearn does a fantastic job; his voice is not as good as Cariou's, but he seems to be a bit broader. <br /> <br /> The only problem I really had was with Johanna's character played by Betsy Joslyn, and to some extent her lover Anthony, played by Cris Groenendaal. Joslyn's voice can not hold high notes, but I was not sure if that was perhaps the point, since I'm not very familiar with this play. Most importantly, I'm not sure if the story of "Sweeney Todd" really has enough weight to sustain part of the song, but fortunately the whole thing does not seem to have been taken very seriously by its creators. As a joke and a bit of comedy in the vein of "Grand Guignol", it is quite pleasant. I do not feel it's such meaningful work as "Company" and "Into the Woods" or some of their other shows. Some of the songs are spectacular, but at other points it seems to exist in a world outside the show. <br /> <br /> I will not say much about it here, because it is a movie site and this is not really a movie, but only one piece that was filmed on film. There were maybe 3 or 4 scenes in which they moved the camera, but that was it. People will want to see this because it preserves the legendary performance of Lansbury, which deserves its legendary status, because it is a hilarious and insightful performance. George Hearn can be proud of his version of Sweeney as well. This would be a good movie to show children over 5 years old, so they would be interested in musicals because blood and cannibalism would really surprise them. Seeing a performance filmed so skilfully and so faithfully makes me wish that more efforts like this have been made over the years with musical theater because I prefer shows from the 1920s to the 1950s for the later era's business. "Sweeney Todd" is an exceptional show of his era, however, miles and miles above the madness of Webber AL.
