Oh man, this movie is amazing, it's very good, it's a story about a man who is not so tolerant of black people, he sits in a bar and drinks on his night out and he talks about hippies who are anti-war, and as blacks and hippies do not deserve any welfare test. This movie is very realistic because it portrays a guy "Joe" who represented many faces at that time, and now also. The story goes like this .... Joe is in a bar and he rubs shoulders with a rich guy who accidentally killed his daughter's hippie boyfriend. And this rich man goes to the bar to rethink what he has just done, and while he is doing it, "Joe" is at the bar complaining about hippies and people who are against the war. The rich guy accidentally tells Joe that he killed a hippie; and obviously Joe applauds the rich guy because Joe hates hippies, Amazing movie see you to see what happens next. I liked this movie because it was reminiscent of those days in the early 70's, I liked the way the movies were filmed back then, very good stuff, not like the movies today. Basically, the film gives you an insight into the mind of the main character "Joe." I like the movie theme ....... about the hardworking man who is busting his ass trying to make a living
