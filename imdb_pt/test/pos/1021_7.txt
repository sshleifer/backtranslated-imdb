A pleasing film, no doubt, and very evocative of his time and that very particular stage in the 'rites of passage' of any boy. But I have to say that having read the very positive reviews here, I was a bit disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. The whole thing revolves around the most shocking miscasting in the history of the school plays. The idea that Quack Quack would be chosen to play not just one of three shifts, but a flirt, is laughable. And without that, nothing. The subframes had no relationship I could see with the main plot - they could all be removed in their entirety without affecting the main story at all - which certainly suggests a fundamental flaw. When all of your subplots look like fill, you know that a central idea is being stretched beyond its boundaries. However, it's a benign movie with heart in the right place, there are some great performances, and you get the feeling that everyone involved felt emptied in the last 'cut'! This good feeling permeates the film. And that has to count for something. A really good movie. 7 out of 10.
