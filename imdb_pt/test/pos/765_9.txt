I had heard about this movie, but I did not see it until my daughter, who saw on a flight to Australia, told me it was a great movie. I was interested to see if Rupert Grint, away from Harry Potter, was showing the promise you see in the Potter movies. I was not dissapointed. He became a great actor, showing a variety of driving lessons from a shy boy being slaughtered by an overweight obsessed mother to a young man who finds himself worthy of his own esteem and the other. Reviewing play lines and poetry with his aging employer, it's obvious he's ready to take on much more complex roles in movies and on stage. But the jewel in this movie was Julie Walters. I had seen her earlier in the Potter movies, Billy Elliott and Calendar Girls, and I loved her. In Driving Lessons, as she does lines of poetry and Shakespeare, I was struck by her timing, mastery of language and body language. I hope it was makeup, since she portrays an older woman with osteoporosis, although no mention is made in the film - as a nurse, I can tell she did it perfectly, portraying a woman on the brink of old age, she remembered the shimmering past she'd had fun with. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I would have liked to have seen it in a theater first - but I doubt it has played anywhere here in Albuquerque. We miss a lot of these kinds of movies here.
