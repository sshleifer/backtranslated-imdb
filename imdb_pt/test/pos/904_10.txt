Genius or total madness? That depends on your interpretation of this movie. I responded to this on the level of a self-conscious "cop-movie parody," and I sincerely hope that's the intention, since I do not see anyone taking it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd for one seems to be chewing the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things! Should this film mark a departure for Rudd from his core in the comedy genre? Some kind of insane attempt to reinvent it as a star of hard action? I think not! With the extravagant, almost awkward acting, the low budget FX and the amazing action sets, all evoked the old TV show "Sledge Hammer" for me! HILARIOUS!!! :-) <br /> <br /> Of course, I may have totally misinterpreted the film. If it was indeed an attempt at a 'straight' action movie, then it was certainly a fun flaw !! <br /> <br /> Watch with lots of alcohol and some friends !!! ;-)
