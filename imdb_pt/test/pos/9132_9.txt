I think Melville intended that this movie was the definition of legal; has the legal approach of the thrillers of the late 60s / early 70s - the same discreet quirk. LE CERCLE ROUGE, a bitter and fatalistic story, is also the playground of Delon, Bourvil, Volonté and Montand in the definition of roles. <br /> <br /> Bourvil is a policeman who has three cats in his apartment and a daily routine. Delon is a thug. Montand is a sick and bankrupt cop. Volonté plays a fugitive suspect. LE CERCLE ROUGE of course, far above an assault film; Does Melville use his techniques ?? long detailed descriptions without words of each step of the assault, etc. However, is this particular action drama far better than your other films ?? and it is very unlikely that they will be much better. The appearance of LE CERCLE ROUGE is very peculiar to Melville, very Melvilian. <br /> <br /> Delon was sharp and cold; Bourvil brings his craft, and Montand makes perhaps the best part of this film; your performance has an unexpected heat. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the characters are poorly sketched, are no more than strictly necessary, and are personae. Or masks; however, the portrait is inspired, economic, but suggestive. <br /> <br /> Another film that proves that Delon is a good actor; and the fact that he is not a genius does not imply that he should be dismissed as a fourth-rate actor. He is good, he can withstand the proximity of a Bourvil and Montand. <br /> <br /> Only ten years. before LE CERCLE ROUGE, Melville was doing in the late 1950s a boring and tasteless pastiche (starring himself) and after only a decade, here he is in top form with this incredible action drama. Stylistically, it's a success. Before seeing LE CERCLE ROUGE, I was not a fan of Melvillian; now I think I'm one. <br /> <br /> LE CERCLE ROUGE is a drama, that is, an action drama, one of the most demanding genres. Scores of Melville.
