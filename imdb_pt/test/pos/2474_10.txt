The most incredible movie I have ever seen. I did not read the schedule and I just stumbled into the movie by accident. I thought it was a real documentary and I felt bad about what I saw. I just discovered it was a movie after it was finished and I looked on the web for more information about the "punishment park" in the USA. It seemed incredibly real and it's easy to believe that this really happened in the US if you're from Europe. I must admit that I felt really anti-American after watching the movie and before discovering that it really did not happen this way.
