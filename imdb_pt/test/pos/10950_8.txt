Lotsa action, tacky love story, unexpected actors and great fun in general. The special effect is acceptable / decent, some of the fighting is kind of cool with some interesting acrobatic moves. The overall story is moving forward, and it's corny enough to keep you wondering when the inevitable will happen, although there is a bit of a twist (only a small one). The overall naivety of the film makes it quite extravagant at times. Pretty cute chicks too what more could you want. PS. If you're going to review a movie like this, try analyzing it in terms of the category in which the movie would fall (not necessarily where it should fall). that is, do not bomb good cheesy movies!
