Our reviewer from Toronto told you what you need to know about this movie (except that it needs to be edited - the manual technique is really old, very fast). I saw this movie last night in Menerbes, France - we are in the Luberon Valley, which is covered by vineyards and, of course, by wine producers. They were all there in the Salle de Polyvalente to show themselves crowded. Educated, patient, cool. Although my French is not sincere, I understood the essence of the film, but I noticed that the public loved the "old" terrorists interviewed - esp. the one of a communist village in Languedoc. He laughed a lot. This is unusual in France laughing out loud. There is no doubt that side of the globalization war of terror they are! Sm
