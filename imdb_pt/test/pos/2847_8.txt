Well, okay, maybe it's not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from the crime drama to the romantic comedy and back so quickly all the time that it looked like two different movies that played simultaneously and then came together again in the end. But they did it without problems, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) funny too. I almost threw up, but I think it's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a novelist. He has the ability to perform these super-dramatic soap scenes with just the right facial expressions and voice intonations. Her scenes with Betty look like something out of "Sleepless in Seattle" or some other romantic comedy like that. You almost forget that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are looking for Betty. Morgan Freeman's fascination with Betty was rather scary considering he could practically be his grandfather, but the scenes in which he is talking to his photograph are definitely worth a few laughs! Chris Rock's performance looks pretty wooden, but he has his moments. Renee Zellweger is as sweet as Betty, the kind waitress with her brutal, unfaithful husband who treats her like dirt. It's very unlikely she got a job in a hospital with no real credentials, but, hey, it's a movie, just go with it! Her roommate, Rosa, also shines, like a woman who cares about Betty but does not know how to deal with Betty's disease. And finally there is Crispin Glover. As a fan of it, I, of course, thought the film could have been funnier if it had participated more. No one else has the same acting style as Crispin, and the argument between Chris Rock, Crispin and the sheriff about the novel is hilarious. I think I'm saying I really liked this movie! If you can feel the stomach with blood, violence and lots of foul language, it is worth watching and will give you lots of laughs!
