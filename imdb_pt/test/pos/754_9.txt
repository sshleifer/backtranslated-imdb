If anyone puts together a compendium on modern American terror that really pays off to be salty, there will be an entrance to the ubiquitous exercise of SF Brownrigg in Asylum Horror. Every time I watch this movie, I am impressed by the complete economy of the film, from the compact and fully stand-alone storyline, with an intriguing start and a horrible ending, the eye-catching performances of what was essentially a group of non-professional professionals. actors, and a prevailing sense of dread and claustrophobia that effectively consumes the narrative with a certain inevitability that is even more terrifying because viewers know what is going on long before the hero [es], with the only question being when will they wake up and Smell the coffee? Filmed on a thrift budget in native Brownrigg Texas in an old manor house that serves as the setting for a private sanitarium, DO NOT LOOK AT THE DOOR Another intriguing turnaround in the good old Edgar Allan Poe on the prisoners who have taken possession of the asylum just before a "normal" stranger inadvertently enters the ranks without realizing it until it is too late that everything is not as it seems, they are totally isolated and beyond any outside help, and inevitably find their own sanity questioned when madness gets out of control - The original TV series STAR TREK was thrilled with its episode WHOM GODS DESTROY of 1968, Juan Moctezuma gave In the process, a peyote fed a Mexican psychedelic trip in DR. TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON in 1972, and tangentially related is the ASYLUM EROTICS / SLAUGHTER HOTEL by Fernando Di Leo, which injects the elements of an unknown killer and an ending that can only be defined as "Cinema Splatter" - Brownrigg may not have seen or thought of SLAUGHTER HOTEL, but he certainly had some similar ideas. <br /> <br /> Former Playboy Bunny Rosie Holotik plays the role of Charlotte Beale, Clinical Psychology Nurse, who has just left her good job as a supervisor in a large clinic. A hospital to travel to the middle of some abandoned and wasted god in a Peckinpah movie to work with a Dr. Stevens in his private sanitarium. Dr. Stevens pioneered a new form of therapy based primarily on encouraging the emotionally and psychologically challenged to face their inner obsessions, bring them to the surface, and hopefully rid patients of anything that has fried their sense of reasoning. Good idea, but arm a completely crazy man with an ax and tell him to assault his assault AND THEN BACK BACK, probably not the smartest idea, and Dr. Stevens is dispatched before Holotik even shows up <br /> < This event leaves the sanatorium effectively in the hands of a Geraldine Masters [actress Annabelle Weenick, who also acted as script supervisor and production manager], a surprisingly professional woman of behavior who quickly defuses the situation with the help of Sam, the marvelously unlikely hero of the movie, an African-American lobotomized booboy played by an actor named Bill McGhee who was sadly stolen from an Oscar nomination in turn as a muscle mass with the brain of an 8-year-old boy. Sam's only wish is for someone to help him put his award-winning toy boat "in the water," and his continued request to cast members [and their uninterrupted consumption of chocolate popsicles] as * ANY * kind of underlying theme, although we avoid this here, because children can still be awake. There is also a quick subplot about a staff member who has decided to quit after being threatened by one of the patients, but I will leave the details of that to his discovery. <br /> <br /> Holotik arrives exactly when Dr. Stevens has been effectively laid to rest and is quickly conquered by Mrs. Masters' arduous professionalism, who reluctantly allows the cute young nurse to stand up despite the tragedy that has just occurred happen, oh, TWENTY MINUTES AUG, you must admit it was pretty sporting her. Nurse Beale from Holotik begins to show symptoms of not being the sharpest cleaver in the drawer, however, when informed that she shares rooms with a lot of maniacs and there are no locks on the doors and do not crawl to the nearest Ace hardware to get a latch and a padlock to protect ourselves, and we are presented with some truly scary scenes where some of the fangs come into your room and do things like smell your hair, try to kill it with butcher knives and caress her neck with ax heads. But that's all part of working in such a radical psychiatric health setting, Mrs. Master informs her, and she follows her strangely defined "rounds" which consist of wearing a leg setting a nurse outfit as you can find on a street 42 boutique fetish and meet the prisoners. <br /> <br /> Allysson is an obsessive compulsive nymphomaniac with homicidal tendencies who likes to take off his shirt and provide the film with a bit of T & A between hits of histrionics; Harriet is a young ex-mother who let her son die in a stupid accident and now adores an old beat up doll that she also protects homicidal; Seargant is a real investigator (and the implicit Vietnam veterinarian) whose neglect led to the death of his platoon, and now watches from the window with binoculars the approach of an invisible enemy; Jennifer is a Phish fan who failed to score a New Year's Eve ticket and went crazy and likes to lower nembutols and other barbituates when no one is looking, and also hid homicidal tendencies linked to her inability to find a bra; Judge Cameron is apparently a homicidal pervert who has become obsessed with his own sense of power and now likes to cut things with axes; Callingham is an old poet who serves as a sort of old MACBETH witch before the cat catches the tongue; and Danny is an insane idiot who has been cast as the random element that the plot can not control, and who is weird serves as the real catalyst for the series of tragedies and murders that finally take place in this dark, middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> The house itself is a wonderful setting with a beat up decor from the early 70's which is notable for its lack of credibility with a fantastic use of the color obtained by the subtle ambient lighting. The house is a series of corridors and rooms with bright brown wood floors, sinuous and confined stairs, secret closets and passages leading to different larger areas, and of course the basement mentioned in the title - visited only once but certainly proof be a doozy! I love the matte freezer where Sam keeps his popsicle stock, the completely simple exteriors that remind me of a summer home our family used to visit every year and forces us to sweat in the heat: everyone is covered in pearls of insight and appearance exhausted, and even the ever cheerful Sam at one point begins to suspect that bad things are happening even though he can not understand what that means and Rosie H. is very firm in her belief of her profession even to suspect what really and while the limitations of a Holotik actress may have diminished the effectiveness of her Apocalypse scene, she is a big screamer when all of Hell begins to loosen up, and Brownrigg indulges in some photos of her in various suggestive poses or stages of nude show what beautiful woman she is without exposing anything more than her stipulated contract. Too bad! <br /> <br /> The real thief program is Sam, however, and fans of what I've been taught to refer to as Splatter Cinema will not be disappointed by the shocking ending, and there's something moving as Sam rushes to the protecting his friend and brutally kills everyone within reach of the arms in a matter of seconds that either suggests he was an evil mover before his lobotomy, or the movie is CUT. In any case, you will not be ready for the end the first time you see it, even though you, as a viewer, know what the score is before anyone else in the movie has put it all together. <br /> <br /> Except for one person: old prostitute Rhea MacAdams, Mrs. Callingham [who seems inspired by the Donald Sutherland Old Woman character from Michael Reeves's 1964 film, Christopher Lee, CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD, plus a rather unpleasant death around the eyes, which not only predicts the future, but also has the movie more fun than talking on a walk in the garden with Holotik, who commands something like that - It's really beautiful out here. Are you out a lot, Mrs. Callingham? " asks Holotik, to which the old woman responds. "It is YOU who needs to leave." <br /> <br /> Hilarious, and one of those things that you have to see for yourself "get it". DO NOT LOOK AT THE BASEMENT is available in at least half a dozen DVD releases encoded by companies such as Brentwood Home Video, Diamond Entertainment, VCI and HORROR CLASSICS series from Platinum Disc Corp; I kind of liked the sexually gorgeous release of $ 6 Alpha Video in 2003: <br /> <br /> Go through those bargain boxes! But make sure you get one with the 89/90 minute print contained in it; an older version of 83 minutes is frankly confusing due to some of the cuts, and you really need to see the final credits as intended to bring that unhealthy, distorted and surprisingly entertaining yarn to the end. <br /> <br /> Masterpiece? It may not be compared to THE EXORCIST or ROSEMARY'S BABY, but it's a very uniquely American horror film, and a genuine drive-in era classic that deserves to be rediscovered by anyone looking for something more than just a little bit of the brain. juice, not a penny more than absolutely necessary. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 out of ****
