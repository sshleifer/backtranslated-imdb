Another story of "good overcoming evil", but with a difference. This includes learning self-discipline. When Julie goes with her teacher to a Zen monastery, she learns about herself. She also honers her karate skills. <br /> <br /> When Zen monks visit the city, some awkward and comical moments happen. It's not noisy, but it's fun anyway. <br /> <br /> The next Karate Kid has a lot to say about looking inside and improving what's there - plus using what you have.
