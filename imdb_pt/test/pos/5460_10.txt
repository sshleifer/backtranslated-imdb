Despite being a film made by HBO, it is a nice film and a fascinating look at the world of television that straddles and reads from behind. Allowing the viewer to peek behind the so-called talk show wars in the early 1990s when Jay Leno and David Letterman competed for the coveted Tonight Show host. Kathy Bates gives a brave performance as Leno's mercenary manager, Helen Kushnick, and one can empathize with what Leno / Letterman suffered at the hands of TV executives. It is so timely now, considering recent events involving ABC's failed attempt to replace Nightline with Letterman. No matter how many times I've seen this movie, I still find it a pleasure to watch as much as when it first aired. If it were released on DVD, I would certainly add it to my collection.
