As a non-theist, I will not comment on the theory of the great men who changed the world 150 years ago. It is safe to say that science is evidence-based, religion is based on blind faith. Nuff said there then. <br /> <br /> The film was produced by the BBC and, to be honest, could easily have been shown on television. While the acting is superb, the film itself is not really worthy of a full movie release. That said, if you reach a wider audience in this way, then so be it. But I've seen a lot of period style dramas on BBC TV and they were fine up to the finished standard of that. Just do not expect too much from a great budget trip when you go see it. <br /> <br /> In a way, I found the movie almost coming out to apologize to religious fundamentalists. Despite a good sense of tension all the time, I could not stop wanting to get to The Origin Of Species publication much faster than it actually did (you'll wait until the end for that). And it seemed to live much longer than I was aware of Darwin's struggle with him and his wife Emma, ​​portraying him almost like some sort of insane lunatic at times - which is hardly true. There are many other errors and facts missing from the actual history of preparing for the publication of Origin as well, but the whole premise of the film focuses almost entirely on the difficulty that Darwin faced domestically with the book, and a small portion on the death of his beloved daughter Annie. This gives the film its most moving scene, where Annie dies when she asks one last time to listen to Darwin telling the story of a prisoner orangutan who died of pneumonia. However, you will probably feel a greater connection to the primate in this scene than to Darwin's daughter. <br /> <br /> With the initial controversy apparently involving the film in the US, this will work well to promote it and ensure many more people will be able to see it. But to be honest, there is really very little in it that insults any mythical Deity. It's hardly a headline on a theory that is about 150 years after all. But as the fundamental Christians (and many other religions we all know well) like to wave one or two posters whenever possible, I think this movie is as good as any. Personally, I can not see what all the fuss is about. But maybe they're just joking ...
