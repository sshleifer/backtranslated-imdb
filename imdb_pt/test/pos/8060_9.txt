This is a movie that every kid should see before they grow up and get distorted, often conveyed ideas from generation to generation of family. I grew up in two different places, though only 20 miles away. I went to school and had friends of all faiths and religions for the first 8 years of my life. So I moved to the country hickory (though not anymore), where it was very unusual to even have an African-American kid in his class. My high school graduation class had 2 or 3 African Americans (God, why can not I just say black? You can call me honky or whitey or something!) Back to the movie, try to see what happens when people have a distorted view or just what ignorance or lack of understanding does to a culture or a country! This is an excellent movie that everyone should see especially kids.
