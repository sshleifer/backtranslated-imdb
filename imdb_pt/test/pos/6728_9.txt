This movie has haunted me since I saw him when I was 8 years old. I did not know what it was called, so I'm so glad I finally tracked it down. I remember being very scared, because I had gone to a tin mine in Cornwall when I saw it, so I could imagine it all. Fortunately I did not see any ghost of dead children there, but I found this movie very disturbing and scary when I was much younger. I certainly never forgot that, even if I could not find it anywhere. I seem to remember that The Children's Film Foundation films are generally good, but they do not show them anymore. I also remember programs like The Children Of Green Knowe at the same time on the BBC - equally disturbing in their own way.
