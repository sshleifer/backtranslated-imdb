The film was certainly true to the real-life story on which it was based. It was difficult for me to find newspaper articles about the real facts, but when I located them, I could see that the truth, in this case, was stranger than fiction. Judith Light was terrifyingly evil in her role as the mother in this film, so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role, the mark I think of excellent performance. Rick Schroder was aptly ignorant as his son, who also defended her in court, an example of how difficult it may be in some circumstances for a child to accept a parent's actions, no matter how criminal they may be. One may find a flaw in the film, but not in the treatment of the reality on which it was based.
