Oh boy !!! my God !!!! what a movie !!! This is probably the best film by Sean Austin and Louis Gosset Jr !!! I've seen all the commentary for this movie ... and most of them love this movie a lot !! but I really do not understand why he only has 6.1 on the IMDb list ??? this one should be above 7.5 !!! the plot and the script are completely perfect !! the acting is superbly well acted !!! Sean Austin ... goes wheaton ... Louis gosset Jr .... they gave an amazing and incredible performance in his career !!! This movie contains a lot of action !!! <br /> <br /> Just one thing I have to say .... WATCH IT !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> 10 OFF 10 STARS !!
