If you're going to watch this movie because Michael Caine or Michael Gambon are in it, so do not bother, it's not your typical role, though I find Gambon fantastic. Instead, I watch it for Dylan Moran. I'm a fan of everything I've seen in and this is no exception, I did not even realize that he could act, but even the characters he has to go through as I found completely believable, which is impressive, considering the public knows they are fake. <br /> <br /> The plot is genius and although it is not constant laughs the whole way has many other charms. A great movie for people with a sense of humor.
