Chop Shop. Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart). Bahrani specializes in naturalistic-style studies of the types of people who go by every day, without anyone noticing they are there in New York. <br /> <br /> These are people who have been pushed to the edge of society. They exist in a kind of gray world, many of them migrants whose legal status in America is somewhat doubtful. Where are they from ? How did they get there? How do they deal? Where will they end up? These are not good stories like these, but stories about survival at their most basic, day to day level. <br /> <br /> Ale is one of those street kids. He has no education and struggles in any way he can, to save money, he too is not beyond a petty theft. Mostly he is looking forward to meeting with his older sister. We see him in the early scenes playing in a safe house looking for her but having no real success. A young friend, Carlos gets a job at a chop shop in the shadows of Shea's baseball stadium. Eventually, his older sister comes to live on the spot with him, but he is jealous of his friends' motives and suspicious of how she makes extra money. He dreams of buying a food van and setting up a sales business with his older sister. <br /> <br /> Bahrani records all his films on the spot. There is nothing shiny or covert about them. This is the life as these people have to live in the raw state. It's not beautiful, though it's never sinister, and the somewhat desperate air that hangs over much of the film is the same as hanging over their daily lives. <br /> <br /> The script is also very natural. and the characters get a lot of space and space to work. Polanco is excellent in the lead role, and Gonzalez gives solid support as the older sister.
