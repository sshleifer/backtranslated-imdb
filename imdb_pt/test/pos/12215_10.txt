Someone asked why it was canceled I tell you why "reality" makes money. the surface of the show was canceled so they could replace it with a reality show, this will haunt NBC, me and about half of my high school, about 1000 people promised to boycott NBC, until they bring that show back. in my area (I do not know about other places), but they had a big deal going on with the science fiction channel where the science fiction channel would show the episode last week at 7:00 and then NBC would show the new episode of week at 8:00 this was great because it gave you a little update on what happened in the last episode. I was so angry when I heard that the show was canceled and they were going to drop them on top of the church like that!
