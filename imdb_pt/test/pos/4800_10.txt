Nazarin is some kind of saint, he wants to live in life just as Christ taught man to do. But it is too late: now the Catholic Church is in the hands of a rich bourgeoisie, bishops live in luxury and do not give damn about the poor and the sick. That is why our hero can not follow the path that his hierarchy asks him to follow. Then he strips himself of everything and, on the way to purity, joins some sort of Mary Magdalene and a woman. who is attracted to him sexually (the scene between this girl and her fianc√© is revealing). In Spain (it was the late 50's) they thought Nazarin was a Christian movie! Knowing Luis Bunuel, it was absolutely incongruous: all his work is anticlerical. Comparing Nazarin and his "holy women" to Jesus is absurd. On the way to Nazarin, only bushes and couch grass grow. His attempt to help the workers on the road is a failure, he is pursued as a derangement All his words do not they give in nothing. At the end of the journey, he is arrested and offered a pi Neapple by a woman (Bunuelian sexual symbol). Thanks to "Nazarin", Bunuel was allowed to return to Spain (where the censors had no idea) and direct "Viridiana".
