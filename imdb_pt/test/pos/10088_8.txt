What can I say about this movie that will not give you any preconceived notion when you see it? Very little. The plot has to do with the return of a teenager's hospital after she broke it. What follows after that is the movie. It's one of the most chilling movies of the last few years. Everything about the film is just a bit off center and leaves you feeling a little uncomfortable well after the end of the movie. It's not a perfect movie. The movie has problems in its last half hour, which makes a story already confusing, even more confusing (if you have read any number of other comments here in IMDb and elsewhere, you will know that a lot of time has been spent trying to find out what really is going on) I'm not sure what I really think about this movie, other than the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in a way that the best-known horror movies ever had. If you like horror, and you do not mind not having everything clearly outlined, I suggest you try this as it is more than likely to tear your skin apart.
