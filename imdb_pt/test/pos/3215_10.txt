Wow!! I just have to say that this show is super cool! I fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of ​​the show is very original and very comforting! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance that the two lovely protagonists give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they are simply wonderful! I am especially a great admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a "monster" of an actress too! I'm not saying that Alexis is not a wonderful actress either ... I just like Lauren more! anyway it's a real pleasure to see them on the screen, "saving" with words! in the words of the immortal Jim Carrey "B-E-A-UTIFUL!"
