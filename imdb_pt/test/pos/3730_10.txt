Great movie. Post-apocalyptic movies kick. This is no exception. I kept pace and interest without a hint of dialogue (mainly through a good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also enjoyed the use of cave paintings and medieval weapons to show how primitive and wild mankind had become without its technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and the end was a bit vague, meaning I had difficulty understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence. In short, the character's progression, design, history without the cushion of dialogue, and more importantly, the ever-appreciated desolate scenario of a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
