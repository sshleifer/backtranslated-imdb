Excellent performance. There are still good actors out there! Also great direction and photography. Very loyal to Shakespeare, and a 'must' for all Shakespeare fans. Macbeth (Jason Connery) brought me to tears with his final monologue (out short candle, out) He gave the sphere of moral decadence and dark forces of a human face, which makes it more interesting. Helen Baxendale is a very credible woman, Macbeth, who can be very cheerful at times and sometimes she just looks like an evil girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. If you love death and decay, and the lyrics of Shakespears ... that's the one.
