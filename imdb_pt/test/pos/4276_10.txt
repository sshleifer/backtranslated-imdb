I just saw this movie and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it keeps its full attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good movie, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is unprepared for the ordeal he is about to begin, but he takes the subject in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor makes a presentation that makes you feel the anguish and the suffering of the character. Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she just has to take a quick look and you understand everything. I will not say it anymore because you'd better get into the story as it unfolds.
