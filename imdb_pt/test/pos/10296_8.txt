Forget about the recent and shocking American remake that sadly tarnished the reputation of the French original by virtue of the director's involvement in both. This is a romantic 90 year old with lots of quirks. It works best as a Gallic ode to Hitchcock's Rear Window because the notion of voyeurism is the constant theme that sets off the intricate script. The story is unbelievably fulfilled, like a Picasso painting, offering various perspectives on the same event and requiring the participation of the viewer everywhere. The settings, music and amazing score are wonderful as well as the excellent contributions of the cast. Watch more than once.
