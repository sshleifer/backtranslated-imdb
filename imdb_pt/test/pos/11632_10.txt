Barney is about "IMAGINATION" which you do not have if my preschooler never wanted to pretend like they do at that show, so I'd be worried. What 2 or 3 years old actually gets all that anyway is all about the colors and the singing. For those of you saying that all they do at Barney is to eat junk food and recommend Sesame Street better so on "monster cookie" that's all he eats, but I have not seen anyone comment on that one. I agree that sesame is a better educational program, but barney is like a show for fun, do not be too serious if you do not like your child watching TV and worried about them understanding things you do not believe, then you should not t be supporting them in front of the TV in the first place because all this is false, everything is false, actors are fake, so why do not you pick up your fake brains and put them to use and think if you have a problem with a fake TV show for the kids then turn it off and play with them and teach them what you want them to learn not BIG BIRD or BER & ERNIE or barney someone who used to watch all the shows and turned out well .
