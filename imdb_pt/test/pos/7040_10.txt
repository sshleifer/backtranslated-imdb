Meatballs is a classic comedy with so many laughs that it is impossible to count. <br /> <br /> In what was only a forerunner of what was to come, Murray rules the screen in what can only be described as a comic domain. Tripper Harrison is one of the greatest comedy characters in the last 50 years. Sarcastic all the time, smart when it has to be, stern when it needs to be, and caring when it suits him, Murray infuses Tripper with that SNL gleam in his eye. <br /> <br /> CITs are only admired as they shrink under the comic genius that is Mr. Murray. <br /> <br /> Summer is not summer without a display of meatballs. One of the best comedies to decorate the screen.
