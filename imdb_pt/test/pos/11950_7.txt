This is the continuation of the creation of Better Off Dead. In a competition, Better Off Dead would win hands. But for the power of the star, One Crazy Summer surpasses the best script of Savage Steve. Problems with One Crazy Summer (OCS): casting. Better Off Dead (BOD) was released much better. Friendship: OCS shows Cusack giving hateful looks to Bill Murray's little brother. Problems in the set ?? More scandalous friends in the OCS, but more genuine friends at BOD. The plot was good. You'll predict a little of it, but even the predictable parts go beyond what you think they could. So even if it's the ugly half-sister of Better Off Dead, it's worth a look. See Demi Moore before plastic surgery, if for no other reason. John Cusack fans, you have to see, just to say you have. If you do not like Bobcat Golthwaite, I'm sorry. I do not like him either, but you can not escape him in this. At least he does a great job on the film doing a homage to another movie monster. Editing the necessary help on the beach, but for the most part, there is not much to complain about. Overall, it's good and funny. But try not to compare it to the BOD or you will find it to be missing. *Sigh*
