Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett. <br /> <br /> Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems like a forgotten movie. That sounds a little ironic to me, because it's actually one of the first movies I remember. My mom took me and my younger brother to see this movie at The Garland Theater in Spokane, when it was first released in the mid-'70s, and I still remember it. <br /> <br /> I'm going through memory here, but I believe this move is about a hunter who was charged with a crime he did not commit and the law goes after him. I believe it's in Alaska in the 1800's. A narrator tells the story of the hunter played by Mike Mazurki. Really, this is a very good movie with a great scenario. It can be compared to the 1981 Death Hunt movie with Charles Bronson. The two films have a very similar plot. The main difference between the two is that Death Hunt is an adult-oriented film, while Challenge is a family movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both quite old when this movie was made, which I find quite impressive when you consider that this movie was filmed on location in Alaska. This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died, which was only a few years later. Both had been around since the age of silence.
