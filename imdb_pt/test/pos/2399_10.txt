Fred Carpenter screened Eddie Monroe at Boston College and, judging by the enthusiastic response, he has a lot to please. An Indy well taught and well done, impressive for its great looks and budget. This movie has it all: a tight script that grabs you and does not let go until the amazing end. This spectator did not see this coming! Great performances around. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were especially well chosen, giving strong performances. And congratulations to Frank Bongiorno and Alex Corrado for creating two detectives as engaging and interesting to watch as in any movie. I really liked this movie. This confirmed my belief that some of the best film work will come from the independents, and Fred Carpenter seems to be one of the best.
