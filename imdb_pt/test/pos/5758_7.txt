I've been looking for this movie for so long before I met it, I saw it when I was younger and I loved it, after my second show I still loved it and still do. <br /> <br /> a love / hate film, if you like background, young people, comics, then you will find this funny. If you do not like that kind of mood, do not bother. I love this movie and grew up with these comedy shows, for me this movie is simply putting your comic genius on the big screen .. Not a prize winner by any means but if you just want a good healthy slapstick then it is that ! <br /> <br /> The film does not have the quality of the TV series and this is usually the case with the movies but it still has enough material to keep you laughing even though many of the jokes are quite similar to your previous work < <br /> Yes, the humor is a bit childish and not for everyone, but sometimes you just need it in a movie.
