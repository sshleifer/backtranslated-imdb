Yes, I am a romantic species that likes musicals and comedy and this fits the bill! Julie Andrews gives a hypnotizing performance at the beginning and end of this movie with the production number of "Whistling in the Dark". The sedate to scandalous number she performs in the middle of the story, when she believes Rock Hudson has seen a program dancer / girl, is amazing and will surely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> I just wish this movie could be found on video or DVD, as I would certainly buy it in a heartbeat for my home library!
