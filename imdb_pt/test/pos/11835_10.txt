This delightful and well written film is based on a New York play with the same title in which Sir Aubrey (the knight Charles Aubrey Smith in 1944) originated the role he plays in the film. Here, in 1931, we see him in the first part of his rebirth in the first era of the talkies and the character role he would play for himself until his death in 1948, after finishing his last performance in Little Women, which he released in 1949. <br /> <br /> This engaging piece is about an elderly British aristocrat who locates his illegitimate children and introduces himself to them, having brought them to his mansion in England. <br /> Marion Davies plays her daughter by mistake and is a tour de force for her. She is both captivating, impatient, superficial, charming, wise and compassionate while creating an indelible and seductive character that remains well-guarded in the memory. <br /> <br /> Ray Milland, 26, appears here in a small but prominent role has appeared in seven other images then only in films for a little over two years. <br /> <br /> The film should be appreciated as a representative of the 1931 Hollywood factory production, of course, and as such is not flawless. However, it is a delightful pleasure from the first scene to the last.
