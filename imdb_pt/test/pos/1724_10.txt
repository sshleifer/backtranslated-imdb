I write this after seeing the last episode broadcast in the UK, and for me it must be a difficult task to keep the pattern. The last episode shown called "Blink" has elements of Gothic horror, all related to statues that are not exactly what they seem. The Doctor and Martha do not show up much, but that does not detract from a well-worked episode. The overall standard was built at a high level and the last three episodes, the two parters with "The Family" and the latest ones have been the best that the current team has ever done. <br /> <br /> It's not just David Tennant staying together, the whole week of support cast, week off is also helping. For those waiting for the series 3 abroad, the wait is worth it.
