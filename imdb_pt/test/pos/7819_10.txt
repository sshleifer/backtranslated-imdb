I loved this movie, it was cute and funny! Lauren Holly was wonderful, she is funny and very credible in her role. Mandylan back was also very good, nice look too! Brenda Vaccaro, as usual was a pleasure to watch, she did a great job with her character. It was a pleasure to watch a movie that is funny, interesting and can be seen by the whole family. It's hard to find good, healthy movies. Thank God for the Hallmark movies, they are wonderful! I wish I could buy it, if anyone knows where I could buy this movie, please let me know !! I bought several films from Hallmark and I'm very happy with them. I hope I can buy this !!
