When I started watching three episodes of this series on the Action Channel, I have to say that of all the shows I've seen that ADV has released, this is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again, and that's when I had my chance. I bought the entire box of this series at Best Buy for my 20th birthday. And I enjoyed it and saw more episodes that I missed on the Action Channel and the same 3 episodes I saw. My favorite characters in this show are: Sylvia, Leon and Nigel. The animation of this series was the best, and the hard suits were also cool. But the show also has a great voice like: Chris Patton, Jason Douglas, Christine Auten and Hillary Haag, and more. So if you like this show on Action Channel then you have to own it on DVD. It's the best and you'll see what I mean.
