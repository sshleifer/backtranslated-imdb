I was not expecting much because of the harsh comments and I continued to really enjoy the movie as a result. Softer colors and compositions less impressive than some of his earlier films, in my opinion, allowed the narrative to take center stage. Although religious conflict in a vampire movie was common, I felt that many of the other things were not. For example: <br /> <br /> how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her. <br /> <br /> the scenes of love very strong and well represented. <br /> <br /> The symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them further. <br /> <br /> Their strong differences from what it means to be 'vampire' created by their previous life experiences. <br /> <br /> The lack of dozens of other vampires appearing or being created through the movie. <br /> <br /> I've heard and read several things about 'tricks used in other movies'. Clear. However, I feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is going on in the scene and I feel that it does it well. I do not need a director to use new tricks. I prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately, which I feel is the case with this movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend it.
