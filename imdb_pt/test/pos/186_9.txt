This is a magnificent film and in many ways impressive. I saw on TV like a little boy, with my throat almost strangled by tears, and again today on the magnificently restored Criterion DVD. <br /> <br /> Cranes is the very essence of War Weepie. Imagine Cherbourg's umbrellas without music and no color, or waterloo bridge without class consciousness. Tatiana Samoilova, a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, is deeply influential as a beautiful girl whose boyfriend enlists and does not write or come back. <br /> <br /> The fiance, Boris, dies at the head and his death scene is indescribably romantic. Very bold too, because so close to "over the top". But this scene will stay with you. <br /> <br /> Although the Soviets were so defined by World War II, the film is rather nonspecific and more powerful for him. The pre-war and post-war scenes have a very 1957 feel. There is no attempt to detail the period. The whole film becomes more and more stylized, even the Siberian scenes, which look like a modern opera set (that's a compliment). The final cathartic scene is milked to the last drop - there again, comparable to Cherbourg. Production seems like a big budget (these staircase scenes must have cost a pretty kopek). <br /> <br /> Go ahead. Do not expect a bitter socialist pill (although it's obviously very sad). Cranes are Flying is an impressive slice of world cinema, quite advanced considering where and when it was made.
