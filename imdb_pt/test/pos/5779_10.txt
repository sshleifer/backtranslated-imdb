A good documentary reviewing the background behind our society's oil addiction, the problem regarding our current use of energy, and finally discusses the effects of the energy deficit resulting from the peak oil problem. <br /> <br /> This film should be educated to all students as part of their education. Show your children, parents, relatives and friends. They will thank you eventually. <br /> <br /> After reviewing the content of this documentary and comparing the sources mentioned, I would say that the facts of this film are well supported scientifically.
