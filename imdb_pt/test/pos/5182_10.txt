I saw FAREWELL TO HARRY at the Plaza Theater while in New York City and was quite taken. The performance of William Hall Jr. is huge. This is a movie for the classic movie goer. The direction of Garrett Bennett reminds me of the initial work of Barry Levinson and Robert Redford. The film seems to transcend the typical independent film. It has a soul and a visual power that is quite unique. I saw this with a small audience (400) who were captivated from the time of the first credit to the last and although I was not out and crying (as the lady next to me) I have to admit I had a little watering in the eyes ... <br /> <br />
