In 1993, African-American director and actor Mario Van Peebles followed the popular urban action film New Jack City with "Posse." The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the lead character, Jessie Lee. Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century when the United States was involved. in the Spanish-American War. Apparently, a time when the US justice system could send convicts to military service, Jessie Lee sees herself as a man enlisted, serving with a troop of black cavalry in Cuba. Some of his compatriots include Little J (Stephen Baldwin), Weezie (Charles Lane) and Obobo (Tiny Lister). They find a hidden gold trunk in a reconnaissance race and decide to keep it. However, the ambitious and intolerant Colonel Graham (Zane) discovers the gold and apparently is willing to kill Jessie Lee and company for him. A shootout between Graham's forces and Jessie Lee leaves the blind colonel in one eye, and his strength recedes. The rowdy crew of Jessie Lee can smuggle herself (and gold) back to New Orleans, but it turns out that Graham is not far behind. Jessie Lee and her allies are forced to flee, going west, to a town called Freemanville. Apparently, Freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the Civil War. Jessie Lee's father, "King David," was the charismatic preacher who co-founded the town. However, as is revealed in intermittent flashbacks, King David was soon brutally murdered by a white crowd, parallel to the Ku Klux Klan terrorist campaigns that began around the same time. Jessie Lee and company eventually find their way to Freemanville, only to find out that the city's residents are not exactly happy to see it, especially when Sheriff Bates (Richard Jordan) from a nearby white town makes it clear that he wants Jessie Lee and your family. dead or living partners. Carver (Blair Underwood) is the sheriff and indeed the mayor of Freemanville - and his own schedule may not fit with Jessie Lee. <br /> <br /> Analysis Action sequences are all very reliable, and Mario Van Peebles turns into a good performance as the brooding hero. In the aftermath of New Jack City's success, Van Peebles was almost expected to lead a sequel, or at least a similar accompaniment to urban action. Instead, Van Peebles looked like 100 years in the past, creating a mostly black West (effectively "updating" the 1970s black-themed westerns), and continuing the legacy of largely forgotten black cowboy movies of the early 20th century. . Unlike New Jack City, the film was independently funded and originally released by Gramercy / Polygram Entertainment. Reportedly, studio executives refused when Van Peebles launched 'Possession' for them. Some of the more "curious" cast of the time involved rappers Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc as Father Time and Angel, respectively. In certain interviews, Mario Van Peebles said he often likes to pitch against the guy; in the following years, the tendency to launch rap singers in non-musical films would become almost common. Watchers will notice a number of special appearances from various entertainment personalities: veterans of black-and-white films such as Isaac Hayes ("Truck Driver Turner"), Pam Grier ("Foxy Brown") and Larry Cook ("The Ghost Who Saw the Door") appear, as stand-up legend Nipsey Russell, not to mention TV producer Stephen J. Cannell (who hired young Van Peebles to star in "Sonny Spoon" years earlier). The film is bookended with Woody Strode ("Spartacus") in a key role.
