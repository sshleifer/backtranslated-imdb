Early Coppola with sublime cast that most people never got to see (a shame). There are some wonderful things happening in this - the best performance of Shirley Knight (an underrated actress), a trip in the late 1960s, James Caan very restrained and moving, Robert Duvall in a part he was born to play (nervous, lonely, police of the motorcycle), and a poignant script with F. Coppola behind the wheel. <br /> <br /> If this had been done five years later by someone else, it would have been a success (both for the time). Anyway, I recommend this to all people who do not need explosions in outer space and bad jokes about the mother-in-law or a billion-dollar budget to sit for a few hours and watch a story unfold . Give this one a chance if you can find it!
