I hope the writer, director, editor and composer (and let's not forget the producer) read this ... because their work was really amazing in this movie. Let me start by saying that I am by no means affiliated with this movie. I'm just a normal guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and I've seen it about 8 times. <br /> <br /> Every second of this movie is moving. Each scene is classic. The acting is real. The movie is honest. You can relate to these characters as people, not as actors. <br /> <br /> This tale follows three distinct kills at different stages of their lives. The story is thoughtfully thought out and each sub-plot is interwoven and interwoven, culminating in a message that lets us ponder the values ​​of right and wrong that each of us carries within. <br /> <br /> Crispen Glover, Daniel Roebuck, Dennis Hopper and Joshua John Miller (as a 12 year old boy) give absolutely amazing performances. I've seen this movie about 8 or more times and still get so engrossed in their performances that I forget I'm watching a movie. That's nice. Great work to all who worked on it. Great job. <br /> <br /> The music is also wonderfully combined and haunting. With the cast chosen, the carefully timed editing and rhythm, the mood, the tone and even the subject matter, the director made some of the best decisions for a movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This movie is real. You're honest. It is a true cinematic experience that I will never forget. You may not be on the subject, but it's something you can not ignore. Ultimately it's about people being people ... and everyone can relate to it. I highly recommend this movie to fans of drama, suspense and horror above almost every other movie.
