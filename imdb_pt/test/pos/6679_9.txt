This is a movie that will leave you wondering, is he or is not he? While many people have complained about the ambiguous ending, it gives room for the public to think and interpret it from the signs. This is my interpretation and theory, and I believe it is very good. <br /> <br /> First, here's the plot. One day, Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the middle of a busy train station. After trying to help a woman of burglars, he is arrested and sent to Bellevue, and later transferred to the hospital of Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges). Prot speaks freely about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to make a report on Earth. Of course, he is classified as crazy and is stuck in a low level security wing. He befriends other patients and quickly convinces them of his story. In fact, he says he can take a person back with him. Soon Dr. Powell is beginning to question Prot's insanity and as the plot progresses, it is increasingly difficult to prove Prot wrong. <br /> <br /> In the end, Dr. Powell discovers that Prot is Robert Porter, an intelligent man who worked in a slaughterhouse in New Mexico when his wife and daughter were murdered. Prot complains that he plans to leave for K-Pax at a precise moment on the fifth anniversary of the killings. The time comes and goes, and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and is never found again. <br /> <br /> In my theory: Prot is not crazy. Prot is from the planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is a Facebook friend of Prot. On one of Earth's previous visits to Earth, Robert was a child, learning about his father's constellations. Prot and Robert became best friends. After the death of his family and Robert killing the murderer, Robert decides to commit suicide. Prot is in K-Pax at the time, but he runs back (at multiples of light speed) to stop Robert. So Prot takes over the thought of Robert, taking over his body so to speak. A while later, Prot (still inhabiting Robert's body) comes to New York and is locked up. When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but he must leave Robert's body behind. So now we have Robert Catatonic. <br /> <br /> Explanations or clues: THE KNOWLEDGE OF PROT PLANETS AROUND LIBRA: As Prot says, any child knows about their own system. Only a few people on Earth had an idea about the system, and Prot added to their knowledge. Robert Porter, though intelligent and aware of his constellations, was not an astrophysicist. <br /> <br /> DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT: True. Prot could have left the institute at any moment, but he did not choose either. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell are: "Now that you've found Robert, take care of him." Prot was probably there to secure a place for Robert when he left. SUPER HUMAN SKILLS: It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly greater sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot provides its usual K-Pax ratio, but no earthly reason was given. It was also mentioned that Prot received extremely high doses of no-effect medicine. <br /> <br /> HELPING PATIENTS: Throughout the film, you see Prot helping the other patients (or patients discussing Prot's suggestions) to a better world are. While the psychologist hesitates with the help of Prot, Dr. Powell speaks at the end of the film about the new lives that patients are taking. <br /> <br /> The VACUUM CIRCUIT scene: The sprinkler is associated with Porter's house in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Does Porter associate sprinkler with the death of his family? Is she trying to protect Powell's daughter from that horrible fate? I have a different point of view. Porter is supposed to have committed suicide in a river. In fact, Prot (under hypnosis) is very concerned about Robert. I believe Prot associates the danger with the water, not with the sprinkler. He's trying to protect the girl from death, as she did with Robert. HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can discover the true identity of Prot, but while Prot gives a lot of information, he never gives up on his persona of Prot and claims the homeland of K-Pax. <br /> <br /> THE SECURITY CAMERA: Why does the camera simply fail for no apparent reason? MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE: First, Prot disappeared for a few days on his journey north. Funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. In fact, they try to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand it better than the staff. Of course, the most revealing disappearance is from Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does it disappear at the same time, but the only remaining clue is your winning essay. <br /> <br /> This is just my humble theory. You can complete whatever you want. You can take Dr. Powell's theory that Prot was just a person adopted by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality, but that would be giving up many holes in the plot.
