1931 also featured "An American Tragedy," the original tale of "Who Will It Lead With, Poor Girl or Rich Girl." this was a really fun movie. Babs stanwyck was as beautiful as she could be, idem sally blane. Monroe Owsley, unimemorably played the husband of Babs. I had never heard of him, but I thought he had a good physical resemblance to the Crosby's "great transmission" (32), even a line of receding hair and ears with wings. Ricardo Cortez, the rich playboy with a heart of gold. a true movie pioneer going back. the dilemma is settled in the end to the tensions of the title and I believe Annette hanshaw had the recording success, although the off-screen voice has done very well. I also liked the scenes from the dance hall. I'm sure they were authentic; the band, one of the best of the era, was superb. Good job, Lionel Barrymore !!!!
