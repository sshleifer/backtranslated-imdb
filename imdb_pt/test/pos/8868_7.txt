That was very funny, even if it fell apart a bit in the end. He does not go overboard after Hitchcock - Owen (Danny DeVito) was fortunate that he had "Strangers on A Train" playing at the local theater, so the film says that was the inspiration. <br /> <br /> DeVito is very funny, but also a little sad. He has no friends and all he wants to do is write and have someone like his writing. His teacher, Billy Crystal, is going through a serious block of writers and his wife stole his book and made it his own success, which also frustrated him greatly. <br /> <br /> The best parts are the proposal of Mr. Pinsky's book ("A Hundred Girls I Like Pork") and all the scenes with Anne Ramsey, who is so horrible that even Mother Teresa I wanted to kill her!
