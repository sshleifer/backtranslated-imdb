An interesting film with Jordana Brewster as a young woman who travels to Europe in an attempt to find out what happened to her older sister (Cameron Diaz), who mysteriously died years before. Brewster is very good and keeps you involved, despite some unrealistic conspiracies, such as having her surprised and starting a romance with the much older boyfriend of her dead sister (Christopher Eccleston). Still, a good deal. SERIE B
