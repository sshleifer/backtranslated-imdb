I have not been a fan of Madonna for some time, however, I thought to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie fooled. One of them, like Madonna, was criticized by critics. They were very much mistaken and many potential viewers were discouraged by the negative reviews. <br /> <br /> First, Madonna does an excellent job in this movie, which was one of her first. She plays a ditsy blonde in the movie, she is far from being a ditsy blonde in real life. Most critics were a little hampered by her singing fame and did not give her a fair shake. When you see this movie, I hope you understand that the accent and the fool are just acting. She was absolutely hysterical, just like the movie. <br /> <br /> Griffen Dunne is another person who has not received a fair review in the film. If you take a look at his filmography, you will see that he is a very talented actor. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, this is something like a beautiful woman, but came 3 years before the Roberts, Gere success. It's a goof-ball comedy with lots of site jokes, slapstick and a liner. Some of the comedies are deadpan and like comedies to really appreciate the subtler mood. <br /> <br /> I know this does not say much about the movie, however, I hope this helps to dispel any belief that this is a bad movie. It is absolutely worth renting for a nice night of lots of fun. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Gary
