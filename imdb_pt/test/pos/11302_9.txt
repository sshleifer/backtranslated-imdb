For a child's movie, that's great. As an adult and a mother, I enjoyed watching the movie with my daughter. There's a lot going on in this movie. The following * may * be considered a * spoiler * ... Barbie learns courage and learns not to judge others so quickly in this movie. She also learns not to lose hope and master her anger. I loved the feel of teamwork you see watching Barbie and her sister and friends solve the puzzle. There is nothing in the film that I find offensive or inappropriate to young viewers. In fact, I felt that the moral messages of the film were superb and well made. <br /> <br /> The animation was very good. I really like the ice skating scenes and I think they were very well done. There's a lot of action in this movie, so I suspect most kids would like it ... not just the ones that really like Barbie. My daughter really chose because of Pegasus. She loves horses. But she really liked the movie. My daughter is autistic, and was able to watch the entire movie and have fun. She really liked the action scenes and any parts with horses involved. <br /> <br /> One thing I was thinking was that a lot of people are opposed to Barbie (and Ken) because they are very pretty. However, I think children, like adults, like to see people and beautiful things. It's natural. As adults, we like to watch beautiful movie stars as well. It's wonderful, though, that the character of Barbie and her "boyfriend" have a lot of personality. While it is fun to see beautiful people, it ages if there is no substance behind the beautiful face. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would say this is a great movie for kids and parents will enjoy it too. :)
