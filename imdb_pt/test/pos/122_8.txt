Overall, a well done movie. There were parts that made me shudder, and there were parts that I threw my hands at, but I came out with something more than I entered. <br /> <br /> I think the movie suffers from something. excessive ambition. Without ruining, let me say that the obvious references to the fire judgment in Ramayana are far beyond what this film stands for. The Ramayana is an epic. It is not a 200-page book that knocks out women in India. The film is about two married girls in a very different Indian family. Although the basic principles of the "unwritten laws of family tradition" seem to be those of conservative India, let me assure my reader that I (having lived in Delhi for 12 years) found whole parts that simply did not ring those bells. I mean a few things and some actions are very true, but some other things are far from reality. Especially today. <br /> <br /> Delhi is complicated. India is complicated. The director tries to simplify the two. And it fails miserably in that. <br /> <br /> Why in English? Can you imagine a movie about American Indians in English? Or the Frenchman speaking English. Seriously shocking. Even the servant spoke in English with a fluent accent (albeit with a suggestion of colloquialisms in the language for "credibility"). <br /> <br /> But the chemistry among the leaders is palpable. If you like this, this is a movie for you. I think it's the greatest saving grace - developing a true love story in real life. <br /> <br /> If this movie were about Radha and Sita, then he would have a complete note of me. And being on them, could have made a subtle statement. But this movie goes there to say that this is what India is, and that's how Indian society is. And in this respect, it succeeds when it fails. Just carry everything you see with a pinch of salt. The dark secrets of India are not being revealed. Only two girls are falling in love. Just like everywhere else.
