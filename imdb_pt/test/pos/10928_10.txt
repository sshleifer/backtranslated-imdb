I had the pleasure of seeing this short film at the Miami Film Festival last Saturday and let me say that I was surprised. It was the only movie in the entire show that I loved. It is beautifully filmed, composed, edited, rendered and written. After the screening, I saw the director at a party and asked what he would do next. He said he was working to find funding for the short version. He described some scenes for me. It sounded like the kind of first movie that casts the big names in the industry. If you've ever had a chance to see this short I highly recommend taking it. Let's take the star hat crossed.
