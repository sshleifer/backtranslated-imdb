The film Jennifer with Ida Lupino and Howard Duff is a magnificent film noir. This is a film almost unknown that all fans of the film noir should see. Jennifer was filmed with the most unusual camera angles for the time, which made the movie have a surreal quality at times. I love the black and white film noir movies.Film noir in color is not so good.The cast and script is excellent.The rather scary music is fun to listen to.Ida Lupino is one of the best and talented actresses forever grace I have never seen a production she was in that I did not like. She was not only incredibly beautiful, she was an excellent actress. The first movie I remember seeing Ida Lupino was Roadhouse with Richard Widmark and Cornel Wilde. I've never forgotten the movie, or it. I've seen her latest films like Food Of The Gods and Women In Chains, and even if the movies were not her usual routine, she was still delicious in them as an actress. The Howard Duff is always great to watch. I recommend this masterpiece for Everyone. I have this movie on VHS tape.
