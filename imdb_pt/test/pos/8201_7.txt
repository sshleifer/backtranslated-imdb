Angela (Sandra Bullock) is a computer expert but, being shy and a little reclusive, she does all her work within the confines of her condo. Just as she is about to take a vacation in Mexico, a co-worker sends a computer disk with disturbing information about it. Angela agrees to meet her colleague, but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash. Angela goes to Mexico, but takes the record with her. While she is sunbathing on the beach, a fantastic-looking gentleman named Jack (Jeremy Northam) makes openings for her. She falls in love with them and the two end up on a boat to Cozumel. However, Jack works for the people who generated the secret information on the disk and he is out to get it. Even after Angela escapes from her claws and lands back to the US, Jack makes things difficult. He changes Angela's identity on every computer across the country, causing her to lose her condo, her bank account, everything. Did Angela, a computer expert, beat Jack at her own game? This very exciting movie has many features. First, Bullock and Northam are two very handsome and interesting actors, and their presence adds an immediate capture. The script is very intelligent and secure in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in today's world. The costumes, scenery, production and direction of the film are also wonderful. And despite how it sounds, there is a lot of exciting action as Angela fleeing to defeat her enemy. If you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, this is a great choice. It offers twists and turns with great frequency, allowing the viewer to "enjoy" a great night of entertainment.
