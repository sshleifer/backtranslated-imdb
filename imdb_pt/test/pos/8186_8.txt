Leaving aside the disadvantages and shortcomings of the movie mentioned by other viewers, I must say that it seemed like a movie about power, which is, in my opinion, one of the most attractive illusions. I saw the drama of an emperor and people. It seems to me that the director wanted to raise a question of what is the benefit of the nation and what is the price of "happiness" for all. Is there justification for forced benefit and "happiness"? How much can be lost for the security and peaceful existence of the nation? Is the idea of ​​a potential powerful empire worth reducing to misery and killing thousands of citizens now? It seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and seeks to learn it all the time the film runs. He is desperately divided between these desires and, at the same time, psychologically harassed by the discovery of his true origin. He seems to hate his subjects for having to renounce his father and his love, sort of loves the people as a good emperor should. No wonder his actions are controversial and his emotions confusing. It seems to me that, like another film presenting the problem of man's power over other men, the film is a success.
