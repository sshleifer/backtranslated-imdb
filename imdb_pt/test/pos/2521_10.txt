I first saw this masterpiece in VHS 10 years ago, and the powerful interpretation about the painfully-anti-established rage-child-society I carried remained in my heart ever since. Director Hector Babenco is such a good man that he finds a delicate angle to tell the story of how urbanity kills the children of the poverty class. Even marginalized children have their beautiful innocent dreams. But corrupt reality never gives a chance ... Thanks to the editors of the recent DVD release, I can now keep this great movie in my favorite collection.
