Emilio is a successful businessman, a perfect father, and a good husband. Or is what everyone thinks. The perfect plot he has carefully constructed over these years will start to close around him all of a sudden. Will he be able to keep up with his own lies? <br /> <br /> This is a very well defined drama, with great acting and steady direction. Even if the plot is pushed to the limit to increase tension, the movie explores some of our worst fears ... Do we really know the people we deal with? Can we be so sure? <br /> <br /> The story unfolds at an ever faster pace, when it reaches the point where Emilio is no longer in control of his lies. A good amount of Spanish films have interesting stories, but they are far from technical proficiency. The perfect rhythm and well-filmed scenes make the actors so credible, we enter Emilio, we hate and we suffer for him, as the situation gets more and more desperate. There is no need for any Spanish folklore, nor is it an attempt to create a Hollywood style. This is the real Spain, 2002, and regardless of the obvious improbability of Emilio's existing life in reality, there are good chances that someone we know is not exactly like the person he claims to be. Not only is it a great commercial product, it allows you to wonder where the lies can lead us. We can continue? <br /> <br /> Well done.
