Having just seen this, I find it hard to believe that it is no longer known. This is the slightly better known, but almost as shamefully neglected, COME AND SEE (Klimov, 1986) should be two of the greatest war films. They are meaningful, powerful and incisive. THE ASCENT is also endowed with a moderately used but brilliant score by Schnittke.
