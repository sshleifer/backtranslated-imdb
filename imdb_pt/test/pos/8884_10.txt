Was it with the one who created you from when you were young? Do you just want her to leave your life? This woman is your mother. You must respect her, honor her, whether she is sick or well. But this can sometimes be aggravating. Especially when she becomes too arrogant. This is how Owen (Danny DeVito) had to deal with "Throw Momma Fron The Train". His mother (Anne Ramsey, 1929-1988) is one of the worst. He's trying his hardest to be a writer, and she's everything, less than grateful. He calls it an "awkward poop", a "larda $$" and "fat" and "stupid". For his friend, Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), he has his own wife problems, his ex-wife. She's trying to discredit you. So, what did Owen do? Push it to the sea. What he does? Help return the favor, get rid of Ms. Lift! In the kitchen scene, I liked where Owen called Larry, "Cousin Patty." And Mom said, "You do not have a cousin Patty!" and Owen yells "You lied to me!" and El Cabongs Larry with the frying pan. Then comes the fun part when they are on the train and try to kill the Momma Lift. This is frustrated and she takes Larry off the train. Well, everything back to normal, the ex-wife lives, but Mom kicked the bucket by herself. Maybe she should have seen the mistakes of her domineering ways. A fun movie, and the cast is great. One classic! 5 stars!
