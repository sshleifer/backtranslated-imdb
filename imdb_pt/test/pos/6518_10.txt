Wonderful family movie that should be a staple at the time of Christmas. It is a mystery to me because it is not. A true lost film that I first encountered, blinking in my old 19 "black and white RCA, when the Million Dollar movie was still in vogue on Channel 9 in New York.This fantasy directed Rudolph Mate should be tucked under the tree Everyone's Christmas But it was never released in home video, it's a shame. I believe I saw part of it at AMC a few years ago, before they cut out many of their old spin films.On Easter or on Christmas Eve Any movie with Daddy Noel, Aunt Bee, Cupcake's Hostess Lady and an actor with the first name King can not be bad Ann Blyth as "Sally" is an energy pack., She runs to the chapel to pray for St. Ann to help and give her family confused and financially tied. She works, then, after graduating, she puts a statue of St. Ann in her own room. At some point, O'Moyne's entire residence is moved to another address. that this was done p to end a neighboring dispute between O'Moynes and the fellow coward on the side. Blyth is cute as a button. Edmund Gwen can play the recluse grandfather while he sleeps. Overall, this is a satisfying cinematic experience.
