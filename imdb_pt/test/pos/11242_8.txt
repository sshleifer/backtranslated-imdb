I can not say that this show is perfect. Maybe all previous commentators remember the old space on Tuesday at 10:30 am, occupied by Butt Elvira Curt's children's mood ("There's a space shuttle hitting a 747!"). Oh, the glory of fighting to push any button on the remote to make it change. <br /> <br /> Face it, the comedy can not pull a Showcase and create the comic genius of true Canadian Trailer Park Boys. But hey, they try. <br /> <br /> This show is by far one of the best original shows. However, none of the following will find themselves laughing at the apparent "players" who show their stupidity at catching girls: a) "idiot" girls - Obviously, they can not realize that they are just like girls in the show. Inattentive. Jump on the man's flesh, you can call yourself a prostitute tomorrow and get his name. He looks good, he must be popular and cool. HAHAHAHA !!! Ah, but you would never do that! Nobody would ... if they knew it was happening <br /> <br /> b) Individuals who do not think and who think women like nice guys - Obviously, seeing these guys succeeding with what you fail or not even try To make your primae rage boil. Watch more closely, they are slaughtered most of the time. They say stupid crap. <br /> <br /> c) Girls with respect for each other - Obviously, seeing their different female species caught in real-world situations is wrong wrong. Nobody is played. Women are not objects, they can not be played, because they are all very loyal angels who go to clubs to talk politely to one another without fear of guys trying to catch them. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait ... hmmmmmmmm <br /> <br /> As much as everyone says this show is not funny, and it does not teach you anything, I have to get the opposite side . The show is very good at detailing how relationships work for both men and women. The way they think and the way they think the other think and the social hierarchy. It's funny to see and hear the guys make absolutely stupid comments on the things women say ("My grandfather died recently" "Oh ... well, are we having fun tonight?"). <br /> <br /> Besides, it's a club. The place where people will have fun and sex. No matter who you are, you go to a club to receive or pay attention to someone. The guys go there to test their game and pick up girls. The girls go there to flirt with the boys and think what else makes them lose their feet. Brighten up! <br /> <br /> If you are a guy, learn a thing or two about different approaches and the different effects they have. If you are a girl, learn what these "studious" prostitutes really think, and learn to differentiate them from genuine guys. The next time you're done with one of these jerks, realize it's not because of him, it's because you're dumb and thought he was the best guy of all time when he was clearly an idiot to you all the time
