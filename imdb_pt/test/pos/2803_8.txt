In France, Xavier (Romain Duris) is a young twenty-something economist trying to get a job in a government department through a friend of his father. He is advised to have a specialization in Spanish economy and language to obtain a good position. He decides to enroll in a European exchange program called "Erasmus" and move to Barcelona to improve his knowledge of Spanish culture and language. She leaves her girlfriend Martine (Audry Tautou), promising to keep in close touch with her, and once in Barcelona he is temporarily presented by a French doctor Jean-Michel (Xavier de Guillebon) and his lonely young wife Anne- Sophie (Judith Godrèche) he met at the airport. Later, she moves to an apartment with international students: Englishman Wendy (Kelly Reilly), Spanish Soledad (Cristina Brondo), Italian Alessandro (Fédérico D'anna), Danish Lars (Christian Pagh) and German Tobias (Barnaby Metschurat). Then Belgium Isabelle (Cécile de France) and Wendy's brother William (Kevin Bishop) join the group, and Xavier learns the Spanish language, and finds friendship and love in his experience of living abroad. "L'Auberge Espagnole" is one of those films that the viewer gets sad when it ends. History is a delightful and entertaining story of friendship and love in a globalized world and a unified Europe. This very lovely film made me feel good and happy even though I have never lived in a student republic. The newcomer William provokes the funniest situations throughout history, with his big mouth and short brain. Also, it's great to see a new approach to students living together, unlike those idiot American fraternities and their stereotypes common in American movies. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Spanish Hostel" (Spanish Auberge)
