Considering all the comedies with a military situation that were made in history, someone had to be the first. It can be argued that, in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre. <br /> <br /> Hard to believe that at that time was a bold move. When you consider that some of the best films involving people like Bob Hope, Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy involved military service and were made during the war, it's something you accept and laugh at. In World War I Chaplin, along with other stars, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, participated in tours. He was a great supporter of the cause of the Allies, unusual for one of his leftist visions. It would seem natural that the Tramp was drawn up and, unfortunately, it would get messy and wreak havoc on everyone. <br /> <br /> Many things you would see in World War II service comedies began in Shoulder Arms. Chaplin had no more imitators, because a few weeks after the movie's release, the war was over. <br /> <br /> But a comic art form was established by one of the greatest geniuses of comedy.
