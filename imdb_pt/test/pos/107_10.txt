Easily one of the best Indian films of all time. Granted, that's not saying much (I made this conclusion after a whopping 15 minutes of watching). But I can actually say that Fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Beautiful because of your images. The best example I can give is the parallelism between the two female leaderships (Radha and Sita) and the characters of the same name in Hindu mythology. Sita, for example, is the wife of the revered Lord Ram. As the legend goes, Ram subjugates his wife by making her walk through a fire to prove her "purity." Sita, in response, cries and leaves him, reuniting with his mother (the Earth). This story has all sorts of crazy connections with the stories of the two Indian women (Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi). The word "Fire" suddenly has many meanings - marriage, tradition, religion, motherhood, and probably a few others that I did not get. <br /> <br /> Brilliant because of its social implications. Many who were offended by the premise for this movie should be the first to see Fire (for example, my mother, who really loved it). Because? Because, although fire is an attack on tradition, it is also an attack on tradition. In other words, this is your strength, NOT your weakness. Traditional conservative social customs (Indians or Canadians, Americans or any other) are useless if enslaved. Gender roles and self-denial can do this. <br /> <br /> These are the things that I took with me after seeing the fire. Did we take the hat to Deepa Mehta ??
