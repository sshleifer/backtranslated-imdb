Fun, fun movie about WWII German spy (Julie Andrews!) Falling in love with the American pilot (Rock Hudson) while trying to get secrets from him. For some reason, this was attacked by critics and avoided by the public in 1970 - I can not understand why. It is beautifully filmed, has wonderful costumes and interiors and exciting aerial combat. Also has Andrews doing a striptease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song - "Whistling in the Dark". The film has problems. Andrews and Hudson did not do well during filming - and it shows. Your love scenes lack glitz and do not have sex chemistry. Still, they turn into OK performances. The film is a bit long (even in the cut of the 105 minute director I saw) and gets very dark and serious in the end. Still, it's worth catching. Try to see the cut of the directors ... the other runs half an hour more!
