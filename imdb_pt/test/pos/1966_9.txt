River's edge is not a nice movie to watch, but it's an incredible one. Having seen this for many years, I really think it would still have the ability to shock if it was re-released or redone or something. Perhaps no movie has ever captured the essence of suburban inertia like this scary and disturbing movie. Since this is based on a true story, it is even more disturbing. Very well represented and just UNSPOILED on many occasions to watch, but also a little-known masterpiece and a truly important film. Must be a must to watch shown across the country in all high schools. Fantastic.
