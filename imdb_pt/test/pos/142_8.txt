We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you have not seen Oldboy (or the trilogy of sympathy), you are missing out on some of the best films of this century. But I'm not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk about thirst. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what you would expect. Yes, it is a vampire movie, but at the same time it is also a very tortuous tale of romance between a priest and a young woman. I will not go into the synopsis (you can read this above), but rather tell what this movie has to offer. Chan-wook Park is a master of cinematography and this film is no exception. With some very surreal scenes backed by intense lighting, it sets the mood perfectly in almost every scene. The movie starts a bit slow, but I felt that it was necessary to build a relationship with the characters. Once things start to move, it almost never ends until the credits roll. "Thirst" is predominantly a love story, but not in the same sense as you would think. the relationship between the main characters is very intense, but at the same time almost disturbing. Chan-wook Park is no stranger to controversy, as we know, and this movie touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy. The final scene is by far the most powerful of the film, and perhaps one of the best conclusions for a movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Overall this is an exceptional movie that I feel like all movie buffs should see. It's an exciting (and admittedly different) view of the vampire world, and the novel is far from boring or boring. This movie is gritty, selfless and beautiful in all the wrong ways. Obviously, it's not for everyone, but chances are, if you're reading this review, you're already interested. Look. Do not hesitate
