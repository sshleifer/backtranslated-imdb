I think FARSCAPE is the best scifi since Babylon 5 and is one of the best science fiction series of all time (ranking up there with Dr. Who, Blake 7, Red Dwarf, MST3K and the B5 mentioned above). I think the characters and races of Farscape are far more interesting and imaginative than the typical "human with birthmarks" that are found in many series. The effects are very good and the stories engaging. Although I lost most of the second season and part of the first season, I think the development of the character was very well done.
