OZ is an old TV series released by HBO. He shows life in a security prison named Oswald, but the main plot is focused on Emerald City, which is one of the prison levels. <br /> <br /> Oz has an incredible plot and an excellent cast! There are many characters and almost all are very interesting. Basically they are divided into groups (gangs), Sicilians, blacks, Aryans, gays, Latinos and many others who have no specific group but deal with many others like Ryan O'Reily (The Irish). The plot is very well built, there is a lot of conspiracy inside, a lot of power struggle. But all this is not only exposed in the form of violence, everything is very intelligent and intelligent, nothing happens without a reason, everything is connected and very interesting to guess! I really love this series, and anyone who wants to see something clever, very well produced with a very good cast and performances, should see OZ!
