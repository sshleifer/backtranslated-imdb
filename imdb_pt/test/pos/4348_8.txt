<br /> <br /> Oh my word !! I've never seen a movie so lacking in any kind of moral judgment or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in showing a world of deep and damaged executions. He not only feeds us with the hell on earth seen through the face of the Mustache Bronson but he also shows us the spoon he is feeding us and says "look at what you are seeing now and ask the question: Are you liking And even if you say to yourself it CAN NOT BE !!!! You will know that deep down you will know ... it is a masterpiece
