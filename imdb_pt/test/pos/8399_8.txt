I, having read and watched Gone With The Wind, found it very difficult not to compare this movie with the original. Although I thought Scarlett, the novel, was superb, the movie did not add up. It was a completely different story. Of course, there will never be another Scarlett and Rhett besides Leigh and Gable, but the new actors did a good job considering. I loved the way the book and the film involved the story of Gon With the Wind because after reading it I felt a wave of disappointment because it simply stopped and left readers wondering what happened. Scarlett ends the story very well, and Alexandra Ripley did very well in the book. I just wanted the film to follow the story more, even though it's great in itself.
