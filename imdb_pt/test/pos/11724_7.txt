Burt Reynolds' response to Clint Eastwood invading his back-to-back comedy with his orangutan comedies was to make his own Dirty Harry in the Chicago-style thriller Sharky's Machine. Originally planned for John Boorman, but ultimately directed by the star himself, it is a commercial package with Reynolds, an agent who is attached to Vice Squad (literally - they are in the basement) who decides to nail a mysterious crime lord who is supporting Earl Holliman as the next governor. You can guess the rest, but while Reynolds tends to lose sight of the story, he sometimes has a good eye for individual scenes and almost gets a performance from Rachel Ward as the high-class prostitute he falls in love with. The romantic subplot is extraordinarily well-developed, there are some good action scenes and some nice touches like having Vittorio Gassman's similar villain a mirror image of the hero or Reynolds and a killer, both guarding a witness of adjacent apartments in the same house. construction. One of the best star films of its glory days, it's not classic, but it does contribute to a more than efficient Saturday night.
