John Voight plays the title character in this movie based on the autobiography of author Pat Conroy (Prince of Tides). A great teacher film tells the story of a naïve Pat Conroy, a young English teacher whose first assignment is at a primary school on a rural island. The only white man on the island, he must combat internal and external pressures as he attempts to instill education and values ​​in children who for generations have been systematically denied such things. A solid performance that really makes you think.
