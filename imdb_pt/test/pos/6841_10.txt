Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Carla Gugino and Gil Bellows are a DELIGHT in this sexy caper. This movie is smart, the edge of your adult entertainment entertainment and what a relief these days of predictable big concept cartoons are. Great music and camera work add to the fun of this New Orleans puzzle. Highly recommended. Ten stars!
