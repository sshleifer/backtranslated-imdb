It is not always that a TV series catches me right away; A recent chance of downloading the pilot for Surface put me in place all through the episode, and soon I began a feverish quest to learn all I could about this wonderful series. To my disappointment, I discovered that it had been canceled after a mere 15 episodes, despite its strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews. It's a shame. <br /> <br /> Since then, I've gotten the remaining episodes and found the top 5 or 6 among the best I've ever watched. Just fantastic from start to finish, and as another reviewer commented, I LOVED how they ended each episode with a huge finale. I imagine watching every week I would have screamed out of tension and just captivated, hoping desperately for the next episode to be released. Growing up, I always heard it was like the movies in a series used to do it, ending with a huge suspense to take the crowds back to the movies for the next episode. Well, it seems that for some reason or another the suits decided to kill this, and apparently the people behind the show must have seen the writing on the wall because after episode 6 things definitely change for the worse . I would not say the episodes really have become boring, but many of the plot elements become a bit more clich√©, and I have to say, the final episode really left me feeling cheated. I just wanted the program's creators to have a fair shot. The other show that left me with that feeling was the first season of Stargate SG-1, which just resonated tremendously, feeling very "true", emotional and made from the heart. Surface has been a great series, and maybe one day, some moneyed TV lover will see all the shedding of excitement about the cancellation of the show, and bring back this show. You can expect, at least. :)
