If you believe that any war movie can make you really feel the war, you need to see the "Letyat zhuravli" (called "The Cranes are Flying" in English). It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), who are in love on the brink of World War II. They are walking along the waterfront, watching the cranes pass when the war begins. Boris is promptly sent to war. Veronika hides with a family and ends up marrying her son, whom she does not love. Boris, meanwhile, continues trotting across the field, battling the Nazis and facing all the horrors of the war, until he runs out of energy. When Veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this news, she refuses to accept it, until Boris' body arrives on one of the trains. At the same time, the radio announces that Germany surrendered and the Allied forces won the war; the Soviet Union has lost 27 million citizens, but it is the beginning of a new era. <br /> <br /> This movie did an excellent job showing the human impact of the war not only on the battlefield, but also how it affected the civilian population. This is definitely a movie that everyone should see.
