Good (not great) small horror movie with a high "creep" factor (not to be confused with a 1991 movie of the same name, or the most recent (2001) Bonfire STORIES). Central tale of stranded teenagers telling ghost stories around a campfire in scary woods pretty well leads and brings together the different stories that make up most of the film (Watch for Ron Livingston (Office Space, Brothers Band) and Jennifer MacDonald in a spirited, sexy segment ("The Honeymoon")). Solid performance and some truly "scary" moments make this a cooler than average. Good example of interesting plot, allied to the set of quality acting resulting in a whole greater than the sum of its parts. "Surprise" end of the main story adds a scary touch, though some might see it coming. The movie is not available on DVD, but can be found on VHS.
