I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I entered the theater I was not really in the mood for it at that particular moment. It's like the Olive Garden - I like that, but I have to be in the right mindset to enjoy myself completely. <br /> <br /> I do not know exactly what was choking my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to Kevin Costner's latest film that dealt with the subject - Waterworld. In addition, despite the promise that Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold with it. Something about the guy irritates me. Probably has to do with their simian characteristics. It took about two minutes for my fears to subside and my hesitations dissipate. The movie immediately puts us in the middle of a tense rescue mission, and I got tighter than Kenny Rogers' orange elevator. My concerns rose quickly with Kutcher's initial appearance, because much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously legal and rebellious. Sunglasses, a tough toothpick in the mouth and a smile that would make George Clooney proud? Yes we do. I was totally ready to hate him. <br /> <br /> But then he had to perform quite strongly and force me to soften my blows. <br /> <br /> Damn man! Effectively combining thrilling rescue scenes, drama, humor and solid acting, The Guardian is easily a movie that I dare say the majority of the audience will enjoy. You can argue about your clich√©s, predictability and rare moments of overly cooked sappiness, but none of that takes away the value of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow down when Costner started. training the young, but, on the contrary, training sessions may be the most interesting aspect of the film. Coast Guard Rescued Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen, so I feel the inside look at what they go through and how difficult it is to make it very informative and a great way to introduce the public group appreciated. <br /> <br /> Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Just think about it - you can go on dangerous missions in cold, dark and hectic waters, and then you must fight the disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia and lack of oxygen while you try to help people in panic who are depending on you. for their survival. And if all this is not bad enough, sometimes you can not save everyone, so you have to make the difficult decision of who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> Man, who wants all this responsibility? I do not! I had no idea what it was really like for these guys, and who would have thought that I would have an Ashton Kutcher / Kevin Costner movie to thank for the education? <br /> <br /> The Guardian not only does a great job in paying tribute to this rare kind of hero, but also to us, which also does a good job of entertainment for its paying customers. <br /> <br /> GIST <br /> <br /> Viewers who want an insight into how to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean may want to give The Guardian a chance. I saw it for free, but if I had paid I would have felt that I had gotten the value of my money.
