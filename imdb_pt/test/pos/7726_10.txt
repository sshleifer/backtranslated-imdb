Even for non-operatic audiences, the name CARMEN is immediately recognized as an opera by Bizet about a gypsy girl whose capricious loves destroy men. But as much as opera is considered a staple in every opera repertoire, the true story of the wild gypsy girl created by Prosper Mérimée in 1845 was never told as well as in this film version by the richly talented Spanish director Vicente Aranda ('Juana la Loca is AKA Mad Love ',' Lovers', 'If they say I fell', etc.). Incorporating the author of the novel as a main character seeking the story of Carmen from one of her lovers - Joseph - offers the right advantage for the story of this famous gypsy savage lady being told. <br /> <br /> Carmen (the incredibly beautiful and talented Paz Vega) works in a cigar factory in Seville, a factory adjacent to the military station where Jose (Leonardo Sbaraglia) himself is stationed. Carmen is tempestuous and in a fight instigated by a factory colleague calling attention to the fact that Carmen is a gypsy, Carmen kills her co-worker and is arrested. José is physically attracted to the voluptuous Carmen and when Carmen flirts with him, he agrees to let her escape - his return is the promise of a night of passion with Carmen. Carmen keeps his pact, giving Joseph his first sexual encounter and Joseph is doomed. His lack of military discipline results in the loss of his position and imprisonment for some time, but upon his release, Jose finds Carmen again, kills an official colleague and, with fear, runs into the hills to live with the smugglers and gypsies who are of Carmen. people. Many incidents occur to try the passionate bond between lovers, but when Carmen's real husband is released from prison, destructive behaviors take hold, behaviors that include Carmen's passion and affair with a bullfighter and the passion of Carmen and Jose arrives at a tragic end. <br /> <br /> One factor that makes the story (adapted to the screen by director Aranda and Joaquim Jordà moves so well is the role that Prosper Mérimée (Jay Benedict) plays: his questioning of Joseph completes the story that Bizet The performance is superb, the cinematography of Paco Femenia and the excellent soundtrack of José Nieto contribute enormously to the success of this excellent film, a must for opera lovers Carmen and a splendid action drama for those who admire historical pieces Highly recommended Grady Harp
