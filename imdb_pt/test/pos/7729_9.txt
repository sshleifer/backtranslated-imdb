Excellent movie in many ways. Vicente Aranda managed to portray the time (1830) with meticulous care. The light, the places, the feelings are perfectly perceived from the beginning of the film. And along with that - unlike what happened to "Mad Love" (Juana la Loca), a rather episodic historical film - all this beautiful photography / music / clothing is involving a very fluid script that reaches its climax in the only possible. In relation to the actors, Paz Vega as Carmen is excellent: liar, seductive, aggressive, totally sexual, so beautiful Carmen. Sbaraglia is a little less convincing to the public about his crazy love for Carmen, but he manages to convey the appropriate tragic mood to the entire film. I recommend it to everyone: the best Spanish film of the year.
