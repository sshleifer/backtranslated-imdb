Hello everyone! The best drama is now on the Gospel Music Channel! Go to their website and see the schedule and find out the number of your cable or satellite. This was one of my favorite shows as I grew up. It has everything I want it to be a TV show, a clean, familiar drama that does not upset me. The story of a man who, after losing his job, decides to leave for a great cross country adventure. Along the way, they meet all kinds of interesting people and find themselves in the middle of all sorts of problems. This show was originally a spin off of Touched By An Angel, another very good family show. Be sure to check it out!
