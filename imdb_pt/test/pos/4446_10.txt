Do not Torture Duckling is an absolutely incredible fun for Lucius Fulci. Unlike other subgenre heavyweights like Mario Bava and Dario Argento, Fulci takes a decidedly courageous, grounded, and socially insightful approach to the giallo narrative in this film. There is nothing glamorous about children's murders and border pedophilia (an unsurpassable subplot for 1972) going on here, and Fulci wisely shoots a serious and lugubrious eye, avoiding flash, melodrama and directional histrionics. Are the proceedings punctuated by bloody and instantaneous pieces that are further reinforced by Fulci's sense of dissonant realism? the deeply disturbing scene of "witch-slaughter" in particular, with its bald brutality, looks like a snuff film. The composer Riz Ortolani bookends these scenes full of carnage with fierce reverberating strings of strings. The film is crowned by a simultaneously lyrical and violent conclusion in which theology, morality, fanaticism and superstition collide. It is a deeply effective ending that has the ability to leave the viewer in a confused and unarmed torpor. <br /> <br /> Fulci could not have chosen a better location for this movie. Do not torture a duckling was photographed in and around the ancient city of Matera, Italy. As Matera continues to modernize today (highlighted by its shift from an agricultural to an industrial economy), it is struggling with its UNESCO-sponsored reputation as a receptacle for mysterious Paleolithic ghosts. The anxieties of the real-life Materani are reflected by the characters in the film, who, using Christianity in their sleeves, coldly confront any exotic marginal tradition (witchcraft) that strays out of the norm. <br /> <br /> Curiously, Matera was also used as a replacement for Jerusalem in Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. If anything, it adds even more power to Fulci's message. Catholic guilt and terrible murders are such a resonant combination.
