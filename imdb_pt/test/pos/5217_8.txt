He is very good in this role as a disgruntled and bored husband, a decorated air force officer who gets bored with his predictable suburban life and decides to make a radical change. <br /> <br /> One night he meets Karen Chairs. , an attractive woman younger than his current wife. A relationship develops, and Cole decides to take him to the next level. <br /> <br /> He not only has a case, he feigns his death to escape his family obligations. Lies become increasingly a standard when he starts stealing banks to keep his new wife (Sillas) happy and project the image that he is a success. A fictitious delirium, apparently. <br /> <br /> This was also based on a true story that makes it even more intriguing. Cole is credible and excellent in these roles. Recommended. 8/10
