Joline (Heather Graham) leaves after her husband Carl (Luke Wilson), who disappeared to clear his head about himself and his marriage. Joline, who is committed to marriage, begins her journey to find Carl, but on the way discovers a lot about herself. In her journey, she encounters several interesting characters who, unknowingly, help her find her way. <br /> <br /> In my eyes, this is a classic road movie that moves at the right pace (some viewers find it too slow). Throughout the film, he retains his humorous note, while Joline responds to the madness of the world around him with a warm, wise, sometimes sad smile. All the actresses and actors give wonderful performances and the musical score is immaculate. 9/10
