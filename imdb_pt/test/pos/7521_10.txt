Certainly the highlight of this film is the cast. <br /> <br /> Diana Rigg, George C. Scott, Bernard Hughes to name a few. <br /> <br /> I have accumulated more time in hospitals and with doctors over the years than I would like to think. <br /> <br /> This comedy attacks the pomp and pretension in every aspect of our society, through the creation of one of the most "arrogant" institutions ... The idea that such events may be possible can be a shock to some, but it is a delight for anyone with the prospect of experience. Dr. Brock (Scott) suffers a crisis of monumental proportions in middle age before our eyes when we, and he, are delighted at the prospect of his involvement with Miss. Drummond (Rigg). The thread of the absurd is woven into this wonderful mixture in the form of the irony that the Hospital seems to be killing its own workers, for they mismanaged their business. <br /> <br /> The climax is unpredictable (unless you have it en it) and it got even more hilarious if you guess. <br /> <br /> It's not everyone's mood mark, for sure, and it has an incredibly funny "Dark Moment" if you're open to them. I loved every minute and was delighted to watch it on DVD.
