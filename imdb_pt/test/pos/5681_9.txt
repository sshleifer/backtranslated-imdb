I put this film in not to expect too much in addition to a film B film gore. Luckily I was gifted with a very well done film that built the suspense and managed to keep it through the runtime. This was an impressive achievement. The acting was solid, creating characters that you cared about and related to; and although some might find the film slow, they forced you to think about what you would have done in the same situation. Added to that, there was a good camera job and the directors put it all together admirably. An excellent effort then well worth your time if you prefer development and suspense on the blood.
