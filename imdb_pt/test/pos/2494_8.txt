A while back I bought the Fist of the North Star Chinese box set that came with all the North Star Fists, North Star Fist 2, North Star New Fist, and North Star Fist Fist. While there is an American version and some European versions, they end up in the middle of the Northern Star's fist, which is as far as the movie goes. <br /> <br /> The series is about the successor to an ancient martial battle. art called Hokuto Shin Ken (Fist of the North Star) called Kenshiro, or Ken, abbreviated. There is only one successor in each generation. It occurs in a post-apocalyptic future where martial arts are the most powerful weapon. The two most powerful arts are Hokuto Shin Ken and Nanto Divine Ken, as my version calls. Nanto is actually several styles, but they are all the same as they allow a person to cut pieces into pieces. There are six masters of Nanto and each one has its own star. Hokuto is an art that allows someone to damage / kill or heal someone by reaching a point in their body. Each art has its own constellation. Hokuto - Ursa Major, Nanto - Gemini. Kenshiro goes around saving the world from evil, consisting of pursuing his two brothers and three of the masters of Nanto and his armies. Each army captain has his own way of fighting, which makes each episode different and the number of soldiers bloody. In addition, Kenshiro is looking for his girlfriend, Yuria, who was stolen by Master Shin from Nanto. Throughout the journey, Kenshiro is accompanied by his brother Toki after rescuing him from his brother Rao, who is called Kenou or King of Boxing. He is also accompanied by two masters of Nanto, King, who is looking for his sister, who was taken by the brother of Ken, Jagi, and Shu. Both and Toki die along the way. Other characters who join Ken are two boys, Rin and Batto, who do not do much. That's the most I can say about the story since it's so long and full of details. The series is also divided into four parts. <br /> <br /> What makes this program great is the fight. Ken usually comes across a group of people who think they are tough and die in one fell swoop. Which is funny and fuck, but makes fights fast. Another great part is comedy / fury. Ken hits someone and thinks it's nothing. Ken says they're already dead. Then they die. Other parts are when he will hit them and say that they have a few seconds to live. Then an accountant will appear. Or when he says that they are not worthy to know his name. Then there is when he makes a quick kick or punch on the fire and goes to the da. Eventually you can see yourself doing it with him. A big part was when a bad guy thought he knew Hokuto. He went to Ken and hit him. Ken stayed there said he was dead in a few seconds. The thug told and died. It is not limited to Ken everyone kills as fast as. There has never been a character as incredible as Ken and probably never will be. <br /> <br /> There are some problems. One is the repetitive nature. Some flashbacks, especially Yuria's, are touched too, and there are also many recap episodes, especially in part four of the series. In fact, the last episode is a recap of the whole thing. Another problem is the end. The final battle with Rao was not so impressive. Ken and Rao fought, then talked, etc., until Rao came to some conclusion and killed himself instead of Ken killing him. But it's better than the American and European versions that just cut the half. <br /> <br /> For whom would I recommend this? This is for older teens and adults who enjoy action. Since styles make people explode or cut into pieces, violence is very graphic and there is a lot of it, but they do not show much blood because they usually make death only a silhouette that still looks like the person but less colorful. This was probably done to avoid censorship. If you do not like action rent the American version. If you like action, then I say go for import, since you can see all series, but they do not have the best English translation since it is subtitled by the Chinese. Note: My import came with everything I said at the beginning, some imported versions did not, but you still have to get an import to see all the series and Fist of the North Star 2. If you do not think you can manipulate the captions by any reason, then go get the American version. Another note: In the version that I have, no caption was on the last disc of New Fist of the North Star; though, New Fist of the North Star is not too good to begin with. <br /> <br /> I give the show an 8/10 for its high amount of action, good story and the grandeur of Kenshiro. <br /> <br /> **** UPDATE **** <br /> <br /> Toei Animation has released a version subtitled in English. You can download episodes as well as Hokuto on Ken 2 from IGN Direct2Drive or watch it for free on the FUNimation website.
