This movie is probably not the funniest I've ever seen, and CERTAINLY does not have much redeeming value. In fact, it is nothing more than a collection of vignettes linked by a loose plot. However, this "impromptu as I go" attitude really works for the benefit of the movie. "Tommy Boy" succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that the SNL skits Farley and Spade starred in succeeded: their extemporaneous humorous stupidity and clutter makes them good-humored, despite their immaturity.
