The best romantic comedy I've seen in years. It's not the kind of Hollywood film thing about Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler and much less honeyed than an Hugh Grant epic. Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr are perfect and both feature professional performances such as the newlyweds who decide to spend some time sowing their oats before their wedding. Instead of playing strictly for laughter, the writers and director invented a beautiful blend of human feelings and comic action. Nicholson is great as the awkward seductress and Mohr does a great job as the man who reluctantly enters the game but soon finds himself enjoying his moves too much. We see just enough of the supporting characters to complete the plot without distracting from the main story. Andy Richter (sincere friend) and Helen Slater (disturbed single mother) are particularly good. There is enough emotional significance and complexity to make this much more than a normal farce between boys and girls. In fact, with a little more rhythm and a bit more cut, this movie would be one of ten comedies.
