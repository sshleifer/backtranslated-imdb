A study of one of these universally familiar, physical and / or emotional states: isolation. I think the film also comments on cultural displacement. <br /> <br /> The film features the experiences of two Turkish men (cousins). One has money (and the comforts that come from having 'done' with a steady income); the other has none and goes in search of work. Nor are they happy. Do not expect any celebration of life here - that's loneliness, warts and everything. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds in offering a powerfully dark crossing through the 'lowlands' of the human condition. Brave cinema. Well-acted and well-shot in my opinion (shots outdoors by the harbor being my own favorites). A movie that should inspire gratitude in who is not a stranger to happiness and fulfillment in life (not to mention the job); everyone else will find a companion in this movie. A movie with all the heat and rhythm of a block of ice. Expect a bitter pill, not a happy pill.
