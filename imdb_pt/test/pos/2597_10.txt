There's only one movie I can think of that can be as good or better than this when it comes to Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck - ALI BABA BUNNY. However, determining which one is best is irrelevant - just watch both of them and enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> I compared this to ALI BABA BUNNY because they both feature Daffy at their absolute worst - greedy, nasty and very funny in the process. However, I think I prefer RABBIT SEASON simply because Bugs is awful in that - doing horrible things back to Daffy every time Daffy tries a dirty trick. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Daffy leaving the rabbit. track down the Bugs Hole in the hope that a hunter (of course, it's Elmer) will blow the rabbit and leave Daffy alone! Not to be outdone, Bugs takes all the time and picks up all the tricks of Daffy and transforms them - and in most cases involves Daffy being shot in the face! It's all very, very clever and funny and I do not care how old you are, this drawing will make you laugh, unless you're a grump. I particularly love the big and unexpected ending, but I will not say more, since I do not want to ruin the surprise.
