I caught it for the first time a few nights ago on television. I just hoped to tune in for a few minutes, but I found myself intrigued by the film. I ended up watching everything and found it surprisingly attractive. The performance of the three American leaders was very good, especially that of Alex Cord. He plays a gunslinger with a certain degree of vulnerability. Very different from how most of them are portrayed in westerns. He ended up in several situations where he was at the mercy of the bounty hunters. The final shootout between the three leaders and the bad guys was very good, just like the scene where the doctor digs a bullet from Clay McCord. A bit horrible, but realistic. I must admit that, despite my initial doubts about watching a "spaghetti western", I ended up enjoying this movie a lot. I would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.
