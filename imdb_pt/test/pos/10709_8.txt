Favela Rising is a documentary about the favelas of Rio, specifically the most violent, Vicar General. According to this film, many more children have died violently in the slums of Rio in the last decade than in Israel / Palestine during the same period - an amazing fact if true, which shows how little recognized this social problem is in the country. rest of the world. This is an important topic especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to bring together the most needy and most at risk through a vibrant cultural program. This is a compelling documentary if occasionally marked by a somewhat excessively personality-based version of events and video and grainy digital movies that can sometimes make you think you need to have your eyes examined. <br /> <br /> Lords of drugs The rule in favelas and armed boys are the main drug traffickers, as in parts of Colombia. The film by Fernando Meirelles, Cidade de Deus / Cidade de Deus, was accused of celebrating violence (Cidade de Deus is another of Rio de Janeiro's many favelas). But the opening section of Favela Rising shows that, in fact, the favela boys celebrate violence and want to deal with drugs where money and action are. It's legal to carry a gun there, legal to work as a drug dealer: it's fifty times more profitable than the gains available by other means. Mochary first discovered the AfroReggae movement and its leaders Anderson Sá and Jose Junior while visiting Rio for a conference and quickly persuaded their friend and mentor Zimbalist to leave their job and come down to help make a movie with their promise to finance it. Sá's eloquence and charisma and a startling twist in his life make him the center of the film and its main narrator, but like the favelas themselves, the film is filled with other people. No doubt about the fact that Sá is a remarkable leader, organizer and artist. <br /> <br /> Vicar General is compared to Bosnia: filming there was very dangerous. Anderson Sá's friendship, protection, caution, and diplomacy allowed filmmakers to gain access to and film detailed scenes of his affairs while (mostly: close phone calls) avoiding serious confrontations with drug traffickers or drug dealers. They also trained boys to use cameras and left them on trips home. This resulted in 10% of filming, including rare scenes of violent incidents, including police beatings. It is difficult for a stranger to follow the police massacres in Rio. There was one in the early 1990s that came close to the story and inspired Sá, who ended his own precocious involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement. The police are all over the drug trade, and if someone does not like it, poorly trained police paramilitaries arrive (often wearing black ski masks) and slaughter a neighborhood, killing many innocent people. <br /> <br /> This is practically the image that we have in the City of God of Meirelles, except that this time Sá, Júnior and the other guys enter, beginning in Vicar General, but eventually spreading through several other favelas to give percussion classes that attract dozens of young people - girls and boys. Its program AfroReggae (Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR), formed in 1993, is a new alternative way of life for black youth in the ghettos of Rio. This leads them to leave behind tobacco, alcohol and drugs (this is the rule ) to explode in rap, music, percussion and gymnastics in expressive and galvanic performances. Eventually, the best of the Sá-led artists end up appearing before large local audiences with local producers, and their AfroReggae Band has an international recording contract. <br /> <br /> Other centers and groups were created by or through the GCAR. over the years in Vigário Geral and other favelas to seek youth improvement by providing training and stage performances of music, capoeira, theater, hip-hop and dance at GCAR centers. <br /> <br /> The performing arts are not all just the focal point. GCAR is also a movement for broader social change Bringing public awareness through such presentations, centers also provide training in information (newspaper, radio, Internet, e-mail links), hygiene and sex education, to try to fill the gaps between rich and poor. , black and white, and offer audiovisual workshops, including documentary production. Currently, the program is active in four other favelas. <br /> <br /> There are many street scenes of favela and domestic life in Favela Rising and they look a lot like the images of the City of God with the important difference that the focus and results are much, much more positive. Not that it's not a difficult battle. And the corruption of the police, the inequalities of the social system and the indifference of the population in general of Brazil are not directly addressed by any of this. But there is a scene where Sá talks to some children in another favela, cynical boys who are not enthusiastic about AfroReggae and who are determined to work in drug trafficking, as Sá himself did when he was a boy. Sá does not seem to convince any of them, although he points out that the traffickers do not reach the age of 50. But we learned that the most negative boy in this group, Richard Morales, joined the movement five months later. There is also the account of an awkward accident that disabled Sá, but with a positive result. It would be great if the images were clearer and clearer and if the story was edited a bit, but this is vibrant and inspiring material and represents a committed and risky documentary, and it is good that Favela Rising has been included in seven film festivals and won several awards including Best New Documentary at the Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently being shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London. However, a wide audience of art houses in the US seems unlikely. <br /> <br /> Included in SFIFF 2006.
