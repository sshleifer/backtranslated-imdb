A little "the movie in the movie" case, or as the theme is virtual play here, which is the reality or even more frightening what reality is the "real" one. Like any Cronenberg there are organic things such as pod and what wonderful idea : the organic weapon, a weapon made of bones and tissues that fires the teeth. If there are slower times, the sets, designs and ideas are there with some thoughts of revolution. It may not be appreciated because the way the movie is going is quite unusual and sometimes disturbing, but definitely worth it.
