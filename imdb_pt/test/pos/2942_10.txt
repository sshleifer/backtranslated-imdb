I saw this movie with my friends and we all loved it! It's so sweet and moving, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after seeing the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things that every family goes through, it's something anyone can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anyone looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will love it! : D It's a real story about a royal family that draws the strings of someone's heart. Not to mention the beautiful scenery and the fantastic performance. See, I'm sure you're going to love it as much as I loved it!
