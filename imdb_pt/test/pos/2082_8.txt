This is a great movie, full of characters and interesting situations. Although not the same class as some of the best-known films of his time, it is still extremely watchable and memorable. The scene where Zachary Scott, sitting on a bus, casually steals the pilot's pin from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him, is great. He defines his character beautifully - a guy who is so low, he will steal something invaluable to a war veteran, to use as a support in his various charades. He easily lies as the situation demands, and he captivates the women of the Fenchurch family with their irresistible charm and that murderous smile. <br /> <br /> I could not help but wonder if this movie was meant to capitalize on success. scored by Mildred Pierce. Scott and Bruce Bennett were united again, and Faye Emerson bears some resemblance to Joan Crawford, with her bony facial structure and large eyes. In addition, the character Mona Freeman is no different from the hateful Veda in Mildred Pierce. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous comment that the ending of the film was very funny, with the convenient fall on a cliff by "Ronnie Mason" character of Zachary Scott. In addition, in one of the final scenes, we see spoiled Mona Freeman reuniting with her boyfriend whom she had previously dismissed in favor of the older, softer Zachary Scott. I think the script should have called her to be punished for her behavior and for her cruelty towards her sister, instead of treating it as just a typical teenage episode. But those are minor flaws in a movie that would otherwise be nice and well done.
