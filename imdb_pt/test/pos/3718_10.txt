This is an example of what film school speakers would call a good debut film. Follow all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cockroaches for filming, production of guerilla films, no scenery (only abandoned buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Moreover, even the black and white film was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense than the film effect, but it worked. <br /> <br /> Reno was amazing like Brute. Everyone is acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective, and there were no limp pieces left to distract him. A fair, well-crafted and economical budget film. <br /> <br /> Launched in 1983, this would have been done just before the art of big-budget action shows was refined by the Hollywood film-making engine. and film production was more exclusive and therefore harder and more in need of the right people in the right places than the current world of the internet, then Luc Besson would have to negotiate to achieve that result, which makes the final product even more remarkable. <br /> <br /> But again, the French film industry has always maintained an excellent reputation (yes, I know that Luc Besson is Belgian, but the film is a French production) and has been the source of many Hollywood remakes . <br /> <br /> If I have a criticism, is that the DVD cover (and possibly the original sales poster) bears no resemblance to any movie and seems to be a rather bizarre, rather than representative image of any of the movi Themes and - at first glance, appears to be a man in post-apocalyptic armor on a swing, but on the second inspection reveals a man in armor with a spear in an office chair with his legs on a table in a recumbent , confident self-posture. This never happens in the movie once. <br /> <br /> It's a black and white movie, zero dialogue, physical acting, tight scenes and brilliant actors that make it a movie that's worth adding to your particular collection of movies. A superb movie.
