First of all I have to say that I am a big fan of Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento. Although I have not seen absolutely all of his films, I really enjoyed almost everyone I've seen. I really like giallos and I thought Argento was the master of this genre, after seeing movies like "Tenebre" and "Phenomena". But after I saw Fulci's "New York Ripper," I discovered that he could make very good giallos beyond his zombie graphics movies and even overcome Argento on a certain level. <br /> <br /> I love Fulci's style, and yes, I love gore, but I think this movie, although it has a plot and characters more developed than its other films, is not the best of it. What I do not like is that it can be confusing at times, especially in the end. And the fact that we go from one suspect to another, and then another until we suspect the retarded girl for a moment, I think it goes too far. I know the Gypsies should keep him guessing until the end, and the killer must be very hard to find, but this movie touches a bit too much in our minds. However, I liked the scene where the witch is dead, I think it is very well made and gave me goosebumps. The acting is also very good and the photography is great. <br /> <br /> Although it's not a bad movie, I think Lucius Fulci made better films than that, and I think his best is "O Beyond". , a very different film but a more atmospheric and visual experience. <br /> <br /> I give "Do not torture a duckling" to 7 of 10. <br /> <br />
