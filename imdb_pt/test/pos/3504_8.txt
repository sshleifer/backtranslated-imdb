As someone who generally despises Ali G, Ali G Indahouse was absolutely brilliant. When I was watching, I was in a hysterical attack. Yes, it's sexist, rude and extremely rude, and I loved it. Since some comedies have only one or two comic scenes, this movie was fun. I've never seen an original comedy like Ali G Indahouse. For a comedy starring Ali G, this would be worth a 8 out 10. Absolutely brilliant.
