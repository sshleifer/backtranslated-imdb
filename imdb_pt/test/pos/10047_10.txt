I saw this movie at Christmas, and what a great movie it was! It tells the story of Custer (played by Errol Flynn) during and after his graduation at Westpoint. Although I have heard that the film is not very accurate historically (Hollywood never is), I still liked it, since I knew little about the actual events. <br /> <br /> I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favorite actor! His performance alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the finale was fantastic! It brought me to tears when he and Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) rode to death on their little horn. <br /> <br /> I always knew that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my father's favorite actor. and I grew up watching his movies as a kid. But it was only when I watched this movie that I realized how great it really was. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie 10 out of 10 !!
