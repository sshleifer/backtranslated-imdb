Like most people, I was interested in "More" just because of Pink Floyd's soundtrack, which turned out to be Pink Floyd's only album that I still listen to after all these years. It was a great surprise to cross the film at a local video store in a digitally remastered version. It was an even greater surprise to think it's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> Visually it is very beautiful, especially when the two main characters are digging in the rocks on the Spanish island of Ibiza. And the use of music from the soundtrack, which as far as I can tell is exclusively from Pink Floyd, is excellent. It was a joy to watch the movie with my copy of the album by my side, mentally marking each track as it was used in the film. The short "A Spanish Piece" by Dave Gilmour was the only one I did not hear, and several tracks are used prominently, especially "Cymbaline", "Main Theme" and "Quicksilver". That last track is boring on the soundtrack album, but it works great during the sequel to the title of the movie, resurfacing at least once later. Maybe now I can enjoy it on the album, now that I have some visuals to accompany it in my mind. <br /> <br /> The plot of "More" is a little hard to take sometimes, especially in the beginning going, when the film seems to be just a vehicle to demonstrate the hypnosis of those involved in doing so. But eventually the film proves that it has much more than that to offer, as the plot becomes more focused. Why does Stefan take heroin? Why does someone take heroin, fully aware of the possible consequences? The film does not attempt to answer this question directly, but Stefan's use of heroin seems a logical extension of his stubborn pursuit of pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to any fan of Pink Floyd who has an appreciation of the "More" soundtrack underestimated. I also recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the counterculture of the 60's and how it was portrayed in the media. I have no idea how realistic this movie is, since I'm too young to have experienced the sixties firsthand, but it seems to capture the spirit of the times in a way no other movie does.
