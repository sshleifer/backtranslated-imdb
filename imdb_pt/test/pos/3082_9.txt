Like many children born in the 1980s, I grew up in Mel Brooks films that were not necessarily the most "racial" ones like Blazing Saddles and History of the World part 1 (I saw them, of course, though not as often as now) , but meanings for the "whole family", Spaceballs, and this movie. I knew at the time I was not seeing a great art, but just an extravagant, goofy movie, though always laughable about Robin Hood and / or adventure films. But calling it family movie quotes means that a) adults can really enjoy it as much as children, if not more because of the little internal jokes and nonsense and b) when a child sees, when to revisit, as I have some Sometimes it's still so fresh, but with some things not well understood the first time. It is a comedy that is not only full of jokes in Robin Hood movies and other films (godfather, of course, as well as small mentions for other movies of modern times), but which also makes reference to the Brooks films; this is a filmmaker who is not above ridiculing even his own style. <br /> <br /> Basic storyline - Robin Hood (Cary Elwes in one of his best shifts) returns home from the Crusades to see things are in danger with King Richard gone and so on to recover his land and , of course, rob the rich to feed the poor. Along the way, he meets Achoo (Dave Chappelle), beats heads with Prince John (Richard Lewis) and the Sheriff, and of course, still yearns for the love of Maid Marian. This, of course, is the usual clothesline for Brooks to let comedy run into the scenes, and although sometimes a joke does not work or can become obsolete on a repeat show, many of them let out that it's hard not to laugh. It also helps that some pieces are one of the best in any Brooksfilm, such as Godfather (Dom DeLouise at its best), Brooks' own involvement as Rabbi, Lewis and Chappelle roles, and a plethora of quotes. lines and a couple of ironic songs. Some of them are obvious, yes, some of them are taken from the pages of Blazing Saddles, for sure, but is it a good time for the right crowd? Definitely - and for parents who grew up in Brooks 'work of the' 70s, it's a fantastic way to introduce young people to their work through it. (Even suggestive sexual jokes and such are not classified as R, all in good fun.)
