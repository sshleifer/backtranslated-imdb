I did something a little bold today when I watched this movie. I tried to get away from the silent movie scores. Of course, when this film was originally distributed, a piano score was probably played with it. Often, the director would choose the score (Charlie Chaplin used to compose the scores of his last silent films). But most of the songs you hear on VHS tapes about silent films are not the same music that should be played when the movie was first released. And again, there were many silent films that were played without punctuation. I do not know the history of Potemkin's score, so I decided to watch it for the medium in which this piece of art was produced within the film. <br /> <br /> Soon after I turned the music off, without help (or should I say unhindered) by the musical interpretation of the emotions on the screen, I completely attached myself to the film. Visually, it is easily one of the most impressive of all movies. Eisenstein was a master of composition. The editing, possibly the cinematic technique for which Eisenstein is most famous (montage), is extraordinary. The mood of this movie is anger, and it has roused my passions violently. <br /> <br /> It takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent movie, especially a drama, but films like Battleship Potemkin prove that this effort is totally worth it. Let's go! You owe it to yourself to watch this movie! Your education is incomplete without it.
