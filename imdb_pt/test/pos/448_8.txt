Anatole Litvak directed the 1959 film, "The Journey," starring Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr, Robert Morley, E.G. Marshall, Anne Jackson and Jason Robards. <br /> <br /> The film takes place during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and concerns a group of travelers who have had trouble leaving Budapest because of political problems in that part of the world. They are put on a bus to Vienna, but the Russians, led by Major Surov (Brynner), confiscate their passports and hold them for questioning. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards) posing as an American, but in reality a Hungarian freedom fighter, who the Major believes is being smuggled out of Hungary. In fact, Lady Ashmore (Kerr) is hiding it. It becomes the focus of the Major's romantic attentions. Very good film that conveys the tension and the annoyance of the Cold War, and all the performances are wonderful. Brynner is particularly excellent as the passionate major who is not all bad, and Anne Jackson gives a realistic and powerful performance as a pregnant woman who does not want her child to be born in a communist country. <br /> <br /> script, good director, good cast - there should be more movies like this. Highly recommended.
