This is a strange and compelling movie. The topic, about the atomic bombs created in Los Alamos, NM in the USA and used in Japan during the latter part of World War II, is huge and, of course, deeply disturbing. The plot of the film takes on many weighty issues and the actors have to withstand much of the creative tension. I had never seen the movie, or was very interested in it, I have to admit, until I read the book "Smoking in Bed: Talks with Bruce Robinson." Robinson wrote the story and the script. I think the movie was better than I expected reading from Robinson's point of view in the conversations about it, but I can see how he thought it had derailed. I think Paul Newman is very good, but it's somehow in the background, miscast. He's very Hollywood. At one point, a big, mean-spirited guy appears in Newman's office and has such a strong presence that I immediately thought he should be playing the character Newman is playing. The other leader, who plays the lead scientist, is also pretty good, but somehow not bright enough to portray the enormous anguish that goes with it - the immense responsibility for creating a final machine of death and destruction. One of the most effective characters seems to be a composite personality, played by John Cusack. It's strangely affecting the whole movie, and in the end, it's the character whose fate really comes home and it made me think more vividly about the fate of over 200,000 Japanese in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
