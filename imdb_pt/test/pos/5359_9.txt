This first (and hopefully not last) Wallace & Gromit live up to expectations. There are plenty of jokes (some a little cheeky) as well as some great tributes to past science fiction films. With the flurry of horrible, stereotypical movies being cast from Hollywood, it's great to see a movie as good as this one, which is enjoyable to almost everyone. If there is justice, it will be the top of the box office and at least nominated for better animation at the next Oscars. The animation is wonderful; the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are very entertaining. This is one of those movies that the whole family can enjoy. Charming, intelligent, fun and well done, what's not to enjoy?
