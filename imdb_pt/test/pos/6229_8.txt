A group of young adults gets stranded at the back of the beyond, where the only place in the neighborhood is a museum full of wax dolls, and the only kind of help is the affable Mr. Slausen local (Chuck Connors). When night falls, children are picked up in record time. <br /> <br /> A strange and weird B movie that combines the strangeness of the sertao settings with the plot of very realistic mannequins (making this a good update of the genre "bodies in the wax museum", this is a festival of (It should not be surprising that TCSM art director Robert A. Burns repeats this duty here, and his eye for a great stage decoration will always be useful.) .) The soundtrack of Pino Donaggios is absolutely chilling, accompanied by the obscure photograph of Nicholas von Sternberg, soaking the film in an oppressive atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The plot twists vary in success; I saw it coming a mile away, and one that really caught me by surprise, and I was happier for it. One of the best moments is shared with us almost at the front, since the first chump victim is stuck in a room with flying objects for him of his own free will. The capper is a large impalement by pipes with blood dripping from the end. Star Connors delivers an engaging performance as our good old antagonist, while the younger co-stars, predictably, can not act at the same level, although Jocelyn Jones is a nice, decent girl who has enough appeal to be considered a nice damsel in distress. Co-star Tanya Roberts (a brunette in this film) is well in support. (If I had a problem with this movie, it's just that the victims are a bit stupid. So again, this does not make it very different from many horror movies of the '80s.) Noteworthy future names among credits are future directors . Ted Nicolaou, who was the editor here, Ron Underwood (who made a major debut almost ten years later with "Tremors") as assistant director, and veteran makeup artist Ve Neill, who has made many films and has won three Oscars since then. Although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements, this is a small surprise that premier director David Schmoeller delivers with conviction and enthusiasm. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
