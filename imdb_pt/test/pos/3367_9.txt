I have to say that some of the other reviews in this movie that I read show very little understanding of him or the original TV series from which he originated. Dad's army was a comedy and therefore had humor and so is required to put a smile on the face of the terrible situation. However, the series contained many serious messages, such as the 'Branded' episode, about the fanaticism and ignorance that were attributed to conscientious objectors. The film was true to the series and was simply like an extended episode. So I'm afraid that the reviewer who claimed that Columbia improved mood was completely wrong and let's face it - the BBC sitcoms of that period hit anything that left the hands of the United States. Also the comments about advertising were also out of the question. Homeguard were people considered unfit for the frontline service they still wanted to serve. They were very brave men who knew they were sentenced to death as soon as they registered, when Hitler announced that anyone who did so would be executed if and when Britain was invaded. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to clarify things, since it is always good to talk and comment on what was seen, instead, to make things happen.
