watch this movie. It really is a good walk through the hardships of making an independent film, and what happens when it explodes in the face of the filmmaker. There is a lot about punk rock and the philosophy behind this movement and its relationship with this project. So, if you like old punk, American punk, you're going to enjoy it ... but, beware, there are a ton of bad acting bits of failed design that are incorporated ... but they come out funny at times. and in fact some of the best parts are listening to people who have never been involved in the pontificate of the film and what they have been through in the three years that were needed to put it into practice. So anyone who is about to make a movie, especially if you did not go to film school or worked in the field, you should watch this and learn from the filmmaker's mistakes.
