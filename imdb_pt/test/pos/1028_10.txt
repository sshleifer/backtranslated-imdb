>>> Great News there is a BBC DVD release scheduled for July 31, 2006, UK - there is also a scheduled release in the United States - do not know the date - can not wait! ! <<<<< Below is my original comment <<<<<< I agree with all the other reviewers - it is simply amazing that one of the biggest TV dramas have never been released on DVD <br /> <br /> The plot is exciting - the acting is great and the character's development is captivating! <br /> <br /> Here in the UK we have a story enough to get TV shows and DVD movies through popular campaigns. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to see why rights owners do not go in a DVD production? I will send an email to one of the main protagonists of this grassroots movement and see what happens. Who did the production? was BBC? RW
