THE SEA INSIDE a film by Alejandro Amenabar. Almodovar has always delivered the banner of Spanish cinema for years, out of nowhere came Amenabar reinventing genres and injecting some blood into the Spanish industry, now in a big bet, he shifts from psychological terror to drama social, well, the big ones would be, the public is ready to embrace the coup and, more importantly, he can hold the flag? This is the story of Ramon Sampedro, a sailor who in his twenties was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident at sea and his struggle with the Spanish government for the right to end his life. The story has the traits of an afternoon made for the TV melodrama and the only way this works is through honest words and performances and both come in swords. Mateo Gil and Amenabar co-write in a way that the public should not be blind to the end of death but they are encouraged to make their own decisions in the process and this is a brilliant coup, this is not a movie to death , but a film in favor of the final illusions of our time FREEDOM. There are some laughter reserved by the way, like when the church comes home in a wheelchair to deconstruct Sampedro's beliefs, but it's mostly a valley of tears, punches coming from all fronts, even when you think you're safe from your father at this point, it makes no sense to come up with the most moving line of the entire film. Is it a moving experience, especially when Sampedro seems more alive than most people wandering the streets and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life, even those who are helping him to die? but when do you take a man out of your dreams? The film is almost exclusively built in close-ups bringing a claustrophobic feeling that makes the public more sympathetic with Sampedro. This is for the actors a huge challenge that must build their entire performances with their eyes and their eyes do not lie. Bardem did not receive his second Oscar nomination, probably in favor of Eastwood, but in my opinion he was the only one who could have followed Jammie Fox. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, where acting seemed effortless and I think Bardem has reached this status where the line of what is acting and what is real has completely blurred. I never liked his first works, but since Almod√≥var's LIVE FLESH show, LOS MONDAYS THE SUN, THE DANCER UPSTAIRS and the Oscar nominee BEFORE NIGHT FALLS made him an international star and although he and Banderas came from the same Almodovar O Bottom line is fascinating to see how the paths were different and how Bardem became a true reference for Spanish cinema around the world. A golden globe, 14 Goyas, jury prize in Venice and probably an Oscar with permission from THE CHORUS BOYS, Amenabar directs, co-writes, edits and puts the music in a high caliber drama, did he succeed? How about a science fiction now? Whose life is it, anyway?
