TV News producer Jane Craig (Hunter) meets Tom Grunick (Hurt), a newscaster on the rise, at a seminar, and their mutual attraction takes them back to their bedroom. Romance, however, is interrupted when it emerges that Tom is, in his own words, "no good at what I'm being a success in," and Jane realizes that he embodies everything she hates about where the news on TV they are going. The problem arises when Tom reveals that he is about to join his news office in Washington. <br /> <br /> Jane and Tom's initial attraction therefore has a second chance, but Jane can leave aside her professional opinion on the subject. the man she is attracted to - and should she? Aaron Altman (Brooks) is Jane's highly intelligent colleague and confidante. Despite his obvious talent, Aaron's career is stagnating, since he lacks the confidence and personal skills - and classic good looks - to be the success that his new colleague, less qualified and less intelligent - Tom - is getting. making. He is also concerned that his good friend Jane may fall in love with Tom, despite his better judgment, as it becomes increasingly clear that Aaron has his own romantic feelings for her. <br /> <br /> This central romantic plot is set within the trials and tribulations of a TV network office, where ethical dilemmas and ethics are fought quickly and where appearances and dramatic effects are becoming more prevalent important. <br /> <br /> Here is where most of the bite comes from. of comments and well-observed scenes. One of the many moments is a scene in which Tom meets Network host Bill Rorich (a special guest of Jack Nicholson) for the first time, and the camera focuses on his handshake. In a movie full of big lines and dialogues, long and short, you realize a lot about the character of these two men from this fast two-handed shot. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between the characters is among the most intelligent and witty you are likely to find anywhere in the movie and in such abundance. Brooks gets the best of them, according to his character, but even the brief conversations that are accidental and perhaps overheard by one or more characters as they move through a crowded room must be heard. Hunter is a tour-de-force in this role for which she was right (and not alone) nominated for an Oscar, and for which she would probably have been for a role in a movie that did not mock part of what has become a closely related industry - and against a strong performance of another actress in a more traditional feel-good, rom-com. <br /> <br /> Brooks is also excellent as the constantly frustrated and occasionally overconfident for his own good, Aaron Altman. <br /> <br /> Hurt, while possessing the look and personality required of his character, does not always convince him that he is as weak as witty the character says he is or ought to be. He exhibits a latent intelligence that allows him to make the most of his apparent limitations, which may be plausible, but I do not think Hurt is quite capable. In addition to when he tells us that he "stinks" or "does not understand," Hurt is a little smarter than that. Otherwise, it's an effective performance, in a role where your character is compromised by your intellectual limitations, but Brooks and Hunter slightly outperform Hurt's performance. It's the only negative thing I can say about the whole movie, and who can say that anyone else would have done better, or better out, when next to Hunter and Brooks and their performances in this movie. The support is expertly provided by Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles and Joan Cusack among others, and there is also a small part for Christian Clemenson's subsequent Boston Legal fame, and the shorter part for Joan's . brother, John Cusack, whose face you do not even see. <br /> <br /> James L Brooks provided us with many great TV shows and movies, and this movie should be rated with the best. It may not have won any Oscars, despite seven nominations, but it has won many other awards and has made Holly Hunter a star.
