Six-shooter, Tunnel Sergeant, Dr. Death, Pinhead, Cyclops and Blade help young Andre Toulon defeat Sutek's Egyption captain in the best sequel this series has ever seen. <br /> <br /> Retro Puppet Master is atmospheric with many sets, acting quality and some fun FX puppet. What is lacking in gore, makes up for with an interesting, well-paced plot. <br /> <br /> Best quote: Dr. Death: "Do not you know, my friends? Smell the sulfur, see the smoke ..." <br /> <br /> This is easily the best Dave movie DeCoteau I've seen. The actors do a more than credible job: Jack Donner as "Azfel" performs an inspired performance, and young Toulon gets on well with the dolls. Oh, and the ring needle is cool. <br /> <br /> The score of John Massari is a great symphony about the original songs of Puppet Master of Richard Band, keeping the movie playful and scary. It's rare that a Full Moon soundtrack really adds something to a movie, and it does. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Dave Allen did not seem to be affordable enough for the Band and Co. in the late 1990s. And beyond, then all the puppets' action is done with stick and rope. There is no stop motion like the famous and funny scene from the original where Pinhead is looking for his pinhead. And of course, as in the whole passage of the Full Moon of that period, the RPM was filmed in and around the Castel Studios in Bucharest, so that most parts were released to the Romanians: listening to their "Parisian" accents was a little irritating In short, this is probably one of the 10 best movies of the Full Moon. It is certainly the most inventive of Puppet Master sequels.
