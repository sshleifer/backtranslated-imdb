A very cute film about a young Chinese person in love with Western technology and an Englishman trying to make his fortune show films in China. It's a very interesting story that is presumably based on true events, although I'm assuming it's more fantasy than real. It has a fairy tale quality that you rarely get in real life, and it also has 8 people credited for the script, so they must have invented things from the right and left. <br /> <br /> This is a very nice film that conveys how the magic movie was for people who had never seen it before. It is not a particularly profound film, briefly touching on the loss of tradition and the invasion of Western culture, but mainly being just a nice little film. In fact, it's a movie that I really enjoyed and it's already starting to fade from my mind 15 minutes after seeing it. Light as souffl√©, but enjoyed every minute.
