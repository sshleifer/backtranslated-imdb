The first time I saw this movie, it did not seem to go anywhere. When I saw it a second time, it made a lot more sense. Take a chance, watch more than once, there are many key elements that shape the story that can be missed on the first and second time watching. The Cohen brothers brilliantly weave the real events of the early 20th century into this story to create a convincing scenario and story. The combination of Clooney's leading role matches well with the supporting acts of Turturro and Nelson. The appearance of John Goodman in the film is hilarious. The soundtrack is great too. This movie became a home favorite for my family. 10/10, for sure.
