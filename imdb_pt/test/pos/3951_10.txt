Reaches the minds and feelings of all leading into the depths of the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and nervous layers of sound and punctuation. The landscape develops its own persona, parallel to the internal geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The emptiness of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then the transcendence of emptiness by the very opening of this desolation. Three misguided souls struggling to find something absolute and positive throughout this negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his colleagues perform skilful performances. Naive student, suicidal blonde, bitchy car thief - everything converges with unexpected twists. Together, they create an explosive portrait of a fractured love - which unconsciously conspires to repair amid the most difficult forms of adversity and illusion - the blindness of human emotions.
