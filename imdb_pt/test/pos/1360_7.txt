An affectionately silly anime with only six episodes of duration, about an unfortunate deliveryman named Kintaro (well, he is called deliverer, although he must be in his 20s), and the adventures he has in his travels. Each episode sees him coming to a new city, getting a new job, developing something of love interest before each episode ends with him leaving. <br /> <br /> Deliberately sexist, juvenile, very immature at times, this is the kind of anime that just puts a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> It's not to start if you're not an anime fan as this will certainly not convince you about the genre but for those who are already converted, this is fluff fun.
