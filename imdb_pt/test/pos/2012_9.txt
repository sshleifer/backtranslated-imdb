I enjoyed this show, it was in the UK but not at peak times, and they seemed to move all about the schedules so I was not able to watch them all. I was surprised when he did not come back and I had no idea why, I still do not know, but I think it's not important. <br /> <br /> Great performances from both leaderships, they were very believable as friends. . The two supporting actresses also added well to the mix. I think it was part of a series of shows that were centered on lifestyle, with Friends being the main obvious, but sex in the city appeared a few years later. <br /> <br /> The characters, they get coffee, they drink in good bars, that kind of thing, a little woody, in a way.
