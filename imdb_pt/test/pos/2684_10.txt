This is the best comedy period. It is so underrated! Smart smart humor, great cast! Jerry Stiller is the gem of the show, he's so incredibly funny and quirky, simply a comic genius! Doug and Carrie have great chemistry! I do not see what the hype is about when it comes to Everybody loves Raymond is so overrated with lame jokes mostly forced humor and not just the spirited show, I do not remember laughing in more than 1 episode. King of Queens is a rare comedy that has all the right ingredients to give you serious belly laughs that are usually caused by Arthur Spooner, I think it's time for this comedy to get the hype it deserves and not the lame Raymond & CO .
