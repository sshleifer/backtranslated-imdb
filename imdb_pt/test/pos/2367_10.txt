A lot of "alternative" comedies in Britain in the 1980s were insular, misguided, overly political and bland, and the worst of the Comic Strip presents ... stuff in that category. <br /> <br /> But this is on the other side - a remarkable film that works on different intellectual levels. Is Dennis a mentor to crime or are you lying? <br /> <br /> Is he telling the truth, bluffing? , bluffing doubly, bluffing doubly bubbly, regardless of what? <br /> <br /> I've probably watched Supergrass 20 or 30 times, and still can not decide 100%. This is the wonderful thing. As well as Ade Edmonson, there are great roles for other important comic strip members - French & Saunders, Pete Richardson, Alexei Sayle, Keith Allen, Nigel Planer and Robbie Coltrane, Interestingly, not Rik Mayall. Everyone on the Comic Strip - as much as I did not like the hidden agenda of some of their members - are compelling actors, and perform extraordinary performances in this big-screen movie, while the work of the Richardson-Richens's writers are so often genius, with little details. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is a study of crime, criminology and human nature in all its incredible complexity. And very funny with that. You will not be disappointed.
