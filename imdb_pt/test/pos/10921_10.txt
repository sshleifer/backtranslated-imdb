Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a teacher who is about to get married. Then one of his alumni wins an Oscar for a movie in which he plays a gay soldier and thanks Howard in his acceptance speech, showing that he's gay too! This film follows the result of reporters in the village of Howard and he tries to convince everyone that he is straight. <br /> <br /> I love this movie! Kevin Kline is wonderful, has really hilarious moments and always makes me great with a huge smile on his face. Consequently, it's a movie that I like to watch as fast as I can. If you have not seen it, you're missing out!
