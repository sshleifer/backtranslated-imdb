I do not know about the English version of this movie, but the Norwegian translation is the funniest movie I've seen in many years. The characters say so many funny things and make so many strange references to current events that I'm amazed they keep having more options like the architect who can never say the name of the Miraculix magician correctly. It becomes things like Malcom (i) X and "utenriks", which is Norwegian for foreign affairs. Like the word "utenriks," many of the translations give no meaning in English, and probably not even in French, so the translators must have come up with their own jokes and did very well. Of course, they have a really good base to build, with a movie that's simply comic from beginning to end! <br /> <br /> Recommended in all languages ​​with a good translation!
