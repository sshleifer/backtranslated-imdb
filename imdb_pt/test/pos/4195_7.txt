You really need to remember the Monkees and have a clear understanding of where and how they fit in the second half of the 1960s in order to fully appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> There is no plot as such. Basically, it's a crazy, mixed pastiche of several unrelated sequences. But it is interesting and fun in a peculiar way when you reach its wavelength. In short, it was a classic, cleverly designed and well-crafted example of experimental cinema of the late 60's. It contains some good songs, some ultra-groovy cinematography and many other worthwhile ideas in terms of film technique. <br /> I give him 7 out of 10 for several reasons. First, it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream, in which both its stars and their producers were firmly sheltered at the time. If a movie fails at the box office, the consequences can be terrible for everyone involved. Secondly, it was, for the most part, a creative success. And finally, as already mentioned, it is unquestionably a classic of the genre and as such is historically important. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Head" arrived too late in the Monkees' career. But again, they would not have been allowed to do so earlier because it was essentially a very sharp and cynical satire of their own image. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the members of the group knew very well that the whole Monkees monster had just run when they started working on this project. In a way, it was to be their swan song and they were determined to let it all out. They were tired of being treated like mere pawns in the high-powered corporate game they had been manipulated and exploited in recent years. In short, they "wanted to leave" and they were going to say a few things before they left. <br /> <br /> The story, however, justified the band. Let the critics be cursed. The Monkees, left behind some of the best, most polished and successful pop albums of the decade. Yes, they had a lot of help. But at the end of the day, they were in front of the studio microphones, they were in the movies and on the TV cameras and did the shows. They were fun and a little crazy. But, unlike some of his contemporaries, they were never menacing. You could safely introduce a monkey for your old aunt. "Head" probably borrows a little too much from the Beatles' "Hard Day Night," but it's still worth taking a fresh look at those who were around at the time. or for younger retr√≥filos that have the capacity to appreciate its meaning. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
