I really enjoyed Manna from Heaven. The hopes, dreams and perspectives of each of the characters are captivating and we, the public, know each one of them, the warts and everything. And the end was a great, wonderful and uplifting surprise! Thanks for the experience; I'll be looking forward to more.
