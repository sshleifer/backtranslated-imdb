I finally saw it on video, after years of hearing about it. It is by no means a perfect movie, but it is strangely hypnotic - one of those rare special films that creates its own world. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** First, the bad things. The scenes in Burkewaite's class are excruciating. Even though the subject is Social Studies, this guy is very exaggerated. His speeches are so exaggerated that they are laughable. And no teacher I ever had would scream his students like that, and say to those who protest to "shut up!" These scenes are brief, but they break the mood and rob the viewer of the story. Then how did Layne just leave the station near the end? Also, what happened to Samson's car after his first scene riding in the city? He spends the rest of the film being surrounded by Layne or Feck. *** END SPOILERS *** Ahhh, Feck ... this guy is great. Dennis Hopper steals the film effortlessly. "Check in the mail", "I love company", "you are my friend" - each line is a classic. He gives Feck an inner logic that makes history work. Incredibly, he really makes the audience empathize with this guy, especially when Samson talks about his future (Samson). <br /> <br /> In contrast, Crispin Glover is difficult to accept sometimes. However, the scenes of him driving through the Beetle are perfect - kids with cars in high school always have something to do, and friends to do it. Matt's discreet attitude plays a good role for Layne - their friendship is believable. Glover's mannerisms are a little too much, but he's consistent throughout the process. He directs the plot and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else does - just try to picture this movie if Layne were as zombie as Matt or Samson - snoozefest! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** What makes River's Edge unsettling is the fact that Samson is not really evil in the usual sense. He's a kind of boring guy who got tired of being given as guaranteed - in other words, he's like thousands of other boring guys. After he kills Jamie, he begins to unravel, which creates some suspense as we wait to see when he will break again. *** END SPOILERS *** Part of the appeal of this film is how the action is centered around the teenagers and their point of view. The parents are comic relief - the mother of Clarissa, Tony's father - or oppressed - Matt's mother. This underscores how children are united by the attention that no one else gives them. He keeps the story focused on the relationships within the clique and emphasizes that the only adult with whom they can relate is Feck. "River's Edge" is a book about alienation. She conveys how awkward, mysterious and disconcerting adolescence is like no other movie.
