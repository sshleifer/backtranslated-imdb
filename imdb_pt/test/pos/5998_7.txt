At first I did not like the way the director was constantly shifting from the past (gulliver's travels) to the present (gulliver in the asylum). But it's really the best way to film the story, even if it took some getting used to. Danson is excellent as the title character and edward fox makes a wonderful villain. The worst part is mary steenburgen as gulliver's wife. She has never been wonderful in Hollywood and in this movie they make her look downright sloppy for some reason. I will never understand why the directors make an ugly woman when it adds nothing to the story! Besides, you want to strangle her for being so stupid to believe the lies that the evil Bates keeps telling her. Even her son can see through the bastard. Still a good show and I rate it B +.
