The film is a remake of a 1956 BBC series called 'My Friend Charles', and as such gallops through the material in a relatively short time. I thought it was moving fast, nice and unpretentious. Someone else noticed the scenes in the end. , where John Mills was being attacked with gas? - producers obviously decided to omit the scenes - perhaps censorship - but watch as he sits by the window of the apartment, breathing heavily followed closely by similar scenes with the car window open. All the serials of Francis Durbridge seemed to inhabit the same universe, that of unexplainable events, people not being what they seem and the villain being someone close to the hero / victim. A predictable universe in some respects, but one with its own rules and regulations. .
