A quick glimpse at the premise of this movie seems to indicate just another 80's inebed / backwood slash-fest; the kind in which sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes that you really want to die. However, "JBD" offers considerably more. <br /> <br /> Instead of focusing on naked flesh and bleeding (although there is a bit of each - there is no sex though), the film focuses on delivering impending dread / tension-set amidst a beautiful setting scenic. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically lovelier characters and antagonists who are more amoral than the definitions of evil in cardboard. Oh yeah George Kennedy is here too and when is not that a good thing? <br /> <br /> If you like "Wrong Turn," then watch this to see where most of your methodology comes from.
