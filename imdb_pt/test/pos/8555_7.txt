I watched this movie on TV after 30 years or so. Several aspects of the film stood out even when they saw it so many years after it was made. <br /> <br /> The story of the little-known C Virgil Georghiu is remarkable, almost resembling a Tolstoy story of a man whipped. by a cosmic scheme he can not understand. Contrast this film with well-known contemporary works such as Spelberg's "Schindler's List," and you begin to realize that the trauma of World War II should be seen against the larger canvas of racism, plus the simplistic Nazi notion of Aryan Jews versus Jews. This film touches the Hungarians do not like the Romanians, the Romanians do not like the Russians and so on ... even touching on the questionable relations of the Jews with their Romanian Christian friends while under stress. <br /> <br /> As I have not read the book, it is hard to see how much it has been changed by the director and writers. For example, it is interesting to study the Romanian peasant view of emigrating to the US with the prospect of earning money only to return to Romania and invest its gains there. In my opinion, the character of Johann Moritz was probably one of the best roles played by Anthony Quinn alongside his work on "La Strada", "Zorba, the Greek" and "Barabbas". <br /> <br /> The best and most memorable sequel to the film is the finale with Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi trying to smile. The father carrying a daughter born of his wife's rape by the Russians is a story in itself, but the director is able to show reconciliation by a simple gesture - the act of carrying the child without slipping into melodramatic scenes. <br /> <br /> Today, after the death of Princess Diana, we often comment on the insensitive paparazzi. The final sequence is an indictment of the paparazzi and the insensitive media (director Verneuil also makes a similar comment during the court scene as cameramen prepare to attack Moritz). The interaction between church and state was so well summarized in the laconic statement of the orthodox priest, "I pray to God that He guide those who have the power to use them well." <br /> <br /> Some of the short scenes, like those of a secretary of a minister scribbling while listening to a petition, said a lot in filming so small. The direction was so impressive that the edition is in the background. <br /> <br /> Finally what struck me most was the rich texture of the colors provided by cameraman Andreas Winding - from the brilliant sequences of credits to the end. I remembered that he was the cameraman of another favorite French film of mine called "Ramparts of Clay", directed by Jean-Louis Bertucelli. I have not seen this use of color for a long time, except for David Lean's epics. <br /> <br /> There were flaws: I wish Virna Lisi's character would be more experienced. I could never understand the character Serge Reggiani - the only intellectual in the entire film. The scene of the train station at the end seems to have come out of Sergio Leone's faroestes. Finally, the film was essentially built around a love story, which unfortunately occupies a secondary place. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie impressed me in more departments than one. The story is relevant today as it was when it was made.
