Do not forget the side lover !! She is a 'hot', Karen Parsons is delicious, she is wonderful in acting and beauty and style. It's just your job! HO, well, now here's a show that the writing slaps you in the gut and as you bend, kick you in the ass! When quoting Peter's wife, (The Associate / writer / Producer), she said that when they watched the previews of the upcoming 'new' shows at an ABC network party, she looked at her husband after the premiere to 'the Job' and said, "This does not look like anything else in this network. You're in trouble." Meaning, looks very good! But it's not like it's the regular comedy series of cheerful and bright people or hair style drama that they (ABC) are regularly putting on the 'Air'. Since I saw this, after the first episode ended, I made sure that I did not miss those hours next week. I was instantly addicted to "The Job". Cutting the wit and cynicism, outrageous situations and laughter of writers make this series a success! <br /> <br /> So I felt anger and a feeling of being disappointed, that the show just came out of thin air. I wondered which executive, who made the decision to tear down an important cornerstone of the comedy to your network? <br /> <br /> I talked to other people about this, some know, some do not, but I know that the stupid network did not promote it with enough force, or should I say visually enough, if they had run at least 3-5 seasons, maybe even six I just believe they know the deficiencies of the network and being overly inscribing in a 'formula' or another that they missed on the boat with th this. There was so much room for expansion that it had barely begun. The situations were funny and serious, fast and sometimes slow, but not too much, keeping pace. A few years later, I finally found it on new DVD for $ 50.00. For me, it would be worth $ 1,000 to have this in my entertainment library. I watched in astonishment as I went through the two seasons again for the third time on DVD and the final episode of 'Betrayal' was entering a serious drama segment with them discovering a murder victim, it was better than most of the drama ' unit 'and' police 'shows in the air now !!! They entered the scenes as serious as a heart attack and, as credible, did it as if they did not even skip a beat. Just as it was meant to be serious, I'm so impressed by the 'versatile ways' that Tolan and Leary shared in the stories and scripts. In another outrage of the 'entertainment week' I learned that the beautiful wardrobe, of silk ties and expensive suits with pressed shirts and ultra-stylish shoes ... was sold to the film made for the cable "In the cut" (2003) for only four hundred dollars, that's it !!! ! I'm sick. Did you see what they all use at each show? A good coat could only work a lot. <br /> <br /> This was Denis Leary at some of his best. I recommend this great 'dramedy' cop for coasters from the east or wherever you are in this country. I even heard that people in Ireland were playing with Leary, the episode of 'Bathroom', repeating the lines back to him because they saw there. (****) A show of New York Leary / Tolan, super intuitive and comic.
