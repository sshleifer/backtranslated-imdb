Like several other reviewers here, I am surprised to see many negative reviews about this movie. Dan O'Bannon's earlier effort was the groundbreaking 'Alien' of 1979. Because he and Star Wars introduced the stylistic approach of 'Used' or 'Dirty Space' into art direction for these types of features, it does not mean that It was the only way to produce them. Instead of dismissing the 'Life Force' as a kind of primitive exploitative resource, it is important to recognize that the film is based on the 'esteemed' traditions of British horror and science fiction - specifically Hammer and American International, as Quatermass (specifically "Quatermass and the Pit", 1967), Doctor Who and "The Day of the Triffids" (1963), if not the works of Gerry Anderson. ('UFO', 'Space: 1999' and 'Thunderbirds'). But none of these influences would be a surprise if other critics recognized O'Bannon's erudite appreciation of 'Queen of Blood' (1966) and 'It! The Terror of Beyond Space "(1958) - the immediate sources of" Alien "(1979). <br /> <br /> Granted this film has some" legacy "elements, but perhaps it is worth comparing this movie to your more immediate peers - 1981's 'An American Werewolf in London' and 'The Company of Wolves' (1984) - other 80's films that share a 'look-back' as they adapt these stories to the zeitgeist of the 1980s. All three films were based on previous incarnations of the same, but substantially sexualized their themes (because they could), and at the same time they recognized the humorous and comedic aspects of their projects. Neil Jordan's "Wolves" played for many of the psychoanalytic memes circulating in the 1980s, while "American Werewolf" coagulated its theme as a "adulthood" film. It is called an artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the inherent to the franchise 'Scream', 'I know what ue you did last summer 'and' final destination '. But these teen-oriented films seem to be part of a box office trend, while the 1980s films like "Lifeforce" belong to a British science fiction canon - even if it's written by an American. <br /> <In many ways, this film holds up much better than the films of alien disaster and alien invasion ('Armageddon', 'Deep Impact') in which 'solutions' do not reside in weapons of fire. battles, armed charges and testosterone. At the opposite end of the post, it's unfortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron did not examine Tarkowski and Lem more closely before redoing 'Solaris' ... The purpose of this film was fun, not ponderous or stupid. <br /> <br /> 7/10
