Okay, I marked this spoiler, so do not be upset when I finish this. Now I went to the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, since almost all the horror movies I've seen were predictable, but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a "WHY" to Kane's madness. But there was and though a little foggy, you still got the idea and understood the craziness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you into the nights that will come this is not the movie you are looking for. But if you're a fan of Saw, or some other movies claiming your fame thanks to sadistic content, this is a movie to watch. Now, where do I really throw a spoiler for a second warning. I give this movie a 9 maybe because I'm a fan of WWE and a fan of Kane, but who does not like a movie a little better when it stars someone we love. However, this movie could have scored a 10 for me if. . . (spoiler) ----> at the end of the movie when he showed Kane dead on the sidewalk. While a dog pissing in his eye was "BEAUTIFUL" it could have been classic with the Kane / Undertaker sitting up fast and turning his head. A perfect 10 would have been granted if this had happened. It was a perfect opportunity but either the WWE did not think about it or a future sequence will start with that same sequence I mentioned. That is all. (9)
