This movie is almost never seen today - the only reason I can enjoy it again and again is from a lightly worn VHS copy that I made when the movie was shown on TV in 1991 here in England. <br /> <br /> Cast set are obviously amusing and this is reflected to the viewer. A sharp script helps things, and once you've seen it, you'll want to watch it over and over again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Rogers is the 'star', but everyone contributes to a great movie with a great jazz soundtrack to boot. There are emotional moments during the movie but never to the point of sick sentimentality - these are the guys on the journey of a lifetime, and they transmit that excitement wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you can really get to see this.
