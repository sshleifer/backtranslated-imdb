I was at the premiere of the movie last night in Rome. I'm not an expert in the book, however, there are a lot of changes from the book to the movie. The pace of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were cut, otherwise it would be a 4 hour movie. Many things have also been changed to give the film a fast pace. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company. <br /> <br /> There are some things in the book that seem very implausible in film form. I'm not giving any spoilers, except to say that the end of the movie is treated in a slightly different way. How Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who see the film may be interested in reading the book for the full details of the story. Some small details are also cut from the film. <br /> <br /> Although they filmed in Rome, they had to re-create interior pictures. Since I went on a walking tour of Rome the day before the movie I can say that the interior locations are authentic in look and feel. Kohler is not in the movie and not much is shown about CERN. Hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes surrounding the archives of the Vatican. Of course they did not have access to that area and I'm not sure if anyone really knows what the Vatican archives are like. Eyelet Zurer has his career in this film as Victoria Vetra and does a good job as an eye salve for Hanks. <br /> <br /> This movie should be received better by critics and the public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and the cast before the movie, that this is just a movie.
