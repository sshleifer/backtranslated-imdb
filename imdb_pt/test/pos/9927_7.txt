No matter how much I hate to say it, the movie is not as good as it could have been. Maybe I've been fooled by the myriad exaggerated comments here on the IMDb, but I expected a lot more ... Of course, the idea is good, the violent scenes and the camera work are awesome, the imagination of the genius Dario is breathtaking, but the film is "dirty" by some mistakes that I consider unforgivable. First of all, I am one of the few people who feel that Heavy Metal music played in the most intense scenes simply rips the atmosphere? With a different kind of music (Goblin ????) during the "needle" scenes, it would have been SOOOO intense! ... Instead, the soundtrack destroys any chance of tension ... Secondly, the final murder scene and the last moments of the movie are simply silly and uninspired. I do not mean "amateur" because I love the Argento movies. The ending left me feeling empty. Talk about a final impression! This is hardly the case in most of Dario's films! Although, admittedly, Suspiria also suffers from a hasty end (even though most of it is brilliant) .... In summary, watch this movie, try to make the most of its positives, but be prepared for some bad ones too. This is not a perfect movie by any means.
