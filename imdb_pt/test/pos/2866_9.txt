This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made that movie. They're the ones who made that stupid Wolf Creek movie, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it would be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really is not that difficult), it's one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time! They really redeemed themselves with this movie. It was bloody, clever and scary, which are the combinations for an incredible horror movie. Kane is amazing as Jacob Goodnight, and Christina Vidal, Samantha Noble and Luke Pegler did good work as part of a group of criminals who cleaned up an old motel. He's had some coarse scenes, and you really feel sad about some of the people who die. All in all, a great horror movie to watch on a Friday or Saturday night with the lights out and with friends. Just do not watch a hotel.
