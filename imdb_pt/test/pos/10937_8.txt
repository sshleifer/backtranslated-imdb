This splicing of THE SEARCHERS is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, filmed by a Brit in a strange and unknown Mexico. It is often said that the best films about America are made by strangers, who can approach the familiar with the eyes of a stranger. But this crazy movie is something else. Although ostensibly defined in post-Civil America America, this is not a recognizable America of myth, cinema, TV, etc. The film has a timeless fable about it, dealing specifically with Western mythology. Director Harvey uses the horse title as a focus for interconnecting stories, all dealing with the traditional Western conflict of primitive and civilization. The first seems to have the advantage. The vast savannah and desert landscape of the film are uninterrupted, ready for allegories of the mind. The only brief places of civilization are a diligence of missionaries and landowners, and their farm, both of which derive behaviors that are anything but civilized. <br /> <br /> The basic story interweaves three stories. In one, an aimless deserter, Pike, having lost his trading partner, steals a miraculous horse, Eagle's Wing, so-called because of his grace and speed. In the second, an Indian, White Bull, owner of this horse, uses a diligence and kidnaps one of its occupants. In the third, the Spaniards sent to find her ignore this quest in favor of a murderous and looting spree. <br /> <br /> Although Western, a revisionist, Indian treatment is problematic. Unlike Pike, his character is never explained, forever inscrutable, denied a voice, except for an excruciating piece of music. When he is not a strange Other, he is a symbol, whose role is not entirely worked - at one point a savage brute, at another point it symbolizes nature and freedom. <br /> <br /> But Pike notes at the beginning that the film will meet the period of primitivism before civilization. In many ways, the film resembles 2001 - A SPACE ODYSSEY, especially its opening sequence. Part of the power of the movie lies in the connections made between the three disparate characters, forcing us to see the mythical fights and quests in a different light. Indian culture and Catholicism are linked by superstition, ritual, greed, and murder. Both Pike and White Bull are musical and alcoholic. White Bull is demonized both by Pike and the kidnapper as a "bastard," unintentionally revealing the tactic of illegitimacy used by the white settlers who infantilized the natives into "necessary" parents. <br /> <br /> Unlike a Western tradition Worried about making history, civilization and progress, this film is a double-detective story, interrogating the past, tracks, remains. <br /> <br /> What gives this film its remarkable singularity, I think, is, despite Maltin's racism, its Britishness. The climax impasse is more like a fair Arthurian. The film itself boldly avoids dialogue most of the time, creating the kind of visual and auditory tapestry that Malick lost in THE THIN RED LINE, and something few Hollywood directors would dare. The existential motives of duplication and quest are more European myths than the Americans (recalling the other British film of Harvey Keitel, THE DUELLISTS). The most surprising is the use of nature. Most Westerners use the landscape as an inspiring setting: there is little notion of living in the West. In many ways, EAGLE'S WING is like a film by Powell and Pressberger, with nature a powerful and pantheistic character in itself - alive, dangerous, hostile and beautiful. There is a sublime remnant scene of THE CANTERBURY TALE when jewelry left as a trap by White Bull in the trees is suddenly blown to the wind: there is an astonishing, tingling, magical, and thrilling effect more reminiscent of the Thousand and One Nights than a horse. opera. Cardiac arrest.
