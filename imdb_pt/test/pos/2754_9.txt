Others commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you would be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overview. Unfortunately, this is a bit short. But having said that, watching Colin Dunne is, however, gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, the changes of the original production of Dublin are evident. <br /> <br /> "Trading Taps" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion. Tarik Winston is unbelievable, as is his partner in the play. <br /> I think the audio was better in this version than in the original video production (1995). In Dolby 5.1 DVD is great. <br /> <br /> Despite faulty videography, it's a must-own for Riverdance fans.
