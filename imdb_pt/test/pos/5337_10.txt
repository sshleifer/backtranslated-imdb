A great animated film that really reaches the level of oldies like "The Lion King". <br /> <br /> I went to see this with one of my best Belgian friends who also watched the series on TV. I was lucky because I did not know that the people in Belgium knew "Wallace and Gromit". <br /> <br /> When it started and this good old theme started, it began to bring back memories of me watching when I was 5 years old. The humor itself was very funny. Some nice sitcom style scenes, some wordplay or just plain jokes. The animation is not so impressive if you know the series, but it's still fun to watch, you realize how it's made. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: Not only can I keep my happiness and fun, as part of the humor can easily attract older people, so I say: Go watch the "Rabbit Curse" as soon as you can.
