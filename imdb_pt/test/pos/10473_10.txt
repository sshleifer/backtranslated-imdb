I can not think of any movie that better captures the concept of grace in a theological sense. The well-meaning religiosity of a small congregation, lost after the death of their leader, steals from them the very thing they preach: grace. The costly gift of a humble Parisian culinary genius returns them to their call to love each other and humiliates a worried general who is wasting his life. CHOICES is a central theme as well as grace. At the same time, artistic gifting is recognized as having a powerful and transcendent role to play in everyday life and in the afterlife. Impossible to improve or to ignore. This is a life-changing movie for those who hear your message.
