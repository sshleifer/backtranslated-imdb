'A Tale of Two Sisters', or 'Janghwa, Hongryeon', is a true masterpiece. Brilliant psychological thriller, heart-wrenching drama and thrilling horror all wrapped up in a beautifully orchestrated package. From the complex plot, to the beautiful cinematography, to the absolutely perfect cast, every aspect of this film is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Afraid to reveal a lot about the plot, I will just say that it is very satisfactory. . Although it seems a bit difficult to understand at first, it's a good job to explain things in the end. And if you prefer psychological thriller, drama or horror, I promise you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, it is almost flawless. Set, cinematography, lighting and especially the soundtrack are all captivating. The waltz seemed a strange choice at first, but it proved to be an ingenious choice. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, we are talking about absolute perfection. I'm Su-jeong is totally convincing as the challenging, but troublesome Su-mi. Mun Keun-yeong is equally compelling as his emotionally traumatized sister Su-yeon. These two girls were magical on the screen. I will certainly be looking at their other films. Yeom Jeong-ah is deceptively cheerful and frighteningly evil as the stepmother. Finally, Kap-su Kim gives an excellent performance as the father tired and tired. <br /> <br /> I really love this movie. If you have not yet seen "A Tale of Two Sisters", I highly recommend the location of a copy. It is a real gem, worthy of anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> (10/10)
