Nothing is sacred. Just ask Ernie Fosselius. Nowadays, everyone has a video camera, and a movie hardly ever leaves before the spoofs begin to fly, are quickly written and filmed, and often posted directly on the internet. Nowadays, the parodies are hot and we strive to ensure that the filmmakers do not leave for their own importance. 25 years ago, when the first Star Wars was made, it was a different world. The cinema was the playground of a few and the spoofs were very rare. So God gave us Hardware Wars. Was it filmed to look cheap (or was it cheap?) And the audio was obviously recorded after the fact. Does this take away the experience? PASS NO! That's what makes it so great! It was raw and unpolished, and it hit relentlessly in some of the pretentious moments of the original film. From Fluke Starbucker waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber (I did it when I was young!) To Chewchilla the Wookie Monster, to watch for Auggie Ben Doggie "nah, just a little headache," this movie is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual Star Wars movies. For rent. Buy. Borrow from a friend. And may the farce be with you. Ever.
