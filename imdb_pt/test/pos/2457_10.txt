This movie is powerful. I watched this movie at 3:00 in the morning and I should be at work at 6:00 in the morning, needless to say I was late for work. I could not get out of bed to go to work. This is the most powerful movie I've seen in a long time. And it made me cry and feel the pain of the family. I think Emilo did a wonderful job directing this movie. I agree with previous comments from other views that this is the only movie I saw that brought the war home and showed what a family had to go through, what a veteran has gone through. It is almost painful to think that back then people only thought you could return home from an experience that would change your life and be the same person you were before you left. Kathy Bates reminded me of my mother in a way. I believe it really showed how women felt and acted then. I'm surprised this movie has no more prizes.
