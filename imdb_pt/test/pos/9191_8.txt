This existential thriller, in English with English subtitles, is a modern version of American films from the 1940s, complete with a twist at the end. It's fascinating from start to finish. My only criticism is their poor production values. The film seems cheap, and probably was, so black and white cinematography is far inferior to that of Godard in Vivre Sa Vie, to cite another noir film of more than 30 years before. Most maddening of all, captions are hard to read. When will filmmakers learn and provide yellow captions so they can be read against a white background? I would give a total of 8, although with better production figures could have been higher.
