This movie is beautiful in every way. It's visually stunning, and that's fine, since the dialogue would take only a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning into an animal and mixing that wild nature with the passion and authoritarian honor of a man. There is not a fault, nor an error or wrong time to be found anywhere. It's completely perfect, but only if you understand what you will experience. It's not a movie for anyone who wants normalcy.
