In this improbable love triangle, set in nineteenth-century Italy, "Beauty and the Beast" is being turned upside down and then some: Giorgio, an army officer and the very image of male beauty, is being transferred from his ( married) lover Clara and sent to a small garrison somewhere in Piemont. There - initially much to your horror? Fosca, the grotesquely ugly cousin of his commander, develops an obsessive love for him. He suffers his passionate and demanding displays of affection for pity and concern for his health (she is seriously ill) but becomes increasingly fascinated by it ?? until the dramatic end? <br /> <br /> Do not miss this most unusual love story, however twisted it may seem. Valeria d'Obici, who deservedly earned a price for her interpretation of Fosca, is as alarming as it is touching. Buy the video, read the book, go see the musical!
