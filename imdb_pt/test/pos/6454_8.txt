I saw this movie last night at a pre-code movie festival, and I have to tell you that when Gary Cooper turned his head to his introductory close-up, the whole audience gasped. He was so handsome. <br /> <br /> Cooper's glances aside, this film exhibits the art of Rouben Mamoulian's direction to perfection. Wonderful scenes, creative camera angles, symbolic allusions - Mamoulian continues to explore the medium of direction and create innovations. <br /> <br /> This was the first role of Sylvia Sidney in Hollywood after her success in New York. stage, and she's as gorgeous as a main lady of Gary Cooper should be. It is good to see her in a role with a greater advantage than they have received - often it seems that she is afraid of being run over by someone else. <br /> <br /> There are many familiar faces in this movie. film, including the wonderful Wynne Gibson. Most striking is Guy Kibbee, best known for being a rich man and a liar. <br /> <br /> There are not nearly enough of these pre-coded movies available on VHS or DVD, so if you do not find a precoding festival near you, try making a campaign at Turner Classic Movies for a broadcast ! As for the reviewer who believes that Gary Cooper was too dumb to have a more complex dialogue than "Yes" or "No," perhaps he should consider Coop's performance in such films as "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" or "Meet John Doe ". Though heaven knows that anyone who looks like that should not be smart, either.
