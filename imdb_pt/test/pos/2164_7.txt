Do not get me wrong, it was fun to watch. It has some cool animation except for a strange looking bugs, and some nice music. And the highlight scene was definitely Elmer's dance, Bugs and Daffy on the floor, which was such a cool and fun touch. In fact, the whole cartoon is good to watch, but overall it's not what I call exceptional as the Carrotblanca. There are some really cool jokes, but they were used before I felt it, and there was not much I considered hilarious. And Daffy joining forces with Elmer? Somehow, since he was a hunter's target, it did not seem strange that he was his friend. Although I admit it was nice to have Daffy there. The dubbing was also above average, but somehow I missed Mel Blanc. <br /> <br /> All in all, a unique design, but very cool. 7/10 Bethany Cox
