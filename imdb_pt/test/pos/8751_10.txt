It contains spoilers I had recorded some time ago when I was on PBS but never got a chance to watch it (probably due to the bias of having to spend 5 to 6 hours of the Masterpiece Theater with its BBC made for the style of TV production music, settings all in one room, no external TV flat-screen look ...)) But after watching the Traffic movie (which I thought was very good at that time), I could not help digging the Traffik tape to see what else they could have lived with the extra 2 1/2 hours. Boy, were my prejudices wrong about this TV series? It's much more engaging than Traffic. Characters are perfected to make their actions more believable. And the whole sub-story involving Pakistan completes the point of view of everyone across the supply chain, from the farmer to the end user. In Traffic, Pakistan's history was rewritten and reduced to a good cop against a bad cop plot. <br /> <br /> There was a more significant discussion and debate about alcohol and other forms of drugs, while in Traffic they became more transient references without significance. The same is true of social issues, which in Traffik were realistically conveyed without sounding the preaching. Whereas in Traffic, the characters have manifested themselves as a statement as they do in those made for the TV "week editions" movies. <br /> <br /> There was not a bad guy against a cool guy Traffik, even the marketer is portrayed as an addict who sells to support his habit rather than the kind of person "no one mistakes me" in Traffic. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that since I've seen Traffic not long before watching it, it was hard not to compare scene by scene, and even though the scenes were not the same, I already knew what would be the result. I thank God for the history of Pakistan, which is different enough to allow me to fully appreciate it without thinking about which scene it compares to. Although I was disconcerted, the drugs were cast in the pottery of the statues Helen brought back to Germany (as in the plot of Traffic). Thank God, Traffik was not shy and exaggerated.
