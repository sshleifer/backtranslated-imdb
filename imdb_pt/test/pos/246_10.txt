This is one of the best musicals of the 1940s. The glorious Technicolor shows the beauty and spectacular hair of Rita Hayworth. She should have made more color films, but Columbia could hardly afford to spend money on Technicolor shows. <br /> <br /> Rita is a WOW like Rusty Parker - she more than accompanies Gene in some of the most brilliant numbers ever. She also looked beautiful at the turn of the century dresses, so she had the chance to play her own grandmother. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with "The Show Must Go On" - sounds great to me - but Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) is not impressed. His motto is work, work, work !!! One of the dancers, Maurine (Lesley Brookes) is determined to improve herself and will be testing the Vanity Gold Wedding Matching Contest. Rusty just happens to meet at the auditions too. In a very funny scene, Maurine just auditioned and see Rusty gives you some tips on how to impress the jurors !!! "Do not be shy and demure - gossip and shine." Rusty does it with enthusiasm !!! <br /> <br /> They decide on Maurine and go to the show to see her, but John Coudair (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty - she reminds him of someone from his past. Cornelia (Eve Arden) is still having nightmares about Rusty's audition. "Whose Complains" features Genius (Phil Silvers) and the dancers, dressed as working girls - (Rusty is a taxi driver). <br /> <br /> John is remembering a long-lost love (Rusty's grandmother, Maribelle Hicks). The first time he saw her sing "A Sure Thing" - set in the races. Meanwhile, Danny, Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls at their local diner. They then launch into the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - "Make Way For Tomorrow". <br /> <br /> "Put Me to the Test" is an animated number of music and dance with Danny and Rusty. Meanwhile, Rusty was chosen Cover Girl and Danny McGuires is the place to be seen. Lee Bowman appears as Danny's romantic rival and spoils things. Lee Bowman is probably the most annoying man of all time - so Danny never needs to worry. Rusty (voiced by Martha Mears) sings "Long Ago and Far Away" and is danced beautifully by Danny and Rusty. . The dresses that Rita wears are stunning. Travis Banton and Gwen Wakeling designed them. Danny wants the best for Rusty, but is afraid of losing it. Gene Kelly is also fantastic in the number "Alter Ego", where he dances with himself. <br /> <br /> "Poor John" is another look at the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and it is extremely Funny song that mocks rich relationships - Hayworth looks beautiful in an incredibly picturesque outfit. Look for Al Norman in "Poor John" and "A Sure Thing." He was an incredible eccentric dancer, who appeared in several old musicals, including "King of Jazz" and "Paramount on Parade". It was easy to spot. <br /> <br /> The dance of "Cover Girl" is simply wonderful. Rita was so talented - beautiful and a great dancer. After a bunch of beautiful models paraded through the covers of the top American magazines, Rusty appears in a beautiful gold dress dancing on a ramp to the catchy song "Cover Girl". Wow, I just love this movie !!!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
