It's hard for me to explain this show to my grown friends. I have a lot of Shasta Daisy in the backyard that I affectionately call my "Chuckle Patch". My friends laugh at me and look at me as if I have two heads. It would be great to see this DVD series for us, people who fondly remember our other childhood memories, or to show our friends that there really was a patch of laughter! Where TV kids today are made up of violent cartoons, characters who do magic, or a talking sponge who lives in a pineapple on the seabed, The Magic Garden was real in the sense that it taught us good values. <br /> <br /> I'll keep good memories of Carole and Paula, and the Chuckle Patch.
