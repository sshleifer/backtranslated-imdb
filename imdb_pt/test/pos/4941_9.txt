When I played the first Soul Calibur on dreamcast, I thought it was great. When I played the second I was addicted. And finally when the Soul Calibur III was released, I bought a playstation 2 and the game. <br /> <br /> This can really keep you awake for hours, with a huge amount of characters, many unlockable content, and not to mention a GREAT combat system, this is really the greatest fighting game to date . <br /> <br /> The strengths of the games are mainly counter-games, where two human players fight each other, playing as one of the main characters or as a character created and customized. The Create character option is vast and allows the player to make thousands of different combinations. <br /> <br /> The only thing that bothers me is that if you create a character who uses the "Grieve Edge" fighting style (only kicks) you have to wear those ridiculous shoes. ^^ <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the greatest fighting game one could wish for. Now, I'm just hoping the planned movie is not crap.
