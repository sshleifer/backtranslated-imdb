"Think Like a Dinosaur" was a well-produced and executed show from the series -Outerlimits. The actor (Enrico Colantoni as Michael Burr) plays a strikingly good and convincing starring role. You can really identify with him and his "introspective" feelings about what to do with the girl he falls in love with (because he has been alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels hopeless until "Kamala" comes into his life with a shy fear of accomplishing the task of being transported, he then consoles her and she knows that everything will be fine, which turns out to be a mistake for the two, something bad happens and she (prototype) comes back ... and she ("clone") is sent to the other planet inhabitant. Although -Dino and "Micheal" have not yet discovered this, when they decide to kill her or let her live.However, what happened to him before he met her, (kamala) was very related to what happened to his wife, his wife died similarly. This show professes irregularity and sadness through most. After the show you are left wondering ... about what should have been done and you is stuck with the 50/50 of what is right of wr ong. , the equation "equilibrium", being only there is nobody. <br /> <br /> 10/10 I strongly recommend watching this program.
