This is one of my favorite Disney movies. It has everything you could expect in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris where Aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their lover in a mansion. Life is perfect for them, until the diabolical butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave all her fortune to the cats. He realizes that if he still has a chance to claim the fortune, the cats will be out of the way. An excellent, often overlooked masterpiece of the '70s - a time when the Disney studio did little animation - with songs like the title number "Aristocats" and "Everybody Wants to Be a Cat", this charms young viewers and old with its enduring jazziness.
