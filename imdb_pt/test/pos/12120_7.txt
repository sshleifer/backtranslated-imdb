One of the first (a combat veteran) of the early works of average quality, but accurately achieves the many conflicting aspects of life in postwar Germany. The main character starts the film in April 45 as a sergeant with C Co, 157th Inf, 45th Div, who actually ended the war in Munich, as in the film. (The same unit in the previous month fought heavily in Aschaffenburg and then released part of the Dachau facilities). To the uninformed, the film may seem confusing when playing between showing what is good and bad for the German people. But anyone who has been there, or at least read well, knows that most of what is portrayed in the film are things that really happened in Germany. The only imprecision I noticed was minor: while on a boat cruise on the Rhine passing the remains of the Remagen bridge, he comments that he crossed there. But his unit actually crossed well south of there - north of Worms, Germany.
