Forget Samara / Sadako and Jason ... <br /> <br /> Terror has a new name: GRANNY. The plot is simple but efficient. The actors are good (two thumbs for "Michelle" and the killer) and the dialogues are even smart. From beginning to end, the action will leave you breathless, you just can not escape ... There is blood, terrible murders, funny moments and a sense of perversity that goes far beyond any rule. "Deja vu"? Certainly NOT: "Granny" is no longer a slash film, it's really a classic of its own ... It deserves the success it has had and there is still more success in its re-release. Congratulations!
