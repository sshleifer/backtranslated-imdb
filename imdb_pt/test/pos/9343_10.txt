John Landis really excelled when directing Michael Jackson's film THRILLER as a short film. Of course, it's cheesy, the dialogue is terrible and everything seems extravagant too, but it's perfect nonetheless. <br /> <br /> Michael and his boyfriend are in the movies to see the latest horror movie. . When everything gets too graphic for the date, it comes out. Michael goes on. On the way home, they decide to take a shortcut through the local cemetery. There, it begins. <br /> <br /> The real dance of suspense is incredible. It's full of these Jackson trademark moves as well as some memorable zombie moves as well. It does not seem rushed or too long. The whole thing looks like it's a movie and it really is quite scary. Of course, it's one of the most famous music videos of all time, and it's probably the best music video of all time. <br /> <br /> General: Watch, seriously. Those 13 minutes will be some of the best they've ever spent looking at a screen. (5/5)
