This movie would have worked out much better if this was the first Critters movie, this is a low budget movie with only two Critters shown on screen. Why this seems like a flaw is because this is the last movie Critters and it is so low budget that it looks like the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money. However, I liked this movie, I mostly compare with the third movie (which were bad). Critters 4 has a more serious tone in it, the first half of the movie (even without seeing a Critter yet) you have a scary feeling to watch, it's a shame they did not "milked" the Critters, I mean even though they only had two (2) puppets that they could still use on the screen much more. The Critters also have different deaths in this movie, which made it a bit special, especially at the end, with the frozen Critter. Ug has a promotion in this part and it's different in this movie that caught me by surprise. I finally liked this one because it also has some sort of conclusion to the series, so at least we will not see a Critters 5 anymore. Oh, one last thing, I missed a scene in this movie, we never saw a Critter shoot a peak of his back , maybe these puppets did not have this feature, but I was really disappointed not to see it (in Critters 3 we see a lot of peak footage, which was the only good thing I liked in that movie).
