Mr. Bean shaped the face of British TV comedy. It has proven that you do not need evil or witty words, a huge budget, a great amount of intelligence or even any intelligence to do something brilliant. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters you just can not forget. Some of those episodes left me in stitches - yes, they are not realistic and they are all very stupid, but to be honest, realism is one of the barriers that the Bean broke down on the road to greatness. Rowan Atkinson et al. can always create interesting new ideas - and new hilarious jokes - remember when Mr. Bean drove his green Mini while sitting on a couch on the roof? Mr. Bean is one of those things that never fades - the movie was not so good, but Bean has introduced a whole new sense of humor to the world, and children and adults will marvel at its immense fun factor. "Extras" and "Little Britain" can be condemned - this is the British comedy at its best and most original. These escapades never grow old! 10/10
