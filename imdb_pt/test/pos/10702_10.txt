Canadian filmmaker Ron Switzer delivers a solid and uninterrupted thrill of relentless horror with the great science fiction movie "Science Crazed", 1991. A heinous monster takes revenge on his mother, a police officer and tenants in an apartment building. Brilliant practice makeup and special effects designs create a truly terrifying monster, especially when lurking through the atmospheric shadows and smoke of the gloomy apartment settings. The characters are beautifully crafted with surprising and surprisingly touching performances from a cast. Produced by Donna Switzer, rookie Ron Switzer has also written the face-of-the-film script, weaving a roller coaster surrounding twists, twists and terror that keeps you guessing until the last frame. Science Crazed will no doubt leave you haunted long after the shocking conclusion. Highly recommended!
