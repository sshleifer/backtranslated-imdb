I recently bought Lost Horizon on ebay, having vivid memories of the number of things I will not miss since childhood (I am an old 29). I also recently finished the novel on which it is based. I was so pleasantly surprised to find a real hidden gem. A wonderful cast brings this warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and elegantly told story, subtly updated from the original film (and so far a completely separate entity for James Hilton's much more intellectual and thought-provoking book). Sally Kellerman in particular has a radiant presence like neurotic suicide bomber Sally Hughes, who gradually heats up to the charms of Shangri-La. The fact that Finch, Ullmann and Hussey are all dubbed is not important, as it is almost impossible to say in quality, the music being far superior to the lyrics but still a vibrant and engaging movie that really deserves a DVD release and much more recognition.
