Written by science fiction veterans Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. This space fantasy is appropriately directed by Robert Parrish. Experienced American astronaut Colonel Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) agrees to a manned flight to the other side of the sun. The mission is to be controlled by Jason Webb (Patrick Wymark) and his scientist John Kane (Ian Hendry), from the Euro Sec agency, will accompany Ross. The two will explore a newly discovered planet that is in the same orbit as Earth ... except that it is always hidden from the other side of the sun. Ross is the only one returning to Earth and has an incredible story to tell. Special effects may be better than the story line. However, fun to watch. The cast also includes: Lynn Loring, Loni von Friedl, George Sewell and Herbert Lom.
