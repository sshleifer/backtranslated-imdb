At 2:37 a high school student commits suicide. Not shown who took their lives or known reasons, time jumps back to the beginning of the day. From here we follow six separate students; Marcus, Melody, Luke, Steven, Sarah and Sean. Each student is struggling with their own moral dilemmas, all reaching the boiling point, coming to an end for one. After losing a friend to suicide, and surviving his own suicide attempt, writer / director Murali K. Thalluri created an invigorating drama with a focus on teenage life and the horrific act of suicide. Suicide has been a topic that was kept in the shadows, 2:37 is Thalluri's attempt to bring him to light. If you have been touched by the act of suicide or by anyone who has committed it, 2:37 becomes even more difficult to be seen. <br /> <br /> With heavy and difficult subjects, Thalluri also faces the daily crises of adolescent life. Sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullying, friendship, Thalluri manages and shows in an extremely realistic way. The factor in Thalluri's talent is his subtlety. He respects his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered at some point. Comes close to documentary, sometimes it has such a painful realism; the interviews with each character spliced ​​through the film only increase that. <br /> <br /> 2:37 has a distinct resemblance to Gus Van Sants's film, Elephant. While the core of each film is different, both approach teenage life. Like Sant, Thalluri uses long tracking shots, with time jumping back and forth, to show the interaction of each character from different perspectives. One defining point for Elephant was his ethereal environment. With extra talk, little character development, and long tracking shots, Sant created an astounding and fascinating atmosphere for an approaching dread. While there is this fear in 2:37, the emotional connection with the characters reaches a higher level than Sant could not reach. Over time, the fragility of each character creeps, dragging you along your emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> The real success in this movie comes with the inevitable suicide, announced at the outset. The difficult part about this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort we have as a public watching someone's life in a horrible way. Although many movies have shown suicide, they cover up the act or romanticize the act. Thalluri shows the pain and agony involved with this act and that is not the best solution. With unknowns in leads and their first leading roles; Teresa Palmereach, Frank Sweet, Joel Mackenzie, Marni Spillane, Charles Baird and Sam Harris all show immense talent and promising acting careers. <br /> <br /> Compelling and reviving, 2:37 is a film absolutely must-see.
