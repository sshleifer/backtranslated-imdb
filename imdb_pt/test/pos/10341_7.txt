This film is still alive and kicking today thanks to the presence of Alan Ladd. This is good in a way, because the film has some interesting things to say, but bad in another, because everyone who watches hoping that Ladd will guess their usual rhythms, will be very disappointed. Without fanfare or introduction, Ladd is suddenly introduced into the third roll. It is true that your role is fundamental, but it is small and you will probably get lost in the confusion. There are many important roles in the ambivalent script of former journalist Martin Mooney, who reaches out to all political alliances and denigrates candidates for the Reformation. It is the lovely and extremely talented Joan Woodbury who unites the various strands of the all-encompassing history. Unlike the usual Hollywood production, the plot really continues in a series of jumps, much like the later movies revealed by the French "New Wave", although easier to follow here, especially if you are aware that the title The original movie was Paper Bullets. However, some of the film's narrative and character changes are a bit disconcerting, particularly in the part played by Jack LaRue, who wisely chose to play the role in a strangely uncompromising way. One of Jack's greatest acting jobs of all time, but no one is able to realize it, unfortunately!
