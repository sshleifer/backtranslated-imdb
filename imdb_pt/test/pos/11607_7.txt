Chokher Bali? A piece of passion. <br /> <br /> Based on Rabindranath Tagore's novel of the same name, this is a classic tale of fraud, adultery and the exploitation of relationships. Set in 1900 in Bengal, director Rituparno Ghosh has transformed the acclaimed literature of Nobel laureates into a delightful visual delight. <br /> <br /> Tagore's story deals elaborately with Bengali society, through its central character, the rebellious widow who wants to live a life of her own. We are taken to the picturesque part of Bengal, where we find our heroine, the beautiful young widow Binodini (Aishwarya Rai). <br /> <br /> Despite his beautiful appearance, two handsome men, the wealthy Mahindra (Prosenjit Chatterji)) and his friend Behari (Toto Roychowdhury), denied having married her. <br /> <br /> Mahindra chooses a naïve Ashalata (Raima Sen) over Binodini and marries her. Leaving behind life on the field, Binodini, free-spirited, accompanies Mahindra's mother to Calcutta as caretaker. Soon his friendship with Ashalata blossoms. It seems that, the two, if treating like "Chokher Bali" (sand in the eyes), share a lasting bond. The English-language Binodini captures a special place in the house. But soon she unmasks her true face. Manipulating good-humored Ashlata, Binodini approaches Mahindra and fulfills his sexual desires. When she is expelled by Mahindra's enraged mother, Binodini seeks consolation from a reluctant Behari. The rest of the story shows how the lives of these four characters cross and culminate in an unimaginable climax ?? Aishwarya walks by the role of a manipulative, rebellious lady, still gaining the sympathy of the spectator with the elegance of a ballet dancer. The other leading artists - Prosenjit Chatterjee, Raima Sen and Toto Roychowdhury - are equally brilliant in staging their characters. <br /> <br /> While Tagore wrote this story of 'mold breaking' at the turn of the 20th century, the very idea of ​​widows' marriage was taboo, even among the upper class! Narrating the movement of freedom of nations in parallel, the author affirms the importance of individual freedom of caged life. Many compliments to the art director, who gave birth to the early 20th century in Bengal, and applause to the cinematographer for capturing these scenarios with enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> This Tagore "passion game" was fervently converted to the screen by the most capable filmmaker without losing its originality.
