Pavarotti and the entire cast are excellent at this opera beautifully filmed by Giuseppe Verdi, the best opera composer in the world. The soprano coloratura is particularly spectacular with its perfect tone. The lead role is well staged and well sung. The whole production is as perfect as one might expect. <br /> <br /> A cinematography masterpiece! <br /> <br />
