During the Sci-Fi TZ marathon of January 31, 1999, this episode was the last to be screened in the twentieth century in my time zone (East). It was New Year's Eve, and when the clown begins to sing: "We are here because we are here, because we are here, because we are here ..." I realized that it was the intelligent nod of TZ New Year's Eve, because this song is also the music of Old Lang Syne. Coincidence? We'll never know. <br /> <br /> I love this story for the little details: the tear on the dancer, the clown's clowning, and the "yourself in the head" ending. This and the Art Carney Santa TZ are the ones that are about Christmas. <br /> <br /> My five personal episodes, after five characters ...: 1. The Hunt 2. The After Hours 3. The Hitchhiker 4. The Lonely 5. The Lost Little Girl
