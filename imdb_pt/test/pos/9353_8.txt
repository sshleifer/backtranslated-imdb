My two top actors are in this movie - Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum. <br /> <br /> Ryan could play anything from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller and play it magnificently. In this film, when he begins his speech "... people with names like Samuels and others with names that are hard to say" - it's scary to see it. <br /> <br /> Robert Young plays the cop who is called to investigate the murder of Samuels (Sam Levine), a civilian, who is talking to several soldiers in a bar. Mitchell is the soldier wanted by him - his wallet was found in the apartment. But Mitchell is a gentle soldier who only misses his wife. <br /> <br /> The story is told from different perspectives. Mitchell and Samuels start a friendship and return to Samuels' apartment. Samuels seems to know the loneliness that Mitchell is feeling. "For years you've been concentrating on a peanut and now it's gone, you do not know what to feel," he says of the war. <br /> <br /> Ryan is superb as Monty, the racist psycho. Robert Young (along with Dick Powell) was an actor whose career was re-juvenile by film-noir. "Crossfire", "They will not believe me" and "The other woman" are great examples. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is his usual self as the philosophical Keeley. <br /> <br /> Gloria Graham and Paul Kelly as the "odd couple" also stand out in their brief but revealing roles. <br /> <br /> This is probably the best racism movie ever made.
