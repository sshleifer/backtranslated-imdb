This is one of the few movies with incredible acting, wonderful story line and worth watching. It's about changes in life. It is about how happiness can be found when someone is true to themselves. It's about accepting yourself and others. It's about the challenges of life. It is about coming to terms with reality. It's about courage. It's about love. Both actresses are very loyal to their role. The actresses had a very good chemistry with each other in the film. This is the key to the movie that made the film. It's rare to see an independent movie like this. One can say the hard work that the film crew had to have during the production of this film. I would like to see more movies from this producer / writer. Watch the movie, you'll love it.
