Hoppity is a charming, if somewhat philately, animated film that, considering it was made in 1941, resisted incredibly well to the test of time. Now I have to admit that I have a crush on 'HoppityGoes To Town' (as it is called in the UK) having watched a recorded VHS version of the TV by our parents many times with my brothers. Imagine my surprise when I woke up this morning just in time to catch him on Channel Four (at 6.15 am, no less!) The film was as delicious as I remembered, with the timely animation and a lovely moral tale that should please parents and children alike. Maybe someday I should share this forgotten classic with my own kids. With a good run time for kids (88 min) and a simple but engaging storyline, there's really something for everyone in this guy's tale coming along. I could actually see this being successfully redone in CGI. Take note Pixar.
