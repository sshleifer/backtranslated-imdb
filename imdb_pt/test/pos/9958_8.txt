"The Merchant of Venice" was one of Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime, but fell on hard times during the 20th century because of its undeniably anti-Semitic content. The play has also been called the schizoid in its comic and tragic scenes, prompting some to say that they are two pieces trying to coexist as one. Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes, who played William Shakespeare in "Passionate Shakespeare") is in love with Portia (superb, Lynn Collins), but needs to borrow a considerable sum of money to win it. He goes to his gay lover Anthony (Jeremy Irons), who has no funds for his person, but gets a loan from the Jewish usurper Shylock (Al Pacino). Shylock finds it amusing and offended that Antonio, who insults him for his religion, now seeks him for money, but he offers it, on the condition that the penalty for not paying the loan is a pound of Antonio's flesh. Which is, of course, what happens. Bassanio and Portia offer Shylock considerably more than the original loan, instead of the pound of flesh, but Shylock, distracted after his daughter leaves him and marries a Christian, refuses to accept him. Portia, in a scene where the public is never sure where to put their condolences, deprives Shylock of what should be legally his and then takes away his wealth and religion. Shylock was originally rehearsed as a cartoon villain, but modern actors and directors have turned him into a tragic figure, complaining of the injustices of sixteenth-century Venice. Al Pacino does a great job as Shylock, and Jeremy Irons is good as Antonio, but I think the work of Lynn Collins as Portia is the best part of the play. Portia is one of the few notable female roles in Shakespeare's canon, and Collins is wonderful in the play. Joseph Fiennes is more than a little bored; I've never particularly liked his acting style often overdone. I give "The Merchant of Venice" an 8/10.
