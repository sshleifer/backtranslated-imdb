Lovingly crafted and terribly interesting to watch Garfield's performance (featuring a new kind of rebellious acting style that would be passed on to the Brand and Clifts and so on after the war), but all that brotherly affection is a bit suffocating. Priscilla Lane is a brilliant and engaging artist, but the other sisters do not actually register (though they can all be cakes and spirits) and I just had trouble buying any of the other male characters other than Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a nice enough actor, but he does not have the weight of movie star to match Garfield's bad luck, Mickey Borden, and that leaves the film a bit out of tune. (Imagine a Jimmy Stewart or someone on paper.) Also, I was not convinced that Garfield would make the crucial (to say the least) final decision he made. The film needed another half hour to better explain this action; seems very rushed and poorly motivated. <br /> <br /> Even so, it is not difficult to understand how someone who grew up with this image would remember it with affection. It falls short of being a classic, but contains some classic moments. The two swing scenes of the gate are pure cinematic magic.
