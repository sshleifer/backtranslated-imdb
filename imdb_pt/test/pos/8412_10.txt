I did not read the book "Scarlett" and when I watched this mini series I liked it a lot and thought it did not have to be compared to GWTW. The story may differ from the book, but who cares is a movie. Even in the credits it is based on the book, it is not the book. The film is clearly underestimated by the criticism that other people write but can not even spell out the names of the main characters. <br /> <br /> Performing in Scarlett, I found it excellent. Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton were excellent. They took the characters and gave them the touch. Now, as other people pass by, they compare them to the great Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. They obviously did the fantastic, but the protagonists of this film are completely different people who have their own acting methods and should not be pressured on what people have to say. If you wanted certain actors to do well, then you should have directed the film, I'm sure other actors would not do as well as those with the chemistry and intelligence they brought to those roles. The supporting cast stood out with greatness, and Jean Smart steals the scenes as she is with her comedy genius. <br /> <br /> The movie locations were very beautiful and it was great to see Scarlett go to all those places in the movie as she causes problems and stuff. Also the scene in which Scarlett speaks with her father's grave was very dramatic and I have since thought that there were two great actresses who brought Scarlett O'Hara to life. Not only Vivian Leigh, but also Joanne Whalley. <br /> <br /> The movie and the book may be different, but you should not take it seriously that this is a sequel to one of the best movies ever made, otherwise you'll think this has to be like Gone With the Wind and you will not like this movie. But this is a below average classic that is different from GWTW, it's your own movie. Also keep in mind that "Tomorrow is another day" ...
