I saw this originally on Channel 4 (UK) and it was a fantastic movie that made a great impression on me. However, I've seen it on Irish TV recently and there was an additional narration by Roy Scheider ("we'll need a bigger boat!"). That ruined the movie for me. His monotonous monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film, and if everything takes into account the brilliance of the film. I wonder if the new DVD version that does not have Roy (for legal reasons?) Would prevent people from buying it. Well, believe me, the movie is much better for that! <br /> <br /> Congratulations <br /> <br /> Damian
