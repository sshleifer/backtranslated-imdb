I'm not sure I've ever seen a black Denamark comedy before, but that's pretty good, actually. Humor is adequately discreet and impassive to accompany some of the gruesome activities. Svend and Bjarne are tired of working for their boss because he is always putting them down (in fact he mentions that they were not bright enough to unpack before peeing at one point). They do what they need to start their own butcher shop and when a worker is accidentally locked in the refrigerator at night while fixing the light, they discover something that makes their butcher shop much more popular than their former boss. In fact, he sold their first "steaks," and it's partly his fault, as he served them at a Rotary dinner at his house and the guests worshiped and showed up in Svend and Bjarnes the next day. Bjarne is a little appalled by what Svend did, but he does not stop there. Svend rose above his sad existence to be someone of some popularity that is new to him and he does not want to leave that aside, so the freezer continues to fill up with all sorts of acquaintances (and, at one point, "a small Swedish from the park "). Suspects, however, arise because former boss Holger thinks something is wrong. Bjarne is also haunted by his twin brother Eigil, who lived in a sanitarium for years in a coma and whom Bjarne wanted the cap to be connected so he could get the inheritance money to help open the store. When Eigil was taken off the respirator, he was resurrected, much to Bjarne's horror. And Bjarne also has a love interest in Astrid, who works in the cemetery. Neither Svend nor Bjarne are well-adjusted individuals and things start to get out of control. The expressionless humor really does it, and while it's not exactly laughing out loud, it's certainly fun. It's a little scary though considering the cuts of meat and body parts casually out there, especially since these two take everything so prosaic. If you are a fan of black comedies this is recommended, I really liked myself. 8 out of 10.
