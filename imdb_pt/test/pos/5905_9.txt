Do not be fooled by the nostalgic aura surrounding "Mon oncle Antoine," because, like the best of Canadian films, darkness hides just below the surface. Presumably nestled in rural Quebec in the 1940s, the story explores the developing consciousness of young Benoit as he learns to deal with both sexuality and death. <br /> <br /> The look of the film is surprising, especially since a high proportion of criticism of Canadian cinema by the general public involves aesthetics. In addition, the unassuming Benoit is a seductive protagonist to the public, staring at his corrupt community with innocent eyes. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading the critical essay by Jim Leach about the film in Canada's Best Features program for anyone who wants to put the film in a historical context and at the same time dissect the shape of the film. Definitely check this out.
