In one sentence, moral ambiguity. In Soderbergh's remake, there are good and bad. The character of Benicio del Toro is clearly the good guy, morally clean and without corruption. His counterpart on the BBC's original Fazal, the farmer who became a trader, is realistically flawed and conflicted about his fate. The two ruthless policemen are equally different. In the American, they win our hearts. In the original BBC, they are overly zealous, almost obsessive. The best moment for me at Soderbergh was when the college student rhetorically asked the drug czar: "What would you do if you were poor and rich blacks and whites came into your neighborhood looking for drugs?" This point was hinted at The conclusion after seeing the two shows is that the dealers are innocent pawns who are just supplying a demand, it is the demand that causes so much suffering.
