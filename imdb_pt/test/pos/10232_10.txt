Why did not the critics like this movie? I dont understand. This is easily my favorite endeavor by Clive Barker. "Hellraiser" is a bit rough around the edges (the movie never leaves this house stupid) and, let's face it, "Lord of Illusions" does not move at all !!! I have loved Barker's writing for years, especially his "Blood Books." Terribly fun. He has a cruel side to him that is totally different from a Stephen King. It mixes freely in its own homosexuality and strange religious and occult elements. I love love, love, love it. I also realize, however, that Barker is both a shadowy fantasy writer and a horror writer. And fantasy is not my purse. It puts me directly to sleep. Always have. I also think Barker works best with short stories. His novels tend to wander a little. This was my experience when trying to read "The Damnation Game". It all started well. Then 100 pages where I thought "where is it going?" because he was not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> I read "Cabal" (the book Nightbreed was based on) and thought it was good. ESPECIALLY I like the elaboration of Decker's character. The way the mask spoke to him and controlled him. I like the way Barker simply introduces this. Black and white. Here it is. It gives a simplicity that is attractive and believable. When asked why Decker kills he says (simply) "Because I like it." Probably something Jeffrey Dahmer said at some point. <br /> <br /> But I really liked the movie Nightbreed better than Cabal. I love the visual attention to detail that Barker gives to his films. ADORE IT. I think it's just beautiful. The Lord of Illusions also had something of that. Some of the drawings in the beginning, during the credit sequence Nightbreed. It's like an entire vocabulary that Barker dreamed only for the Nightbreed world. I would be curious to know how purely his design was. I know he is an AMAZING artist who has his own style and language as an artist. <br /> <br /> Nightbreed is also (I think) the most entertaining movie of BArker. It moves very quickly. Well edited. It does not creep as the Lord of Illusions does a little. Very fast. Everything is perfect. It also functions as a terrifying and scary horror movie. Things with the killer in the beginning killing the family and then tormenting the old man in the store are really scary things. This mask is scary. I would be curious to know if Barker also designed this. It's not just a "Jason" or "Scream" type mask. Something about it is really disturbing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a great movie. Definitely make sure you have not seen it. Highly recommended. One of my favorite horror movies of all time. In my opinion, the best of Clive BArker. It's scary and violent, be warned.
