Is it a murder mystery? Is it a police procedure? Is it a background look at French music theaters? Quai des Orfevres is all that, but more than anything else is a fun comedy of infidelity, jealousy and love, set in post-WWII Paris. It may be surprising that Henri-Georges Clouzot, the director of such dark films as Le Corbeau or suspense as Diabolique and The Wages of Fear, is the director of this film. Clouzot, however, was a cunning filmmaker. "In a murder mystery," he tells us, "there is an element of joking, it is never entirely realistic." At this point, I share Hitchcock's view that "A murder mystery is a slice of raisin cake crystallized, and if you refuse, you can also shoot a documentary. "" Quai des Orfevres is a wonderful film, and it's not a documentary. Jenny Martineau (Suzy Delair) is an ambitious singer in concert halls and dining clubs. She is flirting, sees nothing wrong in using a little sex and talent for her stage name Jenny Latour, and she really loves her husband, Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blier). Martineau is kind of a sad bag. He is your companion and arranger. He's a little bald, a bit chubby and jealous So we have his neighbor, the photographer Dora Monnier (Simone Renant) She's blonde, beautiful (think Rita Hayworth) and capable She and Martineau are friends since they were kids together Dora, However, it's definitely not just thinking about friendship when she looks at Jenny. s Brignon (Charles Dullin), a wrinkled old man, rich and dirty, who often causes Dora to take "art" photographs of his protected youngsters. He offers a contract for a movie for Jenny and suggests a dinner at his house to discuss the details. Jenny is more than willing. Maurice is furious and forbids it. Jenny yells back at him, "You're jealous of the rich!" Well, I want my share of the mass! I'm all for royalty! " "You're a father, you're a worker," Maurice shouts back. "Under Louis XV, I would be Madame de Pompadour, I would have warmed my pants!" <br /> <br /> And after Brignon is found dead with a bottle of champagne next to his bleeding skull, there's Dora to try to make things safe for Jenny. But wait. Inspector Antoine takes the case. Antoine (Louis Jouvet) is a tall, tired, middle-aged bachelor with sore feet. He has seen everything. He served in the "colonies" with the Foreign Legion and returned with an adopted baby and malaria. The child is now about eight years old and Antoine adores him. One of the first things that Antoine discovers is not just someone with Brignon brain with a bottle, somebody shot him in the heart. Who made this? In a short time, Jenny, Maurice, and Dora are inventing alibis, lying, and, at one point or another, confessing. How will Antoine discover the killer? Will we get a chance to see some great music hall songs sung by Jenny Latour? Everything is clear, but only with the time and the persistence of the detective Antoine. We get many kinds of love leading to all kinds of motives, from hair envy to glares of longing ... and all played with a nice blend of Gallic fun. Clouzot takes us to a Paris from decadent but not threatening neighborhoods to oppressed music publishers where songs are played on the piano for shoppers, for restaurants with discreet private dining rooms. Above all, he takes us to the music room where Jenny Latour usually performs. We can see Jenny as she sings, with couples in the seats and single men wearing their coats and hats standing up. And everyone smokes. The first third of the film, in fact, occurs largely in this medium. With Jenny singing about "Your little tra-la-la, your sweet tra-la-la", we followed her from experiencing the music of the editors for an audition for a sassy performance with Jenny in a feathered hat, a corset socks dressed and not much else. <br /> <br /> Delair, Blier and Renant do wonderful work, but Louis Jouvet, who holds it all together. He was a wonderful actor who did not like making movies. The stage was his world, and he only took movies if he liked the director and made money to finance his work on stage. Jouvet was tall with a long face and broad cheekbones. He was not conventionally handsome, but he had what it takes to master a scene. To see how he can play comedy with skill, watch him in Drole de Drame. He is a fascinating actor. At one point, he says, "I liked you, Miss Dora Monnier." "I?" she asks. "Because you and I are two of a kind. When it comes to women, we will never have a chance." Jouvet brings all sorts of nuances to this line, from sorry regret to gentle fun.
