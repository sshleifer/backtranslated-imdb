I do not really know when it was that TV broadcasters began to prefer having handsome men as reporters - regardless of men's IQ - but it was clearly a problem by the time the "Broadcast News" came out, and the movie was not a good looking job for him. Plotting a love triangle between the beautiful reporter Tom Grunick (William Hurt), the clever but nervous reporter Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) and the producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the film does not make any success. Probably the best phrase in the movie is when Tom says something like, "I really do not understand anything I'm reporting." And in the FOX News era and things like that, such a film becomes even more important. <br /> <br /> All in all, definitely a movie I recommend. Also starring Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack and Jack Nicholson in a supporting role as the anchor.
