Mike Nichols in the best shape. I was not a "Closer" fan, so it's refreshing to see him again with that comedy set in the darkest of circumstances. Only a slip in tone could have destroyed this compelling picture, but Nichols and his very strong A-list cast have never set foot in this biopic of a profoundly imperfect but extremely convincing Congressman. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman as usual is sparkling and brilliant - here playing a flawed but ultra-clever CIA manipulator, and it's in the trades between Hanks and Hoffman's characters where comedy rises. Rarely does the mood of the movie laugh out loud and it's also clever ... This hits the clock with a satirical tip that makes you laugh and cry with the state of the world (usually at the same time). <br /> <br /> Another great advantage is the length of the image. The film is based on George Crile's fat book of the same title. The temptation of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (his claim to fame is "The West Wing") must have been to make a fat movie, but what we have are impressive 90 minutes of a great story with radical implications. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be seen and recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest of dark themes and the lightness of the touch of its brilliant witty script - even if it ignores the obvious connection between the help it Herring and Wilson provide and the final consequences (9/11).
