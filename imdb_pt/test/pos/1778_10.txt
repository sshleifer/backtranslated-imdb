A brutally direct tale of murder and capital punishment by the state. So painfully slow and precise in describing the death penalty (from the preparation of the gallop to the victim in her own pants before dying) she has the power to change her opinion on the death penalty. The entire Dekalog originated from this story: screenwriter Dekalog was the helpless advocate trying unsuccessfully to defend and then comfort the accused.
