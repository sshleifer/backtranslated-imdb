Dead Gentlemen Productions has set a film with incredible production values ​​considering its budget. Anyone who has ever played RPG, particularly any fantasy RPG (they play Dungeons and Dragons in the movie) will LOVE this movie. Brilliant performances around - especially with regard to the dual nature of the basics, playing their players and their characters. Anyone who has filmed or performed in a student film will appreciate the amount of work and love they dedicate to this project. This movie (and its prequel) is for fantasy movies and RPG games that Blazing Saddles is for westerns - parody of the highest order. I only have a few minor complaints about the movie itself, none of which will prevent me from buying the DVD as soon as it's available (just another 6 weeks - I'm counting down the days): <br /> <br /> 1 When Lodge is chatting with Joanna about joining the game group, he hands her a copy of the Dragon and Dungeon Players Handbook and says "this will tell you everything you need to know". The camera hangs around a lot in the photo of the book, and the moment really looked like a commercial. <br /> <br /> 2. The jokes are hilarious, but seem unevenly distributed throughout the film. The last third of the film, after the almost continuous bombardment of visual and verbal humor that precedes it, slows down a bit, as if the narrative were joking. Strange, but Burning Saddles have always impressed me that way too. . . and I love this movie too. <br /> <br /> One of the narrative forces of history is the unresolved nature of the romantic subplot. Will Joanna become GM's girlfriend? Is she going back to Cass? Or will the three maintain a platonic friendship, deepened by the camaraderie of role-playing? (Yes, that sounds silky, but there are a few sacrificial moments, particularly when Cass and Lodge "make up" at the end.) But the movie goes on for a week: in terms of human relationships, these issues could not be answered from one only time. week. The fact that the characters' relationships are undefined seems better than the more classic choices you see in most movies, as the girl picks up her prince and they move to the castle, or the prince sinks into the North Atlantic after three platitudes tedious and predictable hours. The writers really seem to have an understanding of the psychology of the characters, and you can see the characters (players and characters of the player) change throughout the movie, but not suddenly, not unbelievably. <br /> <br /> I would love to hear more wisdom from Brother Silence. "The man who stands out in the darkness is ... fluorescent."
