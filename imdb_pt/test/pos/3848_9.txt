The Aristocats are actually very charming and are considered very low on IMDb. The songs are not as memorable as the Jungle Book, but they were not bad. The animation is really lovely, the best sequel is the landscape of Paris in general. It was beautiful. This is probably the most relaxing Disney animation I think, and as another reviewer said very correctly, who does not love cats? Another great piece of animation was O 'Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, since her novel was so believable, though not obvious. (A Good Thing) The plot (about a greedy butler and a fortune, reminds me Bailey's Billions) was a little unoriginal. , but it worked very well, and the script was very funny, especially the fights between the kittens. They remind me of me and my brother and 3 sisters, always fighting. My favorite scene was Edgar's pursuit with the two dogs, who were always fighting over who was the leader. The talents of voice were a delight, most notably Phil Harris, whom I recognized from the Book of Jungle, and Eve Gabor of the Rescuers. The supporting characters, that is, Scat Cat, were also well made. In conclusion, a really nice film, which is definitely underestimated. 8,5 / 10 Bethany Cox
