Personally, I think the movie is very good. It's almost a 8. I liked the ethnographic aspect as well as the gorgeous photography. Colin Firth's character is not the most amiable, but he does a better than decent job with the role. The heroine, portrayed by beautiful Nia Long, is a well-known film heroine who tries to do what she thinks best for her son - marrying a respected member of her expatriate community - while fighting her "bad mood" appeal. "Most of the film is about this mother's struggle: she must do what is expected of her, what she thinks is best for her child or should I follow your heart? I do not want to reveal the ending.Let me just say that it is a well-being film with beautiful photos of location, exquisite African dress (worth seeing the film only for the clothes and African hairstyles of colors The cast of Nia Long's son is brilliant and adorable.The plot is a bit stereotypical but I liked the movie, though.If you are a fan of Colin Firth you MUST see this movie.If you like fancy movies, see.I think I'll watch it again tonight!
