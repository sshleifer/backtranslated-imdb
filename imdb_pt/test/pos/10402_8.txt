A documentary filmmaker explores seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents, linked by the legend of an ancient demon named "kagutaba." <br /> <br /> From looks, the film looks like one of those video camera movies that have been popular. last months, until one that will be released next week (PARANORMAL ACTIVITY)! However, unlike films like CLOVERFIELD, REC and BLAIR WITCH, where most of these films are in complete chaos and disorder with all the shaking, this is basically shown in a traditional documentary style. There are TV clips and interviews and the scares are very subtle as well, excluding the last 20 minutes when we got into chaos and where the fear factor is tremendously high. <br /> <br /> And it works. The film is very captivating and makes you think. Yes, you heard me well: That makes you think. You have to pay attention to those unrelated details given throughout the movie and the payoff is great when, in the course of the movie, these things begin to intertwine. The movie is also very slow, which in this case is good. We, as a public, can absorb the details shown on the screen, no matter how subtle or howling. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a scary movie. I am a person who is afraid of ghosts and the paranormal more than killers who cut teen victims, so yes, the movie gave me some nightmares. There are some pictures here that are really disturbing to watch, including a closer one at the end where she makes you go "What am I looking at?!" Well, it's best left unanswered. There are about ten recurring characters here, all of whom have given authentic performances in their roles. <br /> <br /> The only thing I do not like about the movie is the ending, because most of the questions are left unanswered. The question "is this?" my mind was gone. It left a bad taste in my mouth. However, the rest of the film is just captivating and really scary. Do not see this alone in the dark because you will regret that choice. Also, I can see in a few years that Hollywood would remake this movie. That will be interesting.
