I believe that there are two angles to the story; first, it is the satirical view of the world, presented in an obvious Kafkaesque way, underlining the sordid spectacle behind some of the most common but also pleasant or comfortable moments and elements, which are generally sufficient. keep man running in society. Type: a good job, a good home, a good wife, a good car and even a good lover. Apart from this so-called common happiness, there are some who can not but ask themselves some more uncomfortable questions, such as where they come from, or how long they may have some other form of happiness, the climate could be a reason for them to be or If there was something they missed, or, even more sinister, the weather, there could be something that the system itself is hiding from them. Secondly, the most interesting aspect of this film, I believe, is the fact that it frontally attacks this natural compulsion to dissect the world around us, questioning it by our personal judgment, and usually condemning it because it does not serve us better because it is not made to serve us as a person. The symbolism behind the train crash, I believe, suggests that our own will may be dominated by fate or some other larger universal power, even in the face of our so-called power to decide when we want to leave. Instead, man can be dispensed by that greater power (let's call it SYSTEM, because the authors clearly avoid calling it GOD, perhaps further stressing that the SYSTEM is man-made and therefore can be dominated by man, unlike FATE, which is a closer concept of religion) on his own terms, not killing him, but showing him that there is a place for the man who asks / wants much, perhaps suggesting, that true fulfillment does not come from the outside world, but from within, and if the outside world "decides" to provide you with some comfort, you must learn to accept it without questioning the fabric of every small aspect of it. Uncomfortable, but does you reassess some existential issues that have become mainstream in the last century, such as what man can do in a world increasingly drained of substance, a consumer-driven world in which man can be changed without making a difference to the larger image, but only as long as it is of some use to the system.
