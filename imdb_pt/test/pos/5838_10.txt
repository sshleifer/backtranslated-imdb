I watched a lot of television in my 51 years, but I never had so much fun week after week, as I watched Oz. The performance of the entire cast was excellent. The writing was simply perfect, with each character remaining consistent throughout the six years. I also liked chaos and ultra-violence. It may seem strange, but sometimes it was comical to find out how one of the characters would end up dead. I particularly liked the true romance and love between Beecher and Keller. Those two men really knew how to knock down, in every possible way. I really hope that HBO continues to show us the reruns of this great FOREVER show! I watched all the episodes at least 4 times, but I still look forward to Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11pm. for an episode of this fun and very entertaining show.
