Now lissen vcs, I loved this movie, though not as much as farewell to the king, another beloved epic of John Milius. It was fun, so much more than if it were based on a Tennessee Williams drama. It's a great yarn, with a hint of political correctness. I love this film for its beautiful photography, its humor and its attentive criticism of the Bad Men (Berbers) and the REAL Bad Guys, the spear-bearers of the acquisitive "civilized" world with its repeated rifles, artillery and large motor boats port. <br /> <br /> The highlight scene is the Berber camp with blue-gray smoke from kitchen fires rising into the cold desert air. It is visually eloquent, highly evocative. <br /> <br /> Located in Morocco in 1904, WIND features a defenseless American woman (Candace Bergen) who is taken hostage by a bold, though immodest, Berber villain (Sean Connery - the model of a Scottish Muslim nomad). The exciting story is based on some historical facts. The photograph is beautiful Milius, punctuated by the excellent result of Jerry Goldsmith. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Pedicaris and the Raisuli conduct prolonged preliminaries and hop across the desert between oases. Even though Raisuli proudly traces his lineage back to the monkeys, he is a perfect gentleman - he still lets her keep her head after she beats him in the chess! A detachment of Marines invades Bashaw's palace, erasing the fires of competing hegemonies with gasoline. Do not mess with the body, Abdul. <br /> <br /> There are many interesting stereotypes: <br /> <br /> Despicable sultan - resembles a dissipated ferret. Definitely not a liberal. <br /> <br /> Cruel German officer - a big, bellicose Dachshund sporting a monocle. He gallantly chooses to fight with Raisuli swords rather than shoot him like Indiana Jones. Noblesse oblige, through von Clausewitz? Dashing Marine Officer - kicks the army of the Bashaw of Tangier and assaults his palace while chewing tobacco. His speech is slightly aphasic. Bashaw begged him not to breathe in it. <br /> <br /> The Berbers - a horde of thirsty flatters led by a charming megalomaniac. None of them shower, except perhaps in camel urine. <br /> <br /> President Teddy Roosevelt is undeserved as empty and concerned about guns, toys, and grizzly bears. <br /> <br /> Beautiful American widow - gives men a lesson in courage as do their two children. She evidently has a huge supply of clean, starched clothes and rarely has hair out of place. <br /> <br /> Raisuli sends a message to Teddy Roosevelt, thanking him for the gift of a Remington replica rifle, stating, "MEESTER ROOSEVELT, YOU ARE THE LION AND AIEE AM THE BREAKING WIND. "<br /> <br /> How true. <br /> <br /> Please do not take my bitter remarks to say that I did not like the movie. I had so much fun writing this as watching Pitcher.
