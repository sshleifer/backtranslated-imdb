"Traffik 1989" is an Emmy award winning six UK miniseries and was the inspiration for the Oscar winner "Traffic 2000". The five-hour film divides the opium / heroin trade for the viewer, from the transmission of poppy seeds in a camp in Afghanistan to the "head-running" of an addict in an apartment in England. Traffik not only offers entertainment value through dramatic stories interspersed, but also provides an overview of the international drug trade at all levels, responding to who, how, how and why questions of the old and impossible machine supply / demand of narcotics. Synergistically fun and educational, "Traffik" will prove to be well spent time for teens and up. (AN)
