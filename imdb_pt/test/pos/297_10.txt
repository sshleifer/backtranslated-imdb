Brilliant actors and brilliant picture !! I love the chopper scene with the music at the beginning, it's so touching and at the same time real, but at the same time surreal! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe that this kind of film shows that terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances. Modern war movies are spending a lot of money on effects. This is just a straightforward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A film that truly portrays evil and hatred mixed in fear and fate. How insane is the world and the power of will and friendship, love and passion. A must-have movie and without doubt the best war movie ever! Many have tried to copy, but there is no movie yet as good as that!
