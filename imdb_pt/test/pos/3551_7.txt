John Barrymore plays a gentleman who is also the thief, Arsene Lupine. Although no one knows for certain that this is the case, the inspector (Lionel Barrymore) is sure of this, but can not prove it. So Lionel spends much of the film following John - hoping to catch this shiny, slippery thief. <br /> <br /> Although I liked the movie, I really think I had higher expectations and thought it might be better than just a good time-doer. That's because it matched John and Lionel Barrymore in the film and as these brothers were such dynamic actors, I think I expected sparks and magic, but instead I just glimpsed this here and there. Now that's not to say that this is a bad movie - it certainly is not. Just did not rise to the level of being unforgettable or a movie that I strongly recommend you to see. Thanks to a suitable script, the film is very good, but I was surprised to hear no French accents in the film, even if supposedly on the French people! Besides, there was not much life in the movie until it was almost complete. The ending was really great and fun - so good that it raised the movie from 6 to 7. It was good to see it ended on a high note.
