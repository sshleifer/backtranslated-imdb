Another black comedy that won an Oscar for Best Screenplay. Starring George C Scott, this redefines the phrase "ripping a new hole". In this case, the target is America's Medicare and the great hospital system. Throughout the hospital, patients and doctors are dying because their names and prescriptions are being altered. Scott roars, screams and detonates his workers and bosses as they fail more and more. Your comment about Dachau to one of his many bosses will certainly make you laugh. He even hits and rapes a hippie 3 times. This is one that has to be seen and heard as monologues and soliloquies are the key points of the film.
