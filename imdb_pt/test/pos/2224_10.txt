This is one of the best Peter Sellers films. Why is it never shown on TV or in theaters? Will it ever be released as a home movie? Is it too derogatory to the medical field? I would love to see this movie again. I would like my son, who is a doctor, to see him. Laughter is the best medicine and Peter Sellers is the best doctor for it.
