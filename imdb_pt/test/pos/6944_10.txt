After traveling the world, I learned that Australia really lacks something that other countries have: history. <br /> <br /> Fortunately or unfortunately, Australia was not established after a war, had no war and most of its political history is quite ... boring! Nothing "big" happened to mark a kind of turnaround in Australian history ... until the dismissal of the Whitlam government by the governor-general of Australia - John Kerr. <br /> <br /> For those who are Australian, you can skip this paragraph and move on to the next one. This is for the benefit of curious non-Australians! Australia was colonized by the British. Over time, it became clear that Australia was able to stand alone. Thus, the United Kingdom granted Australia permission to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts and so on. The law and politics of Australia would no longer be supplied directly from the British; instead, Australia would be run by Australians in its own right, although courts, precedents, parliament and so on are modeled largely on the British system. This change was codified in the Australian Constitution. Despite the fact that the constitution legally lays down Australian governments, legislative procedures, courts (but for those who are curious - no bill), there are two "pro-crown" sections that have been included and remain there to this day. These are more or less regarded as the "reserve powers of the Crown (King / Queen of Great Britain)". The first group of sections refers to the creation of the governor-general's office. Briefly, the governor-general is considered the queen's chief representative in Australia and is described as the "executive branch" of the Australian government. When a law is passed by the Australian Parliament, the constitution declares that it only becomes law when it is signed by the Governor General. As such, the Govenor-general is considered by some as nothing more than a rubber stamper performing an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function in the name of the Crown. Theoretically, the governor-general may refuse to sign a law passed by the Australian parliament if he deems it appropriate. For example, if parliament passed a law that would allow the police to murder any Australian over 50 (hypothetically, of course), the GG could refuse to sign it and would not become the law of the land. However, this power is theoretical and has never been exercised. By "convention" (which is the slogan of the events leading up to the dismissal), the governor-general practically acts at the behest of the Australian government and therefore, if the government approves the law and the prime minister instructs the governor-general to sign it, it goes, almost always without question. In fact, by "convention" the governor-general acts according to the advice given to him by the prime minister of the day (and only the prime minister). The second aspect is section 64 of the constitution which states that government ministers occupy positions in the "pleasure" of the governor-general. Now the events of 1975 - addressed in this film - have given rise to a precedent in this particular section: if the governor-general is in some way 'displeased' with the government and / or prime minister, it seems that this section allows him to legally fire the government (what happened in 1975 ... hence the title of the movie "the resignation.") If "the pleasure of the governor-general" can be interpreted as "the unrestricted right to dismiss" is a contentious point, though instead of heated exchanges among Australians at the time - especially considering that the governor-general is not elected by the people of Australia. <br /> <br /> Now that that background aspect is out of the way, let's re-discuss the movie. It was well done. The rhythm was patient, but it did not drag. The drama was well restrained and very realistic. He did not dramatize the events and, more importantly, did not present his point of view from a political perspective. On the contrary, I felt that it was fair and balanced, although the conclusive text before the credits indicated that the filmmakers probably did not approve of the governor-general's decision to dismiss Whitlam's government. But I would not describe the movie as a bias in one direction or another. <br /> <br /> In terms of accuracy, it was practically right. The filmmakers certainly did their homework and, of course, read the books and writings of all the major actors involved. There were a lot of details that were somewhat overlooked, largely because they took a long time to explain and finally had little impact on the events of 1975, so I forgive them for it. Moreover, I think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that time of the post-Vietnam war, but Noyce practically succeeded. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was pleased that the film tried to create individual security policies. both sides without becoming analytical, obsessive or critical about them. Moreover, whatever is raised, for example, Connor's pipeline, had a great relevance to history. The filmmakers realized that their task was to tell the story of the events leading up to the resignation and not to present a political endorsement or opposition to policies and points of view. This was clever because it meant that the film can not be accused of misrepresenting policies on the one hand. <br /> <br /> The dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history that has occurred in Australia in her short life. I'm glad it was crystallized in celluloid. Essential vision for any Australian.
