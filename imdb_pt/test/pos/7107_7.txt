"House of Dracula" is not that bad of a movie and it's pretty decent sometimes. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** Arriving at Dr. Franz Edelmann's (Onslow Stevens) home in his seafront home, Count Dracula, (John Carradine) discreetly seeks a cure for vampirism. He begins working on a potential healing involving blood transfusion, the man of the wolves, Lawrence Talbot, (Lon Chaney Jr.) arrives at his state looking for a cure for lycanthropy. Working with both patients, he discovers a possible cure in a mold found near the laboratory, and after searching the area, he finds the Frankenstein Monster, (Glenn Strange) buried nearby. Becoming obsessed with reviving him, Dr. Edelmann continues to neglect the requests of Dracula and Larry, and after demanding that they receive treatment instead of working on the Monster, they face each other in a decisive confrontation. <br /> <br /> The Good News: This was a pretty decent movie. There is one main idea that is quite creative and imaginative. This is the first film to openly propose the idea of ​​vampirism as a blood disease, and that can be transferred from person to person through the exchange of body fluid, something that would be resumed by later works of genre, but rarely as directly as this . There is even a microscope slide of the parasite that is believed responsible for the condition. It works on some very well-used ideas and is a pretty ingenious idea, even if the execution is a bit obsolete. The fact that each creature has at least one highlight scene is a well-made idea. The Wolf Man has a wonderful scene where he transforms into a prison cell for members who doubt the hunt group and go crazy. Dracula's initial appearance of appearing like a bat and flying toward a slanting figure sleeping and then appearing in human form looks really impressive. The Monster's agitation is well treated and an appropriate amount of destruction is caused. The great bat that Dracula transforms into always seems decent for once, and is done in a very realistic way. It's a completely decent case. <br /> <br /> The bad news: There are several things that were not as good as this. The fact that the film combines so much potentially intriguing plotting and ideas that it really does not know what to do with them. There are several stories that need to be mixed and that should be clear enough to blend in and look coherent. That really does not have any of that. The plot is rather fragile and does not really give a preferential treatment to any of the stars, and instead concentrates on one after another and then includes all three at the end. The monsters seem to be only involved with each other for the smallest possible reason, which makes it a great distraction. The ending is for once a big disappointment, and it seems entirely that it was changed at the last minute. There are a few other little things that were not so spectacular, and pretty much also contribute to this. <br /> <br /> The Final Verdict: It's a pretty decent movie and manages to spend most of his time with a movie. fun style. Nowhere near the classic status of each monster's premiere features, but is a good enough watch for fans of monsters and Universal's movies in general. <br /> <br /> Today's Assessment - PG: Violence
