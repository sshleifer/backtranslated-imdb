I do not usually like romantic movies, but I really love this movie. The story is really touching and the ending is very appropriate. I feel like I really care about a lot of characters in this movie. I feel like I can feel your feelings. While most romantic movies always make me feel detached and bored, it completely makes me feel involved, from the scene of Capshaw running down the beach with Scott to the final scene. I want to rate this movie 11 out of 10 because I want to give an extra point to the end. The acting part is very strong. Kate Capshaw has a good opportunity to showcase her talent. Although I'm not impressed with Scott in 'Dead Man on Campus', this movie completely changes my point of view towards him. He is so irresistibly charming here. Geraldine McEwan is as fantastic as ever. <br /> <br /> This film may not be as good, complex, profound or believable as other films that deal a little with the same type of relationship, such as `L 'Ã‰cole de la chair' or 'Post coitum, animal sad, 'but' The Love Letter 'can still be proud of itself, for it casts a rare different light on this kind of relationship. And that difference makes this movie eminently enjoyable. By being unambitious and relying on great charms of small stars, Dreamworks, this time you really make my dream come true.
