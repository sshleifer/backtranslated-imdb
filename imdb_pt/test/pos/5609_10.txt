This is my favorite movie by Hal Hartley. All his movies are small jewels. I love independent films and I hope Hal Hartley never becomes mainstream or runs out. What if the Lord Jesus came back and loved His people so much that He could not open the last book and destroy the unbelievers? It was good to see P. J. Harvey in a movie since I was a fan of his music. Do not watch this, if you are a fan of Hollywood movies, you will be disappointed.
