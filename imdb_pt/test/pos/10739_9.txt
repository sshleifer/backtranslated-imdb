Kramer vs. Kramer is a movie to hold and not forget. It's not one of the most popular movies of all time and it's certainly one of the best weaker movies, but that does not mean it's not important yet. I thought the movie was well done and made you just want to watch more and more of it. The performances were the best positive for the film and Dustin Hoffman played one of his best roles he has ever done as the lone workaholic who has to take care of his son as his wife separates from him. Billy, who is the son of Hoffman, did another great performance along with Meryl Streep, playing Billy's depressed mother. Kramer vs. Kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10 but manages to make the film worth watching and it pays to worry about it. Certainly, one of Hoffman's best movies he's ever made. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Hedeen Outlook: 9/10 *** + A-
