Inexplicably, I watched this movie for the first time only a few days ago and I understood from the beginning the reason for all this fuss. This movie caught my attention from beginning to end, and showed me the full range of emotions (and may have helped me discover some of which I never knew.) Dustin Hoffman shines as Ted Kramer. He is absolutely convincing as a man having to deal with at least three different challenges in life: an abandoned husband, a workaholic executive, and a loving father. Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less important to the film simply because Joanna was missing out on much of it, but when she was onscreen, she gave Hoffman a run for her money. The real highlight, though, (in my opinion) had to be young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. Children are always the innocent victim in a marital collapse, and Justin seemed absolutely natural and completely believable in this role as he deals with the conflicting emotions around his mother and his adjustment to life with his father, only then to have the confusion about why he should have to leave his father when it was his mother who came upon him. Young Justin did not seem to miss anything in this difficult role. <br /> <br /> After all, this is an excellent Oscar-cut movie whose only weakness was what I thought was disappointing. decision to go to the happy and happy ending, which was totally unrealistic, considering the destructive custody battle that Ted and Joanna had gone through. But there is not much to complain about here. <br /> <br /> 9/10
