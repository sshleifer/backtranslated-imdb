I had never read much about (or even seen photos) from the British comedy group The Crazy Gang, but my positive experiences with contemporaries Will Hay and Arthur Askey - and especially Graham Greene's high praise for FROZEN LIMITS ). The funniest English-language image produced to date ... can be compared to LAST SECURITY and THE GENERAL ") - made me take a chance on Network Network's R2 DVDs and the subsequent GASBAGS movie (1941, see below), both of which were released on early this year with virtually no fanfare. A British western is a rarity, but a western British parody is even rarer (CARRY ON COWBOY [1965] was still about 25 years away). By the way, returning to the Silent classics mentioned by Greene, the film seems to me most obviously debtor of THE GOLD RUSH (1925) and WAY OUT WEST (1937). In addition, it is also presented as a variation of the fairy tale "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (which had just been immortalized on the screen through Walt Disney's animated masterpiece) and where the seventh member is played by the old comics and frequent Will Hay. leaf Moore Marriott; the Gang really calls the beautiful heroine Eileen Bell by that name, and there's even a fun sequence with the six getting ready to go to bed and whistling the dwarven music from the Disney movie! Six comedians (three sets of comedy duo: Flanagan & Allen, Nervo & Knox and Naughton & Gold) may be the biggest group of this type - though not all their personalities appear here: my favorites. great Bud Flanagan (looking a bit like Jim Backus), the heterosexual Chesney Allen and the mustachioed Teddy Knox; however, the bald Charlie Naughton used to be the center of attention - since he is the one that others always seemed to like. Still, it's Marriott who steals the movie since its first scene - where it tries to impersonate all the staff in the ruined theater of a ghost town! a very young Bernard Lee is also notable as the villain of the play. The Ore routine between Flanagan and Allen really anticipates Abbott and Costello's famous "Who's On First?" (the movie, in fact, depends on a lot of word play for your mood - which does not necessarily travels, especially at this time). However, there are several hilarious sequences - some of which even brought tears to my eyes: the opening scene in which the Gang was deposed by a bunch of angry lenders; his dressing up as Indians once they hit the Yukon; the Gang's trick of making everyone rich with the same piece of gold; all of them embody the Marriott sleepwalker to confuse villains (a gag that owes its origin to the hilarious sequence of mirrors of Marx Bros. in DUCK SOUP [1933]); the outline of punctual theater that mocks grayish melodramas; the surreal moment in which, pursued by the villains, one of the gangs climbs a ladder that forms part of the painted stage of the theater; and especially at the end, as a group of cantor cops gallop slowly to the rescue of the Gang (despite being stimulated by the Archers' increasingly impatient hero). The thin soundtrack and frantic nature of the gags themselves made it difficult for me to get all the jokes at times - the captions would certainly be welcome in this case. The Crazy Gang only made five films - with the first two also being well-regarded, OKAY FOR SOUND (1937) and ALF'S BUTTON AFLOAT (1938), and a much later reunion (though Allen had, by this time, and was replaced by Eddie Gray) called LIFE IS A CIRCUS (1960; directed by Val Guest who incidentally co-wrote both the Gang movies I bought as well as some of the Hay and Askey vehicles mentioned above!).
