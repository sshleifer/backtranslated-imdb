Victor Sjöström's "Körkarlen" plunges the viewer into the depths of his life for much of his time with gloomy scenes of alcoholic degradation, family violence and suicidal despair, but the most memorable passages involve the mythic image of death itself . Here Death is incarnated as a ghostly horse drawn carriage driven by a miserable sinner who was the last person to die on the previous New Year's Eve. For a year the unfortunate must collect the souls of the newly deceased, and after twelve months of this horrible servitude, the soul of the driver is finally released when the last person to die on December 31 becomes the new driver. The scenes involving this carriage (the film became known as "The Phantom Carriage" or "The Phantom Chariot" in the English-speaking countries) are strange and hypnotizing, using the double exposure cinematography that was quite sophisticated for the time and still effective when viewed today. Most impressive is that the carriage travels to the bottom of the ocean to collect the soul of a drowned person. As fascinating as these scenes, most of the film deals with the downward spiral of David Holm, interpreted by the director himself in a discreet portrait of a man who gave up the possibility of a decent life. In flashbacks we see Holm enjoying a nice day at the beach with his wife, kids and brother, and he seems to be a perfectly normal guy. Abruptly, without accompaniment or explanation, we then see Holm as an alcoholic wreck, in distress with the law and alienated from his family. Usually, this jump from Before-After may seem like a shortcoming of storytelling, but in that case, filmmakers rely on us to fill in the sordid and familiar details on their own. It is suggested that Holm has been diverted by his friend Georges, the drinking companion who first tells the story of the Ghost Chariot, but whatever the cause of his fall, Holm seems to be a lost cause, a stingy drunk who takes perverse. pleasure in inflicting pain on his family and refusing to reform. While David Holm is our central figure, the true catalyst of the story is a young Salvation Army nurse who has a sympathetic interest in his case and stubbornly believes in him despite his hateful behavior. When the nurse herself is dying - indirectly due to her care in Holm's name - she asks to see him and inadvertently sets in motion a series of events that will result in her recovery. <br /> <br /> This film resembles Dickens' tale of Scrooge in the use of ghostly visitors who inspire a deeply flawed man to take stock of his life, to suffer from bad behavior, and to reform. I also remembered Terry Vigen's 1917 drama of Sjöström, in which a man returns from prison to find his house empty and his family gone (a sequence echoed here). The director also reiterates a standard theme of Scandinavian folklore, previously found in his "Berg-Ejvind och haustru h" (also known as "The outlaw and his wife", 1918) that no man can overcome his fate. This time, however, it can be argued that David Holm really manages to escape his seemingly inevitable fate as he has a second unexpected chance to make amends. Spectators who expect a plunge into the supernatural will appreciate the sequences that characterize the title's Ghost Chariot, but may not be prepared for the painful examination of this film from the alcoholic fall of a troubled man. But those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will enjoy "Körkarlen" in its entirety. It is with the best serious cinema of its time and is certainly one of the most accomplished works of Sjöström.
