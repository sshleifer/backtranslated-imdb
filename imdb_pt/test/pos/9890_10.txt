Check out will be released Friday, September 15, 2006. via the AMC theater chain starting in New York. Times Square, 66 and 3rd Ave, West 84th Street. This film was one of the heart, for the heart. Mark Lane, Jon Stewart, Mark Harrington, Mark Jensen, Nick Pike, Peter Falk, Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold, Mark Lane, movie was something special. The need to comfort the elderly is intended, the closeness of the family is more evident now than ever. I would recommend this movie for all ages and races. This story touches the truth for anyone with or without a family.
