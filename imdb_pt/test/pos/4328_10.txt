Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find Desmond completely lost. His traumatic past experience before navigating to the island is revealed through flashbacks. Sayid draws a plan with Jack to surprise "The Others" in case Michael crosses the group. John Locke persuades Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and does not hit the computer button to see what will happen. <br /> <br /> This episode is one of the best of Season Two. . Unfortunately, we, lovers of "Lost", can see the lack of respect that the producers of this impressive series have with the fans. In the US, the date of this episode was broadcast on May 24, 2006. So throughout this period, fans have to wait for Season Three in a situation of great suspense, with Jack and his group surrounded by "The Others" and finding the truth. about Michael and the death of Ana Lucia and Libby; John locked inside the hatch without intending to push the button and Mr. Eko in desperation out of the hatch. I hope that the fate of "Lost" is better than "Angel" and its disappointing conclusion (or lack of conclusion) after five seasons. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
