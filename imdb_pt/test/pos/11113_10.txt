"Fame" has been one of my favorite movies for years! It's not just an 80's musical movie of "that" high school in NYC, it's LEGENDARY - people no longer refer to High School of Performing Arts, but "Fame School" !! <br /> <br /> The characters are real, they are not "Hollywood" and their stories are real. The film accompanies them during the four years of school, beginning with a powerful monologue of an Auditions student and ending with a spectacular graduation parade. <br /> <br /> Apparently some find the Broadway show better, however, it is my opinion that you should definitely see this movie and have your own vision. For those who like to watch movies and would like to have the "classics" down, this is certainly one of them. It's an example of one of those movies that was really great, with actors that we loved for those 2 hours, and then we never saw them again ... they are classics "Fame students". <br /> <br /> FAMA live forever.
