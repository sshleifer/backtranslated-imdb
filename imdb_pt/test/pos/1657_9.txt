What a movie gas! "Film Noir" has always been one of my favorite genres, but this one stands out from the rest. Only "The Big Sleep", "Out of the Past", "Murder My Sweet" and "The Killers" can approach this classic caper. I know these four American films I mentioned are not cover movies by themselves, but rather are detective stories with complicated plots that still exude a "noirean" quality, similar to "Rififi". <br /> <br /> What is different here is how Jules Dassin sets in motion the overall mood of the film, not only in the brave realism of the directors but also in the use of the streets of Paris as a subliminal character and co-conspirator in himself. ! The film revolves around "le Stephanois," a somber, grumpy and complicated ex-convict being pulled for a last chance with heavy rewards. Even though he is a tough tough guy, he still feels a desire for some kind of redemption, freeing himself from the demons of his past (hey, he saved little Toni!). Dassin chose the right guy (Jean Servais) for that role. <br /> <br /> That aside, the rest of the story unfolds as we travel through the famous "silent" caper scene to the end of the story. the disappearance of the main "perps". Only her women survive except Ida, Mario's honey. They seemed to better understand the underlying futility of it all!
