This started off terribly. Photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (ok, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cool' colors in unique sequences is surprising. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants with that. <br /> <br /> Now, the downsides. The script was horrible. The part of Lopez ended up being irrelevant or totally useless for the plot. She seemed to star in the movie just to sell herself and the photo. The three beds seemed too obvious. The baptism of the child Carl was a psychologically underlined way of embarking on the reason why Carl "worked". And so on .. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie had a great way to show where Singh comes from. Why do the most talented directors seem to emerge from India today?
