I agree with all the above mentioned comments. This show was a delight to watch. Funny, witty, great performance and zany sets. It is always exciting to find a program that is intelligently written, assumes the public has brains and shows a subtle mood. I would spend money on money, too hard to see again on DVD. And as long as we're asking the Smart Series who never had a chance ... How about Maximum Bob's DVD releases (another well-written duck show with a delightful cast of characters.) And add to the list ... Age or place of the Frank. There is a way to release these shows from the vaults and into the hands of dedicated fans and new audiences.
