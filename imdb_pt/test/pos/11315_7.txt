Seeing this movie brought back to me the memories of September 11th. The first thing I remember that morning was watching TV footage of an airplane flying in a large building, and my immediate thoughts "Must be a preview of a new Tom Clancy movie." <br /> <br /> This was not a Tom Clancy movie. This was certainly not a British version of "The Sum Of All Fears". The typical Tom Clancy movie or novel has a relatively small cast, a linear plot and usually some sort of resolution. This movie did not have any. Of course, what I saw directly on the screen was a small cast, a plot and a vague resolution, but like September 11, the point was that the reality was much bigger and more complex. <br /> <br /> Work on systems planning and the reality of the disaster preparedness exercise itself and the disaster itself are painfully obvious. It is impossible to prepare for a disaster like this, nor will it be possible to deal with it when it does. <br /> <br /> From the discussion between the police (not being done enough to prepare) and politicians (giving everyone in the tube a gas mask would cause panic), the constant announcements of loudspeakers (You do not is in danger to your health but does not go home before decontaminating you), and (Do not eat, drink, or smoke before decontaminating yourself), I was at the limit throughout the movie. Not the least desire to channel the surf. <br /> <br /> This movie was 90 minutes long. It could have been twice as much, and yet not shown as much detail as possible. Instead, he left enough unspoken to allow each of us to imagine the details, each of us in our own way. It made everything so much more real to me than any Tom Clancy movie. <br /> <br /> I lived in London once, and just off the Edgeware Road. And I took the train from Waterloo station many times. While I watched Dirty War, I kept saying to myself that this is just fiction. Now. <br /> <br /> God willing, this movie will continue to be fiction, and sometime in 20 or 30 years, my nephews will be able to watch this movie and remember the beginning of the 21st century, and panic made us feel very . I hope, as much as I do today, to see Cold War memorabilia with the evil Communist Regime of the mid-twentieth century, and remember "Drop and Cover" exercises at school.
