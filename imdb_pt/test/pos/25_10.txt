This is a movie that deserves another look - if you did not see it for a while, or a first look - if you were very young when you left (1983). Based on a play of the same name, it is the story of an older actor who heads a Shakespeare repertory company in England during World War II. He deals with his stress of trying to perform a Shakespeare every night while facing problems like theatrical bombings and a company made up of older or disabled actors - the physically fit young people being taken to the military. He also deals with your relationship with various members of your company, especially with the dresser. So far everything sounds a little boring, but nothing could be further from the truth. Although tragic in general, the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high. The two male leaders received Oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys human drama, theater - especially Shakespeare, or anyone who has worked behind the scenes in any capacity. The events behind the scenes make up another facet of the film that will be fascinating to most viewers.
