/ * may contain SPOILERS, but of course it does not matter :) * / * Battleship Potemkin is an impressive spectacle of haunted images. The visual direction is (well, and has been) inspiring, the scale of the film is impressive, and the technique is certainly a pioneer. What is really surprising is, in my opinion, the depth and effectiveness of a film, devoid of proper literary script, sound (save the soundtrack), decent image quality, today's false (deep) referentialism, exceptional performance What you get is a purely visual experience to be remembered. <br /> <br /> BTW, the previous poster noted: "Eisenstien felt after much suffering to give the heroes what they wanted.The problem is that you think Eisenstein is building a great final fight and then he fools you I would rather see a great final scene of action. "<br /> <br /> I must warn you, that the end is not cheap, and Eisenstein was not being generous to the heroes. The story, however, was. Potemkin actually went through the squad as shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, I strongly recommend seeing the Battleship Potemkin for anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema. Look at this with a movie buddy, that kept me talking for hours. However, if you tend to consider movies, generally accepted as "big" or "classic", as "slow" or "boring", this movie may not be for you yet. There is not much cheap entertainment here. <br /> <br /> For me, it's a full 10/10.
