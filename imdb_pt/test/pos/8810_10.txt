It takes a lot for a movie to reach the already numbed particles in my brain that have not yet been taken advantage of because of the overloaded world and around the world of films. But this movie has entered my list of 'magic films'. To become a "magic film," he must leave every strand of my being trembling in what I can only define as "happiness" and "complete satisfaction." This film has harnessed the fibers of how my mind thinks and if it were not for the deeply personal bond that my head and the head of those doing it would share, it would be like another "dead rave scene" movie when the '90s blew up with their Mania of ecstasy. That's not how the movie was for me. He came up to me and pulled up something that I thought was long dead and pushed me to the point of criticizing me. I've forgotten how long it's been since I've seen something that got me so good inside. I strongly suggest seeing this movie.
