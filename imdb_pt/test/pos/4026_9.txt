Valeria, an elegant and beautiful young woman, lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a lover for one night or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference to be completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take steps to approach this special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows him to answer his questions only with a "yes", "no" or "I do not know". . The way to accentuate the character's solitude is magnificent. An example would be the distance of both Massimo and Valeria having coffee in the same room, separated by subtle divisions and not seeing each other. I could mention several sequences, however, it is better to watch the movie. It's amazing to note that not a single detail is out of control of the director. Although all actions are performed in slow movements, no screams or special effects are required, but only a great performance and a touching and well written story. I loved.
