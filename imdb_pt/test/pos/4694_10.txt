By mistake, I ordered a BBC series, the new version of Robin Hood. Very disappointing compared to RoS. Fantasies and terrible origins. While I liked the sheriff, who took the cues from Nick Grace, the rest of the cast left a lot to be desired. As an "example", Marion's costume looked suspicious as if it had come from Walmart. And Sir Guy, well, he looked like a character from a movie from outer space! RoS stole the spotlight, probably forever, on the storytelling of this tale. Clannad's cast, costumes, stories, scenarios, footage and soundtrack are all excellent, as evidenced by all the 26-year continuous feedback. RoS is a timeless classic. My thanks to all who made the series.
