One of Western Mann's most obscure Westerns, The Last Frontier was also his only Western knight (in addition to a brief episode at Winchester '73), although of course he focuses on strangers and internal conflicts rather than offering a Fordian celebration of camaraderie and shared ideals. Situated not in its beloved country, but in the foothills and forests, it is a much more cynical view of the frontier life, in many ways its Apache Forte, without the need to preserve the legend: this outpost is composed of misfits, failures, cowards and the strange competent officer ignored by his superiors, ill-led while the Civil War takes precedence and all the best that the army has to offer. <br /> <br /> Victor Mature and James Whitmore are the free hunters who find civilization creeping over them when they are relieved of their skins and pack horses by a local tribe, hampered by the cavalry's incursion into their territory. Instead of blaming the Indians for their losses, they decide that it is the army's fault to build the fort and decide to demand compensation from them, eventually joining their ranks as scouts. But despite the best efforts of the kind and competent commander of Guy Madison to bring Maduro into the 19th century and make him fit to wear the uniform, the arrival of Robert Preston's humbled colonel eager to take revenge on the tribe that drove him out of his own advanced post ?? and Mature's clumsy passion with the Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft, much of a blank slate here to do much with the role of a woman who is tired of being saved by men who think they know what's best for her) ? Soon, things lead to a much darker territory. It was not long before some of the soldiers were planning to kill each other, both sides trying to incite their subordinates to do the act for them: it is not surprising that Madame throws away the blue coat he had coveted for a long time, shouting " I would have died for it, but it's just a dirty dirty rag! "The Stallone of his day, Mature was one of those actors who could surprise you with the excellent performance here and there when combined with the right part and the right director . Is not this one of your best days, despite having your most complex part, wickedly enough as a simple man? well-intentioned but drunk, violent, uneducated, and with a subtle, almost childlike lust, the part seems designed with Burt Lancaster in mind, with some striking similarities to his character in The Kentuckian. But Robert Preston's Ahab-like colonel is clearly the best role, determined to resurrect the career he destroyed in a single, disastrous Civil War suicide attack by launching another useless suicide campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight and out of mind of promotion frame. In his obsession to rescue his career, he departs from any hope of moral redemption, driven either by his feeling of shame by his wife's sympathy or by the promotion of old comrades whom he considers his inferiors. It is beyond salvation, but is there still a recognizable human being there and a not wholly without a sense of integrity? Does he genuinely admire Madison's courage in making a futile attempt to get orders from Preston counter-attacked by his superiors? as his hero, the film is a little rough around the edges (and boasts one of the most surreal and merry title songs of any Western), but this only tends to make is more interesting, and there are many typically stylish Mann camera moves and plays in perspective, while the frontier scenario is convincingly hard and primitive. Unfortunately, the shortcomings of the first CinemaScope lenses are very apparent on the Columbia DVD, with the often dark image (the CinemaScope 2.55: 1 required a great deal of additional lighting and the early Scope films show a lot of trial and error) and sprinkles.
