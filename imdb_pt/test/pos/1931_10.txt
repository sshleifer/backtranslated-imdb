Waterdeep examines the pressures and ambitions of an ordinary man in a compelling documentary. The testimony and archive footage are a fascinating sight of the late 1960s and a revolutionary round in the world's yacht race. Personal conflicts of duty for family, self, and reputation are thrown into one of the most memorable and moving movies I have ever seen. I was not familiar with the story of this story and the drama was directed successfully and clearly. The story is mostly respectful to the participants with implied heroes and villains rather than ruthlessly exposed. Most of the interpretation is left open to the viewer, allowing space to relate personally to situations and characters. This movie is a bitter and sweet experience with a fun mix of suspense, joy and drama.
