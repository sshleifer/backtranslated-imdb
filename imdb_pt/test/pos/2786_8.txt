Surprising, witty, fun and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student going to study in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story begins, of course there are some calms in the middle and the story sometimes distances itself from the main character, but the viewer does not mind - the film is young, fresh and light. even if I do not agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back, you are no longer part of that universe. But that's just me. The film is deep and at the same time very light. Legal and recommendable.
