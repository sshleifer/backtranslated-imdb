The answer ..... No, unfortunately not. Although miller and sweep should be acclaimed as an extravagant cinematic treat. The drama, suspense, romance and unidentified crowd at the end add to the movie complex plots that must have been too much for the public of 1898. An enlightening experience, one for the whole family!
