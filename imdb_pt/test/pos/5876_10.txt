Since there have been so many reviews on this film, I will write in list form and try to address issues that have not been discussed. <br /> <br /> 1. Dana Andrews was 38 years old during the filming of this film. His character according to the script was in his 20s. Andrews, a highly underrated actor, brilliantly played a character who was supposed to be much younger. <br /> <br /> 2. Fredric March, like all great actors, sometimes needs to be restrained by the director to avoid over-acting. He was attacking the cameras when he was drunk the night after his arrival and also the next morning when he was examining his hanging in his mirror. <br /> <br /> 3. Dana Andrews was superb as he was in "Laura," "The Ox-Bowl Incident," "A Walk in the Sun," "The Purple Heart," and many other movies. Why did Fredric March win the Oscar and why Dana Andrews was not even nominated for his outstanding performance? <br /> <br /> 4. Harold Russell gave the best performance I have ever seen by a non-actor. <br /> <br /> 5. I realized it was the 1940s, but Dana Andrews seemed to have no romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife (Virginia Mayo). <br /> <br /> 6. Ray Teal, who played the right-wing fanatic, years later became famous for playing the sheriff in "Bonanza." 7. The Southern teacher wrote that the film was slow, boring and misrepresented. The teacher is more than likely uninformed about classic films. The beauty and meaning of these ageless classics is that they are studies of characters who avoid profanity, excessive violence and free sex. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that zero out of 3 people found my review useful.
