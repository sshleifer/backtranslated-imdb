This film gives us a bit of the history of WWII, along with some thrilling novels, a bit of fantasy and significant emotion - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails, and here again does a great job. And the other main characters as well. A key character, the doctor / father played by John Hurd, offers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some of the events are a little overlapping to be real, but I'm sorry, knowing that this is partly a fairy tale and a fantasy. My wife and I really enjoyed the movie. And it's good to see people taking risks to love the enemy. A man who left the theater near us said to his wife, "Now is the way to make war!" I think you'll see what he means when you observe the Italian occupants of this beautiful Greek island.
