Great movie. I was laughing all the time. Because? Well, I'm from Austria, I can get along with the German (Bavarian) mood. So I guess this movie only makes sense when you're a native German speaker. Stefan and Erkan are speaking in a new kind of Turkish-German accent, which has become very popular in our countries (GER & AUT). But of course they are very stupid. As in all comedies, your personal mood will decide, whether thumbs up or down.
