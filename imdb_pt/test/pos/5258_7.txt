I admit I did not see the original movie, but I read the piece, so I have some information about the original. If you dodge the fact that this is a remake of an old classic, this movie is clever, witty, new and hilarious. Yes, selection decisions may seem strange, but they work. <br /> <br /> I am a convinced feminist, and I have not been offended at all by this movie - despite what other women might be saying. This is not a movie for men to see (so, please, ladies, do not drag your boys to see you, that's just cruel); women will get the jokes, situations and relationships. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the depth that Annette Bening brought to her character ... she did a great job. Debra Messing was lovely and Candice Bergen was fantastic. I was less impressed with Meg Ryan ... she brought excitement to the table, but her comedy about it was less strong. The cast of only women is strong, and definitely a kind of laughing comedy. I really enjoyed this movie and I plan to go see it again with my mother. Women will understand.
