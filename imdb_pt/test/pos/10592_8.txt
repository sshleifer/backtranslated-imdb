I personally found the film great. I've had this in pre-order for a month and watched twice on the day I got in the mail, and several times since ... Yes, the time lapses may be a bit much, but the rest of the movie clearly makes up for that. All amateur cast, but the acting was right for each part. The plot itself is just ... slaughtered! There is no other way to describe it. Who makes a movie about someone being fucked! BAM, that's who. Genius. Simply genius. Two thumbs up. I would be honored to work with him any day, anytime, anything.
