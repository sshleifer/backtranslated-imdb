When taken as a whole for its ideas and dissections of the current bipartisan system and the political process, I think this is a great movie. Granted the film was not the comedy I expected but once I got more than this movie really made me think. Much of what we see and hear about any election is a joke. There is in particular a debate scene in this film that I felt was a masterful critique of our political debates and how policies are "discussed" in them. I encourage anyone who thinks our process is good for watching this movie. If you want something to laugh about, however, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken are not your usual selves. In this movie they show us that truth hurts, not that truth is funny.
