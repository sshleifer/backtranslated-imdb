Deepa Mehta's "Fire" is innovative, bold and artistic. A masterful social commentary on the plight of women from conservative Indian middle-class families, this is a movie no one should miss. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give stellar performances by underestimating their characters as much as possible. A.R. Rahman's music is the work of genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's score and together they create such incredible sound montages that effectively portray the world views around Radha and Sita whenever they seek support from one another. This movie is not about lesbianism as many have labeled it. Lesbianism is only part of the film. It is unfortunate that most people tend to write the movie by calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning.
