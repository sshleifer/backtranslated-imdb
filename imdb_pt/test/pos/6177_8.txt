I am Czech and soldiers (not just pilots) who escaped from Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad are true heroes and brave men in our history for me. This film by Academy Award®-winning director "Kolya" (1996) is a tribute to these men. It is the first large-screen film about Czechoslovak soldiers from WWII since "Nebesti jezdci" (1968). I think "Dark Blue World" is a good movie - good acting, good special effects, good music, etc. The film is half in English and some actors are British. But the best thing about this movie is its sheer existence. It is an excellent opportunity to show people from all over the world (and also many people in the Czech Republic ...) that Czechoslovakia's role in World War II was not only an occupied country but an active member of the allied campaign. <br /> <br /> The main characters are older and smarter, Frantisek and young Karel. They escaped together from Czechoslovakia, they are flying on the same squad and they fell in love with the same woman ... Maybe it's a cliché, but fortunately this plot is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes (including big fights). I do not want to compare "Dark Blue World" with "Pearl Harbor", someone will like PH more and someone will like DBW. But if you like happy endings, DBW is not for you. So I think it's a very good movie for everyone who likes this kind of stories and a really good movie that wants to know something about this chapter of Czechoslovakia's history. <br /> <br /> BTW, main theme "Dark Blue World" is by the Czech composer of the 30s and 40s, Jaroslav Jezek. He wrote this topic when he lost his eyes ...
