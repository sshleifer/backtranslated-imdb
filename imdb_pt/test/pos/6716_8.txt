"Lifeforce" is a truly bizarre adaptation of Colin Wilson's novel "The Space Vampires," written by Dan O'Bannon & Don Jakoby. A joint US-British space exploration team makes an astonishing discovery: an alien spacecraft resting inside the Halleys Comet, containing three entities that look like people, one of them a feminine beauty (the so attractive Mathilda May). They take these discoveries back to their own spacecraft. Big mistake. <br /> <br /> It turns out that these creatures drain the lives of human beings, and as American Colonel Carlsen (an intense, nervous and committed Steve Railsback) and the British SAS Colonel Caine (a solid Peter Firth) horror, an infestation of vampirism overtakes London, with the fate of the Earth in the balance. <br /> <br /> This picture is certainly not without imagination. He moves a little slowly at times, but offers so many strange and fanciful and visual ideas to widen his eyes that it's hard not to have fun. The first of Tobe Hoopers' three-deal contract with Cannon Films (he followed with the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre II" and the remake "Invaders from Mars"), he makes it truly unique. Incorporating elements of science fiction, vampire movies, zombie movies and end-of-the-world sagas, it's like nothing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Railsback and Firth are ably supported by strong Brit actors such as Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart, Michael Gothard, Aubrey Morris and John Hallam. Mathilda May is very memorable as the charming and enigmatic villain; It certainly does not hurt that she performs a great deal of her nude scenes. Also noteworthy is an exhilarating soundtrack by Henry Mancini, composer of "Pink Panther". <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous, but I also think it's fun. It's an extravagant and lively entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
