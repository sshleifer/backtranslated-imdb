A forerunner of "Citizen Kane" in his analysis of the life of a recently deceased tycoon, reviewed here by his faithful secretary in a series of interlocking flashbacks. In Spencer Tracy's 15th film, he already looks middle-aged, even in scenes where he must be young! <br /> <br /> A kind of silent screen is understandable given the vintage, but this is a very pleasant, well written drama.
