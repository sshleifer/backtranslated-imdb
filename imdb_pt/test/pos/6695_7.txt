I have this as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 DVDs. I knew nothing about the history of the series. Season 1 of the series has the pilot episode as episode 1 and then plus 3 episodes for a total of 4. Season 2 lists 5 episodes, being the last Beyond Good and Evil with an original Air Date of December 7 1998. The other 4 episodes in Season 2 were broadcast from December 1997 to Febrausry 1998. So Beyond Good and Evil looks like Season 3 of Episode 1 except there are no more episodes in Season 3. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here. The two main characters of the first 8 episodes, Dr. Iain McCallum and Dr. Angela Moloney are missing from this episode being replaced by Dr. Dan Gallagher (Nathaniel Parker) and Dr. Charley Fielding (Eva Pope ). I recognized Nathaniel Parker from The Inspector series Lynley Mysteries, which began in 2001. So they were planning to have a 3rd season but only one episode was broadcast. <br /> <br /> It seems strange to try to continue a series. named after the main character, McCallum, when the main character is gone from the series. So they might be planning a comeback from Dr. Iain McCallum, but when that failed, the series was canceled. I have no internal information on this, but I see that both John Hannah and Nathaniel Parker were involved in other projects in 1999. Does anyone have any information on this?
