If there is a theme of this film, it is that people can deal with difficulties having a good imagination. This family is poor, the father works in the cemetery and the mother works in double shifts, and Peter is constantly chosen for several reasons and becomes increasingly frustrated by being often confused with a girl. He is just beginning to approach that age of 10 or 11, where his perceptions begin to change, and think that his appearance begins to matter. The background of this story is the 1967 World's Fair and the Centennial of Canada. The biggest moments of the film come during the various fantasy sequences, where we see how they deal. Watch the flim, and if you've had a childhood friend you've dreamed with and for some reason lost, you'll really like this movie. Children may like this movie, but only adults will appreciate it, including their references to the Bolsheviks and what parents will do for their children.
