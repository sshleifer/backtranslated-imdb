Farscape - is the only Sci-Fi Show that has restarted the Interest in Science Fiction in me. <br /> <br /> But Farscape is much more than simple and simple Sci-Fi. Comedy, drama and more :) The acting is very good. Fortunately Farscape survived is also cancellation and showed with Peacekeeper Wars that is still not dead :) I hope there is a future for Farscape :) In my opinion, it is also not problematic that some of the characters in the Show are muppets. You have to look back and you will see what beauty Farscape is. <br /> <br /> Farscape has set a new standard on television and I think it will be really difficult for new shows to prove that they can be the same or better than Farscape. I love this show :) <br /> <br /> SaphirJD
