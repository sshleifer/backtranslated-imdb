This, without a doubt, is the greatest unfoldment for the Jackass of all time, hell, that even takes Jackass out of the water. <br /> <br /> Imagine this: you have a group of guys who just did not want to grow up, play a ton of money, and some serious acrobatics, and you have Viva La Bam. <br /> <br /> This show is so familiar, and it's not just the "gang" running around being complete idiots (as in Jackass). For example: Bam's parents, April and Phil, are in all episodes, with appearances from the obese Bam's uncle, Don Vito! The reason the Margera family makes us laugh is simple: someone in our family can relate. April: The woman who wants to live life by the book and follow the tradition. Phil: The guy who tries to be a good father and, finally, Bam: That son who never left school. <br /> <br /> The jokes and jokes in every episode give you a guaranteed laugh, and buying the DVDs is definitely recommended! Another thing that is surprising to see, is how Margera is casual about the whole thing. He said in interviews that for most episodes, he is not acting, and is only acting instinctively. <br /> <br /> What I liked most about the whole thing, however, is the amount of Margera influence. has more than MTV. He wanted Slayer to play in his backyard, MTV did that. He wanted to be with Dani Filth for one day and to have a Cradle Of Filth show in his backyard happened. <br /> <br /> Add to that your passion for the love-metal band (and debated as emo) HIM and your brother's garage band, CKY, and there's a lot going on. <br /> <br /> If you liked Jackass, you will fall in love with it. I borrowed the first season from a friend last year, and I'd give up on my legs to meet Viva La Bam Crew. You will not be disappointed, and I can promise you that you will be in points at the end of it all!
