Staff member Kitty (Sothern) is engaged to Bill (Kelly), who neglects to work long hours in her garage to save money for the wedding. After standing on her birthday, Kitty goes on a double date / blind date, where she meets the heir of the Bob Hartwell (Hamilton) department store. She falls in love but leaves him when her protests of love seem to cover the desire for her to be his mistress instead of his wife. Faithful Bill gathers to console her, and finally she yields to her repeated requests to re-establish the engagement, pressured in part by Bill's support of her family after she loses her job. When Bob returns, however, convinced that he wants marriage after all, Kitty will follow his heart or his conscience? <br /> <br /> This movie was much better than I expected it to be. Bill's character initially looks like the kind of high-style Irish comic Jack Carson played so often. But Kelly (and script) infuses the character with true compassion and love, and Bill turns out to be the best person in the whole group. Viewers may find themselves cheering for him against the irresponsible Hartwell! The tone of the film swings, however, between the carefree romance and a much darker side, especially in depicting a dance marathon and a horrible accident in Bill's garage. The cast is at the end by the dependable Jane Darwell as Kitty's mother, a but still not completely obnoxious, Mickey Rooney as Kitty's younger brother, and Spencer Charters as the younger father of Kitty.
