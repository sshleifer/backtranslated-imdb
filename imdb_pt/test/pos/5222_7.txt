"Father Hood" is a little gem of a "road movie". Fine performances by Halle Berry, Sabina Lloyd and Brian Bonsall, two really fun "over-the-top" by Diane Ladd and Michael Ironside, and an extraordinary by Patrick Swayze. The film is aided by an unconventional plot, but seriously weakened by the flashback framing which results in an abrupt end of formulamatic. "Father Hood" would have run MUCH better without these "bookends". However, the film brings important issues of "family responsibilities" and the consequences of state intervention. As long as the breeding system rewards state institutions for NOT placing children, such abuses will exist. <br /> <br /> Choose this one. It's worth the "ride".
