I love this show. It's a twist on some of the earlier sensations and science fiction styles. they are not afraid to shoot and when they tend to die. Many shows are afraid of this and end up just pointing the guns and then having to be a stalemate. Farscape also comes complete with a host of comforting characters. They all grow in you to the point where it confuses you as you listen to them discuss taking some of the animatronic from their box to make the miniseries. From beginning to end, farscape leaves you with a sense of hope and despair as new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die, always surprising you. Worth a watch, even if you do not have the time.
