This is a great movie I have watched since I was 6 years old with my older sister. is the kind of movie you can watch multiple times and still laugh, smile and cry every time without ever getting bored of it like those of another movie. is a film that will live forever through generations of family. I love it :) when ranking 1-10 in my case I would easily rate 9.9 each time. <br /> <br /> It's a film about changing a girl (baby) and her first boyfriend (Johnny), their relationships within the family, the changes in baby and Johnny's world view during their relationship. THE DIRTY DANCE DANCE TO ALWAYS LIVE LIKE A CLASSIC WITHOUT TIME. thank you sorry though just for the short review.
