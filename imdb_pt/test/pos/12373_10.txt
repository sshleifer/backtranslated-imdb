Too said without words. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie. It was made in colors - not colored like in today's movies, but in a special use of monochrome colors (with nuances) that depict meaning, mood, sense and time. It should be seen in color as it becomes a completely different film. The story, by the Nobel Prize winner, Selma Lagerl√∂f, is effectively presented. You never have a clear sense of real, memory or ghost. Changes taking place in Swedish society at the time are subtly layered. More highly recommended. Try to rent it or find it online. I saw it in a Swedish film class and I want to add it to my film library.
