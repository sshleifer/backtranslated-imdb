When I saw the preview of the movie, I figured, "Here's another idiot TV movie written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera," but when I saw it, I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen star (and proof that she can actually act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love and marries a man (Eric Close, of Now and Again), but begins to lose confidence in him when a series of rapes begins to happen in your community. At first, she is blinded by his assurances that he is innocent and his love for him, but over time she continues to distrust him. <br /> <br /> While this sounds like the set-up to another boring TV movie melodramatic, it's actually a lot better than that because the characters are well played by Thiessen and Close, and the movie script allows they are much more complicated and intelligent than you expect; These are not just caricatures or cardboard characters that exist just to move the plot, but rather real, three-dimensional people, and we feel really worried about them. And the film is clever enough to provide an exciting and engaging climate for the story without resorting to idiotic action scenes, stupid cliches or cheap melodrama. Instead, we share the fears and inner conflicts of the main character, and we get a realistic picture of how she can solve them and do the right thing. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to give him a look, please do so. Your production values ​​are not exactly high-level (after all, it's a TV movie), but if you can see beyond that, there's a great story to take advantage of.
