A flawed mistake in the Ministry of Education causes the Nutbourne Boys School to share with the St. Swithin Girls' School. This complicates the respective head teachers of each school and leads to all sorts of chaotic happenings, however, the two are forced to come up with an uncomfortable alliance, hoping to avoid major problems. <br /> <br /> The happiest days of Your Life are based on John Dighton's 1948 play, with Dighton writing the role of director Whitchurch specifically for Margaret Rutherford. Replacing George Howe's part in the role of Headmaster Pond, is Alastair Yes, and here's the biggest glory of this cinematic adaptation, Sim & Rutherford are perfectly wonderful, jumping at each other to keep what is basically a movie a joke, a lot funny. Directed by the talented Frank Launder, and produced by the equally deft Sidney Gilliat, The Happiest Days of His Life is an essentially British film, obviously a forerunner of the St Trinians franchise, the film entertains children with their high and low heart- while tickling the adults watching with their very undercurrent undercurrent. Fortunately, the chaotic ending cemented everything that went before him to leave this particular spectator with a smile as wide as the Nutbourne Railway Station, very entertaining 8/10.
