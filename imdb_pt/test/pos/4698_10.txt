As listed and indicated in many previous reviews, this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients to its credit. In fact, more than 20 years after it was originally broadcast, it is still watched, re-watched, and has a huge global audience of fans, something that should indicate that the creators of this series have undeniably achieved something right. <br /> <br /> The root of the series' brilliance and remarkable appeal has to be, however, that is based on a wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters ?? all this is brought to life by wonderful actors. The characters are wonderful in particular because of their complexity. In contrast to many other Robin Hood adaptations, and indeed many other film and TV productions in general, the good guys in this series often make mistakes and can be seen as having apparent flaws while villains, though presented as evil and relentless. , can often be understood and even occasionally seem quite nice. Does Sherwood Robin really do a story about real and multifaceted people ?? instead of good and bad people? something that adds much to its uniqueness and remarkable appeal. In addition, despite being an action-packed series with countless incredible stunts (which are remarkable in themselves since this was done long before today's animation, green screens and so on. So behind each one of these endless guys falling castle walls, horses, and catching fire, there is actually a real person who at some point fell from a castle wall or a horse or catch fire), there is always an incredible dialogue going on between the different characters in each episode. Ultimately, however, is it usually baddies of the series? Nickolas Grace as the sheriff of Nottingham, Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne and Philip Jackson as the abbot Hugo of Rainault ?? who gets the best lines and who most often steals the show with their arguments full of wit and hypocrisy. "It's a wedding, not a celebration!" is just one of his many "pearls of wisdom" that seem to follow a life :-). <br /> <br /> 20 years after the fact, is it really hard to believe that Sherwood's Robin was originally something made for television? and apparently not with a lot of money? in order to provide fleeting fun on Saturday afternoon for small children in Britain. Filmed in beautiful locations, with clever and amazing scripts and incredible acrobatics and fantastic actors? many of whom give the performance of their lives in this show? this, in many ways, seems to be more professional and has more production value than many Hollywood movies.
