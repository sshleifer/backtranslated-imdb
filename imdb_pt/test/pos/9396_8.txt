I'm not sure what I might add that has already been said in some of those other very hilarious comments, but I'll try. <br /> <br /> So you know the plot: there is a bed possessed by a demon that "absorbs" and selectively disintegrates the bodies of whoever (or whatever) lies on him with his body full of Orange soda. We have the man, in some scenes looking strangely with Robert Smith of The Cure, coming out of the wall commenting on the events, and we have our several victims who just can not resist the comfort of this mystical bed. <br /> <br /> This is not a normal bed. Do not serve Bob! It not only eats people, but also cleans their own covers, and even makes itself. Who would not want a bed like that? He may even use his leaves as a rudimentary "loop" to bypass the escaped victims (especially if they are taking up half the length of the film to try to escape). <br /> <br /> Our "main" story (if you can call it that), is about those three girls who go out to this remote area to sit at home (??). I do not remember exactly, but it does not really matter, since there are many things that challenge the conventions that you have to give in and accept. The dialogue in the film is like no other; the characters talk to each other apparently through telepathy, because their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo. One of our girls believes she is not loved by the rest of the "gang" and makes sure to tell us all her feelings about it through an echo voice, but we do not care; character development was played out the window a long time before in this movie so why start now? There are scenes where the bed laughs, snores, makes crunches and makes several other noises that we judge to be judged by our cast's non-reaction to these noises, can not be heard. This and telepathy make the question of diegese very difficult to determine ... but that's right ... this is the deathbed: The bed that eats and defies all logic, so that's fine. Makes a lush dreamy quality for this most bizarre movie If you buy (hehe buy ... I said "buy"?) This DVD, make sure you check the introduction by the director. He explains that the filming of this "movie" began in 1972, did not end in 1977, he bought them for a few years without luck, and then advanced 26 years until 2003 and was released on DVD. Supposedly someone somewhere had an impression of this in some other country and made piracy after his bootleg and it was by chance, in a message board no less, that our director found evidence that people knew and gasped! he cared about his little-known movie. That's where he decided to shoot him and release him. I'm glad he did. Once you have heard the title of this movie, you MUST see it. I, for example, will buy this and I will preach your gospel around the world ... starting with this comment
