Of course, seeing some boom microphones does not mean anything, does it? Lord, Rudy Ray Moore and D'Urville Martin really put it together, did not they? I laughed a lot, as often happens in these types of movies, but I do not know what I should laugh about because I laughed at so many other things. I'm not saying the movie was bad, but I'll say that a little more editing would have done wonders. I'm a big fan of Blaxploitation, so I do not think it was awful, but I know "The Human Tornado" was several times better than that. I think those who get through this movie may need a Colt 45 or two later. I mean, it really helps you not to notice the boom microphones when you watch again.
