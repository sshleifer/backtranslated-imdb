I was able to see a preview of this film through UCLA's pre-screening program, and let me tell you: THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLE GOOD !!!! I have seen many movies, but few have made me laugh so sincerely or talk about the movie later than this. I had a decent respect for Tenacious D before seeing the movie, and now I'm MAD about them. I will definitely buy their album when it's released on the 14th and watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> If you were on the wall to see this movie, get out and go see! It is worth the extremely expensive price of movie tickets these days as you will surely lose a nut to laugh during the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Beyond comedy, the glorious and divine music that flows from KG's guitar and JB's voice is inspiring. The audience is left in a stupor that such beautiful harmonies and amazing riffs can be created in conjunction with such ridiculous (and hilarious) lyrics. If for nothing other than the song itself, this movie is worth the price of admission. <br /> <br /> With a wonderfully coherent plot that connects almost every aspect of traditional "D" history and trademarks, great new songs, hilarious comedy, and some stunning appearances, this movie is up there with the best ! Go see !!
