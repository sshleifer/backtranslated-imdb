For the most part, romance movies have never been my cup of tea. But Valley Girl is one of the few romantic movies that I could not only do but really enjoy. Nicholas Cage is great in his first role and Deborah Foreman is too cute. There are some parallel stories that tend to get confused, but not enough to lessen this movie.
