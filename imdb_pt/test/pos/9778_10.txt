This has to be one of the best productions in Australia. I completely disagree with the comments made by 'RamiNour101'. <br /> <br /> This series shows the depth of Australian friendship and the lengths they have been to helping each other. Episode 5 'Eddies Birthday' is a great example of this and really captures the Australian spirit. <br /> <br /> The music used throughout the series only emphasized the situation that men faced, their longing for home and their loved ones. The numerous entertaining interpretations of The Road to Gundagai capture the men's spirit and the fact that they never forgot home, and that they were small elements like singing a song that took them home for a while. <br /> <br /> As for the comment about being racist towards the Japanese people, the only thing to be said is that you can not change what happened. The Japanese treated the Australians very badly in Changi and represented him, otherwise it would be very misleading. Commenting on the accuracy of the script is also false. These six stories that are told in the series are composed of real P.O.W. <br /> <br /> The actors were superb; the best is in my opinion, Matthew Newton. His performance as David in the first episode was painful. From being a city boy, to being another unnamed face to his captors. We see him change drastically in the first episode because of his violent jungle attack, and in more episodes we can see how that event has changed him, he is more aware of what is really happening and is always one of the first episodes. to help the other members of Secret Nine. <br /> <br /> Stephen Curry also deserves a mention. His performance in 'Eddie's Birthday' is incredible, going from the group's roots to being sick, weak and unable to take care of himself. The companionship exhibits in this episode touch you on an emotional level and make you proud to be Australian. <br /> <br /> I study World War II at university level and discovered this series, if not physically true, spiritually true, as it captures the true spirit of what it was like to be an Australian soldier. <br /> <br /> Well done to John Doyle for capturing the spirit of Changi.
