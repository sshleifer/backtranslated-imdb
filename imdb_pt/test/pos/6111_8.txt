"Pink Flamingos" was revolutionary for the time, and even today it is still difficult to watch. Not that I did not like the movie, it's hilarious; but it's very repulsive and John Waters pushes the envelope as far as he can. The story concerns Babs Johnson (Devine), she is the dirtiest living woman. She lives in a trailer with her son Crackers and her daughter Cotton. Not to mention the obese Edie who is obsessed with eggs and sleeps in a crib. Then there's Connie and Raymond Marble, two filthy perverts who are jealous of Babs. They yearn to overcome it in being the most filthy person alive. This means that his janitor impregnates abducted women and sells babies to lesbian couples, showing people in public and even sending Babs a shit in the mail. Babs struggles to prove he's the craziest person alive. That includes even incest, murder and dog eating shit and other ill sex acts. It's a fun movie for the whole family. (well, depending on where you live?) Watch "Pink Flamingos", but do not forget your barf bag. For more perverse and strange sexual and bodily functions, see also "Sweet Movie".
