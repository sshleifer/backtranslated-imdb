This is the time of Christmas! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least is what you can expect from Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that Italian cinema did not make a work of art of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can also be considered at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, no need to name it. And finally this is also a great production by Italian standards of the time. In this film there is a rare balance of different elements, all understandable and pleasing in different levels of enjoyment. Real poetry, real humor, real tenderness, real drama, real beauty. No rhetoric, no easy surreal shortcut, no typical tourist image of Tornatore, no overdone performance, no director self-referentialism. There is also a cool use of two touching songs by Nina Simone, whose song I think has never been used properly for a score. So if this will not be a real revival for Italian cinema, it is an extraordinary evolution for Emanuele Crialese after his 'Breath' another definitive beautiful film. 'Nuovomondo' is not to be missed, it is this kind of 'medicine film' useful to enjoy film, watching movie, useful to enjoy and understand life. Francesco Cabras
