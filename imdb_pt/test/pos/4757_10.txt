"The Seven-Ups" looks like a replay of "The French Connection," which was released two years earlier. Both the late Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco make appearances, as does stunt double Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> But we're not dealing with French drug thugs; instead, we are dealing with a war against hoods and assorted criminals after a police officer is brutally killed by a thug. We began to see dislike and a pre-1990's in New York. <br /> <br /> I love watching this movie because it's thrilling to watch the action, and it's a reminder of a colder weather. That said, when comparing car chases, Mr. Hickman was involved in the three most compared: This movie, Bullitt and The French Connection. Each scene of persecution has its own qualities, and this is simply superb. <br /> <br /> And I'm glad that this title has seen the light of day on DVD.
