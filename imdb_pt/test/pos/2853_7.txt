Renee Zellweger is a Kansas housewife whose dominating husband is involved in drug trafficking. Two professional murderers - Morgan Freeman and her son, Chris Rock, murder her husband in their dining room. Zellweger, not observed by the killers, witnesses this and goes through a dissociative reaction, taking on the personality of a nurse - the homonym Betty - who is a character in his favorite novel. Believing herself to be the character on the TV, Zellweger takes off in her husband's car, which has a load of drugs in the trunk, and travels to Los Angeles, where he hopes to join another character in this afternoon drama, "Dr. David Ravell" Greg Kinnear. Not realizing that she is being pursued by the two successful men, she heads to Los Angeles where she manages to connect with Kinnear and is actually written for the show as a nurse named Betty. A handful of men, including the local sheriff, realize what's going on and also looks for Zellweger in Los Angeles. The ending is believable and pungent. <br /> <br /> If that sounds crazy, it's because it is. And it is the writer's responsibility, John C. Richards. The curious thing is that Richards and the director, Neil Labute, with the considerable help of the artists, practically give up everything. This is not a storyline that was cast in a familiar mold. No. I give bonus points for pure originality. Someone came out on a limb. Someone ventured into a movie that was NOT a copy or a remake of something that made money ten or fifty years ago. I imagine the people involved, kneeling every night, praying fervently. I do not know if the movie was remunerative, but it is more successful in its own aesthetic terms. <br /> <br /> It's what can be called the "premise" movie. You start with a single transformative event, in this case the murder of Zellweger's husband and his adoption of a genuinely new personality, and follow the logical paths that result realistically. "Groundhog Day" is another, better and more complicated example. "Nurse Betty" has its logical cracks, where incidents give up on its plausibility. For example, at a party in Los Angeles, Zellweger finally finds Kinnear, the guy who plays his ex-fiance on TV. She is stunned (because, after all, she thinks it's Betty, who lost her fianc√© a long time ago). She approaches Kinnear and some of her classmates and introduces herself as "Nurse Betty," the character. She addresses Kinnear with the name of her TV character, "David Ravell." The group is perplexed at first, then convinced that she is an aspiring actress who insists on remaining "in character" during the conversation - and then also after Kinnear was fascinated by her and bored others. Kinnear takes her home and even when she kisses him good night, she's still in the character, leaving Kinnear wide-eyed with astonishment at the relentless way she captures Betty's character. On the next date, Kinnear returns his love. This development, the relationship between Zellweger and Kinnear at this point, is a crack in logic, the kind that is absent from Groundhog Day. At the end of Night One, Kinnear, like anyone else, would realize that Zellweger is a clown without a circus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film, which includes many tours, exceeds expectations. The relationship between Morgan Freeman and his insolent and nihilistic son is wonderfully enunciated. Morgan is flawless in his exasperation. He can fall in love with Zellweger as he discovers clues about his whereabouts and activities, and in the end he can not kill himself. She's too sweet to shoot. After her transformation into Betty, she left a note in Kansas. "I want to help my whole life, be it animal, vegetable or mineral." Who could harm the author of such an absurd connotation? His admiration for her comes as an epiphany as he stands near one of the spotlights on the edge of the Grand Canyon. Zellweger, dressed as Dorothy, or perhaps the Good Witch of the Orient - well, characters who, like Zellweger, are from Kansas anyway - appear to Freeman and he embraces her and kisses her tenderly. It's a strange scene, romantic and a little scary. I once stood in one of those lights and threw a few pieces of paper into the upward chain of the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by a thousand whirling bats that had mistakenly perceived the swirling rags like butterflies. <br /> <br /> Right. Where I was? OK. I was trying not to run out of space. Zellweger's performance deserves applause. Everything she does, every movement, every statement, is naive and hesitant. She really is a nice character - and that despite the fact that she's not a glam-girl by Hollywood standards. But what an actress. Compare his performance as the 19th century hickory in "Cold Mountain". Just the opposite. But then everyone is ready to make this movie fun. Allyson Jannings does a good job in a minor role. Watch as she tells Greg Kinnear that she is thinking of killing her character in the soap opera in a drowning accident. Kinnear is one of those narcissists who wears the kind of thin ten-thousand-dollar black leather jackets that were popular back then. He laughs and says, "Oh, one of those shipwreck arrangements, right? Okay, how do I get back?" Jannings does not respond. She just smiles at him with those huge blue eyes and tilts her head mockingly. <br /> <br /> It is not a masterpiece of making movies, but a professional, good and original work for all involved.
