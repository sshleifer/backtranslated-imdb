Nothing less than magnificent photography / cinematography in this film. The fact that you keep looking and waiting for more flight sequences tells you that they have enough. The acting is fantastic, the stories are perfectly intertwined and the dogs are splendid ............. <br /> <br /> A must rent, see or see. <Br/> <br /> Do not be afraid of subtitles ........ <br /> <br /> it's worth a little therapy of aversion <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br> />
