As a fan of the book, this work is fantastically adapted; remaining faithful to the source materials and showing an honest respect for literary work. The intrigues translate well into the film because of Ron Howard's good eye for detail and good devotion to authenticity. <br /> <br /> I like Hanks like Robert Langdon. His portrait is genuine and earthy, with only the purest brightness of the Kip we all knew and loved, back to the "day." He is a good dramatic actor and, although I miss his comedic efforts, I like his more serious performances. The subject is no less controversial than the DaVinci Code, and the Vatican never seems to learn its lesson. As with the above-mentioned film, the Holy See issued a blunt rebuke and called for a global Catholic boycott of the film, which, of course, generated millions in ticket sales. Although the story of the "God particle" was played down dramatically, and science was written from this piece of science fiction, the fiction that was left, was fun and extremely well done. And, the truth be known, people who have not read the book will not notice any missing or minor elements in the story, since the screen version carries the main story on its own. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is not necessary to have seen the first installment of this franchise in order to take advantage of this second, which should have been a prequel in all honesty, although this does not detract from effectiveness, or intrude in continuity or franchise flow. In short, this is a good job. <br /> <br /> In short, it's good for a Friday / Saturday night session, although running it might be a bit difficult for the little ones. <br /> <br /> A 8.8 / 10 of ... <br /> The Devil :.
