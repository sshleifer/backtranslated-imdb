I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> In real life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star as Charles and Emma Darwin in the midst of their struggle through the writing and decision to publish "Origin of Species." His consideration of the ramifications he may have for his family and the future of mankind is conveyed in such a way that it is suspected that only a couple off screen could achieve. Jon Amiel (who gave a heart-felt introduction) and John Collee and excellent job of bringing Randal Keynes's biography to life. They created some very poignant and human moments, great cinematography and scenarios, and a generous helping of irony about the still divisive theory of evolution. <br /> <br /> The surprise star is Martha West, who plays Annie Darwin, the character around which much of the story unfolds. She plays the precocious young woman on a tee. If this performance is something to go by your star should be on the rise. <br /> <br /> All in all a great movie, and although it is a period drama the problems that drive it are still very much alive today.
