First, make it clear that I got into this movie not for the song; in fact I find it disgusting. Actually, I was interested in the psychology of punk subculture. At that point, the documentary did reasonably well. One unpleasant aspect was the numerous scenes in which the songs are played and the sensational band and the belligerent crowd are shown wildly. If you saw the first scene, you saw them all. This superfluity is made up of print lyrics of some of the songs. With these, the audience is able to connect mentally with the band. The lyrics are of much more interest than the confusion of sounds that protrude from the speakers. I do not know why all the letters did not print. Scenes without slow lyrics (ironic eh?, Given the many references to the speed of music) the flow of the film. Interviews with fans and bands were also insightful, although there is a disappointment when the interviews of the last band prove not to be as captivating or humorous as the first two. Overall, a good movie that I'm glad I saw. I'll check the follow-ups if I have a chance. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote: He tried to hide the fact that he could not play by rubbing peanut butter on himself and breaking the glass. Generalized broadness of punk: Despite its shame, lack of vocabulary and hygiene and oblivion induced by drugs is often hilarious, in the end it is understood that punks are just pathetic young people who rebel only by cause of rebellion seen through letters and na√Øve attempts to philosophize and politicize (disregarding the Black Flag, which are a little less misleading than their peers).
