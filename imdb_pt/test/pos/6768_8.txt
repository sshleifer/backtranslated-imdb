of Adam's apple and with his permission. I did not even know until now. Also the errrrrrmmmmm 'Wilbur wants to kill himself' I prefer this very concentrated drama ... about the comic buzz of Adam's Apple. But with his permission it's much more layered and subtle, but that's another director. <br /> <br /> Once the 'fleshy' part of the story occurs, I felt the dread of going back to the store again and again. A bit claustrophobic .. maybe this is intentional. It is based on the atmosphere. You fear the rediscovery and again and again until the 'kick in the shin'. <br /> <br /> that's a funny thing.
