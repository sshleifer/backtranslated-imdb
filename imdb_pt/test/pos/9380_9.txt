Never had the words "hidden gem" been so accurate. Lovers of bad movies can search for all the next hidden darkness, sometimes coming up with things like Weasels rip my flesh, but other times, luck will prevail and you can end up with something like Death Bed, so hopefully realize that it's not a bad movie in all, it only has a bad title, and not even a bad title but a good-humored title that can wipe you out, but somehow Death Bed still fits in the "bad" category. With a vibe that is somber and empty, the Death Bed is a true low budget horror masterpiece, reserved only for those who are fortunate enough to enjoy such a dark shadow of a vision. The bed of death involves an incoherent, yet intriguing relationship between a demon in bed and the sympathetic ghost trapped in the portrait, who only wishes he could save someone from the terrible fate of being devoured by the yellow foam. Although not so scary, considering it's about a killer bed, the Death Bed possesses the qualities that contribute to the success of terror. A dark and desolate vibration, confusion, a mysterious and subtle path and that quality of dream that this masterpiece almost boasts. This quality or vibration usually seems unintended. Not only is it intentional, but from what I read, Death Bed is based on a real dream, George Barry, the director, successfully transferred the dream to the film, only a genius could accomplish such a task. <br /> <br /> Ancient mansions make for good quality horror, as do portraits, do not know what to do with the murderous yellow liquid murderer, a rather bizarre dream indeed. Also, this is not exactly the B-horror brand I was hoping for considering the title and all. Before seeing this gem of a Gothic, I expected something more like the Class Reunion Massacre, now that it's a bad movie, if you've seen it, you know what I'm saying. After considering all of the above, I feel that the Death Bed deserves only eight stars, but since it has been so obscure for so long, let's say that the bed you eat deserves nine.
