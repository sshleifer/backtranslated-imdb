I do not know what Dick Steel was talking about, but I found this film to be one of the most exciting epics in Japan to this day. As for Armageddon or Deep Impact, or to the subject The day after tomorrow is pale in comparison. From what I know of the movies, most of the catastrophes in the movies are basically performed by the asteroid films from the plant or one of them from Global Warming. This, as always, took a different course. A course of natural means where the earth's crust is beginning to erode to such a point that it will take another piece of land for the ride. What the scientific teams had to do was to create a way to prevent the erosion of going far and sinking Japan completely. In most cases, this would simply be called a tectonic shift on steroids. I found the characters quite attractive in every way, from the child who lost his mother just to face his own death among unknown friends. Or the rescue girl who does everything she can to save lives in the face of disaster. Or a man who thought he could change his mind to not be such a daring demon and go with him to safety, only to become his own hero and save his homeland. And let's not forget, as the rest of the world just threw them back to be forgotten, making the world turn its back on the Japanese citizens who clamored for help. This was a great movie in every way. What Dick is trying to say is that this movie was not made in Hollywood, it was made in Japan, it had characters that rival other actors around the world, which effects are very beautiful as he mentioned, but that's all he was waiting, and nothing more. He does not have the vision of what is important to everyone and why this film had all the elements of feeling, greatness and humanity. I thought this movie was high quality, and I saw a lot of disaster movies to know that Japan Sinks was possibly one of the most original and well thought out projects I've seen. I really hope Shinji Higuchi makes another one of those movies. Oh, and by the way, I'm not Japanese, although in many ways I'd like to be. I am Canadian, born and raised. And an avid fan of movies in every respect. Prejudice views are bitter and are not worth the effort to be recognized as an opinion. Dick should watch you with a more open heart and mind, not just look for eye candy that makes the content of a movie, look for what is most important and understand. They may not be American, but the Japanese have been cornering the market lately for some of the most impressive and even for making movies. That's why spending 25,000,000 is exactly what the doctor prescribed. You heard right, 25,000,000 to make this movie. Now you tell me, was it worth it? or was it worth it because American actors were not there?
