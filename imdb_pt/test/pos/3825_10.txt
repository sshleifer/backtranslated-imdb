What can I say about the series called NEW EXTERNAL LIMITS ... Hmm ... Only this was one of the best TV series ever assembled !! You have actors of all ages, actors that are a little known and that time has forgotten. Everyone doing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some kind of moral history for them that most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You may feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and at the beginning and end believes what he is saying with all his heart! Not only do these shows have great story lines, they also throw you inside them, make your mind run and your blood pumps. The original outside boundaries were a black and white in the 60s, These shows made a triumphant return of things I've never seen! The new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker was fun to watch, but the new EXTERNAL LIMITS are where you are! If you have not seen it yet: I beg you to check these episodes, and you'll see exactly what I mean! LONG LIFE THE NEW EXTERIOR LIMITS !!!!!!!!!!!!
