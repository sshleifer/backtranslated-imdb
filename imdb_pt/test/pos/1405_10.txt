An impetuous and egocentric army cadet arrives at WEST POINT with a dangerous attitude from a wise guy to the Corps of Engineers. <br /> <br /> In an obviously tailor-made role for him, William Haines shines in this highly pleasing tale of honor. & friendship. A class A thief, Haines during the first half of the movie is up to the usual behavior of Silly Billy, who under normal circumstances should have confined him to the guardhouse. The latter half, however, becomes very serious, leading to Haines' moral redemption and giving him a good opportunity to expose his acting talents. If WEST POINT does not reach the caliber of the previous TELL IT TO THE MARINES (1926), this is undoubtedly due to the absence here of a costar of the charisma and quality of Lon Chaney for Haines to interact. However, this tribute to the army is a very effective entertainment and should be enjoyed on its own merits. <br /> Joan Crawford appears as Haines' love interest, playing the virginal daughter of the local innkeeper. Joan is cheeky and beautiful and especially shines in her early scenes when she meets Haines on a Hudson River raft and is subjected to her usual immature antics. Haines & Crawford made five silent feature films together and were tremendous friends for life. He was the much bigger celebrity in this period and gave him many tips to make progress in Hollywood. A superstar in the early 1930s, she returned after leaving MGM in 1932, encouraging her career shift to interior decorating. <br /> <br /> Little William Bakewell is effectively cast as a Plebe who idolizes Haines; their relationship is actually more sentimental than that of Haines & Crawford. <br /> <br /> The film was made with the full cooperation of the War Department. Extensive location footage at the Academy helps tremendously with the production environment, which has garnered magnificent production values ​​from MGM. <br /> <br /> The WEST POINT has recently been restored and has received an exciting new score from David Davidson.
