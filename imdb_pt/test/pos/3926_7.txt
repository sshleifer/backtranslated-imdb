** 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Michael Murray Chad, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. <br /> <br /> Yet another classic horror movie was remade with a jumbled teenager, despite the grizzly and creative deaths. Based on Vincent Price's 1953 film House of Wax, where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into invaluable wax figures. Still with the fantastic setting to turn the entire house into wax, the film is a typical classic horror remake such as Tobe Hooper's classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre of 1974, despite being creative and so active that the film was still just a scene bloody Director Serra showed a slight enthusiasm with his direction, but still worth watching. My final rating 7/10.
