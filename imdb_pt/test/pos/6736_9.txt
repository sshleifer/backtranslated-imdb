Blythe Danner and Judith Ivey present wonderful performances here as Jonathan Silverman, as Eugene, recounts his life in 1937 in Brighton Beach. <br /> <br /> What makes the movie so good is the relationship between the characters with an extremely wonderful backdrop. family values. <br /> <br /> Bob Dishy had a wonderful opportunity here as the clan's father. He gives a contained but convincing performance as the patriarch of the family. <br /> <br /> His sons played by Jonathan Silverman and Brian Dillinger are fabulous. There are certain scenes when Silverman is skating or jumping where I remember Jerry Lewis. <br /> <br /> As for Danner and Ivey, they are also wonderful. Their mannerisms, intonation and idealism of Jewish culture are beautifully realized by them. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply marvelous. Beautiful Brighton in 1937! Even with the inevitability of war, the film is rich in many of the typical problems faced by families in that period. In a sense, you do not have to be Jewish to experience what the family is going through. <br /> <br /> A must stop for nostalgic enthusiasts and those of us who believe so strongly in family values.
