This is one of those movies that looks so "dated" that being so is part of the fun. You see and hear things you would never see or hear on the silver screen today. Some of these things are good; some are too cheesy for words, some are bad (depending on your views on certain cultural issues). <br /> <br /> For example, in this short (68 minutes) movie of 1931 you have: <br /> <The grandfather of the family who appears in this story extolling the value of patriotism and why should anyone speak against the criminals for the sake of the United States (imagine this in the movies today!) <br /> <br /> A public prosecutor (Walter Huston) almost begging for death sentences and the population shown as supporting him 100 percent once, imagine this in modern movies). <br /> <br /> On the way you have some shocking. the violence, as a boy being caught a few times and literally thrown headfirst into a closet, and his father being caught and swayed repeatedly from head to toe. This is a difficult thing to say the least. <br /> <br /> However, the film is full of comedy, especially by the memorable grandfather patriot played by Charles "Chic" Sales. There are a lot of laughs for all those who see this one crime movie. And for gentle touches, there are the two boys, one of whom - Dickie Moore - became a very famous child actor in his day. Here he is just a little tyrant of about 5 years of age who is understandably far from being a polite actor but you can see stardom for him on the horizon. In fact, he did just that the following year with solid performance on "Blonde Venus" starring Marlene Dietrich. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a fun movie because of an effective mix of violence, comedy and sentimentality. .... and has a good end to wellness and a thought-provoking message. It was also for an Oscar for "Best Writing, Original Story". I am sorry to say that it is only available for viewing on cable TV since it has never been put on VHS or DVD ..... and this is a shame.
