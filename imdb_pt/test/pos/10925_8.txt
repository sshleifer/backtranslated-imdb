I just saw this movie and it made me cry. It's a beautiful drama about two brothers falling in love, and I think it's a good idea, especially for the closed-minded, to watch that one. I've come to love the short-film genre after just having seen a couple because they have to impress you so fast, and I have to say that this definitely sat their mark. He described some things, that I never really thought about it, incest by one. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I did not care much about the ending. Only once would I like to watch a gay-themed movie without wanting to kill me after the wings. They almost always seem to end in tragedy. It was 'cute,' though, how they had to be together, even if it was in death. <br /> <br /> I gave eight stars, and I recommend it to everyone as well, because I think it gives a 'look inside' the world, that this movie makes you enter. <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening, have fun.
