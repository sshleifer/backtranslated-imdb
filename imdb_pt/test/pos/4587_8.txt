You can read all kinds of references in the world of idiocracy. A futuristic world populated by spoiled and self-indulgent idiots fueled by the technology of a bygone era: this idea has its precedent in HG Wells's "The Time Machine" and Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" among other satires. At the beginning of the film, a narrator explains the rapid degradation of mankind over five hundred years, but does not fill the gaps from where all futuristic technology came in the meanwhile. Most of the criticism of this entertaining (and funny) movie seems to surround this omission and the resulting complaint that the world is not "realistic." As if "realism" had been a necessary quality of satire. Is "Brazil" realistic? How about "Futurama" or "Transmetropolitan"? Hell, how about "Gulliver's Travels"? I thought not. "Idiocracy," though perhaps not as pointy as the best of its kind, reaches the same grades and usually does so successfully. <br /> <br /> In addition, I do not find futuristic technology a problem. It's very easy to find out that Mike Judge is satirizing the current trend of automation and simple product interfaces so that even total idiots can use them. As in "Brave New World," the society in the film seems to have reached a point of automated self-sufficiency at some point in the past (apparently created by the now extinct "smart people" to placate an increasingly stupid population). ), leaving the rest of humanity free to satisfy all the worst, selfish impulses they can invent and become even more stupid. The film takes place during the last breath of humanity, when everything begins to fall apart forever. It may still be "unreal," but if so, it is a kind of remarkably well presented unrealism. <br /> <br /> Stupid people take up most of the time on the screen, of course, but they are just victims - they know nothing better. Mike Judge saves his royal hatred for the intelligent people in power who are dead by the time the movie starts, but who are very much alive now, in the 21st century. People like scientists who pursue "hair growth and prolonged erections" without no other reason than the possibility of profiting from their snake oil treatments. People like politicians who let companies simply buy the FDA and the FCC. People like media executives and their yuppie patetotes who promote stupidity - they allow the destruction of all culture, morality and health to make quick money. <br /> <br /> After all, who is really guilty, the Morlocks or the eloi? The Paris Hiltons of the world, or the brilliant executives and advertisers who put it on TV and lowered our cultural standards enough to leave it there? This is all implicit in "idiocracy," however. A phrase here, a hint there (witness the hilarious self-doctor who literally does all the work in the health system). It is one of the few aspects of the film that is NOT pounded on the ground by the unnecessary narrator. It's there just for the viewer to catch, or not, but it's one of the most interesting themes in a movie that's a lot smarter than any other comedy of the year. <br /> Too bad that so many people leave the movie thinking that it is just an excuse to show the farting fart farts and people getting stricken in the groin. Not that this is not funny either, and maybe it's a little interesting. But in "Idiocracy," it's not as simple as it sounds.
