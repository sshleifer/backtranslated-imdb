15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being a address of New York and the film being mounted in Kolkata. However, as the story unfolds, one realizes the tenuous line that the director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and, of course, the world of Schizophrenia. I would say that Aparna Sen is a director who has much more to say and has less time on hand. Well, no doubt she managed to make a good movie. In a way, it makes us realize that probably each of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue '. It's an endless quest within each of us ... <br /> <br /> Shabana Azmi's power performance is a treat to watch. His presence on the screen brings a lot of life to the scene. In fact, it was amazing to see her in such a powerful act after a long time, because I expected it to be all the way from Konkona Sen's land. Shabana makes you feel the skin deeply of a big sister who is directing the entire show to an unhappy family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life. She overcharges all her ambitions and desires with a younger sister of 18 (who is more like a daughter to her) and an elderly mother played by veteran Waheeda Rehman. As for Guide's leading actress (that's how I can instantly remember her), there's almost nothing to say but a few lines and tear drops here and there. Always dependable Rahul Bose plays another key role in the film, it shows the emotions of a middle-aged man with regret in his face to near perfection. This man really surprises me with the variety of work he has done. From a musician in Jhankar Beats to a liberal Muslim in Mr. & Mrs. Iyer and so many others ?? He is a versatile one that I really would like him to do some more photos in the first part of the movie as well. The cameo of the film is by Shefali Shah (remember Satya and Monsoon Wedding). She looks very pretty and portrays the role of a mother of 2 children very easily. It gives you a glimpse of the Indian woman of today who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to previous husband relationships. <br /> <br /> The focus of the camera has been the Meethi, played by Konkona. She and her schizophrenic world make up the nucleus of 15 Park Avenue. She really worked hard for the character, but there are times when she is not able to relate to the audience. The fateful accident of his life tries to please and was only partially successful. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to address a few things at once, starting from the unique world of a disabled person to a woman's unequal status, even in today's modern India, as well as distorted relationships in one family tattered. . And I believe that Aparna has succeeded to some extent. Meethi's helplessness while she works as a journalist in an eastern rural state really gives us a bare image of the country we are so proud of. Well, after I finished at 15 Park Avenue, there was a feeling of unshakable thirst inside me. I wanted more from this movie to emotionally excite me. It was a commendable effort on the part of the director, except for a few hiccups. Must pay attention to all those who like to see a different cinema, something with a strong purpose.
