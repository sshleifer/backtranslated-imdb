Although not as good as An Assassination is Announced, it was not only delicious but almost surpassed the book, this is an excellent adaptation. And you know, it's a big improvement on Geraldine McEwan's version. Now I'm not proud to speak ill of Geraldine McEwan's adaptations, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started well, but ruined by a bad script, a confused end solution, or both. Geraldine McEwan's version suffered with a slow pace, and both of the above problems, and I would consider ITV's second worst of adaptations, with Sittaford Mystery worse, which even on its own merits became monotonous and confusing. This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a great improvement, not only respects the book, despite some freedoms, but virtually fixes the problems of the ITV version. Although Lionel's additional character seems rather annoying, more related to the way he was written than to the way he was portrayed and to one or two slow-paced moments, this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book. It is beautifully filmed, with good photography and period details, and the music as always is excellent. The performances are wonderful this time around, and make the most of a well-done overall script, with Joan Hickson brilliant as always, like Miss Marple, and the solid twists of Liz Fraser, Helen Cherry, Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack is exceptional, albeit in a chilling and moving performance as Clothilde. Overall, worth seeing, better than the recent version in virtually every department. 9/10 Bethany Cox
