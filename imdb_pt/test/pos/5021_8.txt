Wow, I think the overall average rating of this movie on this site is incredibly low. There's really no reason not to like this movie. "Michael" is a simple romantic comedy, but quite unique and easily entertaining. The plot involves a group of reporters / experts who will examine the mysterious appearance of an angel (John Travolta) in the midwest. The angel proves to be less holy and more mundane than you'd expect, and that's what makes it fun. His interest in women and the Beatles gives a new twist on the angel thing. The romantic side of this film involves Michael, the angel, trying to unite Andie MacDowell and William Hurt. The two may not have the best chemistry ever on the screen, but they certainly have enough to make it work well. Everyone who rated this movie so low (5.4 ??), come on! The movie is not so bad. In fact, I found it very funny and memorable. Of course, it's not the best thing you'll see, but it's still good. This is a movie that I feel was notably underrated. It's fun, romantic and recommended by me. out of ****
