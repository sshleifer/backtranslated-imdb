Awww, I love it! The tale of the cat and the moon does not really need a synopsis, as it is what it is ... the cat chasing the moon, for a Spanish poem. It's the art that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called Fan and the Flower, which won the Oscar last year (2005) ... yes, almost the same thing, which leads me to believe that it may just be a rip off. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> But this is really a good summary, with black and white shapes moving and moving into a beautiful movement and poetic seduction ... If you believe that cats are moving poetry, see this and you will believe it more. <br /> <br /> In addition, it has such a moving ending. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
