I felt compelled to comment on this movie because it is listed as the fourth all-time lowest-rated science fiction movie on IMDb. WHAT!?!? Of course, this movie is bad, but it is HILARIOUS! It's not horrible at Ed Wood's level, it's more surreal and uneven. <br /> <br /> There are some classic moments in the movie. Brain surgery is gross and great - and even crazier - when you consider that the film was rated PG! Gor running behind his doll before putting the battery acid on his face - "Dude! Gimmee!" Zandor Vorkoff's speeches at the beginning of the film - "Before Amir, Kali was just another weak nation struggling to break free of centuries of stagnant feudalism!" Angelo Rossito also has great lines - "No, Gor! No!" "You want these keys, do not you, my dear?" It's absolutely wrong that this is the fourth lowest-rated sci-fi movie in IMDb, because it's FUN. No matter how bad a movie is, if it can still be weird, quirky, disturbing or entertaining, it has merit and does not deserve to be discarded. I will not defend most of the films of Al Adamson, but this, along with Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR, are fun enough to make up for their horror.
