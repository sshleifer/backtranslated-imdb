I saw this interesting back-to-back movie with the Chinese / French film "2046" at the recent Dubai Film Festival. Both were intelligent jobs performed in the same year (2004/2005). Both had the main characters living in a "hotel". In both films, the hotel is more a metaphor of exile than a local. Both dealt with love between a man and a woman. Both had wonderful music and fascinating performances. What a coincidence and still how the two films differ in the treatment of the subject! Somewhere at the beginning of the movie, a man walking on a sidewalk turns to look at a woman and, in doing so, hits a light pole. The audience explodes in a volcano of laughter innocently. But this brief picture is not the synopsis of the movie, which entertains you for two hours? While the film is a wonderful blend of comedy (for example, using a stethoscope to hear the neighbor's conversation), the film is based on what Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati had introduced to the cinema earlier - stoic faces that lead to comedy in contrast to the equally intelligent world of Robin Williams or the thrilling Danny Kaye. A sudden frenzy of activity transforms an otherwise stoic character, while the transfer of money from the hotel to the bank is reminiscent of Tati's works. <br /> <br /> But the film is not mere comedy. The anti-automation statement (counting money and the reaction of bank staff to statements related to it, the dummy that acts as an ineffective warning to the speeding lady, the reference to "Moulimix" as the fictitious "company" for which he works). , etc.) are several leads that the director is offering a loaded comedy to the viewer. Laugh, yes, but think about it and enjoy it even more. <br /> <br /> The strength of the film is in the short script and staccato (by director Paul Sorrentino) that offers a comedy that is mixed with philosophy ("The truth is boring" "Dad is dead but no one told him "" Bad luck does not exist - it's the invention of the losers and the poor. "Then the director continues to give him a fascinating lecture on the main character about You will not sleep in this lecture. the director offers a dessert as part of the excellent meal of great acting (Toni), who is the author of "The Truth Is Dull." Servillo), good music, intelligent camera (Luca Bigazzi), a beautiful and enigmatic actress (Magnani, granddaughter of the great Anna) and powerful script. The dessert is for the viewer to find out if what preceded in the movie was the truth. boring, I've been, have not I?
