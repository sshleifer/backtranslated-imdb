I thought this movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. The character of Yasmine Bleeth plays a woman who fell in love with the character of Richard Greico. They end up getting married and everything looks perfect, except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however, she has a hard time conceiving. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy and will take extreme steps to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and that makes you guess. It shows how naive it can be when they fall in love. Yasmine Bleeth is a good actress, and I wonder why she has never advanced in her career. Richard Greico is very impressive as the cheating husband, and plays very well part of the evil. I wonder why certain actors do this and some do not. All and all a great movie that I would recommend.
