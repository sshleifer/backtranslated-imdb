An intense and sombre action drama with an extraordinarily rich support of Casey, Keith, et. al, many of whom get the best roles from their careers and run with it. The film is strangely shaped - often the action slows only to let the characters get caught up in seemingly improved but well-done dialogues - during the parades, almost the entire "Machine" is caught up in perfectly delivered humorous monologues. - and Reynolds, the director, deserves a lot of credit for having Reynolds, the star, back out and make room for them. And unlike most action movies, you really like the characters, which makes the second half, when your various destinies unfold, affect in an unusual way. The combination of character development, brutal violence, a jazz soundtrack (Tarantino must be a fan - watch this and then "Jackie Brown" and you'll see what I'm talking about) make this movie occasionally flawed (The bad guys are a bit melodramatic ) one of the best modern police movies, and in my mind superior to many of the modern overrated noirs, such as "Body Heat" and such.
