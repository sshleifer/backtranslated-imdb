The best screen performance ever made by George C. Scott. Chayefsky's script, the dialogue laden with irony, is almost perfect ("Where do you train your nurses, Dachau?"). Rigg is wonderful as the rescuer angel who rescues Scott from doom as well as the entire cast. It's a hilarious and serious movie. It's a period film, the 1960s, but it's by no means dated. What it is about, the chaos and irrationality of the system versus the sanity of the individual, are timeless. And the monologue "We Cure Nothing." (Delivered, Screamed in Truth as No One Else Could) with their references to cloning and other "wonders" of modern science could literally have been written this morning. <Br/> <br />
