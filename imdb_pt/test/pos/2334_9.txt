I'm glad they finally released it on DVD. I bought the video tape years ago and watched it at least once or twice a year. <br /> <br /> Grammer has an ironic wit about him that really makes this movie a success. Its formula is certainly not original, but it's very funny anyway. I am very surprised that he has not received further evaluations. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite comedies of all time. It's just a little fun movie that makes you feel good. And sometimes, that's all a movie should be.
