This movie is the one you fall in love with. Alfred Hitchcock will always remain above any director of his time. The most influential aspects about his films are sheer simplicity and thrilling drama. The other best thing about Hitchcock's films is a Definite & Gripping End. Anything you say about "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is less. Cinematography, acting, dialogue and camera work are magnificent in this film. The song "Que Sera Sera" in the end should remain in our memories for life. The film is so enjoyable from beginning to end that we never know when it ends. Rarely would Hitchcock include humor in his films, this movie has comedic scenes that fit the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely brilliant and as good as the Vertigo.
