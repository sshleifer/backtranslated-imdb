This movie was billed as a comedy, but it was far more serious than the trailers were. Do not get me wrong, I liked the movie, but I was expecting more laughter. Great performances by Robin Williams and Laura Linney. Worth seeing, but do not expect to be rolling on the floor. The movie left me wondering what it would be like if the character Robin Williams were a real person running for president. Would we elect a comedian? I doubt it, unfortunately. This kind of honesty is something missing today. This is a movie I will add to my DVD library as soon as it is released on DVD. The movie has a heart.
