To solve a challenging problem, you need to start by asking the right questions. Without this, even the largest library of information is useless. This film does just that - where other films guide your thinking along a story board, this film pulls your emotions and your understanding of justice and what is allowed. These questions will attack you everywhere, defying your assumptions as the characters develop. This movie is important. It is relevant and must-see for anyone who is knowledgeable about current affairs. The fact that it is so much fun and including a huge amount of movie stars only improves execution. My advice: watch it with a serious crowd or, better yet, for yourself, not unlike how you read an editorial from your favorite news magazine. In this case, there is a difference: the answers will be yours.
