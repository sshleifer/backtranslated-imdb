I was very impressed with this production probably on all levels; from production to plot and character development. <br /> This definitely fits into the "realism" genre, since there is nothing going on here that makes use of the creative imagination, twists, or manipulates the audience into how a viewer feels, thinks, and swear. <br /> <br /> The actors are great, especially the "little ones". the chemistry between brother and sister is mind-boggling, maybe not as common as it should be in real life. It's a great movie to watch literally when viewing it. You know when a movie is good when you do not want it to end, but eventually everything you do ...
