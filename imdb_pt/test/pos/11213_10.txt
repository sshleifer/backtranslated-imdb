People should learn to observe what is there on the screen. This is a great film that is based on a slow and careful collection of details that serve to establish the personalities of these two men. The passivity of Yusuf (Emin Toprak), the cousin of the country, is well described by his fear of talking with women. He has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman and loses all of them. He has many decades of unmarried before him, and maybe unemployment as well. <br /> <br /> Mahmut is a different case. He left the small town working very hard (we imagine), and his resentment with the lazy like Yusuf is palpable (he leaves crumbs on the expensive carpet - the idiot!). We are shown a group of friends talking about Tarkovsky among other things, and we note that Mahmut feels regret - but only a little regret - that his work has become commercial over the years. The gulf between cousins ​​grows ever wider. The mousetrap theme is wonderfully vivid, it brings out Yusuf's compassion and confusion and Mahmut's cold-blooded solving of problems. <br /> <br /> I remembered two classic movies of crazy men: Cousins ​​of Chabrol cousins ​​(the rich kid with Hitler pretensions played by Brialy is always on my mind) and Spider-Man Kiss (William Hurt Can not understand why everyone is so mean). Nuri Bilge Ceylan occupies his place among the twelve important directors currently active. I just hope that in the future he will rely on collaborators instead of directing, writing and filming his films.
