I was attracted to "Friends" by the soundtrack of a young and still famous Elton John, whom I had seen in a club near Houston. I had no idea of ​​the emotions and the impact that the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie for a song that Heart called "Seasons", so I found the music of Elton John "Friends" thinking it was the same song ... 35 years ago. Anyway, the flood of emotions from "Friends" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first true love. I have more recollection of the way the movie hit me than the actual production details, plot, etc., so excuse me for a rather poor review. I remember taking some special friends on a date to watch the movie and they were as excited and with tears in their eyes as I was. I am anxious and nervous to find a copy and see now. So many movies that seemed so important to me back then (for example, "The Graduate" "Easy Rider") now look silly and I do not want it to fall into the same category. But, I'll find it and if it's silly, then at least I'll be able to turn my wife into a great ... no ... great soundtrack. When we first met, we went through it with "Last Tango in Paris". The young people I work with (56 years old) respect my opinions, but it's hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the films and songs that reflect such strong feelings, but they seem a little "aged" now. I just can not figure out if the aging process is the movie ... or me. "Friends" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful film. This will bring back many special feelings, I'm sure. By all means, rent or buy a copy ... Indies were not close to the strong genre, so they are today.
