Do you ever miss the good old days when Disney really made great movies that really changed you? Growing up with Disney I've always found myself captivated by the characters. Each of them looked truly talented and knew how to act in a movie. I remember Friday nights and ran to turn on the TV just to watch their latest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I've never forgotten this movie. To this day, when we mention the song "Susie Q", I always remember the movie. If someone is thinking of watching this movie I promise you, you will fall in love with it. I do not think I'll ever be able to forget it. You will not regret watching it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it's sad to see Disney movies like "The Hannah Montana Movie" being released. What happened to Disney?
