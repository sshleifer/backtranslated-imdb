There is not much to the story. A young woman steals money from the shady Vermont supermarket where she works, decides to flee to Florida, where she dreams of attending school with her friend Julie and finds a strange couple on the road. If you remember the "Rosemary's Baby" senior couple, you have some idea of ​​how these two are. Bill has a comic face and is retired from the Army. Sandra is a former stripper now became a truck whore, although we did not find that out right away. They are affectionate, helpful and full of good judgment. <br /> <br /> They more or less adopt the girl, Alice, and promise to hitch a ride on their elaborate RV, even though they are not driving "straight". "to Florida. <br /> <br /> Here is where the movie could be one hundred percent wrong.All filmmakers had to do was turn the old couple into the embodiment of evil.Â They would get the virginal Alice (handcuffed to bed or anything else) and would sell her body to any grease driver who had a lot of money and enjoyed violent sex. (Alice would have escaped a whole day, with many aborted attempts, before the final shootout.) But no, the couple is really Alice is not a virgin, she hears Sandra with a client, asks about the business and tries to cheat on her own, Bill prevents anything from happening and insists that she do the right job, if at all. <br /> <br /> Alice makes several hundred dollars, which represents several hundred dollars more than when she met the couple. <br /> <br /> Bill and Sandra keep their money in the safe, where customers will not find Alice does not play well. She does not find prostitution a very pleasant job, and she thinks she will never be paid because every time she asks to be left, Sandra replies, "What, not here, dear, not in the middle of nowhere." However, after she is convinced to surrender her gun to Sandra, the couple gives her the money she wants and prefers to free her to continue her trip to Florida. <br /> <br /> You know what I found most tragic. moment in the movie? It had nothing to do with prostitution or robbery. Alice was waiting for a room with her friend Julie after she arrived in Miami. Julie is a legitimate student after all. But when Alice calls her friend from somewhere in Alabama to make sure she's on her way, but she's going to be late, Julie hesitates and says, "Well, my mom does not think you should go and live with us. Roommate is not cool, either, I invited you down, of course, but I thought it was a visit for a week or something. "Go back to Milford, Alice." There's a long silence before Alice hangs up. <br /> Only one shot is shot (some white film frames) and no one is hit. Tears appear only once. No one hits anyone else. No car explodes in a fireball. No police officer chases them down the Interstate. <br /> <br /> The steering is occasionally awkward. Very cross cut between Sandra trying to disarm the hand of Alice and Alice holding the pistol swinging. There is virtually no musical score. There is a brief male and female nudity and it is awkward, as it probably should be. Alice is not attractive at all, but she's not bizarre either. She has Asian eyes, a sort of sturdy version of Molly Parker. Cinematography seems cheap and the colors are washed. The direction is a direct narrative, with some flashbacks illuminated. Nothing is wasted. And it was all evidently filmed around Danbury, Connecticut. The city is in my mind because I went through it after one of its floods and I remember the cars covered with a layer of mud to the door knobs. <br /> <br /> I do not know exactly what Alice found. (I even fear THINK that the answer to the riddle is that "she met".) The acting is not bad. Judith Ivey is better than that. It's definitely worth seeing, a quiet and organized movie that treats the audience as adults.
