Snap, crackle, pop! The shrill sound of every change in the angle of the camera. And not to mention the white flashes and the cut ends in almost every spoken phrase. What the hell were they doing in the editing room? Or was this approach intentional? Certainly not. What purpose could it serve? Despite all his technical shortcomings, this is an interesting film that describes a day in the life of Joe, a drug dealer determined to earn $ 200 for his wife's pregnant girlfriend. Joe Dallesandro is highlighted as the relaxed, passive and relaxed young man who is willing to let the other person speak to the maximum while listening with a distant look. <br /> <br /> History is sparse and incomplete, documenting the uncertain life led by a man who relies on casual street sex to support his young wife and baby. One thing for sure, Joe is uninhibited when it comes to undressing for sex or posing for an artist. It is understandable that yes, because it has a beautiful face and an equally beautiful body. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the movie that is remarkably effective. There is no sound or dialogue. Joe completely naked is squatting on the floor feeding crumbs of cake to his little baby. There is a beautiful serenity and tenderness captured in these moments of tranquility. Another entertaining interest scene is one in which Joe desperately seeks a $ 100 loan from a friend of the gym, even going so far as to ask a very tortuous approach. <br /> <br /> Joe tries to appear interested but hesitates in his conversation when an artist gives him an uninterrupted retouch of Greek and Roman art. It is a preliminary to another occasion when Joe strips off his clothes and presents himself as the discus thrower in true classic style. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, we get the impression that we have to get to know Joe well. After all, he discovered more than his soul.
