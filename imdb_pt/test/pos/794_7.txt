This Metro movie is episodic, but almost a constant series of chases, mostly trying to escape the police, whether real or imagined, as Buster is mistaken for a criminal who escaped. It is consistently inventive and fun. Its greatest value lies in documenting what Hollywood was like in the early 1920s, with 95% of it filmed outside the streets and exteriors of buildings at the time. A gem moment and a gem sequence are present here. <br /> <br /> The big moment is when a train at a great distance quickly approaches the camera and finally stops right behind it - with Buster sitting badly in the bucket and going from a long plane to a close up in few seconds. <br /> <br /> The great sequence is with the telephone booth next to the elevator - one being constantly confused with the other with floor-to-floor races - one of Keaton's big jokes. <br /> <br /> Kino's impression is clear and clear - almost immaculate. There is a violin / piano sheet music accompaniment. This is one to look for and enjoy.
