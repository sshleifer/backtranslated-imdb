After watching this movie, say, about 8 times, the storyline never bores me. Each character has their own distinctive personality and their own visions of "love." This movie has timeless, almost lifelike love lessons. Filled with philosophies about love, a jazz soundtrack and great actors that's why I would call it classic.
