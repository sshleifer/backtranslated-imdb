This movie is incredibly free to tell stories. It is a pure experience, where music obfuscates the visual impression. - Words can not, of course, express what is to be expressed, but it is the demand of the chattering classes that the conversations are presented, inserted in the production lines of mediocrity and, therefore, a necessity to express any sensible thought or opinion on something that should not need to be degraded by chatter. So these elaborate opinions are presented to satisfy those empty minds that need to be filled by noises you will not find no matter how hard you try in this movie.
