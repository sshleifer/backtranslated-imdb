A very weird, psychedelic, esoteric experience (and did I say weird?). <br /> <br /> But at least on one level - she did exactly what she should do. He bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, and Hollywood pop teen idol visuals that was the Monkees TV show and the adult, musically growing and evolving, yet still a bit ridiculous of the Monkees of the '70s and beyond. The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith's: "If they think we're plastic now, wait until they see how we do it." That the Monkees were tired of all the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of record. They've said it over and over in interviews. They needed to be reworked, and what better way to vent and ridiculously ridicule the very machine that created them. And at the same time, they commented on our whole society (news, movies, art, everything) and said, "Hey, why do we like it - it's not all that stuff made at one point or another." These are the Orwellian "proles" (the Monkees represented the persecuted "common man", even the foolish ones in the TV series), pulling Big Brother's pants and kicking him into his deserved butt. <br /> <br /> ideas, I loved the music, I loved the effects, I loved the movie! But then, as Peter Tork says in the film, "But then, why should I talk, since I do not know anything?" :)
