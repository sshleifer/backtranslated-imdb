All I can say is that I really miss this show !! My wife and I just got married by the time this show started !! Why did CBS take off the air ??? I think it was the best show for the whole family to enjoy !! That made me laugh !! It also made me cry. But when CBS took my wife out of the air and I thought CBS made a big mistake. Do you know what would be so good? Have a meeting show !! That would be so cool !!!! Does anyone know if it's on DVD yet? Last season's Promised Land, did CBS show all last season? I think CBS took off the air in the middle of the season. My wife and I will never forget this. The opening with this theme song was fantastic !!! This show only comes once in a lifetime! May we never forget the Promised Land !!
