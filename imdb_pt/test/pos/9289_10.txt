His satire is a steady success on the Australian radio commission (ABC). After a brief start as a satire newspaper, hunters' popularity skyrocketed when it received its own television program. Never short in controversy with the cast members will do everything a little of the same being stuck by. Chris Taylor goes to Sunrise, a very popular morning TV show and tells his partner to fuck off, create a fake car and enter the high security area of ​​APEC and make a very funny satire of an Australian nicotine ad following smokers around shouting "NO GARY NO NO GARY NO". Although controversial, the program is incredibly funny and worthy of being screened for years to come.
