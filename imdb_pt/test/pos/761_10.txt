I thought this movie was written intelligently and beautifully rendered. It is a film that far surpasses other films in terms of originality and pleasure. Rupert Grint played the role wonderfully, and has a general talent for acting business. The almost obsessive mother added a lot to the plot, and it was a character she could almost instantly hate. It reminded me, in a way, of the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Brotherhood. Not through actual movie content, but the premises and overall tone to the movie itself. "Driving Lessons" is a story of maturity, which many may find very easy to relate due to overwhelming mother, lack of freedom and self-discovery.
