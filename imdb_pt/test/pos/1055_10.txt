I came across this movie in the mid-eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite vacation and non-holiday movies. As you can tell from the other reviews, this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed up for it. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is great as the bride is having second thoughts. Dennis Morgan's performance is also strong. He goes unnoticed in most movies, but he was a very capable actor, check out KITTY FOYLE. In this film, he plays the visiting sailor who takes him away from her husband away from Stanwyck. <br /> <br /> This is a Christmas classic. Settings and story contribute to a great Christmas romance
