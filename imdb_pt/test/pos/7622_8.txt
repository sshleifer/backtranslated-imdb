This movie is good. It seems they used the Tyrannosaurus Rex as an exploded balloon, just like Godzilla, just maybe in those 60-70 days, scientist does not have enough information. on all types of dinosaurs. Back to that time scientist still making dinosaurs, so I think this movie was based on a Tyrannosaurus Rex movement in the 60s-70s. There is even a part where a giant rock, fired by someone on the Tyrannosaurus Rex, damages the Tyrannosaurus Rex and was knocked over for a while. In the end, the Tyrannosaurus Rex searched for food again. There is something wrong in the film too, like a rifle, as a rifle can kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex, when it could be 1,000 to 5,000 stronger than us. If this movie is going to make a remake, I suggest make it better and livelier, because watching an old movie seems to have a remake of it, if you're lucky.
