When I analyzed the video of a local magazine, I called it "the greatest achievement in the history of American cinema." This was not totally ironic. TW & TL remains Milius's best work, and it's sad that he has so little opportunity to work harder. However, TW & TL remains a striking exposition of what was once known as The American Character, largely due to Brian Keith's superb interpretation of Teddy R. (Obviously Milius - and Keith - admired TR tremendously for making two films about it's hard to blame this movie on any level: a splendid balance between action, levity, relationships, and the serious subject of maturing America in the world. In addition, the TW & TL has an exceptional appeal in all respects: note the statistics that show that it is best for under 18s, women 18-29 and over 45! Clearly, Candy Bergen gave a touch responsive to women and men.
