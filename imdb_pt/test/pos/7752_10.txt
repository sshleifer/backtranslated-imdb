I usually fall in love with anime because the more you watch, the more you realize that many shows are just poor copies of the few gems or remnants of old formulas. But every once in a while one of the real gems appears and its originality just pulls you away. Haruhi is truly one of those shows. Many anime series are originally manga and sometimes the translation for an animation program is poorly made and does not utilize the benefits that animation has on static drawings. Haruhi is actually based on a series of novels and light fires on all cylinders, beautiful animations, excellent dubbing, great music and a complete and well-paced story. See that you will not be disappointed, and I suggest seeing it in transmission order that works much better so.
