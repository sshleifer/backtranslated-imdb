In 1965, "My Name Is Barbra," and filmed in bright colors, "Color Me Barbra" features La Streisand alternating nostalgia, clown comedy, female romantic anguish, and seductive seriousness for a mad hour of show-biz collector razzle dazzle. She is a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and a puzzle. With her Egyptian make-up and constantly changing hairstyles, she is also a chameleon. His voice is rich and moving, even if some of his songs are not ("One Kiss", "Yesterdays"). The sequence of the circus is not as intriguing as the trip to the museum (with the concept of Barbra becoming the pictures in the paintings, an idea that works better than you think). The circus-medley (built around songs featuring the word "face"!) Is girllyly beautiful without ever really becoming enchanting. Still, this is a joyful and jazzy special - not as emotionally tempting as "My Name Is Barbra", but certainly an excellent sophomore work.
