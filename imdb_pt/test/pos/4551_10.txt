The 1995 commercial success of Peter Segal and now cult-classic 'Tommy Boy' is a hilarious film, a perennial artist. Chris Farley is a talent we will never forget !!! <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is a simple story told in the funniest and funniest way possible. Farley and Spade make a trip full of uncontrollable laughter, even the portion of Rob Lowe is very funny. As a kid, I remember watching 'Tommy Boy' again and again and again. It has been my childhood favorites, and it will always be to be. Even today, when it comes to TV, I cling to it as a stubborn fan. I'm pretty possessive of this movie. <br /> <br /> Segal's direction is super. Chris Farley may have died in 1997, but he's still alive for me at least. What an actor! Watch your work on 'Tommy Boy', he's very comfortable. He presented fantastic performances later in such films as 'Berverly Hills Ninja' and 'Almost Heroes', but his work here remains the best of all! I love you, Farley! Spade, on the other hand, is as good as ever. He is an excellent actor in every way! <br /> <br /> Rules of 'Tommy Boy' .... 100 thumbs up of this writer!
