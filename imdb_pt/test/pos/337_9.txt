I finally got a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent the eve of New Yera watching an incredible drama unfold. It began with Shyama (a Nandita Das), who married Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over the novel. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp when she gives birth to a child. Several years later, we see Amudha, a playful beloved child (Fr. S. Keerthana), who is the darling (or burden) of teachers, parents and schoolmates, in a very similar sequence to Mary. On her birthday she is told by her parents Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) that she is not their biological daughter, she was adopted. It tilts her world filled with confident love and she constantly talks about why her biological mother left her. Several evasion attempts after adoptive parents take her to Sri Lanka to try to find her birth mother. The country is torn by a violent civil war and the trio is inevitably caught in the mix. But this also leads to their meeting with the new Shyama - one who is finally confronted by Amudha and asked why she abandoned her daughter. <br /> <br /> The story of a child who has to deal with being abandoned. at birth, his obsessive desire to reconnect with his biological mother, the unconditional love of adoptive parents, the demons that direct the biological mother, the normality of Chennai and the horrors of Sri Lanka's devastated terrorism - Mani Ratnam made a masterful film that merged many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring. AR Rahman's music beautifully complements the magical and poignant moments of the film. The film has excellent performances by Madhavan, Nandita Das, Simran and an absolute role as Amudha - the Abandoned - made by children's breeder P. S. Keerthana. This performance earned him a national award. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is visual poetry - each painting is beautifully crafted and breathtaking. I am intrigued by the connection that Mani Ratnam has with terrorism, love and obsessions. I think your exploration of these matters is absolutely remarkable. Mahadevan's character was quite unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish, but very well connected with how much he cared for the little girl. Their linings were hilarious. The mother interpreted by Simran was also quite multidimensional - she was idealistic, loved her adopted daughter, but she also cared about her biological children. The shock, anguish, and obsession of the Amudha child were portrayed by P. S. Keerthana. His big accusing eyes made most of the conversation. In fact, the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das and her husband. Perhaps Mani deliberately made them mysterious, so as not to give us explicit ideas of why they were the way they were - the riddle of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes. This also prevented him from judging - this was another conflict in which he took no side, but only reported while showing the human tragedy. <br /> <br /> Kannathil Muthamittal is visual poetry and a touching drama - I rarely cry the movies, but this one left me with watery eyes and a little sad. This is a gorgeous movie - a treasure and a guardian if you can find a copy; Borrow or steal today and watch the movie!
