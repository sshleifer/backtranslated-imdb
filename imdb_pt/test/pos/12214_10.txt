I do not believe that sixty percent of voters voted this show as ten now how the heck is the five point score eight is impossible I do not understand, it's totally pathetic I mean how. anyway the show is great the story is great and the characters are interesting, definitely ten out of ten of me i think the creatures are cool they look great and i would like to have a great show of nimrod great cgi i hope there is one second series as many went unanswered in the first season and when the nimrod will get bigger, since the rest of the creatures are huge, again, why the rating is so low when the votes were so high? <br /> <br /> 10/10
