This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's about true love and friendship. About transforming your life and doing something good for someone else. Thomas Bo Larsen may play the same role he did in so many other films, but recently we have seen him in other roles that he does very well as well. But what if he plays the same role he did in other movies? he's perfect for that role. Ulrich Thomsen does a great job too. These two "low life" criminals are the best friends of all time. They share everything and do everything with each other, no matter what the costs. When they discover that Peter's daughter is being abused, they put everything on hold (things you can not put on hold unless you have to do even more criminal acts) and take you to a better place. Do they do the best they can? these two men are not intellectuals, but they have their heart in the right place. All I can say is that Peter and Carsten are my greatest heroes too ??
