In addition to having minor glitches, this film is a masterpiece and definitely the best war movie I have ever seen. It's not the mention that it's one of the best movies I've seen in all genres. I could have written this to no one's land before, but now I think it's better. It's very sad at the end, and I almost cried after the two shocking scenes that came within 5 minutes near the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Karel's performance as a main character was fascinating, even though he was a novice considering his age. This movie makes you think a lot, makes you cry (or at least gets you closer to it), and makes you hate any kind of war and political BS. Hospital-prison flashbacks make the movie even more delicious. <br /> <br /> One small mistake about the film is the non-British accents of supposedly British people. Most of the British on the screen were actually British, but what about those who are supposed to be British and speak with a foreign accent? This really did not fit into this lovely movie. But it's pretty much the only flaw I've noticed. The effects could also be a bit better, but again, we all remember many films from a certain region that have tremendous effects and absolutely nothing more. <br /> <br /> Briefly, this film is a total masterpiece and all individuals should see it. If you want to travel to Czechoslovakia in the 1940s, and if you want to witness virtually a tremendous amount of emotions at one go, this movie is for you. If you do not want to do this, this movie will make you want to do this.
