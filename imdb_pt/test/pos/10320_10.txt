Almost certainly Stooges' top three with Shemp, 'Brideless Groom' is as good as any of the best shorts from the trio with Curly. Unforgettable moments of Stooge are abundant. The opening with 'Professor' Shemp giving voice lessons to homely, untalented and lascivious Miss Dinkelmeyer (Dee Green), shuddering with her terrible singing notes and struggling against her breakthroughs, is a prime example of Shemp Howard at his best. Many considered it the most naturally funny of the Stooges. <br /> <br /> Later, when Moe and Larry try to help him get ready to find a wife (and claim $ 500,000), Shemp thinks he cut off his head. when his mirror is turned back. Fixing the mirror, he cries with relief: "I am? And beautiful as a photo!" "Yeah," Moe quickly responds, trying to pull on his pants, "from an APE!" <br /> <br /> The best scene (and perhaps the best of Shemp with the trio) comes when he pays an invitation to an attractive young lady. Hopkins (Christine McIntyre) Confusing him with long-lost "cousin Basil" suffocates him with hugs and kisses (also leading to a hilarity between Moe and Larry in the hallway), without giving him a chance to explain his true identity. Suddenly, the first cousin Basil calls and she goes mad, beating him over and over again and accusing him of taking advantage of "a poor. Ind????

"What happened, boy?" Moe asks. "Can I help if it's not Cousin Basil?" Shemp asks before fainting. Other classic pieces include Moe and Shemp curling up in a telephone booth, trying to find a missing coin, Larry being slapped because of Shemp's bad looks (his face pressed against the phone). glass cabin), and the big girl fights in the apartment of the justice of the peace. The great Emil Sitka delivers his classic line (inscribed on his tombstone), "Hold hands, you love birds" over and over as your apartment is destroyed. <br /> <br /> I prescribe 'Brideless Groom' as a remedy for anyone. who thinks the Stooges' glory years ended when Curly left. It is true that Shemp did not have as many great short films with the group as Curly, but this was due to a growing lack of support from Columbia and his age (and others). When Shemp was healthy and the trio was given decent material to work on, they were still at the top of the game.
