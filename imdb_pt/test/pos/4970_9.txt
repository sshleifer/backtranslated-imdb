Deep Blood ... It's one of those movies that you're here and you do not say another Jaws Italian ripoff! Well, Deep Blood is far from it. It's cheap as the cinema, and the other side is creative too. In Jaws and all the other shark movies we've all seen or herd about they all use fake sharks as well in Joe D'Amato's film, he has a new approach, using all the images for his shark scenes. This is one of the many reasons why I like Deep Blood so much because it does not use footage. In Deep Blood an ancient Indian spirit terrorizes a beach town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark in Joe D'Amato's classic Deep Blood of Shark. It seems that a Native American once warned a group of young people about this great evil at sea and years later friends are forced to face their fears when one of them is killed by a shark in a series of attacks along its coast. Now it fits in slowly to make sure that this monster is dead, even if it means going to sea to do so. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato directed and produced this film under his company Filmirage. . Released in 1989 and later used in Cruel Jaws: Jaws 5, by Bruno Mattei, along with many other shark films. Joe D'Amato's shark entry is a great movie and any fan of shark watcher Joe D'Amato should try it out.
