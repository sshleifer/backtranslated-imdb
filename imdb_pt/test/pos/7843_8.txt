Another piece of moral ambiguity well done, in which the anti-hero makes it difficult to decide who to support. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, "The Beguiled" would silence anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in movies. at least in 1971. There were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well cast and well performed. <br /> <br /> Pamelyn Ferdin did a great job as Amy and would play "Wanda June". This must have been the first time a male box-office star shared a prolonged kiss with a 12-year-old girl, wondering if there was much controversy about it at the time. It was probably Polanski's favorite scene. Given the fate of Amy "Randolph" Tortoise, it is no surprise that Ferdin has grown up to be an animal rights activist. Geraldine Page was also excellent, playing a complex character with the right amount of restraint. Interestingly, she died only three days after Elizabeth Hartman committed suicide (throwing herself through a fifth-floor window), as they had also worked together on "You're a Big Boy Now." <br /> <br /> Hartman (who looks like she could be Blair Brown's sister) was wonderful as Edwina and should have gotten an Oscar (no other performance was that close that year), but given what we know about her , you wonder how much your performance was effort and how much it just came from within it. Edwina shows a pain so raw it's hard to watch. Like Marilyn Monroe's incredible performance in "The Misfits," the viewer is probably seeing a lot of her own demons in the character she's playing. <br /> <br /> Finally, there's Jo Ann Harris who is unbelievably perfect as the Glamor Carol. For my money, Harris was the sexiest actress of the '70s, combining sensuality with wit and wit. She was the best reason to watch the television series "Most Wanted" and the only reason to watch "Wild Wild West Revisited". Hard to believe that anyone who could bring it all to the screen never became a big star.
