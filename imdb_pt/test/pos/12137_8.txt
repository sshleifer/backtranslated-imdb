Not a bad MOW. I was expecting another movie based on women's issues, but I was pleasantly surprised by the element of suspense. Of course, parts of the plot were very mushy, but most of the time the movie kept me guessing. Was the nut bar connected to her ex-husband, someone in the tavern, or was he the guy she cut? Daniel Magder was excellent. I've seen him on MOW's Mom's on Strike and Guilt by Association, and he's very credit worthy, especially the way he defies his mother the way a preteen does. <br /> <br /> Laura Leighton also played the typical mother (ex-wife) with whom men and women can relate. She was frustrated enough to look real. <br /> <br /> See if you missed. Worth it.
