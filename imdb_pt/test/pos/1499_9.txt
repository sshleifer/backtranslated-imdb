Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his feature films. And I suppose most people saw at most only a few clips of it in their opening days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. This is really a shame as some wonderful shorts are waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century. If anyone watches this movie, they have a great chance to see some of Chaplin's best shorts. because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and joined them with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film. This is great for a number of reasons. First, in the early films of Chaplin, from 1914 to 1915, his Little Tramp character is still in his early incarnations or is completely absent. Also, even when he's there, he was often stingy and egocentric - something very strange from the Little Tramp we have grown to love. Secondly, because the short films chosen were in great condition, if you watch this movie you will not have to worry about watching movie scratchy with gaps and poor musical accompaniment that does not fit into the action (a common problem). <br /> So, to take a good look at Chaplin's short films, give this movie a chance. Surely, you will have great laughs.
