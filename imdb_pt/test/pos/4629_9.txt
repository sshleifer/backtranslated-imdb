Well ... What to say. <br /> <br /> I think I'll start with a confession. I cried 4 times in my life. once when my father died, twice due to a girlfriend in high school and at the end of this movie. This film deals with the real issues of confrontation of 6 children of the school, forcing them very uncomfortably in the eyes of the whole world. I've never seen a movie that deals with the human emotional condition and also with that. everything from incest to incontinence is covered here and I doubt there are many people who are safe from the sting of familiarity with at least a couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> It starts with a suicide. at 2:37 p.m. then, without letting you know who died, the story begins to be told from the beginning of the day. follows the lives of 6 school children until 2:37 pm. interchangeably, and edited with 6 teenagers' personal interviews, lets you know everything about their lives. their loves, hates, dreams, desires, secrets, shame, false confidence, self aversion, corruption and arrogance. the overall result is a kind of whodunnit trying to figure out the identity of the suicide before it is revealed at the end of the movie. without ruining anything I should let you know. do not feel deceived by the end. contains a very important lesson. <br /> <br /> And now a warning. This movie definitely is not for the most sensitive. Many people left the theater when I saw him. Disgusted by some of its contents. Or maybe it's because sometimes it's hard to face the harsh truth of reality. This is how high school is for many people. I'm sure most would agree.
