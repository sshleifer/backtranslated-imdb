I've seen this movie at least 8 times, and I still laugh all the time. The movie is about how an intelligent and motivated man, against all odds, can fool the whole self-confident system. <br /> <br /> This movie is for all people who like a funny movie. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The action and the comedy are well mixed in a brilliant film, which I hope to see soon on DVD. <br /> <br />
