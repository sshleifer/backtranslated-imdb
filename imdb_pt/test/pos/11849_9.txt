I came across den this morning during the scene where Ed was involved in the 3-Way and thought my wife was recovering from some morning porn! To my surprise, it caught my attention and I rewound and started watching at 4:30 in the morning! What a plot and script is very fun, rich, fun and well developed. We both thoroughly enjoyed it, my wife so much she shared the experience with her girlfriends at work! Going to recommend it and say "kick" it came out of it. I'm in my late forties and her in her first 50 years. I think this movie would appeal to young and old. An unexpected and very pleasant surprise. Good job! Thank you! Two thumbs up!
