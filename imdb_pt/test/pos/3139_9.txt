Wagon Master is a very original film between the work of John Ford. Mainly because it is the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was drawn up by Frank Nugent and the director's son? Patrick Ford and turned it into a screenplay, and because of the director's personal opinion about it, Wagon Master is the movie that John Ford called "the closest thing to being what I wanted to achieve," to say this does not want say a little But as Ford once confessed to Lindsay Anderson, his favorite was, however, My Darling Clementine and not any other. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master has all the ingredients one would expect to find in a John Ford movie. Wonderful cast delivering your best, you not featuring the main stars except the most "fordian" of all the actors? Ben Johnson Very quirky little characters, who provide a comedic relief, and Wagon Master has some of them, such as horn blowing sister Ledyard (Jane Darwell) in his shot, but very inspired shows. And last but not least legendary Monument Valley with the fifth passage of John Ford after Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache and She Wore the Yellow Ribbon. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two cowboy friends Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and Sandy Owens (Harry Carey Jr) being hired to be Wagon Masters or guides to a caravan of Mormon settlers who are headed to Silver Valley, a place that is for them as a promised land. Along the way, they join a very peculiar Dr. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) with two beautiful women, who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors. They are going in the same direction, simply because they were recently expelled from the nearest town and have nowhere else to go. Nothing particularly unpleasant happens until they meet Cleggs, a dangerous family gang made up of a father and his three sons fleeing the city marshal where they recently committed murder and bank robbery. Wagon Master is no more and no less than a precious pearl in a necklace of John Ford's wonderful faroestes. A must see. 9/10 <br /> <br />
