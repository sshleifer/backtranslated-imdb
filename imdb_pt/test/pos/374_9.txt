Safer, indeed. Hitchcock is the all-time pervert of cinema; however, we all know that their perversions are also ours, so we forgive them. And we not only forgive him, but we also applaud his clever way of inviting us to an unforgettable train journey. <br /> <br /> I saw Hitch's 1953, I Confess, a week before this, and I put the two in the same category as part of their trademarks. These trademarks resided in his genius questioning and pulsing his artistic veins that shed psychological drops of blood on the viewer without leaving patches of guilt, instead a very subtle awareness of feeling ashame. The pen is always more powerful than the Sword and Hitch firmly wrote the most debatable questions with his wrist, and then holding his hands firmly, he held cameras that always reflected the people's thirst (most of humans have), otherwise comedy would not be a tragic thing, and making people laugh would not be so complex. Mixing all the dark elements of "high society," with a rich psychopath Bruno, and an ambitious tennis player wants to be political, Guy, history is one of Hitch's best built and guided, inspiring many filmmakers, not only with their plot, but with complicated images provoking dark smiles and happy nightmares. <br /> <br /> Almost perfect!
