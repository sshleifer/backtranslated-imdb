I saw 'NSNA' shortly after seeing all of Roger Moore's films and I must say it was great to see Connery again. He proves for all time that he is the only Bond. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is not really a masterpiece, but it is worth watching. The jokes are much better here, the effects are funny and interesting, Connery is Connery and Brandauer is a really good villain. But von Sydow is just wasted and the punctuation is not always good and there are some scenes that seem unnecessary. <br /> <br /> 7/10 \ 2.5 / 4 \ 3+ (1+ - 6-)
