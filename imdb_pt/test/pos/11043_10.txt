The magnificent Greta Garbo is in top form, his first talkie. She gets good support from the rest of the cast, which includes Charles Bickford, the rugged sailor who captures his heart. Garbo does a great performance as he usually does as the distant daughter of a ship captain who returns after fifteen years. Also in the cast is the great actress Marie Dressler. A great movie!
