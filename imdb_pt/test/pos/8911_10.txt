First, the alien saves a little boy and a Mexican boy, despite what the IMDb storyline suggests. This film is the fulfillment of the purest of male women, interracial rape. The protagonist of this film is a drug of George Michaelesque, who does not understand primary human impulses like drug abuse and murder. In fact, every time he uses violence to solve a problem, he has an internal conflict that physically impedes him. What a square. In any case, my favorite scene is when he writes to gang members a letter saying if they want the $ 500 they get from the Reading Center for protection they should meet with him. At the meeting he is surrounded by countless Chicano outlaws, but he keeps his head cool. In slow motion, it hits the wooden pole of a stop sign that breaks the contact. Then, still in slow motion, he points to the leader of the class and says, "Noooooooooooooooooooo, mooooooooooooore!" The gang members do. Legal right? The beauty of this film transpires in these simple solutions to social problems such as prostitution and gang violence.
