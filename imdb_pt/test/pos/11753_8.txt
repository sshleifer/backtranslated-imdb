Holden and Jones SIZZLE in this movie, but not in the way we think of squeaking today - it's very subtle and under the surface - but palpable. Jennifer Jones, in particular, is SO SEXUALLY HOT in this film (much more than a cartoon like Monroe EVER) because she creates a real woman - with ALL facets of femininity: She is intelligent, intuitive, graceful. She is longing AND desirable. <br /> <br /> There's a scene on that famous hill, where she's lying on the grass, looking at Holden, and the expression in her eyes is pornographic, but in the context of the scene and the character, it makes perfect sense. You do not have to have everything said in the dialogue - made explicit as the grossness in most modern films. It's all there in her eyes - sexy but elegant. What a dazzling and underrated actress she was. (I saw MADAME BOVARY for the first time recently and I was equally delighted). I'll take you to Bergman, Davis or the two Hepburns any day.
