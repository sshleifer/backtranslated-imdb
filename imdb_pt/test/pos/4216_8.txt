That's it. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now the fourth of the series, which is, in my opinion, the best of the series. Jennifer Tilly was great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than some actors who come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for example) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The plot was not great, but I do not really care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany fight and fight. And the ending leaves everything open for a 5th sequel (which I've heard is in progress). Idle Hands debuts next week and seems to be another horror / comedy, but I doubt it will surpass this.
