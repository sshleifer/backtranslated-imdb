The animation is still the slightly rougher style of the first episode, Simpsons Roasting in a Fire Open, but already, with this first regular episode, Bart the Genius, humor is starting to be more "layered", faster and bigger depth of characterization is already showing. <br /> <br /> This episode firmly establishes Bart's "looser" personality, and more subtly, Lisa's intellectual superiority to the whole family. Although this is the main theme of the whole episode (there is also a good secondary theme in the relationship between Bart and Homer's father and son), it is given to us first in a nutshell, when the episode starts with the Simpsons playing Scrabble. Lisa comes up with "id" for her word - short but something you have to be well educated to know. She has to read the definition for the rest of the dictionary family, which has served as a way to support the sofa. Marge can only appear with "him". Homer already "rustles" already sitting in his tray in order, but does not recognize that it is a word, so he presents "do" instead. Bart appears with "kwyjibo", which he insists is a word. Similarly, in the main plot of the episode, Bart betrays his IQ test, which causes him to be placed in a special school full of gifted children. We know it is not likely to last long. "The Simpsons" have always had fun playing with varying degrees of intellectual abilities between people through their characters, and more importantly, the way people with varying degrees of intellectual abilities adjust (or not) ), are accepted (or not) and are perceived in society. In addition to starting to present the place of Bart, Lisa, Homer and Marge in this context, this episode already begins respectfully mocking nerds and geeks outside the Simpsons family. Through some of the special school students' dialogues, as well as some of the other references, including the purely visual ones, this episode also shows that "The Simpsons" will not pull any punches by writing or speaking up to their audience. It may just be a cartoon, but it's a cartoon that intellectuals, geeks and nerds will understand more than anyone else. And this fact, besides being just a very funny show, is the key to the longevity of the show.
