When the masterful version of John Carpenter's "The Thing" was released in the summer of 1982, it was criticized by critics and bombed at the box office. The public could not handle another "bad" alien, they wanted ET. Your loss in the long run. <br /> <br /> I would kill to see this great movie on the big screen. This is a film that was way ahead of its time; now has influenced a new generation of filmmakers, showing their trail in things like "Se7en," "Alien 3," and even "The X Files," which tore it page by page without a hint. And the structure, which avoids the development of the character in favor of the incredible SFX, is common in today's blockbusters. Carpenter shows the same skills he perfected in "Halloween," using the camera to create a disturbing and claustrophobic image. atmosphere. The performances are all good, and the ending is fantastic - still unique today. <br /> <br /> A paranoid masterpiece.
