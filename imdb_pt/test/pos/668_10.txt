Chris Morris's Brass Eye TV series has always spawned a large number of complaints from both the public and the people involved. But none of what he did managed to provoke more controversy than that. The 2001 Brass Eye Special. Before the overestimated Jerry Springer Opera arrived, the Brass Eye Special held the record for most complaints received on any TV show that has aired. <br /> <br /> The sheer volume of complaints the general public made regarding the Brass Eye. <br /> <br /> Special was unbelievable! Many complaints have been made by people who have never watched the show! The subject that the program dealt with turned many heads, but the message was widely misunderstood. The message was lost in some who liked the program. This was not a show that made fun of the subject of pedophilia. The show was purely about the media and is presentation of the subject. Morris, is and always will be, a satirist of the media. The notion that the program "amuses" pedophiles and children who have been abused is completely laughable! Morris never tries to do that. It merely draws our attention to the exaggeration, and often stupid, excitement of the media around the subject. <br /> <br /> Using many of his established Brass Eye characters, such as Ted Maul and others, Morris shows how the media ends up blowing everything about a subject they themselves created and built, and the result is so funny , if not funnier, than anything Morris has ever done before. Using his tried and tested formula, Morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing they're working on a serious documentary. In fact, they are meant to look exactly what they are. Delays. <br /> <br /> All in all, Brass Eye Special needs to be seen to be believed. And with an opening line, Morris manages to summarize the entire media situation in 2001: "Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!"
