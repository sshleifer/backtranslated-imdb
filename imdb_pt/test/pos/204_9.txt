One of those films I went through on The Criterion Collection and, as usual, I allowed myself to change my pace. This turned out to be a great decision. I was almost mesmerized by the quality of the film, the story it told and the way it was told. The film's almost minimalist feel, with scarce dialogue and almost constant music, only added an evocative level to the film. This is a really great movie to spend some time with and enjoy.
