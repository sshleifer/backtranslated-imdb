It was no surprise to me that this film was very depressing and exhausting. After all, it's all about the impact of war on civilians And it's the "king of depression," Ingmar Bergman. In other words, many of Bergman's works plunge deep into human misery and anguish, and therefore this film does not seem so extraordinary coming from that director. <br /> <br /> Although it is harder to watch, the last half of the film offers perhaps more insight into the lower depths of humanity. That's because, initially, the main characters (Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow) try to overcome adversity and are basically decent (albeit a little dumb) people. However, as deprivation after deprivation occurs, they (especially Von Sydow) become less and less human and more animalistic - doing ANYTHING to survive. <br /> <br /> Fun to watch, NO FREAKING WAY! But an interesting insight into human nature. <br /> <br /> PS - One thing I LOVED in this movie is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche. When the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine, they finished the wine altogether! In most movies, they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched. It drives me crazy, as I would never leave a $ 4 drink without drinking, unless it tasted terrible or had a bug floating in it! ANGRY!
