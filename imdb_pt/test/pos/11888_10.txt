Some martial arts purists think comedy was the worst thing that could have happened to the old kung-fu movie; and it is true that the introduction of comedy in the genre signaled the end of the chop-socky period in the Hong Kong film. But the fact is that you can only take one display of physical prowess for a while, so everyone gets bored with it. And that's exactly why the movie died and how Hong Kong's action movie "New Wave" was born: producers, actors, directors were simply bored to hit people for ninety minutes straight. Given that, and given the fact that Liu Chia Liang is a professional director with a sizable list of films on his resume, this film has to be seen as something different from another kung-fu comedy. On the contrary, it is a comic within the genre of martial arts and, in fact, one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> What Liu did with this movie is really a pleasant surprise: it took a martial art. The pieces trace and re-built along the lines of a Hollywood-style musical! Complete with episodes of singing and dancing! It was at the time of filmmaking that some filmmakers and moviegoers began to recognize that the cinematic performance of martial arts (actually derived from the acrobatics of Chinese opera) has more in common with dance than with fighting. . (I will continue to point that connection until most Americans realize what they should look for when they watch a martial arts movie - well choreographed body movements, using the plot of an action movie as an excuse for their performance.) any fee, clearly Liu Chia Liang made this connection and decided that he would exploit it close to its limits. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredibly charming entertainment filled with wonderfully human characters attempting a miraculous kung-fu (and stumbling on their own shoelaces as often as when they do). and the film that takes place at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, allows Liu the opportunity to explore the nature of China's Westernization and Modernization, which has contributed enormously to building China as we know it today. So the film has considerable historical significance as well. <br /> <br /> Fans of Stephen Chow's recent Kung Fu Hustle should watch this movie carefully, as Chow clearly learned from him before making his own film. A very entertaining and well done film. Oh yeah, and kung fu is really good. <br /> <br /> The purists will not admit it, but this is probably director Liu's best film.
