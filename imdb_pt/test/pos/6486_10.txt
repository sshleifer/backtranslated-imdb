Of all the leading actresses of the 1930s, Miriam Hopkins has been the most bizarre neglected and underestimated. His series of excellent films from the 30s and 40s is quite impressive, but it is often referred to as stagy or fragile. However, she had a great sense of humor and was memorable in several comedies, including the film Old Acquaintance (with Bette Davis) and The Smiling Lieutenant (with Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert). Hopkins was famous for his antipathy to Hollywood, and the results were a bad reputation - undeserved. In Wise Girl, she plays an heiress trying to rescue the children of her dead sister from her guard. sister-in-law (Ray Milland). The film features several hilarious scenes such as Hopkins Bathing is a depot, Hopkins joining Milland and Guinn Williams at a Greenwich Village restaurant for $ 3 each to act as "Bohemians" and Hopkins going ring during one of Williams' bouts. Milland is also excellent and very funny. <br /> <br /> Hopkins and Milland make a great couple. The film also features solid support from Williams, Walter Abel, Henry Stephenson, James Finlayson, Margaret Dumont, Grace Hayle, Leonid Kinskey and Inez Palange. The two girls are fine. <br /> <br /> But Hopkins, drunk with a "slice of wine" and wearing a stuck dress that's twice his size is hilarious when she blows on loose hair while smoking .... A shout.
