Definitely not a film to revolutionize the industry or introduce new techniques of film production, this is a very beautiful and solid production. It is miraculous that we can today enjoy excellent quality on DVD - probably the majority of viewers around 100 years ago saw a black and white copy, since the luxury stencil edition was available only in the best cinemas. Even if you are not fascinated by this movie or the theme, you can not help marveling at the copy released by Image Entertainment (along with another piece, From the Manger to the Cross, 1912). It is virtually impossible to see a movie more than a century old, but with little damage. The stencil coloring process was very effective and, compared to the occasional blurry and blurry images of hand-colored film, the colors are crisp and clear. Filmed within the limitations of cinema as it was known in 1902, when filming began, the static nature of the scenes can today be considered almost intentional, meditative, and solemn. The frames keep moving in a firm folder, so the movie never gets tedious. You may not be fascinated by this movie as a cinematographic work, but it certainly is beautiful as an academic and picturesque work of art. If you are a religious person, the fact that you are watching anonymous, long since people who have played for a long time since they left characters, significantly increases the mystery. A suitable view for Christmas or Lent. <br /> <br /> Q. I checked the "contains spoilers" box just for fun. As you can see, I did not show the ending.
