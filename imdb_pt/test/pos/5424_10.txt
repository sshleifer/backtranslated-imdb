Richard Condie's insanity insult, 'The Big Snit', is a journey through Qwerkyness, madness, hillarity, nice backgrounds, melting characters and a conclusion that almost brings me to happy tears every time I see him. <br /> <br/ <br /> <br /> This short I've seen over and over and I've never tired of it (thankfully, have it on tape for a broadcast on TV) !! He never to make me burst into laughter uncontrollably, and then reach into the depths of my spirit, highlighting the greatness of the human condition. <br /> <br /> Because when someone says, 'Let's go, let's finish the game', everything is fine in the world and the problems we face every day suddenly realize that it's fleeting little things to not fight or worry about more . This movie at first seems like a simple exercise in clown humor, but it's much more than that. This film reaches a greater sense of spiritual meaning with humanity, when everything seems to be so bad and trivial. <br /> <br /> It's flawless ... in every way. AND DONN FUNNY ALSO;) <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10.
