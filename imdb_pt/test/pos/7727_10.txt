I really liked Carmen, better than Original Sin (Angelina Jolie and Antonio Bandaras), who share some thematic similarities, and which I also really enjoyed. I felt that the performance was stronger here (Paz Vega had a wider reach, there was more fire, and Sbaraglia was great too). Overall, their acting was braver, more believable (less dreamy than Original Sin, and both actors here had less 'celebrity status' and 'pretty face' to make the movie work. <br /> <br /> Director Vincente Aranda also built a detailed world (again, better than Original Sin) that allows you to feel the filth and everyday events of archaic Spain - for example, people unloading goods from a cart on the street, workers replacing street lamp candles, all in the background of the action. <br /> <br /> Although I very much sympathize with the recent idea of ​​redeeming our femme fatals (as Femme Fatale de Brian de Palma) Carmen is a modern and poignant experience in the tradition of the classic indemnity noir, and is a delightful delight to see, another excellent example of the triumph of daring European cinema about flashy and safe Hollywood.
