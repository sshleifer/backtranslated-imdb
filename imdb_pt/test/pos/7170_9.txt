I thought I wrote a comment about this movie before, but I can not find it here. Anyway, I'm writing again. I accidentally found this movie from my college library collections. I was free to watch, so why not? <br /> <br /> I'm glad you did. I love this movie. I've seen some Russian movies before, most of them have serious subjects. It surprises me that this was a good comedy. I laughed a lot while watching. and this is a movie that I want to buy. This thing is so funny. and they are not just silly, those plots were very original and well thought out, so they do not seem to be silly. I'm surprised this movie has not attracted many viewers. This is a classic that you can watch multiple times. <br /> <br /> these actors were also very authentic, their performances are real, not false. if you did not attend, go get a copy soon! definitely recommended.
