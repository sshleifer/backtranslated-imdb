A lovely movie about the introduction of movies in China. It catches the astonishment of the first audiences of the film, as it has been described all over the world, and uses real films of Lumiere for the majority of the news. I do not agree with other people about the bad performance of the British - I thought he was fine, but the Chinese leadership really stole the show. Anyway, I saw myself with a smile on my face for most of the movie. People who fear subtitles may notice that much of the film is in English (which, for some reason, gets subtitles like the Chinese on the DVD).
