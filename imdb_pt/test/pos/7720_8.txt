This movie is about a young Indian who comes home one day and finds himself involved with a woman. The problem is, he's gay. In order to stop the marriage without telling his parents that he is gay, one lie leads to another until she gets out of control. <br /> <br /> This movie is hilarious and made me laugh a lot. The acting of Sally Bankes is superb and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. The plot is great too. I think the plot is very realistic, and I can completely identify with Jimi's feeling of being terrified, worried and upset. On the other hand, Jimi's boyfriend, Jack, receives much less attention in the film. I wish he had more lines in the movie and had more character development. However, as I think the director wants to make this movie more mainstream, the love between Jimi and Jack was not developed in the film. <br /> <br /> It's great to watch an affirmative gay movie. In addition, this film preaches us to accept the difference of other people, be it sexuality, culture and way of life. This movie makes viewers think hard. <br /> <br /> We need movies like this to give us a boost. Thanks for making this movie!
