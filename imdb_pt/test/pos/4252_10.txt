1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second film of Robert Downey to obtain some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope got a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and unpleasant. These two films were stingy, to the point of actually delaying Prince's feature film career for several years. <br /> <br /> The subject in question is Putney Swoope. And it's a crazy farce / satire that has to be seen to be believed. I will not go through the plot here. What are you plotting ?? People looking for a plot will scratch their heads. Keep scratching !! This movie is not about PLOT! One can compare this to a movie by Mel Brooks; only without the Hollywood parody party that Mel always pitched. I also see a bit of Monty Python in that. By the way: This movie was filmed before Monty debuted on the BBC! <br /> <br /> I notice that the Gags and Lines that are dying of hilarity DO NOT TRANSFER well from mouth to mouth. You have to see them within the context of the movie. There are some flaws in the film; but even the flaws are unique. For example: actors often repeat the same line over and over; and somehow works. How Many SÃ­labas Mario? Putney says Borman Six Girl needs soul! etc ... <br /> <br /> Black and white photography is excellent. The sound / punctuation is even better! The issue is just like that. The performance is above average. The script is invaluable. The jokes are as off the PC as you can get: MR. Bad News says "Sonny Williams has just been caught in a motel with a 13-year-old girl" Putney says "Well, at least he's not superstitious" Tight conservatives beware. The Anti-Establishment mindset of this movie will take you directly out of the room. Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> There are many things in this movie that relate to today: NO SMOKING !!! Inverted racism; with African Americans treating caucasions as trash. The manipulation of mass media on the masses; Madison Avenue, Deroit, Hollywood intentionally pedaling something that any 8-year-old can say is sheer junk; The Internet, I'm talking about the "drum"; Interracial dating; I could continue ... <br /> <br /> I should also mention that there are about 8 mins of this film that was recorded in 16 mm Color. These are the commercials made by Putney's agency. The stains work reasonably well the first time. They become tiring, albeit in repeated visualizations. The real magic here is inside the P / B sections of the movie. It's the non-scenic lines that stay with you: "Rent a CHORT Schmuck". "I love you, I love you, I love you ... did you take your pill?" "Anything I have to say would be redundant." And a host of others. I also really like the part with the goldfish on the wall: "The director of the game wanted me to play back ... I made such a fight, I decided to ride it!" <br /> <br /> The highlights of the cast include Buddy Buttler as Putney's # 1 bodyguard. He should have been a much bigger star. Antonio Fargas as the Arab. He went to stardom on TV and Films. Arnold Johnson has the right look like Putney Swoope. Robert Downey used his own voice because Arnold could not remember some of his lines. Also Downey realized that he could fill in any additional dialogue / jokes later if he would dub his main actor. <br /> <br /> The film has some shortcomings. The short time is one of them. I wish the start with the members of the White Board has been extended. Stan Gotlieb and Allen Garfield are excellent. The ending seems to have been played as if he just could not think of more jokes. In short, this is one of the best low budget independent films of your time. A time when few musicians played outside of New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Anyone who loves satire and comedy should see it at least twice. Downey's Putney Swoope is ahead and beyond.
