Count on me as someone who is happy not to see Hastings in this episode. The Doctor. Watson, poor man, does nothing for me, for he simply drags all the scenes he's in. Japp is often needed for history as a representative of the functionalism, and a little Miss Lemon is good for tempering, but Hastings wobbles painfully. dim to excessively in different episodes. If I have to sit another one empty "Oh, I say there!" I'm going to get the gas pipe. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, the more Poirot you have in a Poirot story, the better. Each line of Hastings is taken from Poirot. And I've never read the books, so I do not really care about being loyal to Christie's characters. Many viewers / reviewers seem to have trouble separating movies from books. If you want the book to be written, read it. I do not see the point of watching the television version if you know what will come next at all stages. Theater is not prose - do not expect a transcript.
