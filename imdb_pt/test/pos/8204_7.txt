You could get into the heart of the subject of this movie and tell how it could not happen, or how the main character could get into the office and start using computers, etc. without anyone realizing and actually choosing the movie in pieces ... or you could just sit with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the acting. Personally, I prefer the latter, I live the real life and watch the news with all that is doom and gloom, and so it would be much better to be entertained by my movies, and watch the thieves get their fair rewards. Do not take it too seriously, and you can fully appreciate this movie.
