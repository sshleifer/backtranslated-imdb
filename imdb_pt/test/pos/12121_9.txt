Great movie about an American G.I who leaves the army to marry a German girl who saved his life in the last days of the war. She accepts, but does she do it because she really likes him, or because he can support her with easier access to food and such? Meanwhile, his brother and an old friend form an anti-American terrorist group called Werewolves, with the aim of alienating the occupiers (you may remember the same group that played a major role in Lars von Trier's Europa (Zentropa)). James Best, best known for his role as Roscoe P. Coltrane on the 1980s television show The Dukes of Hazzard, is surprisingly excellent as the American. Should he have become a big movie star? at this age he reminds me a lot of Warren Beatty. The other main actors are also good. Fuller's direction is quite good, using many long shots (though they are not as complex as they were in Park Row; long shots usually consist of long, long dialogue scenes). The only problems are in the script, as seems to be the case with all the Fuller movies I've seen. It's not too bad, but it should have been expanded by explaining the main characters and parts of the script. Helga, the wife, undergoes a major change, but completely off-screen. Therefore, the emotional center rests directly on Best's shoulders. Fuller also should have killed the sick mother earlier in the movie. I hope this does not look too hard! She simply does not do anything over the film except lying in bed. It has few lines. But Fuller continues to create it while the movie continues. I would have her death solidifying David and Helga's relationship with myself. And the movie ends very abruptly and has no payback. These are not really the biggest flaws in the world (the way I've described them makes them look bigger than they are). 9/10
