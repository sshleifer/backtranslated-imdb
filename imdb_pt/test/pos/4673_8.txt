I find it sad that just because Edward Norton did not want to be in the movie or have something to do with it, people automatically think the movie is a drug without even watching or giving a chance. I really hope Norton does not do that. He is a good actor and all, but he scared people away from a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I found it amusing. It was not amazing or something with crazy special effects, but it was not bad. It was fun to watch. But yes, it's definitely not a bad / awful movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
