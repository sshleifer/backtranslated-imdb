This was a truly epic production that had all the elements one would want in a fantasy film. Costume, music, cinematography - all the artistic elements of this film were absolutely gorgeous and provided a rich experience. <br /> <br /> Ted Danson, best known for his TV roles in "Cheers" and "Becker." was excellent in the role of Gulliver. Mary Steenburgen (Time After Time, Cross Creek) performed equally well in her limited role as his wife. Other performances that I really enjoyed were James Fox as Dr. Bates, Alfre Woodard as the Queen of Brobdingnag, and Peter O'Toole as the Emperor of Lilliput. <br /> <br /> That would make a childlike movie enjoyable, but it also certainly appealed to adults for their deep social comments.
