I watched this movie when it was released and being very young and not much in the movies, it was one of the most fascinating film experiences I have ever had and it really left a mark inside me. At first I did not quite understand the story and probably failed to make the necessary correlations between past and present as the film presents to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Years later I watched for the first time I got to watch again and this was the time I fell in love with 'The English Patient', touched me so deeply and for me it became the best film of Everytime. <br /> <br /> Anthony Minghella has made an absolutely stunning film, all locations are amazing and through his camera he manages to create unbelievable emotions within you. <br /> <br /> Of course the movie's music is such a big part of the whole emotional journey of the characters and the movie would not be the same without it. <br /> <br /> But, personally, the best thing was the fragile performance that Ralph Fiennes gave in the masterpiece. He touches so well the man who falls in love slowly, but so deeply, with Katherine Clifton, opens his heart and delves into this forbidden subject. <br /> <br /> The saddest scene for me will always be the one. Katherine is taken by Almasy towards the Swimmer's Cave and she wears the thimble he bought for her. She says, "I've always used it. I've always loved you," and at that moment he begins to cry with so much pain flowing from within him. <br /> <br /> Juliette Binoche is also amazing in her performance and really deserved the Oscar she earned. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a movie that anyone claiming to be a movie lover should watch at their shows. lives.
