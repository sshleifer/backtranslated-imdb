Caddyshack 2 has a terrible reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly accomplished classic. People have criticized the film for several reasons, but they all come back to the fact that this is not Caddyshack. <br /> <br /> I would like to start by saying that we should simply take Caddyshack out of the equation and consider this movie on its own merits, but I think it would be unfair. The film has a lot in common with its predecessor. The topics related to the class "snobs versus slobs" and the desire to fit into a class above yours are as prevalent here as in the first film. The two things that are really missing here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who were replaced by Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively. <br /> <br /> Now I will not try to argue that Ackroyd approaches Murray in the film, but Jackie Mason is an admirable successor to Dangerfield. It comes out as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without biting too much. I would not say he's anywhere near to be as funny as Dangerfield is in Caddyshack, but there's a lot more sense to his character and his dilemma in the movie. <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase only appears and a handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. Perhaps these pessimists in particular did not realize that he only appeared a few times in the first film. For my money, his scenes here are a lot funnier, if somewhat over-directed. <br /> <br /> While I'm on the subject, it's really the direction of the movie that brings you down. He is much more self-conscious in his attempts to laugh. Many of the jokes are laborious and long ago by the Gopher, who seems to have assumed a much more anthropomorphic personality and voice, in case we do not understand the idea that this is funny. <BR> The characters are also hammered at home, particularly the insolent boys. Jackie Mason rarely misses a beat, and is consistently nice and very funny, but we do not need the tango sequence! The director clearly is not from the same school of thought as Harold Ramis. Not to suggest that Caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little too much, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music tip. <br /> <br /> All things considered, this is a fun and goofy movie. with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying. Do not be discouraged by the extremely low IMDb rating, check it out for yourself.
