A beautiful film set in 1962 in Hong Kong about a man (Mr. Chow) and a woman (Mrs. Chan) who become close friends when they suspect their spouses are having an affair. Stylistically, the film is also beautiful. Wong Kar-Wai uses lots of slow-motion and close-ups on body parts (feet, hands, waist). The film itself has a reticence and propensity that suggests its time period. It's sexy without showing everything. Wong Kar-Wai also does not allow the public to see how the spouses look, suggesting that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan should be together. Smoke is even made to look stylish with close-ups of curls of smoke. A really beautiful film. Just get ready for the end. <br /> <br />
