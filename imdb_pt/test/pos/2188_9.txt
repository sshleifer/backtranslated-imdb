Televised in 1982 from a Los Angeles production, this is probably the best example of a musical filmed that you'll probably find. Issued on DVD in 2004 on a remastered digital transfer, it's quite impressive. Hearn and Lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the cast is obviously involved in the electricity generated. Of course it is the music and lyrics of Sondheim that make this possible. If anyone doubts that he is one of the "greats" of the American musical form, listen to this. The sets are rigid, as befits the plot, and clever at allowing the necessary quick scene changes, and the cameras capture the action without negating the fact that this is a stage production. A central, movable and rotating platform is Mrs. Lovett's pie shop, with the upstairs barbershop. Around it are several porticos and moving stairs to allow the rest of the action to take place. The brutal tale of injustice leading to revenge, murder and chaos is generously tempered with black humor and comical moments. Sondheim makes for barbershops what Hitchcock did for the showers! An important work in American musical theater is given here an electrifying performance.
