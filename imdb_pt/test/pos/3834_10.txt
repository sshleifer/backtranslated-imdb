This has to be one of my favorite 3 Episodes of the Original TV Series. <br /> <br /> What makes it great is the battle of intelligence between Commander Romulan and Kirk, as well as Mark's first-line performance. Lenard, who later went on to play Spock's father in other TV episodes and movies. This is a case in which those around have risen to the level of talent around them, and Shatner, Nimoy, and the entire cast delivered an exceptional performance in this episode. <br /> <br /> Writing and plot are also excellent, and I love the direct approach used to show us the characters and the feelings and thoughts of these characters, and how freely they are expressed by the actors. <br /> <br /> This very fun episode ranks 10 out of 10. AWESOME !! Desert-Buddha
