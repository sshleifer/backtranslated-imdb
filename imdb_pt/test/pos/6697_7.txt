A mix of Alien and Ghost Busters? <br /> <br /> It starts very promising, then slows down to almost annoying. <br /> <br /> LifeForce contains some awesome special effects that they managed to make in the mid-80's. The story is intriguing, but it becomes quite lacking in brightness in the end. It was classified as R because of nudity, sex and blood. Mathilda May's ethereal and wild (nude) beauty is very apparent throughout the film. A bizarre movie and cost a lot at the time it was made. <br /> <br /> This could have been a bigger classic with a better script, but unfortunately it was not a big hit, I think it really did fail a lot. <br /> <br /> So something went wrong with this, but still, it's a lot of fun.
