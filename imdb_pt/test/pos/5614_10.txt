As you can see by the few comments posted here - mine may very well be the last one you'll see, unless there's a big DVD release or TCM replays it again! - This is a kind of movie "Our Gang" with a lot of different kids. MGM was certainly the musical studio - if the musicians, dancers and singers were not under contract, they were on tap. Heifetz was one of the most expensive ..... which makes for a bit of charity work !!! The rate he received at that time was unprecedented. Another musical film with Jose Iturbi (Mexican pianist) presented about 100 children playing a simple melody on 100 pianos ...... then skeptics who think that small children are not musical are mistaken: I was one. <br /> <br /> As everyone writes, "Frankie Smith" - good American name - (Gene Reynolds) was the grumpy kid who is taken off the streets by the owners of a music school. Do you believe that Walter Brennan ("Prof. Lawson") of all Western movies was the man who ran the school? Joel McCrea ("Peter McCarthy") and Andrea Leeds ("Ann Lawson") were the biggest stars in "They Shall Have Music", with a number of well-known extras (many of which became stars in their own country). rights). As others have commented, almost all the boys in the orchestra (actually, The Meremblum Symphony in Los Angeles) have made great successes of their lives, as musicians (for studios) and other businesses. <br /> <br /> It's sad to say that there are not many young orchestras today - a sad mistake. Parents with children in school usually get so busy trying to keep their heads above water, and many do not even know what's going on with the kids at school. Musical instruction can be expensive, and almost EVERYONE would rather have a football team ... <br /> <br /> This is Jascha Heifetz's cheapest concert you have ever heard contained in this movie. .... in those days, a room. His interpretation is brilliant, even though it seems he would rather be somewhere else ... without emotion. By contract, any Yo-Yo Ma concert is so lighthearted, it makes you want to run out and buy a cello ..... this guy is having fun ... like the kids in the "street" concert, when they cheat Heifetz to play at his school. <br /> <br /> All orchestral numbers have been played by "the kids," and they make it look easy. I love this kind of movie - the plots are so simple that you do not take two days to find out if you liked - or understood - the movie. We need some new movies like this - we can not do anything but inspire younger kids to play instruments other than guitars ... Bravo!
