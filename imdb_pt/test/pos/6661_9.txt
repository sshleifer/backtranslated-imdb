In Cold Mountain in northern Colorado, near the time of the American Civil War, Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in the small town with his daughter, the timid Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), for health reasons. Ada meets the equally shy Inman (Jude Law), and they fall in love with each other. With the onset of war, Inman becomes a soldier, and his great support to stay alive is the desire to see Ada on Cold Mountain again. Meanwhile, Ada meets Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), a survivor of the war, who helps her on the farm and becomes her best friend. The story alternates present and past situations, revealing a beautiful novel. I really liked this movie. Having names like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in the supporting cast, a magnificent direction by Anthony Minghella and seven nominations for the Oscars, this film does not disappoint. My observation is that there are some very important scenes excluded from the story and presented on the DVD. At least one of them, which shows what happens to Sara, her baby and the three corpses on her farm, should not be ruled out as she was. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Cold Mountain'
