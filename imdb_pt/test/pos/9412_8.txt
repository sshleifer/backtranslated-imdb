It's interesting that someone made a comparison between the "Fifth Missile" and the Star Trek episode. It should be noted that the original episode of Star Trek TV, in which the crew of the Enterprise suffers a space madness, while the planet Si 2000 in orbit is titled "The Naked Time", not the "Naked Now". "Naked Now" refers to the first regular episode of Star Trek The Next Generation, in which the Enterprise-D finds a science ship. This episode, however, refers to and is based on the original series "Naked Time". <br /> <br /> Now to the Firth Missile. While the crew's reactions to the Star Trek episodes were based on those similar to alcohol intoxication, the condition of the crew aboard the Montana was caused by a much more serious situation, namely the paint vapors emitted by the defective finish of the bulkheads. There are few places where such a reaction could have more serious consequences than among a crew that has such serious responsibilities as a crew on a ballistic missile submarine, and of course that's what makes the movie so full of suspense and a thriller. The plot is very believable. At the same time, this film, along with "Crimson Tide", "The Day After", "The Light of the Dawn", "The Hunt for Red October", "Ice Station Zebra" and many other similar films give us much insight about the ease with which things could go wrong and how easy it could be for a nuclear holocaust to begin. Fortunately such an event did not occur and (God willing) such an event will not happen.
