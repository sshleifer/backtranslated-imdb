I seem to notice that a lot of people have never seen this movie, and those who generally dismiss it as junk ... it's actually pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie, I admit it was almost one of those people ... thank goodness I'm patient, otherwise I would never have found such a classic. As playful as this movie is, it is also a must have for anyone who is either a fan of 1980s movies, or simply has a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I know there are many people out there who are going to tell you that this movie is a kind of Better Off derivative. Dead ... so what if it is? Both were great movies! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that Savage Steve Holland is a genius! 10/10
