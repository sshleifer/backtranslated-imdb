"Idiocracy" is Mike's last film "Office Space" Judge, and it certainly follows a similar theme from the film in the fact that it's an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity ... relatively speaking. It's a story about Joe Bauer (Luke Wilson), who is literally the most common guy in existence. Joe and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph) become the test subjects of a military project from a hibernation chamber. They should remain suspended for only a year, but due to lack of supervision, Joe and Rita are forgotten and accidentally wake up 500 years into the future. <br /> <br /> Here's the scary part: this movie explains: In a very realistic and plausible way, as the entire population of 2505 became absolutely retarded. Without natural predators, the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the fastest, smartest and strongest people for gene progression ... only the people who reproduce the most. Sadly, these people are sucking well-being, idiots from trailers that breed like rabbits. This abundant reproduction of stupid people has had an adverse effect on the growth of society and now Joe and Rita are the two most intelligent humans on the face of the planet. If that helps, imagine the entire population just as a hybrid of hillbilly, athletes, cholos and lovers. Seeing this nightmare dystopia, Joe learns and tries to track down a time machine to see if he and Rita can go back to when they came, and that's basically the whole plot. <br /> <br /> But although as a -dimensional I can make it sound, this movie is louder than you can understand. Nuances are everywhere and anyone can see glimmers (warning signals, if you will) of the modern bourgeoisie pervading facets of everyday life and turn it into the train disaster exposed in "Idiocracy." The movie has some truly impressive showcases of realistic delay placed on a pedestal. I do not want to give away anything and ruin jokes for you, but let's just say this is pretty complete. I can see how some would say it's just a lot of humor in the bathroom, but strange as it may seem, it has a purpose; to show how stupid these people are. <br /> <br /> This film, unfortunately, is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor, "Office Space"; nobody will see it in theaters, but everyone will brag about discovering this incredible / funny movie when it comes out on video. My only complaint for the film would be that the flow of the narrative is sometimes broken so they can make an exhibition of the "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" about how things should be where they are, but it is a necessary evil and it is implemented here. Other than that, good characters, funny jokes and above average social commentaries, wrapped in a funny bow. Final Note: If we see our youth becoming a gang-banger, acting like rubbish / redneck, and be proud of it ... if you are educated and worshiped anyway and can see how our country is getting out of control into an abyss of stupidity, for God's sake, watch this movie.
