I'll do this soon. It was a joy to watch. It may or may not have been more effective if the characters resembled their real-life counterparts, but aside from that little remark, I found the most delightful animal-fantasy characters. The visuals were more impressive, except for the second-rate CG scenes that could have been left out. I do not like computer generated animation anyway, it defeats the purpose of a biographical film like this. See, you'll like it too!
