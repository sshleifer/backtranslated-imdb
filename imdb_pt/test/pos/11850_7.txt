Synopsis: Ed and Alice are involved. They live together and are living life without grace. He slept before he met Alice. She has much less experience. She decides she needs to sleep before she gets married. He reluctantly agrees that both should see other people for a while. <br /> <br /> At first he is not really involved. His wild days are behind him and he is simply content. Until one day Alice comes back and tells him that she got some random face; who naturally begins to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Of course this is a bad idea that causes extreme tension in the relationship. Good movie. You can see the wreck of the train coming, but it's still good. <br /> <br /> Worth a rental.
