It's all about getting what you want when you want. And the message of Bluebeard's eighth wife is to be careful about what you desire, even what you wish for yourself. <br /> <br /> Most men have heard the stories about what happens when their sexual frustration is not relieved. and a certain part of his anatomy turns blue. Misogynist Pirates aside, Cooper plays a very rich man who is very accustomed to getting what he wants when he wants, learning only too late that he was not what he expected and never learning his lesson until he finds the brave Claudette Colbert. Through a braided deal (in soul and in practice), he ends up spoiling / buying it with the intention of lying down with it, but he will have none of it (literally) and frustrate him at every corner, corner and room, and tourist attraction. <br /> <br /> The film has a defined French sensibility, which means that it has a strong double entender and humor for the day and a bluntness that you are not accustomed (and may not like to see) in Cooper or Colbert. The reason I watched the movie was because they are "friendly" actors, and the purpose of this movie is that they are unpleasant people, or at least nice people who have developed unpleasant traits to protect themselves, they think, from the world. <br /> <br /> If you can accept it on your own terms, you will find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated movie ... and satisfaction, as we said, is everything. A movie like this only appears, after all, once in a ... blue moon.
