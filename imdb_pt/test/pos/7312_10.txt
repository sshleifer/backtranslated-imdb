A rich old lady calls a seductive divorcee to lure a Lothario away from her silly granddaughter about to get married. LET US BE GAY is an interesting little domestic comedy that features some sour dialogues (courtesy of the celebrated screenwriter Frances Marion) and good acting. While perhaps sometimes a bit grumpy, this can probably be attributed to difficulties with the initial sound technology that tended to limit action and movement. Norma Shearer may be credited for appearing in this smaller film instead of using her undoubted influence as Irving Thalberg's wife to insist on only A-grade photos. She is especially effective in her early scenes where the flat and sloppy makeup leaves her almost unrecognizable. His extreme goose-swan transformation could only happen in Hollywood, but it's unprofitable to spend a lot of time worrying about it. <br /> <br /> Rod LaRocque does not do very well as Shearer's adulterous husband. Very popular during the days of silence, the talkies were not especially kind to him and his career would suffer. Here her role is not at all sympathetic and one has to imagine what the masochistic impulse moves women to crave so much. <br /> <br /> The magnificent Marie Dressler is in hand like an eccentric revenge on Long Island. As a great friend of Frances Marion, one can easily imagine that the part was written expressly for her. Full of handles and quarter notes, she's very good-humored. However, the tremendous heat and essential goodness that would soon make your biggest Hollywood star are largely missing. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting cast, Hedda Hopper scores as a stealthy society snake, as does Wilfred Noy playing a comic butler. The filmmakers will see little Dickie Moore as Shearer's young son and elderly Mary Gordon as his housekeeper, both uncredited.
