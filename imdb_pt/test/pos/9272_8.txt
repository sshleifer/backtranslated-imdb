Remember Greg the bunny? It was this show that started on the Independent Film Channel, but it was turned into a complete sitcom on Fox. My cousin and I thought it was very funny, plus the early idea of ​​dolls picking up PG-PG stuff. Puppets Who Kill takes place in a similar universe where puppets live in the same world as people and, like us, take on jobs and lives of their own. Let's just say that if you could not handle it, then you would not mind watching PWK, since this show is a profile of 4 puppets that have drifted away from society's good graces through drug abuse, hedonism, and violent crimes just for finish in stocking. way home. There's a lot of violence, sex and language wrong (so I would never make it to the US Network). As if sociopath puppets were not enough, the fact that this happens in Canada makes it all the more disturbing (in fact, the government pays for it), and I think any American viewer would require longer TV covers like this. I do not know where you can get it in the US apart from the extra satellite TV, but I advise you to make a try. Really funny stuff. (It airs on the comedy network in Canada)
