This movie was fun! Especially if its between 8 and 15 years. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes have a credible team of 8th graders get an adult who really deserves it back. Paul Giamatti is a great adult you really want to 'understand'. My 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it. Parents: No bad word or sex to worry about. Recommend it to the "right" crowd. AP
