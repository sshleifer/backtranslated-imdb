I love this movie. The chemistry between the two leads Miller and Carlisle is amazing, they shine so well each other, creating an unlikely Duo comedy. Alan Cumming is hilarious, his enthusiasm for the role is clearly evident when he campers. The acting is superb and it's a genuinely fun and touching movie. It's not the biggest movie of all time, I'll admit, but it's great fun, and I recommend it to those who enjoy other British films. It includes some of the best British actors, including Michael Gambon, so you can not go very far. Stay tuned for the appearances of David Walliams and Matt Lucas of Little Britain and Rock: Profile fame.
