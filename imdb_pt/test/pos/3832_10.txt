This is one of the best early episodes of "Star Trek," with Kirk and his team venturing into the unknown to fight an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they discover that the feared Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! The young Stiles, well played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unpleasant characters in the Star Trek universe. His ill-concealed hatred of Spock is strangely similar to the post-September 11 hatred and mistrust many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern backgrounds. The atmosphere of war paranoia is very real. Then there are the Romulans: they are the Federation's greatest enemy. Klingons are unpleasant, but basically harmless; more a nuisance than a serious threat. The Romulans, however, mean business: it is the ancient Romans reborn in the space age; despite their vulcanic characteristics, are clearly intended to remind us of imperial Rome, with names like Decius and titles like "centurion" and "praetor." Mesh armor is very cool. Mark Lenard, who went on to play Spock's father Sorek, and Klingon's commander in "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" is a war-weary gray commander, a character who looks a lot like Laurence Olivier's Crassus. in "Spartacus". In addition, his questioning about the insatiable thirst for conquest of the Empire reminds me of the same fears that Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) expressed at the beginning of "Gladiator." A must for both Trekkies and epic sword and sandal fans.
