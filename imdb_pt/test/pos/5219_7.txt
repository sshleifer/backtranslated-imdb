I do not like boxing, I do not understand the attraction. I liked this movie. Positive portraits of Latinos, without drugs, sex or street violence. The plot, in fact, showed stable and loving families. The fight sequences are violent, as is boxing, but not as exaggerated as the Rocky films. Nothing wrong with trying familiar themes with a different angle and ethnicity. It's a good rental.
