There's not much that comes close to perfect storytelling and action-packed thriller levels like "GoldenEye." When he left, it was the biggest game of all time, and to this day, he is still strong. <br /> <br /> I admit that this game got boring after a few months playing playing again until two years later, I was pushed back to its biggest, almost as if I was playing for the first time again. <br /> <br /> There are 20 levels full of action, which is probably the most of any James Bond game to date. Probably the most unforgettable is the Tank level, which was probably the most explosive video game sequence of the era. And the first person shooting and the use of Q gadgets is what James Bond fans are always dying to use. <br /> <br /> Frankly, as a James Bond fan, I look for aspects of a true James Bond experience. , which are now appearing in the PS2 games. So this game, despite having great action and usable gadgets, I was expecting a little more, even in 1997. I also did not like that this game did not have Q or M or Moneypenny, or someone from MI6. While watching the movies, Bond interacts with these characters at least a few times throughout each movie, but they are not seen in this game. And the vocal dialogue would have made the game more lively than the text dialogue they used. They had the technology. They simply did not use it. <br /> <br /> Probably the most annoying feature of this game is that it somehow follows the story of the movie accurately, and other ways are incoherent. For example, there are two levels in which you have to protect or save Natalya, even if in the movie she can take care of herself. There are also some unnecessary levels, such as the Boat level, where you have to disarm some bombs (which are not in the movie), which adds nothing to the plot. There are even some levels in which you rescue Natalya, but at the beginning of the next level she is captured again. As? <br /> <br /> Oh well. Even these little things can not really do away with this game. And while I prefer the newer games, this Bond experience is definitely one you will not forget. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
