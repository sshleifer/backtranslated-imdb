Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid movie in every respect. Everything from acting to filmmaking was solid. It's not a perfectly linear plot, but there was nothing you could not see coming. Maybe a bit melodramatic in points, but again, a pretty decent movie, though. Definitely worth checking out. If in doubt about the movie to rent on the weekend, try it. Although you may not feel like running and buying it, I thought it would be worth it.
