Most of the silent movies I saw were serious by nature, so it was fun to watch one with a comedic twist. The scene and some of the scenes of "The Loved Ladino" reminiscent of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", 1923, in relation to the street scenes of Paris and the celebration of "King of the Crazy". John Barrymore portrays France's greatest poet, Fran√ßois Villon, in a characterization that varies greatly from a virtual slapstick to a romantic novel; that 'water in wine' bit at the beginning of the picture was quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> It seems like times never change, and it's interesting to see the movie make a convincing remark almost a century ago - Paris has foolish reign for one night while the rest have one all the time. How true. <br /> <br /> Conrad Veidt's appearance in the film was a little surprising for this viewer, I only saw him as Major Strasser in "Casablanca", strangely one of his last films. Like king Louis XI, he is a monster obsessed with astrology, cunning, but suspicious, and it was a bit unnerving to see how he looked like Brad Dourif's Wormtounge character in the last chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Not exactly exuding the confidence a king of France could expect. That is why the Duke of Burgundy's (Lawson Butt) ascendancy seemed even more plausible, until Villon stood up to lay one on top of both rulers. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting that the use of title cards were extremely spared, used only when absolutely necessary to advance the story. Without them, however, someone would have lost a curious nugget. It seems Villon made his exile from Paris at Lame Flea Hostel! <br /> <br /> The impression I saw was of exceptional quality, the first film featured on a hundred DVDs of action and suspense movies from Mill Creek Entertainment, which says something to an eighty year old movie . It's great that silent-age films are now finding a wider distribution in this kind of commercial format, making them accessible to an entirely new generation of moviegoers. <br /> <br /> A Question - Does It Look Like Conrad Veidt's Did King Louis choose his nose on purpose, or as an inadvertent gesture that simply remained safe from the courtroom?
