This series has recently been discovered and excerpts can be seen, at least in Britain, via http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html. Presumably, there is some hope that the series may eventually become available more widely. The problem is that this series was followed by the series THE WARS OF THE ROSES, which had an equally stellar cast that is available for cable TV, or at least crowding the market. <br /> <br /> The two series are quite different in dramaturgy; THE WARS consolidates the pieces through extensive re-writes and scene changes; An era of kings follows Shakespeare more closely. Both series benefit from full casting.
