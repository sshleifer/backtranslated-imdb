I saw the Merchant of Venice in London last week. Great performance by Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Finnes and Lynn Collins. Compared with other films based on Shakespeare's play, this production made the play so easy to understand and follow. Bravo to Michael Radford for directing these top actors. The costume and the scenery are great and since it was filmed in Venice, the film gives an authentic touch. I had read the play for more than thirty years at school, and the emphasis was on the characters' anti-Semitic behavior toward Jews and the cruelty of Christians. I do not know if this movie will be controversial, but in any case, I'm sure he will get some Oscar nominations.
