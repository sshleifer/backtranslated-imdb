Believe me when I say this show is just hilarious. The basic story is about Kintaro Oe, who travels from town to town, taking part-time jobs, chasing women and learning everything he can about life. Kintaro has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made. He takes everything to the extreme, and is just laughing loud and funny all the time. From his constant unending quest to study life, to small things he instantly explodes in matters of life and death. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things about this show is simply Kintaro is constantly overcoming the main expressions and reactions. He spends a great deal of time in several super deformed modes like Dragon Half or Trigun. Other times, in less than 0.1 second, his face will not only become serious, but expressions of life or death in the style of manga fighter, like a weight lifter, trying to impose a new record. It's hilarious. <br /> <br /> If that were not enough, the writing is superb and dubbing in English could not be better. Kintaro's English VA is just perfect and will make him roll when he's not even saying anything. The only thing to mention is that this is undoubtedly an Ecchi series. This pretty much defines the word. If you are an adult anime fan who can laugh at movies like American Pie, you will love this. <br /> <br /> - Rirath_com
