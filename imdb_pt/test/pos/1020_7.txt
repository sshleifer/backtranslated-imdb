Kathleen Beller, a high school student, is found beaten and raped in the opening scenes of this TV movie. The film then flashbacks to the few days before the rape, as Beller is chased by a stranger. Beller and Scott Colomby and her Best Friend Robin Mattson and Dennis Quaid are dating dating from an early age. Beller's anxious parents <br /> <br /> relaxed Tony Bill and Blythe Danner, waiting at home to wring their hands and so on. Immediately, the decade of 1970 marks its entrance, since the young couples discuss the romance and the love in "Three Days of the Condor". <br /> <br /> Beller, an amateur photographer, begins to be threatening notes <br /> <br /> stuffed in your closet at school. The filmmakers wisely gave us a bunch of suspects: Beller's new boyfriend, Mattson's boyfriend, Beller's father, Beller's ex-boyfriend, and what's up? Overly friendly photography teacher who wants Beller to be a little sexier in her self-portraits? I knew who the rapist was <br /> <br /> because the video box company Worldvision Video has a photo of the attack <br /> <br /> attack on the back cover, destroying any suspense in that <br /> < in account who is the attacker, Beller begins to receive phone calls of harassment and ends up being raped. The film then goes south while she does as Nancy Drew and secretly puts a time-lapse camera to catch the guy chasing another student. <br /> <br /> Finally, the filmmakers approach a narration that ends with the end of <br /> <br /> Beller on the lack of understanding of the victims of rape in that < day and age. <br /> <br /> The thriller here is very real, without going over into horror movie stuff. Beller is very good, and watch out for her and the Mattson scene in an abandoned theater - both do great jobs. <br /> <br /> The film is full of familiar faces, including Ellen Travolta in a small role, <br /> <br /> and everyone is professional. <br /> <br /> This was done in 1978, and it shows. I'm sure no one had the slightest idea that this would be reviewed in 2001 by an overly critical horror movie lover who needs to go to bed and wake up early in the morning. <P> <p> <p> <br /> <br /> Morning, but some of the attitudes here are embarrassing. </ p> <p> The teacher who tells Beller to be sexy is never meant to explain what exactly he had in mind. Nowadays, if some high school teacher said that, then, it would have been made for the TV movie alone. <br /> <br /> After Beller is raped, the rapist is still a part of his life, as warrants are issued, blah, blah, blah. There may not be a case because <br /> <br /> Beller is not a virgin and can not prove that she was raped by whom she said. Many of these problems were addressed with modern technology and policing efforts, but this film obviously knew it would have a chance to join the reform debate. Rape is an act of violence that did not go away, but the efforts today to catch the attackers are miles twenty-four years ago. The problem is the anti-rape angle that feels stuck, like a late reflection. Before that, we have a small, firm hanger that really is honest for the characterization of God. After the rape, everything changes <br /> towards the movies, not for the better. <br /> <br /> I remember Beller from the '70s and' 80s (and who could forget <br /> <br /> his revealing role in "The Betsy"), but she did nothing at all. almost ten years. This is a shame, since she was very good <br /> <br /> back then. <br /> <br /> I'll recommend "Are you in the house alone?!" based <br /> <br /> acting alone, with a reluctant nod to at least the first two thirds of the movie. If you want to relive the 70's made for high school life, this is your Tab cup. <br /> <br /> This is not rated but contains physical violence, some sexual <br /> /> violence and some adult situations.
