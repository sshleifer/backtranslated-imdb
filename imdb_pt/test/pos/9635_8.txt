OK ... the film (like the last Segal movies) once again goes beyond "knocking them down, kicking them in the crotch, shooting their faces, getting revenge on the bad guys for hurting my sister's cousin's cousin "Things Seagal was doing for a while. Geepers, Steven began to think and use his dollars to make movies with real ideas in them. Of course ... there is a lot of action in this movie, but also a bit of thought and heart. It's not an Oscar movie, but it's worth it unless the viewer is so caught up in brain violence that it hurts to think for more than a second. It's worth renting ... or two !!
