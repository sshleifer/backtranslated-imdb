I'll be brief: I usually hate movies like this poisonous ... but there's something about it that just draws me in and will not let me go. Granted, there are some big flaws in it (some of the performances are below average at best, and the dialogue is sometimes so bad, it's funny), but there are enough redemptive features to make it watchable to the end. <br /> <br /> But what are they? Well, it has a cool plot - it's not original, but it's better presented than other movies of the genre. The three main stars (Whalin, Johnson, Long) performed fairly decent performances that more than offset the lack of distinct quality of the support cast (the fat cop and trainer Quinn actually crammed me), and the script is clever and witty. Even if it 's bad in some places. <br /> <br /> The result is that this movie is so CUTE: I smile all the time and it has a place in my collection of videos just because it could cheer someone up. You really have to be some kind of boring nonsense to not like this (I dare someone to sit with this without smiling!). <br /> <br /> I recommend this if you want a simple, fun, and - above all - nice watch. You will not regret! <br /> <br /> ~ Top $ ~
