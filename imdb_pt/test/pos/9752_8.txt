I found this movie to be educational, entertaining and very moving. I was impressed when I heard how much Judge Arbor contributed during his time in Kosovo. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is highly underrated and it is good to see her again in a Canadian production. Other easily recognizable stars are Leslie Hope (24) and John Corbett (Sex in the City). <br /> <br /> Although the story of this movie may not be completely factual, it has left me wanting to learn more. on the word of Arbor. A great movie to inspire young women. <br /> <br /> I say the film is a "must see."
