I love this movie. It's the first movie Master P ever made. It's based on the story of your life. It's low budget, but it's very good. It shows how the Master p grew up in projects in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> Not only has Master P started in this movie, he was also the screenwriter and director of Moon Jones. The DVD also has The No Limit ice cream party. This movie shows how Master P comes out too badly and how he had to deal with things around him. He also has many of The No Limit Records in this movie. You must buy or rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie to watch you like rap, or you're a fan of Master P. I will not ruin this movie for you. Go get this movie as fast as you can and watch. You will like.
