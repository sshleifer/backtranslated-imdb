When I saw this movie at a festival years ago, I was very impressed and started looking for it. Nothing to do, neither in theaters, nor on DVD nor Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How can this really happen ??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and was filmed in a very unique way, the music is perfect and James Franco is hot as hell !!! <br /> <br /> Please release this masterpiece and let it have it's own life !!!!!!!!!! This is really a great movie that people should see and deserve another chance !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Edvard
