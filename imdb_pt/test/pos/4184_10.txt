I just can not understand why people are surprised that this movie does not make sense. It should never make sense. (Duh! Writers were completely wasted with Frodis at the time.) It was just to entertain and mock, and do both wonderfully. <br /> <br /> The Monkees are good actors. They would not have been hired if they were not good actors. Mike likes inexperienced and somber artists, Micky is the best of pure psycho comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was so dumb in real life. Do not tell me they can not act because they definitely can. <br /> <br /> They can also write. Of course, Jack and Bob get the exclusive credits, but in reality, they got a lot of help from the Monkees script, which was also in that room full of smoke. <br /> <br /> (It is absolutely impossible to ruin this movie) The head is highly symbolic. Among the most memorable elements is the black box, which was actually based on two things: the Monkee image the boys were tied to, and the real black box on the Screen Gems lot where the band was held between the outlets. There's a lot more symbolism in the movie that I'll let you watch and find out. <br /> <br /> The music is incredible. "Circle Sky" is one of Papa Nez's greatest songs of all time, and "Porpoise Song" and "As We Go Along" will enchant you. If you'd rather be weird then "Ditty Diego", "Can You Dig It?" And "Long Title" should be satisfying, great songs that are. And then there's "Daddy's Song," undoubtedly a tribute to Davy's days on Broadway, and the editing / color scheme for this sequel is superb. (At least to 68.) Oh, for those who do not watch a PG movie, you're missing out. Especially since Head was originally ranked R in 1968. The rank was reduced about twenty years later! <br /> <br /> Now, where was I? Ah, yes: "We were talking about beliefs, beliefs and conditioning ..."
