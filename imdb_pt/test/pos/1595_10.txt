If all the movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared, the Death in Venice would have to be that. It is a monument in the history of cinema. Much criticized for being slow, boring and obvious in stating his point (an old man discovers the beauty of a boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically), we should appreciate this movie as it is. 'Morte a Venezia' was filmed more than 30 years ago, and depicts an even more distant period in the early twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Life was slow compared to the current one. People should behave in a certain way, hiding their true emotions even from themselves. Director Visconti and Dirk Bogarde, the lead actor, managed to show admirably how the old composer Von Aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a boy. For a man like Von Aschenbach, in his time, this must have been a very powerful shock to reach an agreement. We see his inner struggle, especially on Bogarde's face, against the beautiful scenery of Venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music composed by Gustav Mahler. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, there is no denying it. . No special effects, car chases or fights to keep the public stuck to their seats. There are no perverted sex scenes either; the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen looks from afar and an occasional smile. <br /> <br /> So, basically, nothing happens in this movie? Not if you want your senses to be hit like a drum base. If you want them to be played like the strings of a violin at a romantic concert, this is the movie to do this.
