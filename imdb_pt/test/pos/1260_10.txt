What a movie Quite possibly the best I've ever seen, Direction, Production, soundtrack and cinematography, absolute, wonderful. The acting is also great, and the Man / Robot scenes have to be seen to be considered. I can not recommend this movie enough. Put it on video now, turn off the lights and enjoy.
