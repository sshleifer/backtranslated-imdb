Every time I watch this program, I just want to turn it off and curse the manufacturers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogues, or monologues, as everyone talks nonstop about nothing, are becoming so boring. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly endless rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, noodles with meatballs, maybe) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into total war. And these were only a few seconds or more. <br /> <br /> So, it always seems, many lines, with absolutely zero content. The scripts they use should be huge. <br /> <br /> But sometimes something happens. The babble stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent and emotional moments. For example, this week was Lorelai's collapse in the real estate agency. I just thought it was the best TV piece I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Almost makes it all worth it.
