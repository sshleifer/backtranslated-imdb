Over the years, I seemed to have lost this picture of Ronald Reagan, and because of his recent move to the big screen in the sky, it was shown on TV recently. This is a great low budget black and white movie from the late 1930s, however, it is very interesting to see how criminals used their talents to steal money from insurance companies with false claims during that specific time period. I was struck by the role that Ronald Reagan (Eric Gregg), "The Killer's", 64, played in this photo, along with a great veteran movie star, Sheila Bromley (Nona Gregg), "Nightmare Circus", 73, which was a great supporting actor, was a great film that showed Ronald Reagan as a very young man looking for the stars in his Hollywood career at the time.
