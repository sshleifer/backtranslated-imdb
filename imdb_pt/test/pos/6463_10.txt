I cry in a lot of movies. Call me sentimental. Call me one of those spectators who always likes to see a happy ending. This movie, despite having a sad ending, was great! Of all the actors I'd like to have lunch with, it would be Sidney Poitier. His performance, along with John Cassavetes and Jack Warden (of 12 Angry Men fame) is stellar. His character, who befriends a man on the run (Cassavetes) and helps him in every possible way is incredible. <br /> <br /> This is another of those forgotten noirs made during the end of the era of noirism. It is well done, has a superb cast, extremely talented acting and great cinematography. It's a movie worth watching over and over again. I highly recommend this! This is just another great film made by Mr. Poitier and should be sold on DVD. Even though I have cried, praise to this great art!
