'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It's nothing like the book, which can disappoint your fervent followers. However, seen by itself, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting is also not bad !! Nicolas Cage was brilliant - so different from his usual characters of action heroes. Penelope Cross is superb and really holds the movie together. I think this movie has to be judged as an individual project - not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up the screenplay for the film, so the film is an interpretation of the director, John Maddon. Go and watch this movie with an open mind - you will love it; because underneath is the moving story of love and war.
