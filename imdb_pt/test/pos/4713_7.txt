A powerful film that regained much of its significance in the second half of 2007, after the new desperate movements of the Burmese people against their tyrants. I felt a complex mix of feelings about people there, something like compassion and admiration at the same time along with a bit of anger because I feel that no one, neither the countries of the world, nor themselves, is doing anything effective to end with this shame. I think those feelings have become directly from the movie, and that they were made when it was made, so it's a hit movie. The desire for peace, the search for enlightenment, respect for life sometimes leads to subjugation. In fact, it is the Burmese Buddhist culture that left the doors open for its dictators. But how can you feel angry with these poor people?
