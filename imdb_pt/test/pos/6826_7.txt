I can not understand the need to jump back and forth to set the scene and fill the plot. To show that someone has a skill before using it, I believe, offends our intelligence. It's starting to look a little artificial, and like they're compensating for being so vague in the first three grades. A little disappointing in this episode. In addition, using the peculiarities of the past, such as Locke's ability to know when a storm is ending, is downright insulting ... we should do ooh and arr, or laugh at the softest side of Locke ? <br /> <br /> This episode was all over the place.
