What some Hollywood films try and virtually never do, creating metaphysical connections between people (without becoming unrealistic), perfectly manages this beautiful film (resembling a bit of the same director's wonderful 'La Vie Vie de Veronique'). and with the same beautiful actress). This is a REAL movie, which changes the perspective of life a little - clever and beautiful story, masterfully directed, excellent lead actors, masterful cinematography. I just saw the movie the third or fourth time, and I still think it's one of the best I've ever seen. And if you're not happy with the end of 'White' - 'Red' puts a happy ending throughout the trilogy.
