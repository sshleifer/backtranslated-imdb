This is probably the best cinematic representation of life in a Manhattan advertising agency: the pressure to introduce itself; demands from clients and agencies; the parties; creativity; the money; the cold surface with powerful corporate trends. <br /> <br /> Shoot fatherhood for Dustin Hoffman. <br /> <br /> The film is textured and deep. He follows his inner relationship as he tries to understand and live with what is happening; her relationship with Meryl Streep (and her friend, who becomes her friend), and her relationship with her son. <br /> <br /> While Meryl Streep was great, did she set the record for less time on the screen to win an Oscar? She sure can deliver when she is, though.
