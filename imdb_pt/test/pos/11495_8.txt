I get the feeling that Lisa Krueger is easy to ignore. I personally found her first film, Manny and Lo, from 1996, to be a wonderfully detailed character study and the performances were uniformly wonderful (with special credit for Mary Kay Place). The film played for a week or two in the major urban centers and disappeared. One or two critics really liked it, but many considered it insignificant. Krueger's second film, Committed, was released this year (2000) (after almost two years of delays) and also disappeared. And once again the critics dismissed the film as something light and set the film aside, at the most complimenting Heather Graham's presence, but rarely his acting ability. And again, to me, Committed is a solid success. I feel as if Krueger has a genuine voice and a personal visual style and these are traits that should not be so easily ignored simply because she works on a very contained advertisement. <br /> <br /> The title has several meanings. , but mostly refers to Joline's (Graham) refusal to let her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) fall and leave her. She follows him from New York to El Paso and becomes one of the most attractive pursuers in recent film history. His respect for his marriage vows led her to Mexican mysticism and self-discovery. And yes, the plot is simply simple and therefore so easy to ignore. <br /> <br /> Joline, of course, is the crying voice of a generation whose parents divorced at a rate close to 50%. And to me, your personal revolution against unfulfilled promises and a legacy of falsehood is quite intelligent and powerful. Confident in believing that people just do not have enough faith in each other, Joline inevitably has to discover that their beliefs are not in sync with those of society at large. Several of her comments referred to her character as one-dimensional and I'm afraid it's a simplistic reading of the film. Or maybe even a wrong reading. If Joline were just an innocent, she would not be interesting at all. It is the fact that she understands the world and refuses to play by the rules of the "normal" that make it so interesting. Sociologically, she is a complete deviant. <br /> <br /> Krueger sometimes falls into moments of cute dialogue and his direction of this movie has an excessive reliance on two shots of clouds moving on the horizon of El Paso. However, his mistakes are quite rare and in this film, as in Manny and Lo, are the performances that lead the day. Graham was never better because she never had a character perfectly suited to her as Joline. For the first time in his career, Graham seems comfortable in playing an adult, even in a lightly trapped development. She carries the film perfectly. Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck (as Joline's brother) have several good times, such as Alfonso Arau, Mexican Mystic, and Mark Ruffalo and T-Bo, the slightly psychotic truck driver. As in Manny and Lo, the characters are part of their environments, well-detailed fully organic creations. These characters can sometimes seem meaningless, but make sense in their context. Even Goran Visnjic, as an artist attached to Joline's devotion, fits in some strange way, even though his personality is never discussed. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a film that gains depth looking back. Another commentator spoke about stereotyped Mexican portraits. And again I'm tempted to call this a misreading. Joline is looking for self-justification. She knows her engagement is out of control, but she is looking for any spiritual path that can help her understand herself. Arau's character understands that most people do not believe in him and he develops his own faith when he sees a woman who respects him. <br /> <br /> I think I can understand how this movie could be viewed as understated, I would simply disagree. It's consistently funny, often hilarious, and all the characters exude a warmth that is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I am giving this one a 7.5 / 10 and when I enter the vote here, this will go up to a 8.
