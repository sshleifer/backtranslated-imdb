DEATH WISH 3's Paul Kersey is a long way from Paul Kersey's original movie. If you remember the 1974 movie, then you will remember that Kersey was a "Conchie" during the Korean War and that he was physically sick after committing his first execution. Ten years later, Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to deal with anti-tank weapons in his spare time. But I'm going to ignore that gaffe, because DW3 is the best of the sequences, poor quality bags are shot dead, burned alive, teeth crushed and thrown to death by middle-aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes. Yes, I know the members of the gang are multiethnic and so they deserve some credit, but even if they are not racists, they are still killing scum that deserves everything they earn from Kersey and the innocent citizens. Who needs Mayor Rudy when you have Paul Kersey, an anti-tank rocket and a bunch of retirees to reclaim the streets of the criminals. Paul Kersey I salute you sir
