All the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a thriller memorable for years to come. You have the stellar cast - Michael Douglas in an unconventional 'free spirit' role that practically launched his film career, Fonda playing his typical straightforward woman doing his part for women's lib, and Jack Lemmon as confident as ever showing us one man with a crisis of confidence. Give them a hot topic about big business being duplicated, and that's encouraging for a kick-start, but having life imitating art soon after is a marketing man's dream. <br /> <br /> The script is impressively tense, intelligent. but mercifully keeping the jargon to a minimum, and there is a genuine sense of sustained tension brought into play by the director as our three protagonists rush to beat the clock. If you like 'blow whistles' dramas, then this is not as good as 'The Insider', but the whole thing is more than nervous enough.
