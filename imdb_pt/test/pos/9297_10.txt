The Tracker War at All is a weekly show of guys who brought you CNNNN and the hunter decides where every week the 5 Hunters and Firth break the issues we did not know were important. <br /> <br /> Show goes beyond the mere satirization of politics and television for not being afraid to take the mickey out of anyone, be it a counter-girl on the subway or even the Prime Minister of Australia and although this may be familiar on American television. has never been so well executed. <br /> <br /> The Hunter's War in Everything is the most intelligent, fun and global program on Australian television and, if you have not seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to give it a watch.
