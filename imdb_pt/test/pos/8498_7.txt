If someone had poked me about 15 minutes into 'Ray' and asked what I thought of Jamie Foxx in the title role, it would be time for an empty look. After all, what is this (fictional) person talking about? That was not Jamie Foxx on the big screen. That was Ray Charles. This is one of the best performances of anyone in recent years. Like the soundtrack, Jamie like Ray is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The blind Soul Genius (who took a revolutionary step mixing gospel with R & B) died during production. The movie about your troubled life is good, not great. Taylor Hackford's direction and James L. White's script follow the well-used biochemical sketch. The super-talented young man faces adversity, attains greatness at the same time as he self-destructs, then picks himself up from the gutter for a happy ending. The film shows the flaws of Charles (heroin abuse, chronic womanizer, persistent father-bastard) even though he sucks you with his beautiful music. <br /> <br /> Kerry Washington and Regina King play the leading women in Ray's life, one his suffering wife and the other his longtime lover. Both actresses combine with Foxx. What brings him to a different level, however, is his profound understanding and strange imitation of the great musician. The entire cast is effective, especially Sharon Warren as his stubborn mother and Curtis Armstrong as a music executive. Hackford's stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and - even better - more leading roles. <br /> <br /> I was not a fan of Ray Charles before 'Ray'. Apparently, the film left out a lot (as do all biopics), but this image works both as a pleasure for all old fashioned and a dark investigation of a brilliant / troubled man. For those who mourn that Foxx does not sing (as if that somehow diminished their performance), take a walk. No mere actor can sing like Mr. Charles anyway. You can not have everything. What the talented star does in this image is as close to "everything," as we shall probably see for a time.
