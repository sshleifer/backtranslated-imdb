I was referred to this movie by a friend. I had never heard of it, but I thought I had Christopher Lampbert, so I rented it and discovered it was not Christopher Lampbert, but Thomas Jane, which was great in this movie. I love that almost the whole movie is set in this suburban house. The characters were great and the script was awesome, I really wanted Skip Woods to write and direct another movie. In my book Thursday is the flawless tale of this guy trying to do the wife and child thing after a grim past, but then his old drug dealer companion pops up and becomes quite Thursday. This is one of my favorite movies and shows real potential in Thomas Jane. But this movie is very rare, but I found it in some Hollywood videos on VHS. So dust off the old VCR and pop in the farm because it gets the seal of approval from Pee Wee
