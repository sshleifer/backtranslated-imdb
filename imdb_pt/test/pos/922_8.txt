In my analysis of "Trois couleurs: Blanc", I wrote that his tone is much clearer than the tone of "Trois couleurs: Bleu". I think it's the same with this movie. This time it is not because of a tragic element of comedy but much more because of the main character Valentine. Although her boyfriend is living overseas and is ridiculously jealous, she runs her life lightly and optimistically, it seems to me that she may be the image of Kieslowski to a carefree youth. The opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, a grumpy old man, who experiences a great loneliness. In my opinion, Valentine and the judge are very similar to each other, the judge is much older and went through many other disappointments. They share a different kind of naivety, and both discover that they can learn a lot from each other. Finally, I would like to emphasize the performance of Ir√®ne Jacob, she completes the incredible female contributions to the trilogy "Three Colors".
