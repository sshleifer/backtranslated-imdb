Though friendly and entertaining to gay audiences, Frank Oz's "In and Out," about a gay teacher who was exposed on national television by a former student, has been sanitized and deodorized to appeal to larger, more lucrative viewers. Patronized "The Bird Cage". Although the audience has probably been patted on the back for being tolerant and liberal enough to see the film, the film revolves around Howard Brackett, of Kevin Kline, who is a grossly stereotyped gay man. The film claims that the trend of dancing to disco music, reveling in Barbra Streisand's films and dressing well indicates someone's sexual orientation. As "Queer Eye", the film actually gives an indirect slap on heterosexual men and stereotypes as sloppy, obscure and lacking in taste and culture. OK, so "In and Out" is just a comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the center of the mood of the movie there is a character a bit pathetic. Howard is middle-aged, deeply incarcerated or self-denied, and evidently never had a sex life. A three-year commitment to a teacher at the school where he works is described as a series of sunsets, long conversations and watching "Funny Lady." Fortunately, Joan Cusack plays Howard's intention, Emily Montgomery, and she steals the show all over. Most of the funniest moments in the movie belong to her, although Kline's attempts to resist dancing during an instructional tape about macho behavior are hilarious. He is a talented physicist, but the film gives him only a few moments to shine. Matt Dillon also stands out as the student turned actor, and the clip of his Oscar-nominated movie about a gay soldier is hysterical. However, despite the gay theme of the film, there is no boy-man-boy romance and only one man-to-man kiss, and this kiss is as erotic as that between Michael and Fredo Corleone in "Godfather II." Although well intentioned, "In and Out" does not address the injustices and prejudices it illustrates. Howard is fired from his teaching job despite his excellent performance and credentials, but little outrage is expressed. Most of the characters are more upset with the canceled marriage than with Howard's self-realization, which seems to happen overnight, and his abrupt and unfair dismissal. Not surprisingly, Howard's parents, represented by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley, and their students stand up to support him. However, the sugary ending is as embarrassing to the audience as it was evidently to Howard Brackett in the film. The movie would have been more invigorating if it had revolved around a gay man who dressed like a goofy, soccer fan, ran a truck, heard country music and lived in fast food. Despite some good performances and funny situations, "In and Out" perpetuates stereotypes and, whether positive or negative, stereotypes should be consigned to the social history bin.
