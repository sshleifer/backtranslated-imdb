Wow, what can I say that was a good movie, very different from all the boring finials we see lately, the only thing I would like to see is a bit more of an ending like when Jane left her husband? I think she was going to Serena she fell in love with her, not just for her, but for all she is, I wanted the producers to really show this kind of ending instead of letting their imagination run out, I really I hate it when they do it. The aerial acts seemed fun, but I think you'd have to be light and muscly, I'd like to see more movies like this, maybe you could do a sequel to Jane and Serena. If I had been in Jane's place, I would have gone to the girl as well she was attractive.
