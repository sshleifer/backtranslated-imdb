I went to see it thinking that it would be a great comedy and a return to Robin Williams, but when I saw it I realized I had been fooled by the advertisers, as this is more drama than comedy, although I have some good laughs at it. It looked like I was watching two movies. One was a fun joke with Robin Williams who should have been the whole basin for the movie anyway, but you'll also get a techno thriller with political anguish in between. I really do not know how to rate this movie. But I can say it was good and I laughed, not as much as I expected, but at least Williams is back in the right direction. Watch this, but know before you go it's not all comedy and it's a little intense.
