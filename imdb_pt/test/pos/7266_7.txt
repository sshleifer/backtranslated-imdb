A very watchable film, and it was eagerly awaited by having seen the trailer several times. <br /> <br /> Everything seems superb, from the ridiculous efforts of the upper class just distanced itself from mediocrity, to the low-class slag just trying to keep their heads above the dirt, the film captures the spirit of the 18th century brightly. <br /> <br /> Jonny Lee Miller plays Maclean extremely well, although the part does not stretch him exactly and Robert Carlyle seems a little wasted on Miller's caster colleague Plunkett. <br /> <br /> The real star of the show was undoubtedly Ken Stott, who plays Mr Chance (a kind of 1740 police chief) with a bad joy that put him out of the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> A great movie, and anyone who likes the color and style of the Peter Greenaway movies will love the appearance of it, although the thinness of the plot becomes apparent before the 2 hours is up. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
