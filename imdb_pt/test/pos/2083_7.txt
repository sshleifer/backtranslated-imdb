Between the ages of 30 and 51, when he died of a brain tumor, Zachary Scott made 70 films. It was introduced in 1944 in 'The Mask of Dimitrios', by Jean Negulesco, where he played Dimitrios. The following year, 1945, he made three films, of which this is one. He is best remembered by the filmmakers as the star of Jean Renoir's "The Southerner," one of the 1945 films in which he played a nice role. However, he often played scary characters, and in this movie he is a sociopathic killer of women for money. So, what happens here? He lives in a house with three women, so be careful! Faye Emerson, who also appeared in 'Dimitrios', plays the eldest of two daughters in the house. She falls in love with Scott and they become secretly engaged. Then her younger sister "cute little child" (played effectively by Mona Freeman, who looks like Bonita Granville in both appearance and behavior) returns from boarding school and casually reveals in conversation with Scott that he inherited a good amount. on her, instead, with all the torrid jealousy seething in the house that it was about to awaken. Things get tense and then tense. Meanwhile, assassination plans are advancing in the mind of the calculating Scott. But it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions. He is also being sought as a result of his last death, with which the film was opened, so we can know his story. James Wong Howe gives effective noirish cinematography to this tale, which was directed by Frenchman Robert Florey, who moved to Hollywood some time before. The film is an effective psychopath-at-home mystery that can cause some wear and tear of the edges of some seats, for those of such a slope.
