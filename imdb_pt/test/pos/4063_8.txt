"Showtime" is somewhere north of what some critics have said, and somewhat southerly than I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro joining in for a comedy. Overall, it was very good! As the "real life" crime or cops go - and conspire, for that matter - it's pretty illogical, but DUH --- this is a comedy. Moreover, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and exploding skyscrapers were present, but less important than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and exaggerated. Leaving aside the sensitivities of September 11, for me, all of this pyro-techno hyper-effect material was getting very old in recent years. He looked like an idiot replacement for characterization, history, and surrounding emotions. I hope the smallest amount on "Showtime" is an indicator of a trend in Hollywood. A downward trend, less use of the fool, less use of the building exploding. <br /> <br /> Di Niro and Murphy are two of my favorites. His presence on the screen and charisma - and even the depth of his character - have been "a joy to contemplate" for many years. This can not be ruled out here - they are engaging and entertaining and engaging actors in this movie. I can not put my finger on this, but maybe the explosions, the excessive FX, and all this has diminished the final product ??? Maybe, or maybe it was something else, or a combination of factors that gives the feeling that the film did not reach its greatest potential. Whatever it was, "Showtime" was fun - I'll probably buy the DVD when I leave - but I had the vibe of it, though, it was not all that it could have been. At least not everything I expected. Very good movie, but not a great movie. I gave it 8 out of 10.
