Here's another fun action-thriller from Clint Eastwood. I'm not particularly fan of him, but I have to give him: he knows how to make fun movies. This is another example. It did not hurt, too, to have John Malkovich as his co-star. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays a killer and is fascinating to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the great dialogue he received. He also has an interesting voice. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo is quite discreet (for her), but that's okay and Eastwood plays the usual role of lone cop, not appreciated by his superiors, but showing them all up. In the end. I think he could not stop playing the "Dirty Harry" type numbers, but he played them well. <br /> <br /> There were some negatives in this movie, however, namely: credibility in parts, as there was a couple. From time to time, if this were real, the killer would have eliminated Eastwood. The climactic scene, in particular, had many holes in it. There were also many abuses of the name of God in vain here. <br /> <br /> On the whole, however, this is good, escapist.
