I feel like this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who really care about each other. They may have flaws, but bitterness and criticism have no place with these girls. Try to find this on TV or in the usual movies. It's a breath of fresh air to see girls being feminine - wearing gorgeous dresses and women's shoes. Contrast this with the clothing in the shops today, ie faded and faded jeans and jackets, etc. The plot has an evil edge going on, but that's what makes it more realistic and interesting. I know it's lively but it still gives the feeling that families can get together and get away with it. I would recommend this movie for boys and girls.
