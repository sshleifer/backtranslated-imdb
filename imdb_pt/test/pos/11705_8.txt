This is the first feature film by Australian comedian Mick Molloy. Mick wrote the film with his brother Richard with the help of John Clarke, another comedian and actor. Mick & John also has leading roles along with several other iconic Australian actors - Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson et al. The basic premise of the film is that slimy Jack Simpson (Mick Molloy) has become a member of the Lawn Bowls Club for the sole purpose of getting a free parking close to his work. The club is in financial difficulties and asks Jack for help. John Clarke plays the arch-nemesis arch-nemesis - he is trying to get the club and turn it into a "Poker Machine Slum" Jack and the other members of the club come together to try to save the club with many funny twists and Jacks eventual redemption . This is a little smart movie. It's way above the usual mood of Mick Molloys gutter. It is very well written and well represented. The older Australian actors are brilliant (Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Maughan and ors). The film snakes over time, but at the rhythm of the neck, but this adds to the charm of the film. There is coarse language of low level.
