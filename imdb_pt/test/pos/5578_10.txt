I heard about this series in 2001, that a friend of mine was recording television every week. I never bothered to watch, although I got acquainted with the series through the magazine that I looked at from time to time in bookstores. I recently bought the series one on DVD and got hooked on this fascinating and original series. Initially, the characters seem unusual, but it is impressive how quickly they grow and develop into a united force. As they begin to care for each other, it becomes easy to take care of what happens to them (keeping in mind that this is just a TV series and they are fictitious). <br /> <br /> However, it is not the PC world of Star Trek and so while each character shows a good feature, each has its own flaws and demons that they must deal with. Individual story lines mixed with a general arc of history make this one of the most complex and rewarding television experiences I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. I absolutely enjoy seeing each of the characters interacting with each other. <br /> <br /> This strange new world presented to us is brilliantly portrayed through the eyes of astronaut John Crichton and how he learns and adapts to being on the other side of the galaxy, strange alien creatures, different cultures being hunted by a character who wants him dead and being treated as inferior by his comrades, we can easily relate to what he must be feeling. As he becomes accustomed to the environment, the spectators and their compassionate, stubborn and courageous character are a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> I watched only seven episodes of the first season of Farscape and I look forward to continuing. through seasons two and four and the mini-series. Maybe one day we can all enjoy a fifth season. Highly recommended viewing and worth setting aside time to watch. Buy and enjoy! 10/10.
