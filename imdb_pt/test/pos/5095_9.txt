Great acting is best rewarded by combining with a melodramatic script that truly elevates the human spirit. For all those lackeys who toil every day, have courage! your patience is virtuous. Your tolerance and decency will evidence in ways you will never anticipate. This is your great story. I do not believe you can watch until the end without a little moisture in that stiffened eye. Or you can? For me, it would not be like this ... the story is relentless! The idealist denied due. Is anyone going to talk? Ah! but you will need to see the show on your own! notice the schoolmaster in his prime, without the warning and the peerage that the observer would surely expect. And why does he continue like this? Yes! you should watch O'Toole's performance by yourself! I can only wish that it is still "printed" to buy, then introduce my friends as my evidence of respect for their faithful lives.
