A great combination: - Chabat's humor - Uderzo / Goscinny's world and characters - Christian Clavier's limited presence <br /> <br /> The original comics were great - one of the best of a great series - and Alain Chabat, a the most funny member of the famous French group Les Nuls, was able to film, replicate and complement the great work done by goscinny and uderzo, deftly reinforcing the story, giving Djamel Debouze his best role (in short, a little far from his usual repeatable part), bringing together a lot of great actors (Gerard darmon is wonderful, as always, Chabat himself is a great Cesar). <br /> <br /> In addition, despite being forced to continue with Christian Clavier as Asterix, Chabat skillfully honed his role in the film to highlight Darmon and Debouze ... which is always a good idea! <br /> <br /> Great atmosphere, great scenery, great director, great actors, great humor, beautiful Cleopatra ... This movie would have deserved a 10 if Clavier had not bee involved.
