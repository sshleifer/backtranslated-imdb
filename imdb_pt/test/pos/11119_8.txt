The fame was released in the US a year before I was born; I was too young to remember the original version of Fame - and I still heard and read many things about it. Like the fact that it spawned a TV series and that its soundtrack was led by Irene Cara, Giogio Moroder hit, 'Fame'. <br /> <br /> Fame was undoubtedly the first of its kind to portray and show the world of performing arts in the form of a feature film. The lives, the struggles, the difficulties that the students and some of the teachers suffered were under the eyes of the spectators. The performances were great, but one that caught my eye in particular was Gene Anthony Ray, who played the nuisance still promising Leroy. Annoyed, frustrated, and at first rude, his character later became less irritated, frustrated, and more committed to his studies-not just performance practice, but theory as well. Irene Cara was good as Coco - the scene with her pulling off her blouse while some perverted filmmakers filmed her were quite uncomfortable to watch - as was Paul McCrane for his incredible portrayal of a vulnerable but closed-up homosexual trying to cope with life and enrolled at a performing arts school in New York, after he was expelled from the military when he said he was gay. Ralph played by Barry Miller was interesting, but sometimes his character irritated my nerves. <br /> <br /> The choreography was excellent, there were a few good dance numbers involved and the 'hot lunch' scene in the cafeteria was worth watching. Another scene that was great was when the song 'Fame' was played and all the children started to run to the streets of New York and danced madly and without a care in the world. It was a street jam like no other. <br /> <br /> The only star who really benefited from this in the long run was Debbie Allen - she later became a producer, director and protagonist - although she worked mostly behind the scenes of shows like Everybody Hates Chris and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Paul McCrane later went on to star opposite Peter Weller in the movie "Robocop," where he portrayed a villain and ER as the critical and detestable Roman Doctor. <br /> <br /> British director Alan Parker filmed this very well. he allowed the artists to dance, to act, to sing to the content of their hearts without wanting to interfere and affect their styles. <br /> <br /> Throughout the duration of the film, we see the various stages that students encounter during their sessions. years - from her first year auditions to graduation at the New York High School for the Arts. <br /> <br /> Fame is one of those movies that caters or is geared towards a specific audience that is not necessarily the mainstream mainstream movie loving community, it's definitely not for everyone. I for one liked because I have an interest in the arts, not technically in terms of being an artist because I am not one, but as someone who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be chrooted through hard work, commitment and passion for what you do with your talents. So if you are an aspiring dancer, actor or just someone who is creative, you might be interested in a movie like this - but if the events in Fame are similar to what is in a performing arts school / school in reality life, then this is completely different. <br /> <br /> The 2009 remake of this movie was released recently, and frankly, it practically pales in comparison. <br /> <br /> As for the original Fame, almost 30 years later, although yes, it's a bit old-fashioned, but it's still a great movie. <br /> <br /> It's not an absolute classic, but as a cult classic of the '80s, in tune with other blockbusters of the 80s, such as Footloose and Flashdance, Fame hits the spot. Is not it a coincidence that all these dance films begin with the letter 'F'? <br /> <br /> Courageous, moving and intriguing, this is worth watching.
