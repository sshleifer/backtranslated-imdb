Very good political thriller about the aftermath of terrorism and the use of political torture to achieve its goals in freeing the terrorists. <br /> <br /> History is intertwined, where two families are adversely affected by terrorist events. /> <br /> This is one of the best roles of Meryl Streep in years. She plays a cold, calculating, and clever CIA director who allows these things to continue. She is out of George Bush-Dick Cheney's school to deal with the war on terror. If her part had been enlarged, Miss Streep would certainly have been awarded at the time of the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is our hero. A CIA agent who really can not stand what's going on. <br /> <br /> We have a terrorist who really has a heart and this costs him the life in this well-directed and exquisitely paced movie. Alan Arkin appears briefly on the side of a conniving senator. Arkin seems to improve with age.
