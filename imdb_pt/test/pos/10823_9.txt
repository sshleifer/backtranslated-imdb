One comment said it was not a comedy ... Bug! It was a delightful comedy from a period of history that does not lend itself easily to this genre. Very busy ... and active movie from start to finish. Often the shots from the train window, or car, were simply beautiful. A fun way to spend a few hours in a theater. All French historical figures such as Charles de Gaulle and Petain and some of the people involved in the French Resistance have been included in the script, which may make those unfamiliar with the collapse of France under the German invasion want to search. The characters were engaging and the actors portraying them were excellent. Recommend, 9 out of 10.
