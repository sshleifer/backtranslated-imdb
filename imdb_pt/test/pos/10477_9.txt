This movie is almost unknown, but it's very good. In a solitary Danish town, two older sisters live remembering a distant young man, when, due to a strict puritanical education, they had to reject happiness. Lonely, then, life in dignified austerity, until Babette arrives, who flies from Paris, frightened by the horror of war. In a short time, she will be able to transform the goodness and love she received when she arrived. A good lottery prize allows her to organize a grand banquet, following the best rules of French gastronomy. All the neighborhoods are invited (all fanatically Puritan). They accept, but they do not show any trace of pleasure or pleasure, for it would be a sin. However, the seductive force of the delicious meal they eat, they become seduced by the sensuality of French gastronomy. The banquet ends in a very felt, though silent happiness. Love among humans has awakened. The miracle of the rise of human goodness, due to the pleasure of meaning, began. The movie is surprisingly good, but not to everyone's taste. For most of the movie, nothing happens, everything is so quiet and so peaceful, that for many minutes, you can only see the life of the inhabitants of the city. But as the film develops, it becomes more precious, when Babette wins the lottery prize (after 30 minutes of film), the show begins. The author is able, with a perfect direction, to show us how Babette prepares the banquet, how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful (Love), all said in a quiet and delicious way, with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting . . Then, as the banquet passes, the quality in showing us how the mood of every eater changes because of the meal, with just the first shots, with stunningly filmed scenes one after another is simply amazing. In addition, the touch with the colors and the photography is also superb, almost all the scenes of the film are like a picture, so the work is involved there. If you are able to admire good cinema and are able to realize that sometimes the way to say something rather than what is said is more important, this is your movie. If you enjoy good food and love good food, you'll probably be entertained, since most of the film's feelings will be familiar to you. A totally deserved Oscar. The only problem is the slowness in creating the story, but I can forgive it (I hope everyone also)
