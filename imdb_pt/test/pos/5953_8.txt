Jean Dujardin picks up Connery's mannerisms: adjust cufflinks when entering a club, while all the women turn to admire him, the carefree straightening and the smoothing of the tie, the arrogant and steel gait. It's strange, and you realize how much Bond in the sixties was the creation of Connery and not the character of Ian Fleming. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is a tribute to these early films, the film takes off From Russia With Love and Thunderball mainly. The main joke is how machismo is chauvinistic, not just in terms of sexism, but also of nationalism and colonialism, and how he looks at his noses when he is sent to Egypt. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect - about 20 minutes looks like a joke movie and bits of it resemble one of the parodies of the day, of which there were many. The Intelligence Men of Morecambe and Wise had suspected men in Fact, following their heroes as well, and this is coming back a little. Unlike Sellers' Clouseau or Baron Cohen of Borat, Dujardin does not give his character that layer of realism or genuine pathos - he is too busy perfecting his Connery mannerisms. It does not do enough credits or a big song, and there is not a funny or serious villain, like Mike Myers' Dr Evil or Ricardo Montalban's Naked Gun, for the hero to face. <br /> <br /> But the scene where the OSS117 wakes up in Cairo one morning made me laugh out loud at the empty three-room cinema, and the whole thing looks wonderful, and you never get a chance to see Operation Kid Brother on the screen, and women are ace crumpet, very warm. It's a Bond parody without falling into the mad scientist / Ken Adam sets or the funny routine gadget. It is recommended completely.
