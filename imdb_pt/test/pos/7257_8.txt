I tend to like historical (period) films and get new costume ideas for my historical group, and a friend recommended this to me. I like Johnny Lee Miller as an actor, so I thought it was worth it, and I was definitely rewarded !! His portrait as a member of the English noble class was far more precise than I have seen in the past. The comedy aspect left my sides aching, the costumes were not horrible and, historically, I did not shudder too much. I also noticed the fact that England did not have a proper sewer system until much later, but anyone who did not devote to the minutae of England's past would not notice or care. Absolutely worth seeing. I recommend this movie.
