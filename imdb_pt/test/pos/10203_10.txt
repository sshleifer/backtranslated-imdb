Here is another of the 1940s westerns that I watch whenever it comes on the TCM or FMC, because although it may be historically flawed, it's extremely entertaining and well represented, plus Randolph Scott, my favorite actor second only to Gary Cooper-Well, OK, fourth behind COOP, Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck. But the film itself, for me anyway, is reasonably historically accurate and as I said before, well acted and "flows" very well - I'll bet I've seen it 50 or 60 times and I take advantage of each view more than the previous one. I have this on TCM tape, but I would buy it in a minute, if it has already come out on DVD. See if you have not- I guarantee you'll like it!
