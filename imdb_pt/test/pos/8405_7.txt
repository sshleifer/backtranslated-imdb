Overall, I enjoyed the movie Scarlett. I'm a big fan of Gone with the Wind. I read the book and saw the classic movie many times. I even have a small collection of Scarlett O'Hara ornaments and stuff. I must admit that Gone with the Wind is my favorite book and movie of all time. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable are notable actors and two of my favorites. Unfortunately, I could not read the book Scarlett, but I was excited to see the movie. Truth be told, the movie is nowhere near the caliber of Gone with the Wind and neither the actors. However, Joan Whalley Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were pleasant actors in the roles and often Joan sounded like Vivian Leigh in her interpretation of Scarlett. Dalton also portrayed Rhett well sometimes. It took me some time to get used to the different actors, but overall I really liked being a Gone with the Wind fan as I am. A big disappointment was that Joan had no green eyes and Scarlett O'Hara and Vivian Leigh as well. I also found Lord Fenton absolutely shocking and I did not like his character. If you are a fan of Gone with the Wind and / or enjoy romantic stories, watch the movie Scarlett. However, do not expect it to be noticeable like Gone with the Wind. It's far from that, although it's interesting with the new characters and so on. I'm glad it's not a remake and some of the happenings of the story was what I imagined the continuation of the love story of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. If you did not see it today, get tomorrow, then tomorrow is another day. :)
