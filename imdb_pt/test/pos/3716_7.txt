Pierre Jolivet plays a character of Don Quixote, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He relies on his homemade armaments - helmets, sleeves and spears - made of shells, seat cushions and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode in Rocicante, "The Man" mounts his contraption (literally) transcending the lives lost in the cruel and degrading world - hovering over the earth, far from the situation of modern man. Both characters travel in search of adventure in an effort to correct the world's mistakes. Both characters are knights guardians of unknown values ​​to most of the other characters in the story. <br /> <br /> Contrary to Cervantes' tale, in this film we identify more directly with the anachronistic ideals of the main character. We can only compare this alien and forbidding landscape to the exuberant and beautiful world in which we live. Our frame of reference is the fantasy realm that perhaps the lone knight will remember. Our vision is one that expects the main character to triumph, win, change his world (for the better) back to a world of abundance that no longer exists. <br /> <br /> We look at this film and see a true knight among a world of humans as animals. Don Quixote considered himself a true knight among the animals. With the story of Cervantes, we can only see the dreamer without really understanding the extent of his anachronistic shift. In the tale of Besson and Jolivet, we see the new world from the eyes of Don Quixote, because we value the same visions and ideals as the main character of the crusades.
