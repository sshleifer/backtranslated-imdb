Just being released from a six-month drug rehab program and having served his time to hand out letters in illegal card games, Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) has high hopes of going clean and finding a new life as a big band drummer . However, upon returning to his old Chicago neighborhood, he soon finds growing pressure from those around him, including his wheelchair-bound wife, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), to return to the old "Dealer" lifestyle that made money for the first time. he started on the path of self-destruction being addicted to heroin. <br /> <br /> It is very rare that a movie has so many great performances like this. Frank Sinatra is superb as Frankie Machine, and realistically portrays the symptoms of a drug addict going through a certainly better withdrawal than anyone else had ever done before him. Sinatra seems to possess a keen understanding and awareness of his character here and expresses the constant battle for control over his own life that is always happening inside the heart of the man who is Frankie Machine. Parker as his crippled wife Zosch wants to own Frankie forever so that he "negotiates" to make good money so as to take care of her and pay his ever-increasing medical bills. She seems terrified of anything she considers a threat to her control over him, such as the freedom a drummer's life can offer, or anything that can change the status quo between them. Watcher Molly (Kim Novak), a girl who lives in the same building and seems to possess real and strong genuine feelings for Frankie, having no desire to control him, but only to help him prove the best thing Frankie has for him in the world, if he can just stand straight enough long enough to wake up and realize it. Darren McGavin as heroin dealer Louie, however, is always there, waiting in the wings, just the right buttons to push, just to say, to make an ex-addict go back to that old habit, profitable for Louie but deadly for the addict. <br /> <br /> The scenery also seems to have a life of its own, constantly dark, sandy, decadent and full of crimes, with things positive enough to wait for in life, a place where it is very easy to escape through a bottle or drugs, a quick "fix" that really does not serve anything but only works to keep one in the dark away from the light of day and all the bright prospects that the world may have to offer. It's a cool touch that when Frankie is on the right track, the scenery always looks brighter than when he's going the wrong way. While some argue that it's a bit old-fashioned, for me this is a brave movie that features a realistic inner war inside a man to control his own destiny, which features very strong character performances by all involved. Given that, THE MAN WITH THE GOLD ARM receives my highest recommendation possible.
