It was cool. It was one of those stories we have, but we do not have enough evidence. In the two handfuls of movies I saw her, I never really liked Stephanie Zimbalist. A professional TV actress, she is, but nothing really exceptional. Here in this she was definitely above average as the ex-fed (or was loan-fed?) Profiler. Her character got along well with the heterogeneous band of police of the Special Investigation Unit that she received. There was not really a silly character to turn your eyes to and just despise what was good. It's also good to take some time to know who the killer is ... but when I found out, I was not so surprised. Oh well. One more thing that was good was the Los Angeles locals. Quite possibly, if this were done today, they would use Toronto or Vancouver, but here they actually filmed in downtown Los Angeles. It's a lot like this (even if I despise L.A). I liked the movie too. I do not know if I've watched it again, but it was not so bad. My Note: B-
