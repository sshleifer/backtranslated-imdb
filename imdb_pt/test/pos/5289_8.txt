For readers who have seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and has made another valuable experience. Okay, you do not need to read anything now. <br /> <br /> I already think that the majority of readers are older than the two protagonists of this picture, so I must say that Ponyo is not so much a family movie as a movie. chance to remember the feeling of being a small child: discover the world as you wanted, create your own rules and have a lush enthusiasm in doing things alone for the first time. Ponyo distances himself from many of the problems that movies of all ages face. Never condescends, all characters have a genuine good heart and believable problems. <br /> <br /> The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I have ever seen on screen. They are not simple, arrogant or naive, just curious, enthusiastic and learning the ways of the world. They are so easy to love, but even easier to identify. Many movies regard children from the outside, as the adult looking at a world in which only a child can enter. Ponyo brings everyone back to this world. In Ponyo, it's the first time to learn and choose what you like best, which the film values ​​with high esteem. It's worth remembering, feeling again.
