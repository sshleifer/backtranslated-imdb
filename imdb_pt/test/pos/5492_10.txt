One of the best movies I have ever seen ... Good script, original plot of a man who is haunted by the murder of JFK when he was assigned to protect him on that cold day of November 1963. Thirty years later, another lunatic anti- wants to assassinate the current president. The Secret Service Agent loses his partner along the way, to the crazed shooters who plan, lie and murder anyone on their way who is on their way to their mission. <br /> <br /> The film follows with a great memorable track, and a restrained but significant romance between Russo and Eastwood ... which shows how difficult it is to have a romantic life in this kind of work. Malchovich is great, of course many other candidates could have played the role he played, but how many could have acted with such cunning and intellect that he showed in the film? <br /> <br /> Needless to say I thought so. It was a great movie ... every time it is on the television I have to watch .. and I own on dvd! I'm a big fan of Eastwood, it just boosted his already fabulous career, and the best role of Malchovich to this day! <br /> <br />
