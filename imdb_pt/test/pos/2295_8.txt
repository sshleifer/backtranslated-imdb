MR. BASEBOL is a movie of paradoxes. Written and filmed as a "lightweight sports comedy," it really has a comforting core as human and universal as some of Capra's best. At the plot level, you have the baseball paradox, a good old American game, as it is played in Japan - it turned, with American values ​​discarded and Japanese values ​​printed in the game. (Some of the superficial "sports comedies" result from Jack's incomprehensible disbelief about how "bas-boru" is played in Japan.) You also have a main character who is introduced as a super-old baseball star but who is Truth, quite immature - pro ball allowed him to postpone growth. And you have a main character who is rudely resistant to the changes in your life that are being forced upon him, refusing to accept the curved ball that life has given you, in the midst of a new country, a new manager, a new team , and a new girlfriend, who welcomed him and tried to accept him. Sounds like heavy stuff? Not really. It is a charming comedy of "clash of cultures" that takes place at the national, sporting, romantic and professional levels. But if you watch very closely, you'll also find a great story about a man who has to give up his immaturity and grow up too late (causing some personal pain), and finds success in places he never expected. . I love history, but I also have great respect for Selleck's performance; he discovers his butt (literally) to portray an ugly American, insult people and make tantrums in public, then lets us enter this character to understand his discouragement. It also does not hurt if you are a big fan of Takakura Ken as I am. MR. BASEBALL is a surprising story of "loss of innocence".
