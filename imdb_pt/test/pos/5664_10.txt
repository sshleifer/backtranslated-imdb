This is certainly not the best movie of all time. But this is certainly worth it for people with a special kind of mind. So, one who loves sadness and depression, and scary fairy tales at night, and real wolves and madness - welcome! If you find a copy, of course :) As for me, I could take it once ... But since then the Wolves, and Saint-Lucy, and children's drawings, and a Christ without a head, live in my nightmares.
