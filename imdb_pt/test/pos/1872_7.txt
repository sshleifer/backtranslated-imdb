I firmly believe that a film, TV series or any art form should and should be fully appreciated since the time factor - when written, produced or conceived - should be taken into account. <br /> <br /> Yeh Jo hai Zindagi is one such series. I remember watching it in the mid-'80s on TV and re-rushing through the VCR libraries during the early 1990s. And laughing loudly and being addicted to it. It made me buy the complete series of DVDs and surprise surprises - the comedy and the good old days simply fell on me. Even the very popular "30 years ka experience" "GULAAAAB JAMUN!" and "Sofa bed cum" did not invoke the kind of joy that I thought it would be. The time factor: for the 80's, this was the showstopper. The main event. The mother of all TV comedies. And it worked during age and time! Perhaps the same can not be said now, but even so, watching the DVD brought back pleasant memories. <br /> <br /> I wish the seasons with Shafi Inamdar and Swarup Sampat to be longer. Satish Shah has been unbelievably good as the heart of the show, with equally effective supporting cast of Farida Jalal, Tiku Talsania and the Bengali neighbors. Rakesh Bedi hams everything. <br /> <br /> All in all, an experience that will bring back memories for those who saw it during prime time, may not appeal to younger or first time viewers!
