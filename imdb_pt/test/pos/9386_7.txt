As Roger Corman said in an interview, low-budget film production allows filmmakers to risk unusual ideas. Well, you'd be hard-pressed to find a movie that thrives on the eccentric as powerfully as George Barry's "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats." <br /> <br /> The movie has a story behind it, and it's interesting in that. I'll forgo any kind of details so you can listen to them for yourself if you have a chance to watch it. Suffice it to say that the title item of furniture has an insatiable hunger, consuming the unsuspecting ones with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves their victims as acid. "Death Bed" is a strange and astonishing little movie that throws away its absurd premise in such a way that it transcends the usual variety of schlock fare. It occupies your particular dream world in such a way that it was possible for me to take it seriously. It is a truly strange and unconventional horror film. He is interested in exploratory ingredients - there are some tasty recipes for female nudity - and it is also art, although it is an art with a completely distorted sensibility. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not so bad for a film with a microscopic budget. and Barry gives the film a good, atmospheric "midnight movie quality". The cast is as uninspired as one might imagine, although Patrick Spence-Thomas lends a reasonable amount of seriousness as an artist / narrator, and a definite point of interest is to see a familiar face in hand: the future "Boy Meets World" Father William Russ! <br /> <br /> This movie may not even have found the next little cult, were it not for pirate copies doing the rounds; this certainly has to be classified as one of those cases where such a practice eventually helped the film - even if the exposure took years to happen. <br /> <br /> If you have a taste for truly bizarre obscure items, "Death Bed" may be exactly what you have in mind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
