I can not disagree with an earlier comment that "Driving Lessons" is more than a little bit, but a man's accusation is someone else's endorsement, I suppose. In my book, this movie succeeds in pure charm, not a small feat in itself. <br /> <br /> I can not help but wish the story was a bit less conventional, given the amount of talent in acting, but by finishing the plot it seems more like a backdrop to the character interactions anyway . Julie Walters' Dame Evie is a glorious over and over actress on the mount. Although Evie has not had a steady job in years, it's not clear the last time she visited reality, if ever (think Edina of "AbFab" at 65, at some point she is forced to deal with her kitsch factor ). Some may find it annoying, but I think that's the point, to emphasize how much she pushes Ben's reserved buttons (Rupert Grint) to force him out of his shell. Ben is equally isolated from reality, living his entire life under the control of his overly dependent mother, who Laura Linney can breathe in some life, despite being a reasonably one-dimensional character (you are an arrogant religious mother). I was quite impressed with Rupert Grint, who I found to give a very honest and convincing performance (not to mention the sweet as everyone leave), I can not think of many teen actors today to whom I can say this. <BR> <BR> The heart of the film is what happens when Ben and Evie's worlds collide. At first, Ben is understandably hesitant, but also intrigued, since Evie is essentially the opposite of everything he has ever known. With the combination of Evie's persistence and Ben's useful nature, a genuine sweetness develops between them, culminating in an impromptu trip that gives Ben his first true taste of independence. <br /> <br /> The tone is consistently light even by some. brief melodramatic chunks, but there was still a surprising amount of emotional resonance, a credit to the main actors. All in all, I would say that if you're willing to sit back and be charmed by some lovely performances, "Driving Lessons" should not disappoint. However, if "fluffy" is not in your movie vocabulary, better stay away. <br /> <br /> Another minor note, the soundtrack features the music of Sufjan Stevens highlighted, a nice touch.
