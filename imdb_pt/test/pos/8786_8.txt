Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is unjustly accused of sabotaging a hanger making aircraft for war. He flees, meets Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) along the way, and she joins him to find and bring the real criminals to justice. <br /> <br /> There are many things wrong in this movie. Robert Cummings was a good actor, but he is totally misled in this role; Priscilla Lane is beautiful, but she was never a good actress; the story does not make much sense (and walks more than necessary); she uses her patriotism a little too much (but this was done while World War II was in full swing) and there is no end. It should not work, but it works. <br /> <br /> It is full of lines and bizarre characters that surely catch your interest. <br /> <br /> For example: Lane tells Cummings (while they're falling in love), "I wish I had met you a hundred years ago" (???? !!!!); Lane PAYS a villain for getting his lunch and Cummings and Lane join a circus troupe while on the run. Also, Hitchcock's direction was (as always) great - he throws some truly incredible scenes and scenes - especially the climax of the Statue of Liberty. <br /> <br /> This is not one of the classic Hitchcock movies, but it's still very good and worth getting numbered.
