One Life Stand is a film production piece that has not received the credit it deserves. His IMDB rating of 1.7 does not do it justice and is perhaps due to the few exhibits he had, and not to the quality of the film itself. Filmed in digital in black and white, the film is well directed with production values ​​that belittle your tight budget. The performances are excellent, particularly that of Gary Lewis, who looks better in every role. My only criticisms are that it is a bit long and could have done with a touch more humor to make up for the darkest moments. Overall, though, it's a good job.
