* Five medical students, Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), Joe Hurley (William Baldwin) and Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt) decide to try an experiment; dying for exactly 5 minutes (it's the maximum amount of time someone can do this before having a risk of brain damage). <br /> <br /> Almost everyone does this experience, Randy being the only exception, but they start having unwanted visitors; David sees a black little girl shouting coarse insults at him, Joe sees all the women with whom he had sex (and films) asking why, on TV, Rachel relives her father's suicide and Nelson faces a murderous boy. . <br /> <br /> Why are they here? And how will they get rid of them? This tense and interesting film, set in a hallucinatory city and a school of gothic medicine, is a great experience both for the story and for the characters, played by stars like Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Oliver Platt and Kevin Bacon. and William Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The director is Joel Schumacher, who had worked with Sutherland on 'Lost Boys', and this second co-operation is even better than the first. <br /> <br /> Must for psychological thriller-horror buds and lovers of metaphor (this story is about forgiveness and correct past mistakes), this is one of the minor classics of the 80's that receive respect until today, as the mention of Rebecca Gayheart in 'Scream 2' or the episode of Tru Calling that used the premise of the film. Flatliners: 9/10.
