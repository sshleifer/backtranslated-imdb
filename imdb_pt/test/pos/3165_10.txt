I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! <br /> <br /> This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. The protagonist Jim Kirk drives a heavy trailer across America, stopping often to fill his gas tank. He is middle-aged and confused. It feeds your diabetic and thick body with cups of coffee and radio conversations. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced, quite oblivious to the growing tension around him, but feeling like stitches of discomfort. <br /> <br /> Spirit spreads the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and passes in the visual field. The Spirit eventually collides with the Flesh and Kirk descends, unable to comprehend what happened to him. He has been in denial about how bad things have become because of his disobedience because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh. We are all in the same denial, and so we, like Kirk, run the risk of falling and being carried away by the sands of the desert like him.
