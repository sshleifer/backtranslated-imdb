Chaplin is a mass kid in his last 1918 movie, a boy of mass who does not seem to be able to make the march in a straight line. He spends his time "there" in the trenches of World War One. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as an improvised grenade by one. The tight quarters in the trenches and when Chaplin and his companions are washed from their bunks by the flood are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers alone and beaten the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin responds that he has surrounded them. Chaplin hides behind the enemy lines as a tree of all things, and these scenes are very funny. He escapes to a bombed house where he meets a French girl played by Edna Purviance. He is tracked by German soldiers, escapes from them again and Purviance is arrested for helping him. Chaplin is able to pull a quick beating on a soldier and wearing the soldier's uniform. He ends up saving Purviance, of course, and capturing the Kaiser in the process. Along the way, Chaplin employs some jokes of vision and clowning in returning the German soldiers. With this film, Chaplin explored the possibilities of filming while keeping the attention of the public longer, which his contract with the Mutual Film Corporation prevented him. The film also allowed him to mock the enemy, something he would do again with greater effect on The Great Dictator. *** of 4 stars.
