I'm a fan of Randolph Scott Westerns. While some of them are surprisingly clich√©s (like most Westerns of the time), their ease of delivery and style really elevates the films to classic and almost classic status. While this film features yet another example of Western real-life heroes being exploited after his death by Hollywood (in this case, Bat Masterson), the film works well because of it as well as excellent supporting characters. One of them is the always strong performance of Robert Ryan - an excellent actor who today is sadly almost forgotten. The other is the ubiquitous Gabby Hayes, who has one of his best roles as the grumpy deputy and very colorful. Here he is more entertaining than in his many supporting roles for Roy Rogers and John Wayne - mainly because his part is better written and he has more to do. <br /> <br /> The plot is practically the plot of the half. the westerns already did. There are some villains who hire a bunch of thugs to get over the sites and it's up to a good (Scott) to restore peace and kill the villains. However, how the plot runs is much better than average and because of this, the movie is still fun. Just do not expect too much innovation or uniqueness - unless you want to see what might be Gabby Hayes' best performance.
