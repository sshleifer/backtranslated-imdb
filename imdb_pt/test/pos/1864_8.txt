Wow!! Fantastic movie in my opinion, I was not expecting it to be that good! I was captivated from beginning to end - it's a very well done and educational film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the trials that Darwin had to go through to convey his ideas to the world, chronicling his life by writing "Origin of Species"; fighting against personal demons as well as ignorant society of the time in order to do so. He struggles hard with his mind, body and soul as personal matters come to the breaking point and even his family seems to escape ... while the rest of the world opposes him as he knows that his discoveries literally shake the very foundations of his lives, culture and meaning of existence. It's a subtle film (not overly exaggerated in this typical Hollywood way, this is a British film produced by the BBC), but fortunately very powerful in terms of meaning and thanks to the incredible well-directed scenes as well as the excellent performance of Bettany. . Connelly acts as a lighter support role but I liked her and she is as good as expected as always, her chemistry alongside her husband was definitely strong and nice, you could feel the connection and her husband in real life / Bond wife definitely shines through her performances. But the star of the show is definitely Bettany and he does a brilliant job, a very touching performance - I understood and sympathized with him as he fought against his own degrading health and impending "insanity" to try to understand what he discovered and came to. in terms of what he really is and means that he thought his thinking contradicted his feelings, and found himself losing everything, including his wife, who naturally firmly believed in religion and was a strict Christian while he was in the realm of science, two worlds who could not see eye to eye, so their relationship was at stake as well. <br /> <br /> Anyway - a very good emotional drama, well represented and I dare say I shed a tear during the tragic climax that was truly moving as well as moving and moving. The film is symbolic and very intellectually artistic as well, in fact I can not wait to watch it again as there was so much to take in the first time I missed it. Easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.
