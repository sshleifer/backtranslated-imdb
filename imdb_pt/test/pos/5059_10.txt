We begin all our comments with the following information. My wife and I have seen almost 100 movies a year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored to receive lifetime movie passes for any movie at any time, at no cost! Then we can see what we want when we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count toward ZERO. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert are not really different from you or me. The only difference is that they write about the movie and are forced to watch hundreds of movies, whether they like it or not. So it's our belief that if you get your money's worth for two hours of fun, it's good enough for us! We NEVER NEVER hear or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those we know as the same things as us. Well enough about that. When Meryl Streep, the head of the NSC in the film, says that "The United States does not torture," he laughed a lot with this film. Of course it's a lie that the Bush administration has denied time and time again. It's a very good movie and it's scary what they can do when we lose all our civil rights. They can simply "catch" you anywhere and tell them that they have. In this case, they pick up a man who has a name similar to those who killed thousands in 9-11. He is, of course, like you or me. And then they take him to a secret location outside the US to torture him and drown him. <br /> <br /> Very scary. Well represented by Jake and Reese and the whole cast.
