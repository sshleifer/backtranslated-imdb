I consider this film a complete masterpiece - in fact, I consider it to be the best work of Fernando Fragata and undoubtedly the best of all Portuguese films. I do not think you can come across a kind of "zero budget" movie as impressive and amazing as this. <br /> <br /> The steering is done to perfection at an incredibly fast pace and the music also composed by Frigate is mostly excellent. The story is chilling and humorous at the same time, and is certainly an advanced study of the old adage "Misery loves company," sort of situations intertwined with an incomprehensible mystery. A recipe more than perfect to glue the eyes of the spectators to the screen, from frame one to the last. <br /> <br /> It's been called Neo-Hitchcock, and I'll agree. Much like the best Hitchcocks, it kept me guessing throughout the movie and most of my assumptions were far from what is cleverly revealed.
