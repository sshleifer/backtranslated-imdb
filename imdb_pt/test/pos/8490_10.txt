Jamie Foxx leads a brilliant cast on this powerful journey through the life of the blind, emotionally disturbed, African-American jazz pop genius, Mr. Ray Charles. Although the entire cast performs well, Mr. Foxx has won more than just an Oscar. If it were possible to name an actor in consecutive years, I would consider that for Mr. Foxx. Foxx does not just touch Charles, he recreates it. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of Ray's mother (the inspiration of her life) and young Ray. These two provided the strongest support in the film. <br /> <br /> The dramas of Carlos's guilty struggle, the death of his younger brother and his mother, blindness, discrimination, vice and success, are clearly intertwined in the film. tapestries of his music. The music is beautiful, the script is, as far as I know, perfect, and the acting is nothing less than legendary. <br /> <br /> The method of directing the film deserves discussion. Taylor Hackford - a director about whom I am usually ambivalent - had to choose which aspects of the life story that was larger than the life and complex of Mr. Charles would tell his story in the most honest, dramatic, and understandable way. Although some disagree (apparently wanting a documentary instead of a dramatized biopic), I believe he has chosen his themes admirably. A big part of the success of this film is its consistent focus on some lingering themes in Charles's life - his deep love and respect for his mother, his need to be loved and accepted, his vice and guilt complex, his musical genius, and his deep fear of responsibility for others. Charles is portrayed as a man fighting bravely against an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could imagine about one of the men I used to hear on my old turntable with my dad in his living room on Sunday nights while football games were on TV. And nothing was coated with sugar in "Ray." The themes are carried forward with power and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama that covers the duration of your long and enlightened life. The power of these themes, strong script and direction, music and acting make this one of the most enjoyable and evocative biographical films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Recommended for all.
