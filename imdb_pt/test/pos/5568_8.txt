When I saw the Farscape Premiere Episode for the first time, I had no idea what to expect. I was immensely impressed and pleased with the "Premiere". Subsequent re-watches, however, have made numerous apparent flaws to me that I initially lost. "Premiere" is not a great Farscape Episode, but deserves credit for riding the plot in a successful and efficient manner and giving the basic stories back to many of the regular characters. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with John Crichton (Ben Browder), an astronaut and scientist, preparing to launch into space in the Farscape Module, a small spaceship perfected by Crichton and his friend DK. Crichton has a revealing conversation with his father, Jack Crichton, and then begins his test flight in space. Of course, everything goes wrong and Crichton is "shot through a wormhole" and ends up in "a distant part of the galaxy". <br /> <br /> After exiting the wormhole, the Crichton module is pulled aboard a living space ship. From here, the characters and plot of the Farscape series are introduced in a fun, yet hasty way. <br /> <br /> Regular characters are entered correctly during the first half of the episode. Of course, there's Crichton, played well by Ben Browder. It offers the public a nice character to identify with. He is lost and has no idea how to do much. In "Premiere", Crichton has to choose between joining prisoners or Peacekeepers. He knows nothing about either side, but by helping Aeryn (a captured Peacekeeper pilot), it is clear he intends to help the Peacekeepers. He probably would not have ended up taking the place of the prisoners were it not for Crais, a Peacekeeper captain, declaring that Crichton would be his brother's killer. This puts Crichton in an interesting situation: he is stuck with bizarre and violent fugitive prisoners in a distant galaxy over which he knows absolutely nothing. Crichton's total lack of knowledge about the world of Farsape makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during the first season of Farscape. <br /> <br /> The support cast is equally compelling. There's Zhaan, a blue Delvian and ex-prisoner. She is peaceful and reasonable, unlike fellow prisoner Ka D'Argo, a powerful and obstinate warrior. Virginia Hey is fully covered in blue makeup, allowing her Zhaan character to look cool and convincing. D'Argo's mega-makeup, by contrast, is below average. He looks kind of silly with his gigantic tentacles and strange nose, and there's something peculiar in his eyes. They seem to have had some kind of allergic reaction to their makeup. Farscape would have made some improvements in his make-up in Season 1, but the overall fantasy would be, at least for me, a problem until Season 2. <br /> <br /> Rygel's and Pilot's digital puppets / characters are, to put it simply, excellent. Rygel is a small Hyinarian Dominate that floats on some sort of hovercraft. In "Premiere" he gets a good dialogue, but not much else. Pilot almost steals the show as the link between the living ship, Moya, and Moya's passengers. Even in the first episode, the pilot gives the appearance of being a real living alien; He never once in the series seems to be a giant and expensive machine. <br /> <br /> Peacekeeper characters are also very interesting. Peacekeepers are made up of a race called sebaceans, which look like humans. The main antagonist is featured in "Premiere" as Captian Crais, who believes that Crichton killed his brother. In fact, Crais' brother's death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental collision with Crichton's ship. Aeryn Sun, a pilot who Crichton helps escape, tries to explain that the death was an accident, but Crais only claims that she is "irreversibly contaminated" and refuses to change her mind. Crais obsession for revenge, guaranteed or not (it should be clear to Crais that Crichton is not responsible), is mysterious in "Premiere", but would be explained at the end of the season. Aeryn provides herself with an extremely interesting character. By being forced to leave the Peacekeepers, it changes their entire way of life, and it is in that sense in a similar (though less severe) situation as Crichton. <br /> <br /> The current episode, as mentioned earlier, seems a bit rushed and awkward. So much happens that you do not spend enough time on anything. In addition, D'Argo (for now) seems a bit of a fool running around in his mediocre outfit trying to look menacing. Still, "Premiere" is solid entertainment. Special effects (as in the starburst sequences) are impressive. Most of the clothes and sets aboard the Moya are original. Despite its flaws, "Premiere" is a must-see for fans of Farscape. 3/4
