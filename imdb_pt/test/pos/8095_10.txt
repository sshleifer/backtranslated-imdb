Although I have not seen it yet, I know Chaplin is a genius, and only someone of his talent would take on this bold subject-a comedy about Hitler. Every great satire is based on going out on a ledge. Also, all great comedy business with the other side - pathos. This movie looks like it's going to come out on both sides. Like Dr. Strangelove of Kubrick, The Great Dictator deals with history through the distorted lenses of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is to laugh at it. And hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to see the world in a new light. Another film that comes to my mind is Emir Kusturica's Underground, and Fando And Lis. So, let me watch the movie first.
