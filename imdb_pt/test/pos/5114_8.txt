This is a really good movie with incredible humor. Jim Verney, as we all know, was very good with facial expressions and demonstrates much of it in this film. This is definitely the best of Ernest's films. I would certainly recommend any fan of Ernest out there. I have to have great taste in films and I'm sure anyone will like this movie. In the film, (Ernest) plays 2 roles, villain and good guy and plays very well. I really like humor exaggerated type, where things seem impossible, as in naked arms movies, for example, and there is a lot of it in this movie. I bought this movie soon after I saw it. Good direction, good script, worth renting.
