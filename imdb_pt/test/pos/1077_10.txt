I was expecting a lot from this movie, and I can say that I was not disappointed. First of all, this film, like a world wine tour, allows the viewer to enjoy beautiful places. The people interviewed are really interesting and fun too, in particular Hubert de Montille. Shooting can be confusing, the camera is always unstable and often focuses on background elements in the back. You may not like this, but I do not consider it a defect. <br /> <br /> The themes raised in the film can also be confusing, since globalization is not the only issue discussed. Nossiter managed to give the film a consistency all the time. One great achievement of this movie is to reveal all the characters involved in the wine industry as they really are, avoiding a "Good vs. Evil" clich√©. This could be the main difference between the documentaries of "Mondovino" and Michael Moore; Nossiter's point of view appears subtly, through opinions expressed by his favorite characters. The wealth of this documentary is based mainly on the characters, in the history of old wine-growing families, like the De Montilles, the Mondavis, the Antinori and the Frescobaldi. Nossiter allows the viewer to discover that wine is in some way related to families rather than just a business and an industry. This movie does not make you want to drink wine, but it certainly makes you want to discover vineyards and wine producers. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie as a student of oenology, and we go there in many ways. learn. I give this documentary 10 out of 10, despite its technical peculiarities.
