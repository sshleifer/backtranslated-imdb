I think this is the best Norwegian movie I've ever seen. It's about Andreas, 40, who gets hit by a subway train and suddenly finds himself in a strange city, yet everything here was prepared for him. He got a job, a house and clothes. At first, this city looks perfect, without death, without pain and without problems. Everywhere there are men in gray suits who clean and fix everything that does not fit their definition of perfect. However Andreas can not really fit in and begins to return to his old world, and tries with all means to return. What strikes me most about this movie is how to make the city look surreal, even though I have seen many of those places in real life seem so far apart. Another thing that contributes a lot to the performance is the actors. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is the perfect guy to play the confusing and troublesome Andreas. And all the other characters are also doing a great job playing listless (looks like a hard job, right?). The strong difference between Andreas and the others leads to very amusing situations as well. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a fabulous movie. The plot can be a bit confusing, but the film has such a good atmosphere that I would recommend everyone to see it. <br /> <br /> And I do not recommend listening to "ccscd212" as it seems that he has seen many American commercial films and seems to have become too accustomed to just having served the moral on a silver platter. As I see it, there is not much in this movie that tries to tell us about suicide being right or wrong. I consider one more warning of a direction that our society seems to be taking. But surely everyone can see a movie their way.
