The 1970s is often considered a golden era of British television comedy, a period that saw numerous classic sitcoms as well as drawing shows such as "Flying Circus of Monty Python." The period was, however, emphatically not a golden age of British movie comedy, and what worked well on television was rarely successfully transferred to the big screen. The most triumphant exceptions to this rule were provided by the Pythons, but their best films ("Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and "Life of Brian") were very different in designing their television program. The main problem in adapting sitcoms to the cinema is that the concepts designed to fit in the BBC's 30 minute slots (25 minutes on ITV, which has room for commercials) do not always work as well when expanded for a movie of three or four. times longer. Few people will remember the cinematic versions of, for example, "Up Pompeii!" or "Steptoe and Son" with the same affection that the versions of television. In the case of many classic TV comedy shows ("Some Moms Do 'Ave' Em," "Yes, Minister," "Fawlty Towers," "The Goodies") no attempt was made to film them, so we can be thankful. Characters such as Michael Crawford's Frank Spencer or John Cleese's Basil Fawlty may be hilarious in half-hour doses, but I doubt they would be funny for over two hours. A comedy show (though a dramatization of a comic novel rather than a sitcom in the normal sense) that might have worked in the movies was "The Fall and the Rise of Reginald Perrin," but all the hopes of a movie were thwarted by the tragically preterm infants. death of his star Leonard Rossiter. <br /> <br /> "Dad's Army" was one of the few television sitcoms of the period that was turned into a decent movie. (About the only other one I can think of was "porridge"). This was possibly because he had an unusually large number of well-developed characters and derived most of his humor from the interactions between them. The original sitcom was published between 1968 and 1977 and recounted the misadventures of an Internal Guards squad in the small seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea. (The Home Guard, formerly known as Local Defense Volunteers, was an auxiliary militia during World War II, composed mostly of very old men to serve in regular forces). The film version is a three-act drama. Act I deals with the formation of the platoon and the recruitment of its members. In Act II, they wreak havoc during an Army training exercise. In Act III, they managed to capture a group of Nazi airmen whose plane was shot down. The three main actors in this drama are the platoon commander, Captain George Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe), and his two subordinates Sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesurier) and Corporal Jack Jones (Clive Dunn). Mainwaring, who in civilian life is the local bank manager, is a hectic little man looking at the world through a pair of thick glasses. It is he who takes the initiative to form the unit of the Internal Guard and appoints its commander. He is pompous, authoritative, with an exaggerated sense of his own importance and his own leadership powers, the kind of man who does not tolerate fools willingly. (And in George Mainwaring's worldview the term "idiot" covers most of the rest of the human race). He, however, has his good qualities. He is motivated by a genuine patriotic idealism and is capable of great physical courage, demonstrated in his encounter with the Germans. <br /> <br /> Wilson is Mainwaring's deputy at the bank. The two men are very different in character, somewhat emphasized by a difference in appearance, Wilson being tall and slim while Mainwaring is short and sturdy. He seems more intelligent and polite than his boss. (His accent suggests he may be a former public student.) However, he ended up playing second violin in both civil and military life, probably because he has the kind of passive personality that leads to pessimism and defeatism and an inability to take everything seriously. Jones is an old soldier who now runs the local butcher shop. (Its promotion to the cable is mainly due to its ability to bribe Mainwaring with black market sausages). His enthusiasm for his new role is matched only by his incompetence and ability to cause chaos. Although his slogan is "Do not Panic!" he is prone to panic at any opportunity. <br /> <br /> Several other members of the squad are featured. Private Fraser, the sullen Scottish undertaker, is even more pessimistic than Wilson. (Phrase: "We're doomed, man, DOOMED!"). Soldier Godfrey is an old gentleman whose main concern is the whereabouts of the nearest bathroom. Private Walker is a sharp cockney spiv and Private Pike (another bank employee) a spoiled mummy boy. (Pike's mother is Wilson's mistress, though Wilson tries to keep this connection secret from the disapproving Mainwaring.) Two significant outsiders are the moderate Vicar and the director of ARP, the detested enemy of Mainwaring, and their equality in pomposity and ingenuity. There are occasional double hobo elves ("Take your hands off my soldiers" - Mainwaring is ostensibly referring to the soldiers occupying this post), rather than on the television program that was surprisingly free of innuendo . (Their creators, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, later came up with comedy shows like "Are You Being Served?" And "Hi-de-hi," which were notorious for suggestive humor.) The film, however, preserves much of the blend of mild humor, nostalgia and razor-sharp characterization that made the TV series so successful. 7/10
