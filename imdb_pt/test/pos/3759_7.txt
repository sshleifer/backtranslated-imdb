The scene "all I have is $ 5 and my wedding ring ..." was a riot. I also laughed at the bar scene where Hyde snorted the radish and turned the bird to the Japanese and said "friend of Pearl Harbor." I think my IQ is greater than 115, but I'm not sure why I can not count it that high. <br /> <br /> Funny thing, that requirement of 10 lines. It seems they would make it seem too long, not too short. I hope I do not reach 1000 words before I reach line 10. <br /> <br /> I still have two lines. Forgive me while I think and I drink, or I drink and I think. It depends on whether my hands are faster than my mind. Well, I think I got to the limit of 10 lines. Thanks for reading!
