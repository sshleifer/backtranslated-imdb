Shawn Michaels vs. Edge-8- Hard to believe Shawn Michaels is in the opening match but it's still a great game for both men, Edge, whether you like it or not you're a great artist in the ring, and Shawn Michaels is only without age when it comes to their performance The Undertaker Vs. Heidenreich. Casket Match-2- OK, after a good opening match, now this, what a fucking match. Undertaker played great matches at the Royal Rumble, and the 1998 Royal Rumble against Shawn Michaels was the same type of match, but that is a lot worse than this game. <br /> <br /> Kurt Angle Vs. Big Show Vs. Bradshaw. Triple Threat WWE Championship-6- It's okay, I feel like all three men could perform better, it really did not show them at their best. <br /> <br /> Randy Orton Vs. Triple H. World Heavyweight Championship-9- Triple H wins a clean win, you may believe, for sure he picks up the Sledgehammer but does not use it. Randy Orton did very well by acting as though he had a concussion, but how he got the concussion is really ridiculous. I really enjoyed this match, this was the best performance I've seen of HHH in all eternity. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble Match-7- This was great fun and I usually do not make the actual match this high. The winner is again, very predictable but just this took a lot of moments that were a lot of fun to watch. The segments with Flair and Guerrero are hilarious the best segments I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great PPV and a must have for fans of wrestling.
