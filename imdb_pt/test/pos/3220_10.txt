It's the best movie I've ever seen !!!!!! I just love them !! I watch every day! I have the episodes on the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! I'm happy that I've seen the show from the beginning and I'm happy that through the internet I can see Season 7. So far, Season 5 is my favorite: I love it because Logan appears and the scene they jump at is my favorite. I also liked Dean, but Logan is the best. I wish Lorelai would stay with Christopher, because he is beautiful. This show is good for all ages and worth seeing. I really want the DVD, but I think here in Romania will never appear, because I do not think they even know they have fans here. but, no matter what, I'll be watching. bye!!
