Life was going very well for New York advertising artist Ted Kramer. He had a great job and a loving wife. No, actually, his wife was not so loving, because when Ted came home late from work that night, his wife, Joanna, had a suitcase ready and was coming out the door. He tried to stop her, but she just got in the elevator and out of Ted's life. Well, now, in addition to his work, he now has to care about the house, as well as with his 6-year-old son, Billy; Ted assured his boss that leaving his wife would not affect his performance at work at all. However, this has affected his performance as a parent. It blew up when Billy punched his client's job! Well, some time later, Ted and Billy got a letter from Joanna, and it was obvious from her letter that she would not come back. Ted was upset. Well, he was late getting back from work on Billy's birthday, which made Billy sore with him. <br /> <br /> Ted was late for work one day and his boss yelled at him because he had missed a very important meeting with the client. When he got home, he yelled at Billy for having ice cream over dinner. Then later, he told Billy that the breakup between him and Joanna may have been his fault, not Billy's; Ted invited a good friend, Phyllis Bernard, that night, and, well, Billy looked for the first time at a naked woman. When Ted took Billy to the park the next day, he fell off the jungle and fell flat on the toy plane. Ted literally took him to the hospital, where they had to manage points. After that, life began to take a downward spiral to Ted. Then one day, unexpectedly, he received a phone call from none other than Joanna! They met at a corner cafe. At first they have a nice talk, but then Joanna informs her that she came back to pick up her son and take him with her. Ted did not want to know and ran. Well, life got even worse for Ted when his boss, Jim O'Connor, took him to lunch and fired him abruptly. Not only that, but Joanna was choosing to sue Billy for custody, and without a job, Ted had no chance of winning. He hired a lawyer, John Shaunessy, who charged a penny: an exact change of $ 15,000. And that's if they win. <br /> <br /> Ted also managed to find a new job. In fact, it was a step below what he used to do with a considerable cut in wages, but he accepted with great determination. Finally the court date arrived, January 9, 1980. Judge Atkins presiding. Joanna took over the position and Shaunessy began to question her about why she left Ted and his other relationships and how they were failures. The next day, Ted climbed onto the bench and Joanna's lawyer assaulted him like a cheeseburger. Ted's good friend, Margaret, also accepted the position and really did not help at all. Well, the judge took some time to think about it and for sure, one day Shaunessy informs Ted that he lost. Joanna took over Billy's exclusive guard. How typical! Always ruling for his mother. Well, Ted and Billy were just devastated by the farewell. They had a tearful goodbye when suddenly Joanna passed. She and Ted have a little talk and well, instead of just giving the ending, let me assure everyone that everything goes well for everyone! <br /> <br /> This was a very good movie. Dustin Hoffman was very good. He won this Oscar. I also saw him in Hook, Meet the Fockers and Rain Man, who also won an Oscar. Meryl Streep was fine. She also won an Oscar. Justin Henry was good too, so where was his nomination? I think the Academy had a rule against giving Oscars to children, but the rule was suspended when Haley Joel Osment appeared. This movie has a great drama, light comedy and is very subtle. Does a good job of holding your attention. I was watching Rain Man at TCM the other night, so this came later and I just could not help but watch. And that's what you should do. If you like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep or movies of the genre, then I recommend Kramer vs. Kramer! An exciting film about the pains of two divorced parents fighting over their son. I liked Ted's little speech about governing for mothers all the time. What was it about sex that makes good parents? In fact, this is how they have the child. But seriously, he's right. Why always rule in favor of the mother because she is a woman? Also in the cast, George Coe, Howard Duff, who passed away in 1990, and Howland Chamberlain, who passed away in 1984. Pay attention to an up-and-coming JoBeth Williams in the nudity in the corridor scene. Finally, see Kramer Vs. Kramer today !!! Good movie !! <br /> <br /> -
