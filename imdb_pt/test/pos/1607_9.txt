I can not explain why I find it so attractive and "The Leopard" does not; may be because the focus here is on everything that was great with that movie, those intimate moments that Visconti can render so magnificent. Like that movie, it has an extremely slow pace, but this time it's not too long. It's the kind of movie where nothing happens, but twenty minutes go by like that. I think this is due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that work like its own mini-story. Like "The Leopard," he has a sympathetic leadership that bears the same kind of worn pathos - though Bogard's performance is more open to being unpleasant, especially in appearance: he has a really stupid smile that's easy to dislike . It is often very beautiful in times of silence. It is the opulence of the Visconti films, the grandiosity of the ball scenes, which I find tedious as they switch individual clarity with mass precision. But here, that's part of the point - Gustav surrounded by a visual noise. <br /> <br /> The way the Gustav object is presented to us is very bright - the camera shows a girl, girl, girl, then this handsome, feminine boy. It's like an allusion to Shakespeare's sonnets, and it does not seem to be heavy. (It is not until the camera sees Tadzio completely, back away and we see his long, thin legs, that we realize that he is not a boy, but a teenager - at first we are forced to question Gustav's attraction in an uncomfortable way; have known this, and he does not shy away from it.) Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav; We have a notion of man, we know him. It is a largely silent performance, and when he opens his mouth it is to vomit venom; No wonder he wants the angelic, open-mouthed boy to project. There is a difference with Tadzio (we never know him, just as we never know a handful of Fellini grotesques, but that's because his life is another, his own film), but it's not as flirtatious as it seems. however, where it revolves around a pole that is too much). Tadzio is not necessarily leading him - he's looking at him; Visconti just magnifies everything. The film does not detail Gustav as gay - Tadzio is not very masculine, he is a beautiful version of a boy (delicate, pale, thin, with gold locks) that everyone seems to love (including a handsome young man, a little older with whom he fights). The closer they get to showing what can be understood as a reference to Gustav's homosexuality is the famous barber scene, which opens up his repressed vanity. <br /> <br /> He is not totally successful - any section with Alfred is a waste, and some unnecessary scenes, people carrying bulk bags, could have been excised. Some pieces are heavy, like when Gustav's boat comes in and the rowdy kids overtake him - the looks on his face are too obvious. (But during the same scene, Gustav makes an attack, wanting a new rower, something so inexplicable that makes up for it.) But there are some scenes - playing for the first time - that create a remarkable and silent intensity. Tadzio repeating piano music again and again, the notes trembling in the air, may be the best example of the anxiety that the film has. There is a discussion that contains a debate that interests me especially: can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses, or does it need to go beyond them? (We may consider that Tarkovsky, who considers both Visconti and Mann, to be the prime example of one who goes beyond mere sensory sensations.) I think he can do both. 9/10
