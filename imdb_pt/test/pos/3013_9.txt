It must be said that the director of The Cell, Tarsem Singh, settled quite easily on his first feature film, which happens to be one of the most visually stunning films in contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> The Cell is more of a visceral experience than a movie. As a thriller, it rises above most of its peers, with competent editing and a scary score that effectively delivers an exceptionally thrilling atmosphere. However, in the final analysis, it is Tarsem's skill in set design and elaborate and disturbing images that carry the film's horror sense. <br /> <br /> As with many recent films, I was shocked by the alarming hypocrisy among those who have commented negatively on the phone; In defense of the film, I will address some of these issues. The plot seems to be the main concern, and although it is not revolutionary and borrows much from The Silence of the Innocents, it was never intended to be the most important aspect of the film; the plot itself is a vehicle through which Tarsem's vision-simultaneously horrifying and marvelous-is presented to the public, just as the plot of The Silence of the Innocents is secondary to the fascinating study of their two main characters, Lecter and Starling . Although The Silence of the Innocents is clearly the superior film, it is irrational to condemn the plot of The Cell and, in the same breath, to praise The Silence of the Innocents. <br /> <br /> My final concern is the mention of the direction "MTV style". It hurts me to see the conviction of directors using innovative camera techniques and cinematography. A camera has the potential to be much more than simply a tool for recording events; angles, pans, color adjustment, and so on, are all used throughout their length in the Cell for the purpose of creating the sense of a dream state that could not have been achieved otherwise. This is essential for the film, since the whole premise behind this is the subconscious visualization of a serial killer. If you simply want a series of static shots, stick to theatrical plays and give in to the movies altogether. <br /> <br /> That said, The Cell is a lot of fun, terrifying and breathtaking both in rhythm and in design. Anyone who can see beyond the script - perhaps uninspired but never boring - will find one of the best films of the year 2000.
