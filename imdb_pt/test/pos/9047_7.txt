Dexter (Kurt Russell) returns from The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes for a new adventure that can stand alone. Dexter, always the college student prone to misfortune, has an idea of ​​a formula to make things invisible. Dean Higgins (Joe Flynn) is less than impressed and sets his hopes to win a lucrative science prize with the student studying the bees. However, bees sting the student and he turns out to be allergic. There goes that chance of a prize. But wait, Dexter does it! He actually invents a liquid that makes him invisible. The problem is that an unscrupulous businessman (Cesar Romero) learns about it and decides that he can use that formula, thank you, for something illegal. Can he steal the bottle from under Dexter's nose? This is a movie that accompanies the TCWT, but you do not have to have seen the first movie to enjoy this movie. Russell is a messy leader who passes when he really counts. The rest of the cast is also a dream, with Flynn, Romero, Jim Bacchus and others showing why their comic skills are still highly prized today. The screenplay is just innocent fun that is charming, with the somewhat simple special effects by today's standards but effective nonetheless. If you want to sit back and relive a bygone era or just want to share a quality movie with your family, this is a great choice. Although you are over 30, there is a great possibility that even now you see your loved ones giggling at the blues with a view of this great movie.
