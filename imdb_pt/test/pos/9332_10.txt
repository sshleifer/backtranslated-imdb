I'm not a big fan of video clips. I think video clips draw personal feelings about a particular song ... Any song. In other words, creative thinking comes out the window. In the same way, personal feelings apart about MJ, put aside. This was the best music video of all time. Just wonderful. It was a movie. Yes, folks, it was. Bright! You had incredible acting, incredible choreography and incredible music. That was spectacular. It was simply a plot of a beautiful young woman dating a man, but he was a man or something sinister. Vincent Price did his thing by adding music and video. MJ was MJ, enough said about it. This song was on video, which Jaguars are for cars. Top of the line, PERFECT. What was even better about it was that we got the real MJ without the thousand facelifts. Although, ironically, there was more than enough makeup and clothing. People go to Youtube. Take 14 minutes. Out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this particular video really is.
