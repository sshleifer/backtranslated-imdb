I've seen three of the Animatrix episodes, and this is my favorite of all of them. The second revival provided a fragile history for the already fragile universe. The program was a stylistically impressive number, it seemed kind of silly. I think what gives a special touch is the direction of Shinichiro Watanabe, director of the incredibly popular (and for good reason) series Cowboy Bebop. It has some of the best elements of Bebop: ingenious adventure, science fiction, a nonsensical hero, a little apathetic working for others, a reward head (more or less) and a chase scene, all wrapped up in an excellent film packaging -noir. The fluidity of Watanabe's Tarantino style comes through here at full steam.
