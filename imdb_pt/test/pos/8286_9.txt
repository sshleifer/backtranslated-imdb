"The Chipmunk Adventure" is one of the biggest animated films of the '80s. Alvin and the Chipmunks have always been of some interest to me, since they really put me in rock and roll. None of the Squirrels have any more features. Alvin is really the star and has all the cool looks. Theodore is the sensible sensitive. Then there is Simon (my personal favorite), the clever one who is usually a party-goer. I also really like Chipettes. There's Brittany, who, like Alvin, is the one who's always trying to be so popular. Then there's Eleanor, who, like Theodore, is sweet, sensitive, and fond of food. Janette is the only Chipette who is not much like her counterpart; She is very naive and very clumsy. In the first feature film of the Chipmunks, David Seville is going on a business trip to Europe, and he's leaving the boys with Miss Miller while he's away. While playing an arcade game, Alvin loses against Brittany and then says that if he had the money, he would compete Brittany around the world for real. Unbeknown to the children, a man named Klaus Furschtien and his sister, Claudia, who tried to create a sneaky way of delivering diamonds around the world in exchange for money, heard this conversation and said they would let it run around the world for US $ 100,000. Alvin and Brittany accept and participate in the race. <br /> <br /> This adventure movie has many great songs. "Off to See the World" made a theme song appropriate for the film. Then there's "Getting Lucky," one of my favorite songs in the movie. "My Mother" is probably the dirtiest song in the movie, but it always makes me cry. "Wooly Bully" is the only cover song used in the film (the rest was completely original). Then, of course, there are "The Boys and Girls of Rock and Roll," which, in my opinion, has to be one of the biggest musical numbers in movie history. <br /> <br /> I used to watch this movie many times, until my tape died. I still watch the movie, though. This is really a fun movie for people who are about to go on holiday to a foreign country for the first time. This will give you an idea of ​​the kind of thing you would expect from traveling the world. Definitely one of my childhood movies, and one I would recommend to 80's fans and Alvin & the Chipmunks fans.
