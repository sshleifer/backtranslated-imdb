I'm an avid fan of ff7, for example, I have the game, then I see it (serious error), but then I buy again (good mistake ... erm) of any way, yes this movie is very good, the fights are very cool, very good music, and the cgi you can not hesitate. <br /> <br /> Only disappointing thing with the movie that I felt was the lack of involvement of another character, it was almost every cloud that although it is a great character, you can not beat a cid and barret. <br /> <br /> but although the movie was great in my opinion, and a must watch. <br /> <br /> In general, a great movie give and you will give 9/10 <br /> <br /> squaresoft, make more movies like this and you will be more adored than it already is !!!!
