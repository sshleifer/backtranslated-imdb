Alfred Hitchcock's most assertive statement about a film he made twenty-one years earlier is infinitely superior to the original. Hitchcock told himself that his first version was the work of an amateur, and while it's certainly not a bad movie, he seems to be right. That said, this remake, while definitely better, is still not among Hitchcock's best work. That certainly does not mean it's not good, it's just more than a bit excessive, and it drags you down. Hitchcock seems eager to drag certain elements out, and these are parts of the movie that are not totally relevant to the plot, which can become annoying. Some of these drawn sequences, such as the one seen by James Stewart and Doris Day eating in a Moroccan restaurant, are good because they help establish the different culture in which our American protagonists met, but for every restaurant scene there is an opera sequence and it is the last one that makes the movie worse. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a middle-aged doctor and his wife who go to Morocco for a vacation with their son. There, they meet a Frenchman on the bus and another middle-aged couple in a restaurant. However, things go wrong when the French man dies knife in the back shortly after whispering something to the doctor. The holiday turns into a complete nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped, which causes him to stop and go to London to try to find him. The film has a very strong degree of paranoia about it, and can handle it all the time. In fact, I would even say that this is the most paranoid movie Hitchcock ever made. Like most Hitchcock films, this is very exciting and keeps you on the tip of your seat for almost the entire duration, with only the opera sequence mentioned standing out as a time when tension is diffuse. There is also more than a little humor in the film, which gives a carefree relief to the morbid effects, and actually works very well. <br /> <br /> The original version of this story was borrowed excellent support from the fantastic Peter. Lorre. This film does not benefit from its presence, unfortunately, but this is offset by performances of the incredible James Stewart and Doris Day. James Stewart is a man who will always be a candidate for the crown of "the greatest actor of all time." His collaborations with Hitchcock all feature his mesmerizing performances, and this is no different. (Although his best performance continues to be that of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). Stewart conveys all the courage, conviction and disgust of a man who lost his son and would do anything to recover it brilliantly. In fact, this is one of the best things about this movie; you are really capable of feeling the loss of the couple and this makes it even more exciting. Doris Day, on the other hand, is a rather odd casting choice for this movie. She's definitely a good actress, but she's more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is a little weird (even though she's able to flex her vocal chords a bit). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned; this is not the best Hitchcock movie, but there's a lot to like and although I recommend many Hitchcock movies before recommending this, I'm definitely going to give it two little joys too.
