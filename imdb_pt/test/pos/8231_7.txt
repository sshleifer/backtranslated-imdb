This is a modest and modest traditional western, with a stereotyped plot about opposition between farmers and farmers around the town of Liberal, Kansas. The story is essentially routine and features several classic Western conflicts. There is the farmer versus the rancher; there is the clash between cultivated land and 'civilizing' tendencies, on the one hand, and the desert / frontier ethos, on the other, and what this ultimately represents is the opposition of two value systems - democratic and against individualism. Randolph Scott plays the legendary criminal Bat Masterton who enters the Liberal at the request of a land agent (Robert Ryan) to help him solve the bandits who are the cattlemen who drink heavily and fight. The two men fight, but they meet again. to deal with the problematic elements of the city. The script is clich√© but the action is forcefully powered by director Ray Enright and there are solid performances. In addition to the harsh performances of the male protagonists, there is a comedic relief provided by George Gabby Hayes, an oily villain played by Steve Brodie and appealing contributions from Maggie Meredith as a cousin and appropriate Eastern attracted by Ryan and Anne Jeffreys as a bar. singer As long as you do not value the originality, this is a good entertainment for the western lovers
