My husband dragged me into this movie as I had no interest in seeing some Anime cartoons. I was absolutely delighted with the simple story and amazing animation. In a digital world where the effects are generated by computer, it was exciting to see a beautiful and imaginative animation designed by hand. The world of Sosuke and Ponyo is a land of fantasy full of minimal reality. I have not seen an animation like that since I was a child and it's wonderful to see it last and succeed. <br /> <br /> The actors who provided the voices in the English version were fabulous. The length of the movie was PERFECT, especially for kids who tend to squirrelly in movies. Overall, a delightful experience is worth the price of the very expensive tickets we have nowadays.
