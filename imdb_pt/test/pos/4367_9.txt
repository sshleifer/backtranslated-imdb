Turning the novel somewhat somber and absolutely brilliant into mild comic play could easily have been a recipe for disaster, but in a way it was not. The story moves at a zenily fast pace and the black and white pictures are beautiful as well as Harvey and Harris as they ham their way through a wacky Weimar Berlin. Fun!
