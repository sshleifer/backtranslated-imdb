This is a great example that no Hollywood movie is very thought-provoking, poignant and without a sense of humor, Kevin McKidd and Paula Sage are excellent. <br /> <br /> In fact, I watched TV late at night and I can see why I missed it at the movies, it's not the kind of movie that the "mega" multi-screen theaters show today, more What a shame. <br /> <br /> I'm going to look for the DVD. Not for those who prefer, the current trend for special effects and no story. If you liked the best selling book "The Curious Incident of the Dog at Night", you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is alongside the best of Scottish films, such as "Small Faces" and "Trainspotting". All the films that Kevin McKidd also star. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
