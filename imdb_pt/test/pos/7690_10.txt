I've seen this on television for more years than I remember, but I've never forgotten the performance of Sammy Davis, Jr. I just happened to think about looking it up on video. This version of Porgy and Bess is a treasure. I would love to see this again and introduce my son as well. I just can not imagine why this is not announced as one of the greatest performances Sammy Davis Jr. has ever given. Whoever is responsible for not bringing this to the public should be ashamed of their ignorance. I'll keep looking for it though. Perhaps the executives responsible for such things will realize the forgotten work of so many African-American actors.
