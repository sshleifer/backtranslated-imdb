I foresee many students now signing up for student exchange to Barcelona and getting disappointed when they do not have such an exciting time. <br /> <br /> The movie was enjoyable. Of course, it's always a pleasure to see Audrey Tatou. <br /> <br /> However, I have a very strong problem with part of the movie. The lesbian roommate tells Xavier that women like to be physically dominated (which I disagree with) and shows her some kind of blow that a woman asserts. Xavier then tries his ass to grab a shy married friend - who starts saying "no, no" "I'm married, I'm married", but then somehow succumbs to the ass grabbing? Suddenly she is moaning "yes, yes" and they are going to the banks of Parc Guell. I found this really very offensive. In addition, it is very stereotyped. How many times have we seen scenes where the woman says "no" but obviously does not mean it? No means no. Grabbing ass / physical dominance will not work. It only fully supported the stereotypes of the rape myths. <br /> <br /> I was not sure how to read the next scene in which he rejoiced with the lesbian about how it worked and how next time it would require "sucking it, bitch" (or something like that) . Did he really think that forcing a woman out of respect for her feelings was the way to go? <br /> <br /> This section really ruined the movie for me.
