The Curse of Monkey Island has always been my favorite in the series. Vibrant visuals, great soundtrack and excellent tone make for a memorable and humorous adventure. <br /> <br /> Graphics are wise: the game is definitely not disappointing. Although some corners have been cut, the overall feel of the game is reminiscent of the Disney Feature Length Animations. The gameplay is simple and even a beginner will get the hang of it soon enough. The game also offers a bit more for the more experienced players with Mega Monkey mode. <br /> <br /> The voice cast is one of my favorites. The understanding voice of Dominic Armato makes Guybrush complete and Alexandra Boyd is simply charming as Elaine. Earl Boen makes for a wonderfully sinister yet over-the-top villain, LeChuck. Also the charm of the game is added by memorable characters like Wally (Neil Ross), Murray (Denny Delk) and one of my personal favorites Haggis McMutton (Allan Young, voice of Scrooge McDuck). My hat also goes to the late, great Kay Kuter and his memorable supporting role as Griswold Goodsoup. <br /> <br /> The wonderful and tropical soundtrack of Michael Land once again pleases the Monkey Island adventure, including some of the best. tune the business. The game is not perfect and some sites are not as well detailed as the others but I had no complaints with the simple end of the game which I found very satisfactory.
