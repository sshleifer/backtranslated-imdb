These were two filmed movies that Troama decided were horrible, so in a desperate move it turned into this movie. Perhaps the bitterness on the side of Troama has helped trigger the comedy, but for some reason this is very funny, with a bit of inspiration with "Oliver Stone" commenting during the film. Many cameos, lots of use of the Lesbian Cannibal HoeDown music adds to the fun. Trey Parker, Ted Raimi, Julie Strain etc etc ... <br /> <br /> One of the best recent releases of the Troama. Yes, it is everywhere, I know that entering, the quality of production, or the lack of it, becomes one of the many running jokes. Go ahead and you'll be in for a good time. <br /> <br /> Backstage, often the best things about the Troama's releases are also above average this time round. I really think the anger they felt about these two bad films helped them get them, well, not greatness, but it took them to "fix" this movie in a better way than any of the movies would have been like were originally planned.
