Although not exactly comedy in the usual sense of the word, this is more rewarding than any movie full of laughter but devoid of substance. I do not think Bergman films can be easily classified into narrow genres, even the lightest ones are quite complex. This film, despite its light touch, presents a series of problems related to marriage and its deficiencies and what happens when the flames begin to die, etc. I do not really communicate personally with all these issues, as I'm sure others do. But the atmosphere of the movie is extraordinary, you almost do not want it to end. I have to admit that I was swept by the Bergman of the fifties, having come to know most of his latest and most innovative efforts. Before Nykvist, von Sydow, Ulman, the master produced some of the richest, warmest and most exciting films I have ever seen. Although it is a long shot, I have seen this kind of love for humanity, in its complexity, only in Fellini's films of the same period. A love lesson next to a summer night's smiles is worth to Bergman fans, to have the full picture of man's capabilities and to those who love the cinema with a heart. May he rest in peace!
