I love this movie and have my TV programmed to record it when it comes back on November 2nd. It's a really cool love story with a twist. The song that is played at the end of the movie is one that you would not think would be a great success, but it's a song that's in your head and now I'm trying to find this song so that I can hear and play. I really do not have any style of the shows I see or the songs I like to listen to and that leaves me very open to seeing new things with an open mind. I would like to say that there are some parts in this movie that is not for the whole family to watch. This movie shows the skin. It's like a movie for women, about women. I say watch the movie and you can enjoy it as much as I do.
