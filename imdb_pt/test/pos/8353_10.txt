I thought this is a wonderfully written movie. I love Little Scamp and the Street Angel. This film is very easy to understand for young children, but it is also a good adult film. I liked this movie because it continues the original Lady and the Tramp, and this movie is a classic. Lady and the Tramp 2 Scamp's Adventure was full of new characters, captivating songs, brilliant animations and unforgettable classic characters. I've loved the movie since I first saw it. I also loved how they showed the different personalities of each character. It also shows the falls and the good things about making new friends with whom you can hang out. My favorite song in the movie was Always There, because it showed the different characters sharing their opinions about how they feel. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone who was a fan of Lady and the original Tramp.
