I have not seen all the movies Burt Reynolds ever made, but this one (which I just watched for the third time) may very well be your best! She suffers from only a few slow stretches; Burt may have tried to make it more "artistic" than it should have been. On the other hand, he managed to avoid many of the usual clich√©s in portraying the "tough cop" role he plays (note, for example, the scene in which he tries to kiss Rachel Ward for the first time, or the fear he expresses shortly before final confrontation with the indestructible Henry Silva). In fact, Silva and the two murderous ninjas are three of the most memorable villains of the 1980s crime films. The film also has some unusual twists, an amazing amount of humor, a brutal and thrilling fight, and many well-directed shots. (***)
