I recorded this at Sundance and had no idea it was a Miike movie. I thought it was just another kung fu movie. <br /> <br /> So I saw things like the dancing saxophonist <br /> <br /> that sounded like an Oriental Barbieri Cat, and I knew it had to be Miike. <br /> <br /> I missed the first opening credits and had to wait until the end of the final credits to see Miike's credits. <br /> <br /> So far it has not disappointed me yet. . Audition, City of Lost Souls, Ichi the Killer and The Happiness of the Katakuries were all good movies, and now I've discovered that this was the third in a trilogy. <br /> <br /> In addition to Miike and Todd Solendz there is no one making interesting movies these days.
