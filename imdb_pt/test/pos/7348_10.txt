OMG, it's seriously the best show in the world. It's harder than Jackass and CKY and it's so funny and fun. I love the show. Season 5: - Great, if you want to plan a hunt, watch the house be separated and enjoy watching Phil die of hunger. <br /> <br /> Season 2: - Great if you want to see them, buy a Castle Bam, watch a killer show, see the wonder that is Mardi Gras and the fun of getting there, see a derby demo and really see the creation and opening of a Tree Top Casino. <br /> <br /> Season 3: - Great if you want to see probably the first Driveway Skatepark, a civil war, Johnny Knoxville, a pirate ship and Don Vito, actually winning one of Bam's reindeer games. <br /> <br /> Season 4: - Great, if you want to see them in Europe, they buying Jobs, building a state and a bayou and The Dudesons Season 5: - Great if you want to see them in the Brazil, Monkey's birthday, Mike Vallely, The Metal Mulisha, Bams Lambo disappearing, Bams Hummer being destroyed, a playboy party at the pool of bams and the last Last always Viva La Bam :(
