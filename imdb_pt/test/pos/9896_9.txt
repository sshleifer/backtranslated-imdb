I only saw this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival today and I loved it. The synopsis was listed on our show as "a former Shakespearean actor invites his three children to his suicide party." I was not sure if I would see it because when I read about it I liked the idea of ​​a "suicide party", it sounded very interesting to me, but "old Shakespearean actor" worried me that the film would be kind. dry and boring. But I decided to try. I'm glad I did. It was not dry and boring, the dialogue was great, funny in a clever way, but not pretentious and difficult to understand. Peter Falk was great in this role, he stole the show. I was also pleasantly surprised by the performance of Laura San Giacomo, she usually bothers me, but I really enjoyed seeing her in that movie. I think Judge Reinhold's part might have been better done by another actor, sometimes he seemed kinda tacky and seemed to act, not like you were just watching this character. But the film was so good that I could forgive the embarrassment of an actor. I would recommend this movie to anyone and have already told some people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public. Who knew suicide could be so hilarious?
