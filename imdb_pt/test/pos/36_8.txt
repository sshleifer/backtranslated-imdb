LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining, captivating and emotionally charged HBO-TV movie based on the childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson (who also appears in a small role). This lively cinematographic experience centers around the childhood guardian of Santiago-Hudson, Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a strong, strong-hearted black woman who administered a pension in New York during the 1950s. The nanny was a service organization social life of a single woman whose pension was full of drunks, abandoned, crippled, drug addicts, misfits and all the other inhabitants of the city who needed help instead of a surrender. The heart of the story revolves around Nanny's relationship with young Ruben (beautifully played by Marcus Franklin), a boy whose divorced parents were not able to properly raise the boy for the nanny to accompany him. S. Epatha Merkeson, lost for years to the ungrateful role of Lieutenant Van Buren in NBC's LAW & ORDER program, transforms into a powerful performance as Nanny, the maternal figure of the neighborhood whose pension has become a symbol for oppressed blacks in your city. Merkeson is nothing short of magnificent, in a performance that earned him a Golden Globe and an Emmy. Merkeson is backed by an impressive cast of stars including Terrance Howard, Louis Gossett Jr., Rosie Perez, Jimmy Smits, Delroy Lindo, Macy Gray, Michael K. Williams, Jeffrey Wright and Henry Simmons . , Patricia Wettig, Ernie Hudson, Mos Def and Hill Harper as the adult Ruben. Colorful and exciting, beautifully photographed and refined in an extraordinary way, this is a unique cinematic experience that works on all levels, but if not for another reason, it is worth seeing the electrifying performance starring S. Epatha Merkeson, who receives the prize role of a lifetime and makes more of it.
