Although at first glance this movie looks like the story of your parents' school life (and many people will try to tell you that this movie is outdated) ... and I admit that this was MY first impression ... but honestly , the 'lessons' that are learned by heroes / heroines are def. NOT outdated. Who does not want to be famous? And who does not want to be accepted by my colleagues? And the homosexual guy - is not there a whole controversy today about gay marriage, blah, blah? This film, although released in the 1980s, still addresses some of the biggest problems in the world today. This movie has a bit of swearing and nudity for my liking, though. (thus, note 8/10)
