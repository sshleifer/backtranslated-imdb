This is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen - from start to finish it was perfect in time, atmosphere, background lines, background music, fighting sequences and every other possible aspect you can imagine. To be absolutely honest, I find this movie as funny as the comedy "Rik & Ade", "Bottom" - maybe even funnier. I laugh constantly throughout the film and can only recommend watching this movie ... However, if you watch without knowing (or like?) The kind of comedy that Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson did before, you may not find it funny - but I really can not understand those who do not like him - THAT'S HUMOR FOLKS !!! (People being hit with frying pans, guys running around wearing red rubber lingerie, green vomit filling the aisles, guys being kicked in the breasts and getting stiffeners in the eyes - how can that not be funny?) 10/10
