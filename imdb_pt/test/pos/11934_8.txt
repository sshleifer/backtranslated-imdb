I saw this movie for the first time a year and a half ago and I loved it, I decided to take the DVD last year for my birthday .. It has the right amount of suspense, action and drama .. This movie is about the preparatory school called Regis School and its gang of rebellious children, in which a boy William Tepper (Sean Astin) has difficulty adjusting due to previous rejections of other schools because they could not control his rebellious act and now in the Regis School to commit more acts of one rebellion, the school is taken by terrorists on a random day and the real reason is because the leader's father Luis Cali (Andrew Divoff) has been sent to prison, and the leader will do anything, including killing the students, putting bombs and so on. in order to get his father back. <br /> <br /> Alongside William Tepper, is his rebellious friends at Regis School, one in particular is Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) in that this guy has a troubled past living in a mafia family and being sent to o The Regis School for hating his father for who he is and now he must deal with these terrorists dominating the school, so William, Joey and their friends must unite to prevent these terrorists from engaging in violent acts and dangerous tactics. This movie was really incredible and I think people should notice more, because when people think of a good hostage movie they say "Hard to Kill" and even though I have to agree with them, they need to recognize that Toy Soldiers was a good thriller, surely my heart beat because the students were my age and I would be afraid to face terrorists like these if they took to school ... But overall this movie is really worth a good 112 minutes of your time and if I had a decision to rent or buy ... I would buy it! I recommend it with much hype! 8/10
