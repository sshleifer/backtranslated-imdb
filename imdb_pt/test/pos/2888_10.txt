After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was worth the wait! "Rush in Rio" may well be the greatest rock DVD ever. I'm not kidding. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being low quality is true, however, it does not make the concert be unattainable. I think it makes you feel like you're really in Rio watching the show from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're really there. Besides, Geddy, Alex and Neil were never better off! Geddy's vocals are flawless, Alex's guitar is still amazing, and Neil - absolutely no word to say. The camera work on this show was very good, I must say. They gave us a good look at everything that was happening on stage and in the audience. Lots of praise for cameramen! Anyway, enough of my raving! Go watch "Rush in Rio" for you. You will be surprised. I guarantee that. <br /> <br /> 10/10
