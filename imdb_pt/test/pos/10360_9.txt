I first saw it on January 5, 2009, and after one day I watched it again and want to watch it again. Love everything (well, almost, then 9 stars) about it. No color, beautiful naive stories, funny gangsters, Anna, camera work, music. Well, sometimes you just want to hear a little more and the music just stops. But this is not a musical after all. I like the acting of Anna, this naive gangster aspirant, as she speaks, holds her gun, everything makes me smile. No, it's not so funny, although I've laughed a little at times, it's so subtle. Excellent work by Samuel Benchetrit. Although 3d nouvelle seems weaker, but they are also gangsters, maybe even worse, because they are stealing ideas. And the last scene is my favorite. It makes me feel so hot and romantic. Yes, I would recommend this movie to romantic souls with a taste for such art-housish movies. And I do not agree with those who compare to Pulp Fiction. It is not about action and distorted history, though all the vignettes cross. It's quiet and maybe a very slow movie for most people. It's about characters, their feelings, very subtle. Anyway, probably this comment will not be of much help to anyone (my first), just wanted to express my appreciation. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: This movie does not have a Goofs section. Wonder, did not anyone notice that hand in part 2 when the hijackers decided to go home? Looks like a part of the crew, hehe. I know I should post this better on forums, but I do not agree with some policies here.
