There was a time when not all the animations were Disney or Pixar. It's so good to see this wonderful movie again and I really got a good and reasonable copy on DVD. Be careful as it is out of the public domain and there are some really bad copies out there. I have a very good copy of a company called Flashbacks and it's very good. In the old days I watched black and white on TV and its magic to see it in color. Much better than some would like you to believe. The songs are delicious and the color is great. Interestingly, the characters are well-developed, which is strange in animated films. I loved Hoppity and the villain, Mr. Beatle is a real idiot. It's incredibly imaginative. The way inanimate objects such as cotton reels, old cans become part of the environment and have new functions is great. The anthropomorphic use of insects is surprising, considering the very tainted creatures that most people find sadly disgusting. I hope we can never step on an insect again! The enemy of insects is man. In fact, of course, it's the insects that will survive. No matter how much we try to get rid of the ants here in Australia, they keep coming back. The battle has been lost and we have to live with them. There are several scenes that stand out, such as when Hoppity and Mr. Bumble are caught in a watering can, the big flood and the journey to the top of the building are wonderful. It is also quite anthropomorphic, but somewhat charming. The human characters are very similar to Gulliver's and are incredibly effective. The wedding scene looks beautiful. It's a crime this movie was not hailed as a classic. The only dissonant note to me are the occasions in the movie where the characters slip into the verse. Speaking verse spoils the narration and was not necessary, The verse is horrible and spoils another good wise script. It's great and the kids will love it. It is a joy to look at. There's a very clever end too.
