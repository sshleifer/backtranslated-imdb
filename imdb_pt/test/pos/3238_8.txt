I just checked the Northanger Abbey from the local library and did not expect much. Imagine my surprise in this gothic gift! The Northanger Abbey is one of the strangest places you've ever seen, with empty passageways and ornate rooms filled with hidden secrets. The glory of the film is that it never reveals everything: his imagination runs free, running with the imagination of the main character, a Kathrine M. She is a girl of wild imagination, a gothic fantasy reader she brings to her (and ours) real world. <br /> <br /> If I were to use a word to describe this great film, it would be surreal. Dreams are woven throughout the film, increasing mood. Sometimes it is difficult to say what is real and what is not; This is intentional, I believe. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere reigns supreme. The music is not what you'd expect from a Jane Austen movie: it's sinister, with flute and drums, loud and haunting with a current of fear. If soft and pleasant music were playing at Northanger Abbey, it would be positively inviting. Now, it is a bad omen, a palace of mad and dark men. (But the characters! You must see them for yourself!) <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a nice evening, look no further than Northanger Abbey.
