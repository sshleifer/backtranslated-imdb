Okay, I love this movie !!!!! I watched it over and over again. It's so hard to tell who the attacker is. You keep thinking you are one person, then another, then you go back to the first person, then to another person. It's so full of suspense you want to advance your TV all the way to see who it is. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left in her home. She is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped. It goes from the date with her fixed boyfriend, to the teacher who likes her, the ex-boyfriend, all the different stories, all the suspects. But who did it? <br /> <br /> I love acting, they have a lot of talent here. The suspense is wonderful and the settings are excellent. If you come on TV, watch. *** 1/2 stars 10/10
