LCDR Tom Dodge, despite having a reputation among divers as a renegade and dissident. (* Note to reader: Maverick does not mean "Tom Cruise." Maverick means "nonconformist".) He is actually an intelligence agent of Vice- admiral of his submarine fleet. The Vice Admiral is worried about our old friends, the Russians, who get yard sales with their old diesel fleets. Countries such as Libya, North Korea or Iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and put a nuclear warhead in the port of Norfolk or in Mayport, Florida. And that was 6-7 years before 9/11. <br /> <br /> The Admiral designates Dodge to take command of a WWII diesel submarine and mount an exercise against the surface fleet and the USS ORLANDO, a top of the line sub fast attack. Dodge takes over and in no time lashes out the bad news bears .. err I mean your adorable group of eccentric divers in warriors. Despite having "welcome aboard" tattooed on his penis, he is a competent and fair commander, he does not pick favorites and he delegates authority responsibly. The US Navy could not have come up with a better recruiting advertisement than this generously underrated gem of the "Police Academy" creator.
