This film is not just about human feelings and emotions, it is also about everything that could be, but it is not. Poetry in movies can be very boring and boring, but this movie is delightful to watch. Not to mention the incredible Irène Jacob, a great actress in France - one of the best, actually. When the movie ends, you can only feel sorry. After all, when something is really big, we want more (Well, for another great K Kslowsky movie with Irène Jacob, we can always see Veronique's double vie)
