I watched this movie for the first time last night and I enjoyed every aspect of it - the dance, the acting, the dialogue, the plot, the screenplay and the whole atmosphere that this movie created. I strongly recommend. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray gives an absolutely wonderful and first-class performance in her role as Frances (Baby) Houseman. She has a natural ability and a talent for dancing and she is beautiful and lovely on the dance floor. But what is wonderful about the baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension in her character. This is not simply a movie about dancing but the writers also gave us the chance to see the baby deal with the various emotions and feelings she is experiencing during the movie and allow us insight into how her interaction with others in the camp changes . her life Gray portrays your character with such realism and pungency that you end up feeling deeply for Baby as she experiences everything she does in this movie. <br /> <br /> Patrick Swayze is magnificent in his role as Johnny and really manages to make his character alive. It gives your character a comprehensive personality, strong appeal and great depth. The chemistry between Swayze and Gray is charming and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this film. Cynthia Rhodes is great in her role as Penny and her portrait of the ordeal she experiences is truly powerful and contributes a frightening dimension to the film. The other supporting cast members Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor deserve a special mention here - they also give wonderful, imaginative performances that give this film an added dimension of high-quality acting and credibility that is wonderful to experience. The dance is magnificent and first class on the part of all involved. <br /> <br /> The script and interaction between all the main characters is intriguing and engages the viewer in a powerful way. The plot, while extremely predictable, is given more than enough life and vitality to make this film successful. <br /> <br /> In addition, the wonderful selection of songs contained in this film creates a truly magical atmosphere and a nostalgic atmosphere that enhances the quality and success of all the scenes. <br /> <br /> `Dirty Dancing 'is a truly powerful, magnificent and very attractive film that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance. I recommend
