Ninja Hunter (AKA Wu Tang vs. Ninja) is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its scandalous characters, meaningless plot and lack of any pretension whatsoever. The creators of this film have given us a true OTT masterpiece that must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the villain of Wu Tang, White Abbot, who wants to destroy the Shaolin monks and become supreme. martial artist To do this, does he join a Ninjas clan led by three masters? ninja lick gold, black mustache ninja and black ninja ?? and manages to destroy the Shaolin Temple and most of its inhabitants. However, there are some survivors. It is his job to convey the knowledge of Shaolin's finger-stroke to a new generation, who must defeat the ninjas and Abbott White so that peace and order can be restored. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Abbott White is a difficult enemy to win, as he is able to become virtually indestructible by sucking the vital force of hot nude girls (an excuse for some welcome nudity!) . Other pleasures reserved for viewers include: A lot of very impressive fighting (although some of them are speeding up), some really incredible clothes (the above mentioned lame gold ninja, Yin Yang suits from Abbott White, and even some assassins wearing Swastika robes), a ninja turning into a flying carpet, plus something tacky for good measure. And I almost forgot to mention the really eye-catching eyebrows on display in this movie? certainly a good reason not to let this gem pass.
