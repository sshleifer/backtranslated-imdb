First, I must say that I do not speak Spanish and usually do not like Spanish-speaking films ... BUT Dois Coiotes is an exceptional film. There is plenty of action and hard drama that does not matter if it is a Spanish language film. The captions were easy to read and did not block the action - OR the drama! <br /> <br /> I would tell fans of Spanish language films and not Spanish movie fans to watch the movie. Action and drama are worth every penny. <br /> <br />
