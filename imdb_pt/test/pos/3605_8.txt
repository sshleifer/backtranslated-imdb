Captain Corelli's mandolin is not an Oscar nominee, but it was very good. I have to admit that Ms. Cruz can really act. She does a great job. In fact, she does her boyfriend Tom in the drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt like he was going back to the roots like an Italian. However, I learned something. One more chapter in Nazi Germany's Horrors the many Italian soldiers killed during the period of surrender to the allies and final surrender of Germany.
