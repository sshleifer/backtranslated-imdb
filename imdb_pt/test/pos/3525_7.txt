Following Lieutenant General Deliverance and The Texas Chainsaw Saw Massacre, Jeff Lieberman's film, Just Before Dawn, may not offer much novelty in terms of plot - a maniac chases and kills a group of campers - but still manages to be an effective shock thanks to the skillful manipulation of the director's material, great use of the stunning scenery, even greater use of women in hot-pants, a Brad Fiedel synth-synth score and a nifty twist at the end (although one that should be apparent to those who have paid attention) <br /> <br /> Thanks to solid performances from their capable cast including Oscar winner George Kennedy as ranger Roy McLean? there's a sense of realism for Just Before Dawn that is all too often missing that kind of fare. The film also features a rather scary maniac (who laughs like Mutley, Dick Dastardly's dog, and uses a serrated machete to kill), and offers some imaginative sequences that help elevate him above many of his contemporaries: a woman of topless (free nudity). Box well and truly ticked) in a pond discovers that the hand that has been groping underwater does not belong to your boyfriend; and a nearsighted character fucks with his friend's girlfriend (as a joke), unaware that the person who is slowly approaching is not his friend, but the killer.
