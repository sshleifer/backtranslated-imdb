Although this is a film of only less than forty minutes, it is one of the best directed and acted stories I have ever seen. It does in less than 45 minutes what most movies can not do in over 90. <br /> <br /> It is the story of two brothers, one 18 and another 10. They come from a poor family of farmers in the Mississippi. Both are involved in war and the conflict of duty versus love of family. <br /> <br /> I brought tears to my eyes, especially since the whole film is so well represented and directed, as well as telling the story of so many films. wars where one serves and another left behind. <br /> <br /> I can totally recommend this movie as beyond superb!
