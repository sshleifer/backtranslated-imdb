I watched Six of a Kind for W.C. Fields - he's only in it for about 10 minutes and has a long scene, the infamous sequence of pools he made famous in vaudeville and several other great moments. The remaining 55 minutes are also delicious, thankfully mainly due to the hilarious Charlie Ruggles as the banker J. Pinkham Whinney. He is everyone. He stutters and stumbles for our pleasure. In addition, his comedy partner, Mary Boland, plays his wife, Flora. Joining the lawsuit are George Burns and Gracie Allen. Boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end, but Gracie and Ruggles use most of the image. Gracie is funny, but it can also be tiring. And poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do but repeat Gracie all the time. I do not remember laughing at him once (though he has a great scene with Ruggles, where Ruggles tries desperately to get George to take Gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while, and one with Fields, where he asks Fields to sell her, but this part is exclusively Fields', though). The situation is constantly funny: the Whinney are going to drive to California, but to help them with the expenses, George and Gracie are recruited. 8/10
