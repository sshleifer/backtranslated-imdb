DO NOT TORTURE A DUCK (Lucio Fulci - Italy, 1972). <br /> <br /> Definitely an important contender for the most insane film title ever designed and this is a great achievement in giallo-terra. Originally the film was titled even more absurdly, "Do not Torture Donald Duck," literally translated from his Italian title. A small Donald Duck figure briefly appears as a toy, but it is hardly enough to render a title like this, but apparently it has been changed for fear of the legal ramifications of Disney. I protested a lot against Fulci's LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN (1971), but here are all the right ingredients. A surprisingly effective mystery, a good cast and an imaginative shot against an unusual rural environment. Everything just clicks. I think it's justly acclaimed as one of the director's most accomplished accomplishments. <br /> <br /> The story takes place on the scene of a small town in Sicily, where someone is killing young teenagers. Among the suspects, the most obvious is a young woman, Maciara (Florinda Balkan), a self-proclaimed witch who is seen suspiciously digging up a baby's skeleton and stuffing pins into effigies. Guiseppe, the village idiot is also under suspicion as he made a feeble attempt to profit from the disappearance of one of the boys and went right into their trap. As soon as a new treasure arrives (Tomas Milian) from Milan to cover the murders, he immediately begins to question the guesses of the authorities when he encounters two other possible suspects: Don Alberto, the local priest (Marc Porel) with an attitude arrogant and Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a bored young lady from the city with a troubled past drug offense, who also enjoys having sex with the city boys. Talk about your main red herring. <br /> <br /> Fulci contrasts well with modernity and tradition with the newly built elevated highway winding through the hills of Sicily, past old towns where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition. One could debate the political position of the film as North versus South, or as comments on the virtues of small cities-the conventions of society at large-that are almost always dangerously close to turning into moral disintegration, chaos, and justice for the population. The film has often been criticized because of its anti-Catholic tone, but it is not an important element here, except for obvious plot-related reasons that would be giving away too much. In fact, it is rather meek compared to a film like Joël Seria's, DO NOT DELIVER IT FROM EVIL (1971). Probably the unflattering portrayal of the film about the Sicilian values ​​of a small town (when another boy is killed, the local population portrayed as a late lynching) may be the cause of some offense in Sicily, but - considering the problematic relationship of Sicily with the rest of Italy - hardly problematic for other Italians, I think. The film was too quickly annihilated to have much impact. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Fulci, the amount of blood is usually a first-line subject for discussion. While there are missing eye-ripping scenes, the film contains two very graphic scenes. At the rough end, the killer falls off a cliff, breaking his face along the rocks on the descent with terrible (though not very realistic) results. And the sequence of lashes with Florinda Balkan in the cemetery shows Fulci's tendency toward sadistic violence, and typically he does not retract by graphically showing what most filmmakers would hint at. Certainly, one of the most horrifying scenes in Fulci's repertoire. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a well-crafted, well-written, beautifully filmed mystery, beautifully filmed by Fulci, with an impressive cast of genre-goers like Barbara Bouchet, Marc Porel (not very convincing as a priest) . ), Tomas Milian and Florinda Balkan (mouth-foaming mad as the city witch). <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
