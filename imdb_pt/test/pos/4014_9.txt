These days, you rarely come for a children's show that does not involve 1) a teen / preteen teen pop star who is just as much fun as watching dry paint 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a guy / girl other than each time 3) revolves around erratic screams and unintelligible humor. About 95% of Disney, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network programs fit the criteria listed. To put it in simpler terms, they all do not have good acting, originality and good story. It's as if the producers and writers felt that children are not smart enough to understand the character's development and plot details. They could not be more unconscious. Of course children enjoy good laughs and erratic behavior (if done at a conservative level and done correctly), but as they also want to enjoy a story, watch the drama and see people being challenged. They do not want to see people living in a world without fail, where they get everything they want. They know that this world is not only fun and games, they know it is not perfect. Everyone has problems, and we must all learn to work around them. This show revolves around this sort of thing. Alex Mack is an average teenager who seems to have everything for her genius sister, Annie. Her mother works in some office, but sometimes she is a housewife. His father, George, is one of the plant's top scientists, a chemical company that employs much of the city he lives in, the Paradise Valley. Alex is unpopular and criticized by most of his colleagues. His only friend is Ray (but she gets more friends as the series continues). On her first day at Jr. High, Alex returns home not too happy with school, but a truck delivering factory chemicals drops into a fire hydrant trying to prevent it from running, dumping a strange chemical known as GC-161, where chemical mixture with water, covering Alex. Soon after, she begins to develop strange powers, such as turning into a puddle, firing lasers from her hand and moving things with her mind. She also shines constantly when she is nervous (though we never see much of it later). In addition to her sister Annie and friend Ray, Alex decides to keep these powers secret from everyone, even her parents, for fear of being abducted by Plant, whose corrupt mistress, Danielle Atron, has her security chief, Vince, searching for the mysterious Kid GC161. Each episode then deals with Alex trying to live a normal life as a kid, while learning to live with his strange powers. The show may sound like a girls' show, but it's not. As a boy, I enjoyed watching this show because of its awesome effects and drama. Producers have successfully added some elements of science fiction to the elements of teenage drama. In fact, some episodes were quiet and a little strange. The baseless factory manager Atron and Vince are good antagonists to the series because writers really set them as a threat and give you that terrible feeling every time they appear onscreen. In addition, smart move adding David, truck driver who shed the GC-161, as Vince's bumbling assistant in search of comic effect, but also you get to love it to the end. It was interesting to see little Alex trying to live like a normal kid, but he struggles to perfect his powers. Sometimes you forget that these are children who are struggling against a giant institution because you are drawn to history. The show does a good job of relating to children, showing Alex that she may have superpowers, but she is still a child and must be careful. Even in a few episodes, you will find yourself disturbed by Alex's calamities. My favorite episode where Alex wishes she was never born really demonstrates most of these elements. As I said, the producers never hesitated to add a few laughs, be it Ray's liner or George's weird habits, or David's trying to be a cool guy. Of course you are faced with raw moments and an entire episode that really has nothing to do with the plot of the series, but what good series do not have? All in all great shows. 9/10
