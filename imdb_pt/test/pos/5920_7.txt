"In 1927 a young man, alone in a single-engine airplane, flew nonstop from Roosevelt Field in New York, across the North Atlantic to Le Bourget Field in Paris, at a distance of three thousand six hundred miles. triumph of mind, body and spirit, Charles A. Lindbergh has influenced everyone's life on Earth - for in the 33 hours and 30 minutes of his flight the air age has become a reality. <br /> <br /> Billy Wilder fits the Charles A. Lindbergh Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, which is the recreation of Lindbergh's historic solo flight in 1927. Driven by a considerably strong leadership performance of James Stewart himself a pilot like Lindberg, and containing a clever script by Wilder and Wendell Mayes, Spirit Of St. Louis is a sincerely well told story. <br /> <br /> What sometimes threatens to become a monotonous movie, Wilder continues to spend his time using flashbacks to Lindbergh's life. After the well-told construction of the event, such as the danger being perceived as Nungesser and Coli disappearing (never being found) while we tried the same trip backwards, we learned things like how he got to buy his first plane and his work with the circus flying. This is all about man's understanding and his obvious passion for flying. This also helps give us a full view of Lindbergh, putting us in his isolated cabin as he embarks on this dangerous journey. Struggling against isolation (her only company is a fly) and chronic fatigue, this is where Stewart perfectly portrays Lindbergh's dedication to the task. Helped by an excellent trail by Franz Waxman and the Oscar-nominated effects by Louis Lichtenfield, Wilder's film turns out to be an engaging human-interest story that has produced a completely professional production. 7/10
