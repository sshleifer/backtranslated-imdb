A NIGHT IN McCOOL'S / (2001) *** (of four) Blake French: According to Harald Zwart, the director of "One Night at McCool's," this film is "a dark comedy about women's power over men, and how a group of people can perceive different realities." It's the same story told from three different points of view, and each time we tell the story, we try to reveal a little more about what really happened, that no one really knows. "" One Night at McCool's "marks the debut in the direction of Zwart, an award-winning commercial and music video director who began making short films at the age of eight. I always get nervous when a director of commercials and music videos becomes a filmmaker. We have already seen so many examples of how these guys think they are making another TV ad or video clip with their productions. Zwart resists this trend. He captures a specific humorous truth in "One Night at McCool's," an inventive and complex script by the late Stan Seidel, even if it's a little disconcerting. <br /> <br /> "One Night At McCool's" features three men who share their separate experiences about a particularly beautiful young woman. In a way, this movie is the comic version of "American Beauty", but in others, it's a world apart. <br /> <br /> "It all started one night at McCool's," explains each of the three men to their various listeners. There's Randy (Matt Dillon), a contest at the local bar, and his cousin, a lawyer named Carl (Paul Reiser), who stays until the place closes. Detective Dehling (John Goodman), arrives when the hall becomes the scene of the crime of the dead boyfriend of a fatal woman appropriately named Jewel (Liv Tyler). Randy is the first to see her, while an individual treats her rudely. He stands up for her, and before you can say SEXY, they are having vigorous sex and she will move in with him. At first, Randy is reluctant: "Sex and violence, all in one night? It's a little too much." But who could turn a jewel like Jewel? <br /> <br /> Jewel changes the lives of each of the three men. For Detective Dehling, she pulls him out of a gullet hole since his wife died. For Carl, she makes him forget his loving family and his nice little suburban home. For Randy, she lights up some fires, positive and negative, and later persuades him to get in touch with a bingo that plays a killer named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to put an end to his deceptive ways. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how the film perceives the three different chronicles - even the costume of Jewel is relative to the man who tells the story. Dehling sees Jewel as a mesmerizing gift from God. Carl sees Jewel as two sexy legs and many necklines. Randy is not sure what to do with her, an awakening to her tedious path to a life nowhere. The most intriguing element of this film is Jewel herself, however, deliciously touched by the always delightful Liv Tyler ("Armageddon"). She is not really interested in men, but what they can offer her. Their motives are too simple, they are not truly diabolical or evil; she is simply a young lady who learned early on that she can get what she wants out of life through her beauty. <br /> <br /> The movie is a lot of fun with the material. From the enthusiastically entertaining cast, to his wildly hilarious showdown, "One Night at McCool's" takes advantage of most of his humorous ideas. What makes the film even more fun is how the views of the three men differ. The actors also have a lot of fun with their characters. Goodman is curiously capricious; Reiser fits very well into his perverted and contorted part; Douglas is astute and mysterious in one of the funniest performances in the film; Dillon gives personality to his arrogant character, although Randy is a dull nobody; Liv Tyler is gorgeous. She injects Jewel with the perfect amount of prepotent charisma and tantalizing wit. It reminds us of Mena Suvari's intimate performance in "American Beauty." "One Night at McCool's" is the first film from the new Michael Douglas production company, Furthur Films. It is a creative, genuine and sexy production. Along the way we often get stuck in the winding structure, but this is a natural response to a movie that intentionally interweaves multiple angles into a single story. The film ends with a note that is both black and comical. This is one of those comedies in which serious events happen in a humorous way; that is, the black comedy. Many movies of this genre are either too black or too indifferent. "One Night at McCool's" is one of the few that really work. <br /> <br />
