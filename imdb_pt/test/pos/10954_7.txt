17/12/01 All I can do with this movie is to improvise on my impressions. I did not receive the "changes", do not know the "punctuation" and I am not instructed in the genre. I've always had trouble following the chord changes anyway (trumpet player, you know), so I was pretty much limited to doing the basics "keep the melody in mind" and ad lib around that. What intrigued me about this incredibly melancholic piece of black and white blues was the knot that hit me in my head and heart in an attempt to find out if I should go with the set or choose a path through the song (story). it was with the melody as usual; I kept getting lost in the changes - very deep, extensive, over my head, probably. Still, it was a gas to try and keep up. I admired the actors playing with the theme and plot. I did not see some things or heat up things that other people look like: I did not feel that the fair-skinned girl was "trying to get through" as much as she was unaware of the color issue or was trying to ignore it - at first: then she came back fighting . The pale-skinned young man (his trumpet-like but ridiculous pasta) was ambiguous, ambivalent and - perhaps his best - remote feature. What, I thought later that the shade curtain closed on this provocative piece - is the basis of such a thing? Is it a way of finding "reality" by setting up a stage, populating it with expressive characters and giving them a melody and a theme? Is it more real or true than a well-crafted script - without the benefit of editing and proofreading? Is improvisation heroic, "more artistic" - more than the work done? Where is there greater or clearer truth: in art / retrospective craftsmanship or in manufacturing and reform? Well, I'm still lost on this issue. I loved the movie; It got me lost on a cold, cloudy blue night, where I had to go home and get my horn. Guess what? I burst into a twelve-measure blues riff, tried and true - I could not get away from the melody. The reality is very scary. jaime says give them a 7 and over. I'm off duty.
