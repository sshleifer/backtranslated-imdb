Teen Deviyaan is a great movie. A very cheerful artist and a very modern film for its time in the 1960s. Music and music are great, although Majrooh's lyrics have no meaning in places. Dev Anand is a tremendous star and, as usual, does great justice to his role. Kalpana is sexy and Nanda is fine. Simi is almost right, too. The film has a great dialogue with Vrajendra Gaur, who wrote most Dev Anand films, such as Mahal, Duniya, Warrant, Jaali Note, Manzil, etc.etc. <br /> <br /> It's a story of Dev attracted by three women. - the mod Kalpana, Simi and the homemade Nanda. He finally opts for Nanda. The story is about OK, but it has been narrated in an exciting way and the dialogue and the songs and the great Dev Anand are the highlight of the film. A must-have for all Dev Anand fans.
