The recent history of East Hollywood ghost / horror remakes has been bleak. This movie will inevitably suffer the same fate, so grab a copy on e-bay or similar. <br /> <br /> It is well photographed and the sound is superb. It is recommended to view on a good screen and with a good sound system activated by 5.1 or DTS. Obviously, it's captioned, so if it gets you off, then I would not bother with that. Dubbing rarely works and simply would not do it here. <br /> <br /> It's also genuinely scary, with excellent performances from a cast that will not be familiar to Western audiences. I would particularly highlight the character of the stepmother, who was absolutely brilliant. The ending will make you want to watch it again if you can handle it. The plot is relentless, and offers no comforting moments of release along the way. <br /> <br /> If I have a small criticism, there may be a detectable influence on certain scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring. However, we have accepted direct copies of other people's ideas for Western movies for years, and so my argument is limited, which did not stop me from giving the 10/10 text. I believe that most fans of this genre will get a huge "pleasure" from this movie, which I hope is a classic.
