This is really a great movie. Full of love and humor, it forces the audience to really care about the characters and participate in their journey. Michael Parness has managed to assemble a large cast of great players, a small miracle for a first movie. No doubt they were moved to help you tell this beautiful story. David Krumoltz carries the film with its mild intensity and honesty. Natasha Lyonne is unpredictable, exasperating and yet totally adorable as Grace. It was also a big turnaround for Karen Black (great to see her onscreen again) as Grace's crazed but nice mother. There is a sense of rape everywhere, allowing us the relief of laughter when faced with the pain of life. The acting is impeccable, the editing is tight, the direction is inspired and the music creates an appropriate backdrop. Given the current blockbuster Hollywood craze, full of big budgets, big names, car crashes and special effects, 'Max & Grace' is a refreshing departure. Give yourself a treat and watch this movie.
