I've always liked this movie and I'm glad it's finally available on DVD so more viewers can see what I've been telling them all these years. Story is about a high school virgin named Gary (Lawrence Monoson), who works at a pizzeria as a delivery man and goes out with his friends David (Joe Rubbo) and Rick (Steve Antin). Gary realizes Karen (Diane Franklin), who is the new girl at school and one morning he gives her a ride and by this time he is totally in love. That night at a party he sees Rick with Karen and now he's jealous of his best friend, but he does not tell anyone his true feelings. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Rick asks Gary if he can lend his home vacant to the Grandparents, but Gary makes up an excuse for it Rick does not have Karen alone. But one night, Rick boasts Gary that he hit her on the soccer field and Gary gets furious. A few days later, in the school library, Rick and Karen argue and he asks Karen what's wrong. She tells him that she is pregnant and that Rick has dismissed her. Gary helps her by taking her to her grandmother's house and paying for her abortion. Finally, Gary tells Karen how he really feels about her and she seems receptive to his feelings, but then at his birthday party he enters Karen and Rick together again. Gary leaves without the girl! This movie ends with a much more realistic version of what life really is like. No matter how cool you are, you do not necessarily get the girl. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Boaz Davidson, who would become a quite competent action film director, and he did two things well with that. movie. First, he made sure there was plenty of free nudity, so that this was marketable to the young males who usually go to these movies. Secondly, it made the movie end with young Gary without Karen and I think the males in the audience can identify with the fact that they have been screwed no matter how hard you try and conquer a girl's heart. Yes, this movie is silly and exploitative, but it's funny and sexy. Actress Louisa Moritz almost steals the movie as sexy Carmela. Moritz has always been a popular "B" level actress and you may remember her in "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest". Like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", it has a great soundtrack and the songs played reflects what's going on in the story. But at the heart of this film there are two very good performances from Monoson and Franklin. There is nudity required by Franklin, but she still conveys the sadness of a young woman who is dumped at a crucial time. She has always been a good actress and her natural charm is very evident in this film. But this is still the story of Monoson and you can not help but feel for this guy. When the movie ends, it's his performance that stays with you. It's a solid acting job that makes it more than just a teenage sex comedy. Even with the foolish scenarios of teens trying to have sex, this movie still achieves what it wants. Underrated comedy hits target.
