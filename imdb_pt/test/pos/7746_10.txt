I absolutely fell in love with "Living in the Big Way" when I first saw it! Reason # 1 is because I love, love, and am a big fan of GENE KELLY. He was a wonderful dancer, actor and choreographer. Not to mention his extremely handsome looks and sensual personality. I love his role in this movie. He was a gentleman. This film has shown its wonderful talent for acting. I liked Marie MacDonald too. It was the first time I saw or heard anything about her, and this great movie made me a fan of her too. In fact, the whole cast of this movie was nice and great. The humor between the butler, "Everette Hanover Smythe," and the father, Mr. Morgan; The mood of Mrs. Morgan's courtroom, and especially the immediate connection of the grandmother with the concern of "LEO GOGARTY". And the GENE number "FIDO AND ME" is lovely. The opening dance number with GENE and MARIE is also very good. I would recommend anyone to see this movie. He will remain truly dear to your heart forever. Or at least have mine. And you're going to fall in love with GENE again. I rate it as my # 2 GENE KELLY MOVIE favorite, and I've seen and owned many of his films. They are part of my daily routine! So trust me when I tell you, you're going to love this movie! Watch and enjoy !!
