This is probably one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It has action, but not this bullet-flying, good guys - bad guys, van damme - stallone action, but quick action, realistic and nervous, has a plot, because by the end of the movie you do not know how this will end, aidan quinn, donald sutherland and ben kingsley are perfect, and have suspense, this movie will not let you go before you see the end of it. <br /> <br /> Although there are only a few characters, I did not find it difficult to keep my attention on the story, and as for the story, it's basic (not too complicated but simple and crude) > If you are in a movie with a good story, some action and great acting, watch this and I promise, you will not leave until you have seen the ending. The end of it.
