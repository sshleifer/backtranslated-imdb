This is the kind of movie that people of a certain age will say, "I do not think they've done more movies like that." Walter Matthau gives his usual exaggerated performance, but instead of leaving tooth marks all over the scene, leaves nice grease stains. He's like that great uncle we all know who still wears polyester plaid and shames everyone, but we still love him anyway. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon's performance reminds us why he had more Golden Globe nominations than anyone else (22). . He gives a real performance of the "ordinary, good man" even in the middle of a farce. <br /> <br /> This movie is not likely to please people who prefer blunt humor designed to confront or offend but will appeal to people who enjoy wide farce played with a serious face. <br /> <br /> The whole supporting cast is excellent in its ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character. /> Brent Spiner gives a wonderful performance as a professional version of a lounge lizard. Anyone who has known professional hosts in real life will immediately recognize the type they are playing. He blinds the guy perfectly. His version of 'slime' deserves study as a perfect example of the contrast between the absurd and the pathetic. <br /> <br /> The plot is more a straightforward subject, 'let's get married rich', which has the usual results. Just because a plot theme was done a thousand times does not mean that it is dated, but rather that it is a timeless theme. The rest of the supporting cast shows what can happen when professionals display their skills in the roles that are written to them rather than competing for the spotlight. In this film, even the actors in the second layer shine. It is also obvious that they liked to make this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot can be standard and fine, but it allows artists to shine. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real treat for people who want to see professional actors involved in their craft. The plot falls and the artists shine.
