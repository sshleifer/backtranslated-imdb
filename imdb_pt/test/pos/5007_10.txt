Spike Feresten is a comic genius. "Talkshow" demonstrates a new insight into the kind of strange ball irreverence that has made programs such as Letterman and The Daily Show successful. His sympathy is palpable. He seems to find the unique angle of the joke, not the predictable path of the sitcom ... thank God. His comedy is reminiscent of the award-winning Arrested Development (fingers crossed that 'Talkshow' has a longer lifespan). The topics he highlights tend to be those things that go unnoticed by everyone else, but when he creates a joke around them, you wonder how you missed the first time. I particularly liked the sketches ... "Unfair Target" will be a cult classic in no time. Set people on your Tivo ... this is a show not to be missed.
