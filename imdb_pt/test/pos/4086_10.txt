TV produces dozens of true movies every year. You can watch 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be used by some every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking that I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle and beautifully played drama that enveloped me from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Both brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in Luke's challenging role. The appearance of Georgia was in almost every picture. If I had any complaints, it was Gordon Clapp as the sheriff. He simply does not look or act like a southern small town man named Byron Calhoun. He looks and sounds like Medavoy, and Medavoy is not right for this part. <br /> <br /> But that's a small problem: Morrison's murders are worth watching, and not just on a rainy Saturday afternoon. If you are leaving, record it. You will not regret.
