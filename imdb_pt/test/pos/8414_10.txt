MP James Hacker did not expect him to be the next prime minister. Unlike the United States, the party is elected in Great Britain, while we Americans vote for candidates regardless of their party. Despite the differences, Paul Eddington CBE's performance as a minister who became prime minister almost overnight is aided by his senior adviser, Sir Humphrey, played by another knight, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, and veteran actor Derek Fowlds also returns to the scene. Now, instead of pleasing some people, he has to please the nation instead of his constituency. Now he has a difficult job to do even harder than before. Now he must approve the honors list and work with His Majesty also on a regular basis. Hacker is not the type of hacker. He is more than every man we like and we do not want to disgust and become a kind of villain or a cruel dictator. Now we see the Prime Minister's point of view and all the pleasure that should continue as well as deal with strikes.
