"One Minute to Pray, One Second to Die" is a quality western spaghetti with a solid cast and an interesting storyline. It's filmed beautifully, with a relatively high production value for such a film. <br /> <br /> Alex Cord does a great job portraying Clay McCord, an Outlaw who is suffering from increasingly debilitating seizures. He is seeking amnesty before his enemies approach him, but he is being too arrogant for his own good when he asks for it. Robert Ryan offers the best performance in the film as the Governor of New Mexico. Mario Brega and Arthur Kennedy are great too. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good, but it does not stand out as one of the best spaghetti westerns out there. You're missing a lot in style to be in the same league as any of the greats. It has some nice touches of spaghetti, but overall it's a bit much like an American western. This is especially evident in the musical score, which is a good thing, since the films are general, but rather boring by Euro-Western standards. The soundtrack reminds me of the song of "The Unforgiven". Although there is an interesting story here, it is told in a way that is a bit too conventional for my liking. If a fan of spaghetti western and a fan of western Hollywood had to watch a movie together, this would be the perfect compromise. <br /> <br /> All this does not mean that someone should avoid this movie. I enjoyed watching a lot. Like I said, it's a very well done film and I recommend it to anyone who likes westerns, spaghetti or others.
