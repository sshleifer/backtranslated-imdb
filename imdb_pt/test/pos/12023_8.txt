Note: I tried not to reveal any major (or final) twists, but if you're worried about this, please think about watching the movie before you continue reading - Thanks! <br /> <br /> It was obviously a fairly high budget production, launched by Paramount. The story follows the (supposedly true) exploits of man-fleece Jack Shepard in 1700 in London. He was a locksmith who was blackmailed in a life of crime by the nefarious "Thief-Hunter" to save the life of his brother. After being crossed by the Thief-Taker, we became a kind of Robin Hood-like figure and won the support of the common people. He continues to flee various prisons (including the infamous Newgate), as well as having time to "entertain" numerous noble ladies. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie, although the plot was somewhat predictable. The film was shot in Glencree and Wicklow Ireland and the sets were very well made and looked realistic. I think Clavell captured the bustling atmosphere of London in the 1700s very well, and I enjoyed his creative use of camera angles. And unlike many films depicting this period, Clavell makes no effort to show us the deplorable conditions in which the poor lived (in one scene several people fight over a meat pie that rolled in the dirt of the street ). <br /> <br /> Overall, I really liked this movie. I admit that it lacks the wonderful scenery and the underlying political commentary that Clavell's next film, The Last Valley, has (a parable of the Vietnam War), but it still deserves one or two views. It is unfortunate that I have never (to my knowledge) been released on video or DVD.
