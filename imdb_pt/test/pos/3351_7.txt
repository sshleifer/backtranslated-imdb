Adult version of Lewis Carroll's classic tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls into the bunny's den and learns to love sex and her own self-image. Made in the days when adult films were creative with plot lines rather than just a series of sex scenes, this is a small movie that looks more like the low-budget movies of their day. Despite what you may think, this movie really does have a good script with funny jokes and good songs. It's a little disobedient adult tale. If you're wondering if my recommendation is good or not, consider that the movie was only available in its non-hardcore version for most of the last three decades, simply because the movie stands out without sex. That's how I first saw the movie on cable television for years. The relatively recent release in home video on DVD has put sex back (in horribly grainy inserted clips), which makes it clear that removing the scenes was the best choice around. If you are an adult in an opening spirit with a taste for something spicy I can vividly recommend this little movie as a pleasant diversion.
