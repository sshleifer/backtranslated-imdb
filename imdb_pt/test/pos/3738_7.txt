Eichard Gere and Diane Lane again in another romantic love story. They are a great team, but somehow this movie will not be among the best. <br /> <br /> Director George Wolfe using a screenplay by Ann Peacock & John Romanao for Nicholas Sparks's novel, does a capable job . This is another tale of 2 strangers meeting and falling in love, so they are still there, so when are they about to meet again and start a life together. <br /> <br /> SPOILER, but not really. The tragedy happens, one of them dies. <br /> <br /> How many times have we seen this? <br /> <br /> Those who have never seen tearjerkers like this one will like it more than I do. This story has about every clich√© that exists. <br /> <br /> The only reason this has the ratings I will give. is because of the good performance and excellent production. The cast beyond our 2 stars includes Christopher Meloni, Viola Davis and Scott Glenn. they all give really good performances and they do the best with the material they got <br /> <br /> There is a good, but not finished, storm sequence, Sex scenes are well done, no nudity and no lack of language , <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (of 4) 82 points (out of 100) 7 out of 10
