This is not the nasty video Night of the Demon as there are more than one. In fact, there is only one, but it multiplies. <br /> <br /> After Suzanne (Scream Queen Linnea Quigley), she passes it to the gothic girl Angela (Amelia Kinkade) through a long kiss. Then we see Linnea showing us her quigleys in the bathroom. It shows a lot more as Jay (Lance Fenton) thinks he's in for a bit of fun. <br /> <br /> Soon, everything literally goes to hell as bodies drop one by one and are possessed. Judy (Cathy Podewell) and Max (Philip Tanzini) are the last two trying to escape. Max does not help much, leaving Judy to find a way out. <br /> <br /> The makeup was absolutely fantastic, and the only thing that kept it even worse was the extremely long construction for the public. The old man (Harold Ayer) who appears at the beginning will be back and will have his desserts right. Linnea Quigley may be the Queen of Scream, but Cathy Podewell has definitely shown the biggest lungs in this movie.
