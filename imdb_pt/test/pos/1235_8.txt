While caricatures and / or references to people from the entertainment industry or things or even product brands are usually a staple in shorts like this, they are not used in quantity here. Most individual jokes are pretty generic. As I will give examples, there will be spoilers below: There are only three (well, technically four - there's a quick at the end of the drawing) caricatures I've seen, which is a little low for that kind of short , although one is a very active character. They are Jack Benny (as Jack Bunny), Leopold Stowkowski and the inimitable Ned Sparks (as a crab in a can-odds are very good that if a crab was involved in a short Warner Brothers in the 1930s, the cartoon used would be Ned Sparks). There are also references to Billy Rose's Aquacade and a riff on a radio show character named "Henry Aldrich" (coming, mother!), A Superman game here and the villain is a takeoff in "King Kong." That's it for that kind of joke. <br /> <br /> The products themselves are more generic and the jokes are more played on basic items in unusual situations like turtles coming out of soup cans to attack the villain like tanks. , cans of tomato soup making "the can-can", gingerbread men who turn into paratroopers, using parachute fabrics and so on. The jokes are very good and is a great example of a Bob Clampett cartoon. director up to this point and although it's nothing close to his best work, it's nothing to sneeze at either. This short can be found in Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Vol. 3, which is a great set that I recommend. itself is also recommended.
