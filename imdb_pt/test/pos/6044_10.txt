I went by the camp at MCRD Parris Island in 1953 and this film is such a precise representation of what the boots went through at that time, even to bury that sand flea. Many of the film's "actors" were active marines. This movie may be more fun for the Marines than others, but I feel that the film itself is very well done, and Jack Webb has made a "good ID." Semper Fi!
