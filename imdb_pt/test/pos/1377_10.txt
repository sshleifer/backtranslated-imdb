Okay, so maybe it's because I'm from northeastern Scotland and I talk like the guys in this movie, but I found it a lot of fun. It's a lot of fun to be sure, but a lot of effort was made to make the film look great and the actors certainly gave it all. I was really affected when they died. In particular, when the captain finally fell. The script? Well, it's a 2-halve game. The initial half of the film is well written and sharp. The last half hour is not so good, with many unanswered questions. This will no doubt bother others as it bothered me. But, nevertheless, good fun and a very smart first feature of Sturton.
