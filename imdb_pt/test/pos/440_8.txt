Although it does not look very promising for a long time, Renoir's French Cancan turns out to be a charming film without effort. The story is cliché: a laundry girl, Nini (Françoise Arnoul), is discovered by a nightclub owner, Danglard (Jean Gabin). Danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and leaves her current girlfriend, the two return to their former lovers. Nini has to choose whether to return her humble life with the baker, continue with the show with her employer, oh, or become a princess, as a prince falls in love with her at one point as well. I'm glad that the movie was not the most obvious choice, as a smaller movie would certainly have. The film ends with the opening of the new Danglard nightclub, the Moulin Rouge, and some beautiful numbers of music and dance. The first one, "Complainte de la Butte," which also provides the basis for most of the film's soundtrack, is simply one of the most beautiful songs ever written, and Renoir himself wrote. If you are a fan of Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film Moulin Rouge, you will recognize the melody, which appears near the beginning of the film, sung by Rufus Wainwright. Although not very prominent in this film, everyone I know who owns the soundtrack loves it. In addition to having one of the most adorable songs ever written, French Cancan is also proud to be one of the most engaging protagonists in the story. It's hard not to fall in love with this girl. 8/10
