Wow!! I picked it up at IFC recently after watching But Im A Cheerleader. I've never heard of this movie, but the description sounded remotely interesting. I entered with low expectations and now I must say that this is one of the best love stories of all time in the movies. Robin Tunney does a great job portraying a person with tourettes. The relationship between the two and the minimal details of the film are so accurate and credible. I usually hate "romance" and love movies, but this movie really touched me. I recommend this movie to anyone with the ability to view.
