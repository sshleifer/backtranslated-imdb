When the trailer for Accept first appeared, many people started getting excited to see it ... very excited. Whoever blamed them seemed like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accept looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Aceito is not the kind of movie meant to be a good movie. It's to be a movie that pleases your crowd without much effort being given. That said, for those of you expecting a great movie, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like that. Think about it, and you'll really enjoy the movie (because you'll get rid of your idea that the movie will be fantastic.) FINAL: Watch the movie and have fun, but do not look for anything groundbreaking.
