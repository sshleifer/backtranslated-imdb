I am Sociologist / Anthropologist, specialist in the field of Symbolic Interactionism, and I must say that this film exhibits high quality in the symbolic context throughout the film. For anyone who has not yet seen this, I recommend you also read Victor E. Frankl's "Man's Search For Ultimate Meaning." I think you will be able to draw some amazing correlations. <br /> <br /> That said, I would like to say that despite the fact that the main characters are gay, this is not a story about being gay. This is a story about seeking and finding meaning in life, despite the difficulties and challenges, the pain and the terror that stand in your way. This is a story of search and pursuit of balance, wholeness and happiness.
