This is a great movie to watch, since it's so well directed by Andrzej Wajda, but at the same time I wish the film had more depth in terms of its history. It is a historically relevant film about the last days of the French Revolution but still the film forgets to focus on the character's motives, making the film perhaps a bit shallow to consider this a brilliant and relevant film for what. <br /> <br /> Somehow, it does not make the movie less interesting to watch. It is done with passion and attention to detail. all aspects of the film are very similar, such as scenarios, costumes and camera. <br /> <br /> Also the story still works as powerful, although at the same time it could have been much better and more powerful with a bit more character development and historical information of insight. Guess if you are completely familiar with the French Revolution and the stories of Danton and Robespierre in particular, this movie will be perfect for you to watch. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat typical for a French film to tell a slow and subtle story, without ever treading too much in detail. Often this works with charm, but in this case the film could have been done with a bit more depth. In addition, this film is still a good example of French cinema, despite the fact that it is being directed by a Polish director and also stars many Polish actors. <br /> <br /> GÃ©rard Depardieu is great in his role, although the film also decides to focus too much on many other different characters. The movie may have a lot of characters, but each performance is great, so it never becomes a big complaint, unless it reduces the story a little at certain points. <br /> A great movie that could have been brilliant. <br /> <br /> 8/10
