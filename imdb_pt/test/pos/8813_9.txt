I have a completely partial point of view, mainly because I live and enjoy the cultural lifestyle of the club. Being a DJ and frequent club goer, I see the honesty in this movie and I love it. If you do not know the rave club / culture, then it will be a major foray into this culture for those who do not know it firsthand. The honest picture of human emotion and issues on the part of Jip I loved. The characters were well built and I really enjoyed this movie. I really do not like the fact that you have to write ten lines on this site. I will write at least 6 or 7, but I feel I can portray my point with less than ten. Here are some extra lines to make the gods of IMDb happy.
