This is, unfortunately, the last concert of HBO recorded by Carlin, of a series that lasted more than 30 years. Although this may not be your "best" job, it is great, fun and thought-provoking. This recording is also a bit different from most of his other shows which is a little longer than most of his other shows. Throughout his long, prolific and influential career, Carlin has moved from the most humorous observation and fart jokes, toward a more "humanitarian" view of society and culture. His focus on the English language and euphemisms has grown over the years and culminates in this performance. However, I would say that his audio book "When will Jesus bring the pork chops?" it best shows your intelligence with respect to language, euphemisms, and the breaking of our values. It's Bad For Ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer. <br /> <br /> If you are offended by the foul language or the contempt of the church, you probably will not like anyone standing up for Carlin material. However, if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and can tolerate language and blasphemy, you would probably enjoy this show a lot.
