Something that I think some people miss from the great science fiction is that it predicts a part of the future. No other theatrical movie I can remember has predicted that when the space shuttle went to study Halley's Comet, a disaster would occur! Some differences were: "Churchill" (the space shuttle in the film) actually went to the comet, the "Challenger" was only in low orbit; The "Churchill" was simply burned from the inside, while the "Challenger" exploded - the vampires had to return to earth. A great resemblance (and this is always bad luck!) Both had mixed male / female teams - the legend of Comet Halley and the disaster continues! <br /> <br /> Other than that, there is much more to be said about this movie that has not been said before. As an outer space / science fiction / horror / sex film individually, it did not provide anything really new, but as in all the great dishes is the combination that counts. And together, this was a highly original and satisfying combination. <br /> <br /> I just wanted Mathilda May to drain her victims through another part of her body!
