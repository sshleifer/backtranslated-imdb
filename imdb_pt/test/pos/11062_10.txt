I would rate this movie at the top of my Ingrid Bergman movie list. The beauty of Ingrid apart, her talent is evident in scene after scene. She was sad, evil, witty, snobbish, seductive, delightfully funny, caring, affectionate, sad, distressed, happy, etc. You mention, she was all those things and more. -And so convincing. Ingrid plays a notorious woman (Clio) who returns to New Orleans and falls in love with a Texas player, Gary Cooper (Clint). I particularly loved the scene where they are sitting at the dinner table without saying anything, just looking at each other. She in an elegant white dress and he in a beautiful white cowboy clothes, sitting there looking at her with adoration. What chemistry! How sweet!
