Biographical tale of the life of Charles Lindbergh, the first man to fly alone over the Atlantic in 1927, aboard his plane, the Spirit of St. Louis. <br /> <br /> Although not among director Billy Wilder's best films, it has some very impressive production values, especially for a 50-year-old film. The story is well told and the performances are also good, although they are not remarkable. One final limiting factor about the narrative is that Lindbergh flew alone and without a radio, which means he has no one to talk to. This required some different storytelling techniques, such as internal monologues, talking to a fly, and the occasional attacks of self-talk, especially when exhaustion sets in. Also to avoid an extended sequence of the famous flight, it is interspersed with flashbacks of his life and methodical preparations for flight. <br /> <br /> Charles Lindbergh was a huge hero of his day, but his controversial beliefs would tarnish his legacy a little. Nonetheless, he would continue to contribute to the field of aviation and assist as a civil aircraft consultant for the US effort in World War II. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart certainly had the background to support his interpretation of Lindbergh. He rose to the rank of colonel of the US Air Force during World War II and, while in post-war reservations, would attain the post of Brigadier General.
