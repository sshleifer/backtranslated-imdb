I would have to say that, in general, Barbie Movies impressed me. I have a fanatic 5 year old Barbie niece and she watches them all the time, so needless to say I've seen many Barbie on these holidays but I'm not tired of them. <br /> <br /> This film visually has a lot to offer, especially the backgrounds, and the character animation has improved with each new movie. One thing I noticed in particular was a big improvement in the animation of Barbie's hair in this movie. It has a nice variety of snippets of classical music and I think this is great because it exposes a new generation to the classics. This movie is well worth it, especially if you have young relievers. They will have fun for hours!
