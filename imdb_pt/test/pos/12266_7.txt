Essential viewing for anyone watching TV news as this can help to become a little more skeptical or even skeptical. On a personal note, I remember taking a course a few years ago about being interviewed for TV - what to do, what not to do. The course instructors impressed us that the TV news was a "show-biz branch." This depressing view, which is probably even more valid today than when it was made, is reinforced by this film. No matter the journalistic integrity, what counts is the ability to look good and smile well. And make sure you do not worry about the camera. <br /> <br /> The interactions between the three main characters form the centerpiece, each with its own ambitions, capabilities and beliefs. Brooks picks up these differences and puts them in the volatile setup of a TV news studio, and adds more than a pinch of love interest to the mix. The result is a complex, albeit rather long picture of how we pledge ourselves every day to meet our ambitions and lead others with us. It's always fun, although the final scene was perhaps unnecessary, given everything that happened before.
