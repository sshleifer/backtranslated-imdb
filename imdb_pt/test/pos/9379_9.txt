Tense and organic, Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is a distinct thriller of suspense, an unlikely "message" movie using the visual and devices of the noir cycle. <br /> <br /> Bivouack in Washington, DC, a company of soldiers his uneasiness about going out in bars. Three of them end up in the apartment of a stranger where drunk and belligerent Robert Ryan beat his host (Sam Levene) to death because he is Jewish. Detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum, who is assigned to Ryan's clothing. The suspicion falls on the second of three (George Cooper), who disappeared. Ryan kills his third friend (Steve Brodie) to guarantee his silence before Young approaches. <br /> <br /> Aided by John Paxton's screenplay, Dmytryk draws accurate performances from his three starring Bobs. Ryan, of course, makes his prototype of White Male Angry (and to the utmost), while Mitchum underestimates his characteristic alert indifference (his role, however, is not central); Young people may never have been better. Gloria Grahame makes her first full version of the smart and vulnerable mouth bum, and, as a sad bag that came into her life, Paul Kelly haunts us in a little peripheral paper that he makes memorable. The politically engaged Dmytryk may inevitably succumb to sermons, but he is practically confined to Young's recollection of how his Irish grandfather died in the hands of fanatics a century earlier (thus, by the way, extending the chronology to the limit). At least there is no attempt to give an explanation, no matter how superficial, about why Ryan hates the Jews (and countrymen and ...). <br /> <br /> Curiously, Crossfire survives even to the great change caused - the novel is based on (The Brick Foxhole), of Richard Brooks, that dealt with a murder that abuses of the homosexuals. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale. Holocaust news, however, began to emerge from the ashes of Europe, so Hollywood was encouraged to register its protest against anti-Semitism (studios always trembled at the possibility of offending any potential ticket buyer). But while the shift from homophobia to anti-Semitism generally works, the details do not fit so well. The victim is talking to a solitary drunken young soldier, then inviting him to return home seems strange, although (or especially since) there is a girlfriend in tow. This raises the question of whether this scenario was inadvertently retained or left as a discrete hint for the original mechanism generating Ryan's murderous fury.
