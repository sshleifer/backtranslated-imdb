I wish there were more movies about middle-aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of the moral road of life provide an interesting insight. There seems to be a different pattern of judgment in women who have extramarital affairs than in men. Amy Watson's offensive and humiliating behavior toward her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and you can expect a torrent of condemnation against the man. If she found her husband annoying and critical, she could have told him, she left, and waited for a big financial deal on divorce. The country and scenes of London are wonderfully authentic and rich, while the autumnal weather magnificently enhances the melancholy background. The ending is perfect, so in tune with real adult life.
