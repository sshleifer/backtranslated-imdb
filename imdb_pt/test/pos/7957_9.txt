I always had this concept that Korean films were about comedy and drama, but "Christmas in the fall" changed my point of view. This movie is so simple. It has no melodramatic scene or the best comedy scenes. Not a single scene where the actors scream out loud. Not even a scene where the actor and actress kiss, not even a simple kiss. And yet, this movie is able to reach viewers in ways that I know existed. The end of the movie left me speechless. I do not even cry, but my eyes were red. This film left me with a feeling that I can hardly describe in words. <br /> <br /> I do not think I can recommend this movie to everyone, but I highly recommend this movie to people who want to watch the real movies. 9,4 / 10
