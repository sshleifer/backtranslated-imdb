Everyone who identifies this as a simple copy of 'Elephant' - there are no other comments you can make about the movie on its own merits as an individual movie (regardless of their apparent similarities to other films). <BR> <BR> Everyone who questions the validity of the film - in terms of its stereotypical characters (compulsory gay, athlete, handicapped boy, etc.) - do not know how much time has passed since you were school - but no matter how amateurish the acting may be - the events that occur are surprisingly close to what can actually happen. <br /> <br /> And all those who disregard the film are so simple: only six teenagers with the regular anguish of adolescence pushing one over the limit ... someone stopped to think, and noticed that the girl who took his life was not really one of those six !! As one comment points out - she had a screen time of maybe 2 minutes at most (excluding the final scenes). I think the purpose of the film is not just to make a point of teen angst, and how far that can lead someone - but also that apparently it is not obvious who is always in danger of committing such an act (suicide) ...
