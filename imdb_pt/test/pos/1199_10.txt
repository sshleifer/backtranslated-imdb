The anti-war musical "Hair" is my cult film number one. I do not know how many times I've seen this movie in theaters and on VHS, or how many times I've listened to the CD with the impressive soundtrack, and now this work has finally been released on DVD in Brazil. The pacifist and touching story is still surprising, a hymn of freedom, friendship, and freedom of choice, and portrays the resistance of a generation against the stupidity of war. I do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the 1970s counterculture and their dreams, since the present world is probably worse than in the 1970s. I do not remember who won the Oscar in 1979 but Treat Williams and John Savage deserved it at least an indication for their impressive performances. Beverly D'Angelo is extremely beautiful in the role of a spoiled high-class teenage hypocrite. I've seen "Hair" probably more than twelve times, and my eyes always get wet while Berger walks to the plane singing "It's me, it's me, it's me", and I start crying with his gravestone in the graveyard. I believe this is one of the most beautiful, sad and touching conclusions in the history of cinema. My wife, daughter and son also love this movie; so I can guarantee that "Hair" is timeless and recommended for any audience. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Hair"
