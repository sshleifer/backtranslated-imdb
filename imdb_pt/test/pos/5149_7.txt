Roy Andersson has managed to create something that defies almost every convention of what a movie should be, a work of art that is both beautiful, funny and evocative. The end result is a touching, if somewhat fractured, tale about humanity in its simplest and most honest forms. <br /> <br /> It is unlikely that this will attract everyone, in fact the mood is so well adjusted that it is unlikely that many get into its wavelength. The almost absurdly long takes, the embarrassing silences and the consistent medium takes will surely fend off even the most willing audience. But it is in these disconnected tales and unconventional thinking that Andersson shapes a world where every character seems to take center stage in his own absurd way. Each scene is absorbed by the desolate environments, with the characters seemingly left alone in their own strangeness. It's a difficult piece to watch at times, even because, like many of his scenes, it requires patience. But while some may greet you on an artistic throne, others will simply look in confusion. It's a movie that mixes discreet humor with the heart's own brand
