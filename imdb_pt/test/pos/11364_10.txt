In 1961, this series was shown on local TV here in Southern California. I and many others are already losing the BBC to tape or DVD ever since. Now, all of a sudden, here it is on Amazon. I pre-ordered in January and now here on March 30 arrived. It was a long wait (48 years). Worth it? So far I've only watched Richard II (I've only had the DVD since 2 hours) and I can truly say YEA !!! totally worth the wait. The acting, the direction and the production are excellent and even better than I remember. Production is in B & W, but somehow it fits. The video is clear and very good, the sound is flawless. More proof of how timeless Shakespeare really is. <br /> <br /> I gave this 10 stars, although I have seen only 1 of the 8 moves. I am sure that when I saw them, I would change my rating to at least a 12. <br /> <br /> It is currently in stock on Amazon (US 1 region) at a reasonable price. <br /> <I'd better stop now so I can watch it again. The next one is Henry, the IV, part 1 of which is my favorite game of Shakespeare.
