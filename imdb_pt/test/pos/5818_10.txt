Life is crazy. You're crazy, I'm crazy, we're all crazy. We are all a little Minnie and a little Moskowitz. Sometimes it seems best to be sensible ... but then what can you be missing out on? <br /> <br /> You have to be you. You do not have to park cars and scream semi-randomly at people, but you can not hide behind a veil (or sunglasses) and pretend and act like everything is fine. And sometimes, you really have to throw caution to the wind, because why else are you alive? <br /> <br /> I will not 'evaluate' this love in comparison to the other films of Cassavetes, because they are all absolutely 100% unique works and each their own individual act of expression and exploration of our lives. In that sense, all are great and comparisons are odious. Sure, this movie has a crazy quality, sometimes maddening, but in the wonderful and liberating ending that all your movies have - you never know what will happen next, and you never know what the characters will think, do or feel Next. Neither the characters themselves - and do we really want to live our lives otherwise? Unlike Moskowitz, you can have a great job and judiciously punch money into your IRA but still live the life of an adventurer within your feelings, your spirit and your own life experience. Yes, we can have both, that's what Cassavetes shows us. Thank goodness someone did.
