Batman Returns is more gothic and somber than its predecessor, and I really like that. Moreover, the scenery is darker, and the whole environment is saddened, along with the creepy music composed by the talented Danny Elfman. <br /> <br /> However, I did not like the idea of ​​making Penguin is a monster, unlike comics where he is human. Even though it looks like a monster, it shows that it has a human dignity, and I felt very sorry for it when it saw the tombstones of its deceased parents. But still, he was a dangerous villain indeed, and he needed to be stopped. Michael Keaton did a "tour de force" with his return as the Dark Knight, and this time he is powerful as in the original Batman. It's not hard to understand why he's called Batman in public sometimes ... <br /> <br /> In addition, Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and well-equipped in her role, and she gave a faithful performance as the villain / crime fighter dressed as a cat. Actually, the actors did a masterful job with Batman Returns, which made it a hit movie. <br /> <br /> If you liked Batman, watch his incredible sequel because it is very valuable to the Dark Knight's hardcore. lovers. <br /> <br /> Steve Baillargeon
