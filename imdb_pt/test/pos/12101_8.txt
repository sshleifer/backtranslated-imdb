Faith Akin made me realize once more the depth of my passion for this city called Istanbul. Being touted as a city of cultural mosaics, Faith Akin contributed to this addressing through the music mosaics made in the film. In addition, the climax of the film, in my opinion, is the scene in which Muzeyyen Senar (a diva of Turkish music) sings at age 86 as she did in her younger years and wraps the raki glass in the air without spilling a drop , which is a traditional act in raki culture. She is simply wonderful. Seks Aksu (a Turkish pop singer) with her mystical and significant looks at the end of her song, which gives the film its Turkish title, makes the scene a climax. Last but not least, the beautiful landscape of Istanbul can make you feel nostalgic if you are away. Watch out!
