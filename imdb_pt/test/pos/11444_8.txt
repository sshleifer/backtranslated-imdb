I saw "Night of the Demons 2" before seeing "Night of the Demons". Unfortunately, my old Blockbuster thought it a good idea to have the continuation, but not the first. Looney, huh? Now, I think all horror fans need this movie. It's like McDonald's, you know it's bad for you and you'd rather have The Cheesecake Facotory (or any other more expensive restaurant you prefer), but you can not help but want the cheap stuff. Night of the Demons has it all: its innocent, sexy, follows the rules chicka-dee, its symbolic black face, which surprisingly is not dead. You're a naughty girl, you bitchy type, your girl or your black guy, the silly ball, the extravagant set-ups of a haunted house, bad acting and a lot of unnecessary nudity. Is not that great? I mean, I know deep down in my heart that this was really bad, but it was bad for horror movies. Terror fans should enjoy and enjoy! <br /> <br /> 8/10
