I blame "Birth of a Nation" myself - for starting the long tradition of transvestites in Hollywood history, of which there may be few more examples than this. In addition to getting the names of Custer and his 7th Cavalry, Crazy Horse and the Sioux and President Grant spelled correctly, correct geography and the fact that Custer and his men were in fact exterminated to a man, the rest only takes hyperbole and invention ridiculous limits. Play in some frank scenes of the purest exposition (try Custer and his wife over the fake "Gold Rush" to excuse the invasion of Sioux territory, Custer's testimony in front of Congress defending the rights of the Indians and everything, Custer invading the office of the president to beg to return to his post), honestly, there is much more of the same, some of these almost comical scenes in his greed ... ... And yet, and yet, it is still a great actioner with Flynn as dashing as always, DeHavilland as captivating as ever, young Anthony Quinn taking a start as Crazy Horse and director Walsh as a barnstorming as ever in his depiction of crowds scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences. Ford taught us in "Liberty Valance" to believe in the legend before the truth. Here I think we're closer to the legend of the legend, but hey, it's just a movie and a wonderfully nice classic Hollywood movie!
