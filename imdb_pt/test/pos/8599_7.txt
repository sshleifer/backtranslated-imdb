Nothing is worse than the genocides in the history of our world. This film attempts to describe the horror faced by a particular family - a common narrative device - in the world of Hiroshima's atomic bomb. The most memorable parts are the graphic and sad images that the people of Hiroshima face after the war. History, however, becomes more concerned with the effect on a particular group of people and how they deal with their lives; in other words, if you do not care about them, the movie gets annoying. It is difficult not to care, however, when the homeland of a family is destroyed. I'm not sure if I would recommend this movie because it says too little politically and honestly has not kept my interest in family issues.
