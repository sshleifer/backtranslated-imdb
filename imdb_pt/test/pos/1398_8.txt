Screamers is an Italian fantasy film (L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce) bought by Roger Corman and released through his New World Pictures. Of course Corman has to sculpt his initials by having one of his lackeys (Dan T. Miller) direct some additional images before he is released in the states. <br /> <br /> L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce is a very entertaining version of Dr. Moreau's Island. It is 1891 and Claudio Cassinelli is a castaway on a mysterious island with some newly escaped convicts. Claudio is faced with stellar Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson. Johnson plays the coward Edmund Rackham: a man who is able to manipulate scientist Joseph Cotton to turn the local native population into deep-sea diving amphibians, (they look like a cross between the creature of the Black Lagoon and one of The Humanoids From the Deep), convincing Cotton that mutations are being created for the highest of scientific and humanitarian motives. Having discovered the lost city of Atlantis, Rackham is using the amphibious creatures to plunder his treasures. Sexy Barbara Bach plays the daughter of Cotton, who has a psychic bond with these mutations. In a memorable scene, Bach takes a midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little to the imagination. Claudio discovers that one of the condemned that he made friendship was transformed into a guillote creature and then all the hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> Shot at the same time and in the same place as Zombie 2, Richard Johnson did not. t still have to change suits between movies. The house where the experiments happen is the same one that Johnson uses to perform experiments in Zombie 2. Talk about economic filming! <br /> <br /> The additional footage shows some bloody beheadings, (the way to Roger!), and ridiculously evil Cameron Mitchell doing his best pirate imitation. All that is missing is the parrot. <br /> <br /> Spanish title: Le Continent Des Hommes Poissons
