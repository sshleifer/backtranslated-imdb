Firstly, I was a fan of the program when my PBS station started showing it in 1981. I learned a lot about the program and the people who participated or contributed to the program. <br /> <br /> This last installment of Doctor Who made a great impression on me. The original series, also known as the classic series, was ridiculed by bad special effects and / or unstable sets. Well, that's no longer true. The special effects are impressive, but what's even better is writing. You get a chance to learn more about our beloved Doctor and maybe a little bit of why he loves both planet Earth. Without giving much attention, it is a very interesting series to watch. Christopher Eccelston brought in a side of the Doctor that we could never see, a bitter and angry but still loving at the same time. <br /> <br /> A MUST SEE!
