I watched this movie every time I was on cable and I never got old. Who can forget some of the best lines in the history of cinema? --- JOHNNY CAT FAT PLAYERS !! JOHNNY'S FAT BOY BURGERS !! and LOOK BETWEEN GIANT MELONS! I used to wish I could run all over town on a treasure hunt as fun as this one. It's an all time favorite and I'm happy to know it's in the video! I'm sure that's where MTV got its original premise for the Road Rules series.
