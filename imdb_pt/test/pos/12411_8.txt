This episode of "TFTD" from the first season, titled ironically "Answer Me", is a very well done and memorable episode, and takes a shocking turn in the end. You have Jean Marsh as a hill up and was LA actress who moved to New York for a test and is living in an apartment provided by an old friend. Strangely, every night she is kept awake by a telephone ringing in the apartment next door, but curiously, the residence where the telephone rings remains unoccupied, since the guests have been dead for many years. Finally she has to give in but she should have followed the phone and not answered the phone without anyone at home, since it is bad to get involved in a phone with a life of its own! Overall good episode strange, although on a supernatural phone is still suspense and it twists well in the end.
