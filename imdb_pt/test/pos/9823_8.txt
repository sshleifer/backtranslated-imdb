Like many others, I was drawn to the combination of Pollack, Ford, and Scott-Thomas. I had enjoyed Pollack and Ford's work on Sabrina, a well-made movie, and a careful rewrite of the old stuff. Upon learning that this film was in production, I ordered and read the book. Immediately, it seemed like this would be a harder story to film. The characters are not always friendly, there is little or no humor and the author makes numerous shortcuts to focus on his main theme: this, since each would see the other as the only one who shares the unique combination of loss and betrayal brought by the accident, the spouses completely surprised of the adulterers would search each other. Moreover, he imagines that the resolution could come to both through a bitter exploration of the hidden lives of adulterers and that this "thick and thin" experience could yield a deeper love than each had previously. Although much of the book deals with its bitterness and builds hatred of its former partners, in the end, acceptance and forgiveness are found. The script of the film retains only the air crash and the shared situation of the spouses. Where the woman is the aggressive researcher in the book, she is the man in the movie and the woman is never a willing co-investigator. The film has a completely new dramatic sub-plot for Harrison Ford, which seems even more artificial than the double coincidence of the plane crash. The sub-plot of the "congresswoman for re-election" for women is also new, but works better. Audience expectations of pure romance or romantic comedy can not be met because this story focuses on a very bitter pill. Where resolution and forgiveness are achieved in the book, however, lifting the burden of the reader's bitterness and allowing for levity, there is no corresponding moment in the film. Although forgiveness is never insinuated, we are led to suppose that healing after a shot doubles duty. Ford's character does not have to be a man so uncertain of a few words and the change of accent of Scott-Thomas is a bit disconcerting at first. This movie is not the dead loss suggested by others. It is, however, a film difficult to appreciate because the rewriting and the adaptation to the screen are below the standard previously achieved by the director.
