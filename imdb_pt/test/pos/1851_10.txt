I love this movie! It has everything! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job, co-writing, directing and co-starring in this film. David Duchovny is simply hot. and Minnie Driver is as cute as ever. To combine all this talent with David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson and Jim Belushi, you have an Oscar-winning movie! I'm surprised they did not get one. if you have not seen it, go rent the DVD, watch it once and then post the comments of the directors ... Bonnie Hunt is Fabulous!
