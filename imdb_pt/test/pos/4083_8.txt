I picked it up on local Mexican television at 2:00 in the morning and decided to give it a shot since it is based on a real case that deals with the murder of the typical All American family (a father, a mother and a small child) , the tips point to Walker being the killer because he had strong differences with his father.A short time later, when Walker and Luke are taken to the sheriff's department to be examined by the lie detector machine, things turn out to be very different ... <br /> <br /> In addition, when Walker and Luke attend a meeting with their father's lawyer, they find out that Luke would receive $ 200,000 and Walker is out of heresy. <br /> <br /> Luke immediately buys a convertible < <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is an excellent mystery movie that deals with betrayal, ambition, feelings and cold blood and very cold. <br /> <br /> I know the real names have changed, but still the experience is the same.Try this movie.I know that there are hundreds of "based on real murders" or similar events, but this one is really worthy. Pure quality in acting, direction and plot.
