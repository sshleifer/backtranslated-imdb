I am a hard fan of the Army of the parents and nothing is going to change that. I have all the tapes, DVDs and audiobooks and every time I watch / hear the new ones. <br /> <br /> The movie. The film is a sequence of certain episodes, Man and the Hour, Enemy Within the Gates, Battle School and many others with a different advantage. The introduction of a new general instead of Captain Square was a brilliant step - especially when he would not cash the check (something that is rarely done now). <br /> <br /> The first few years of equipment and equipment acquisition follow. uniforms, initialization and training. All in all, it's a great movie for a boring Sunday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Two draw back. One of them is the false accent of the Germans (comes one, the Germans do not pronounce the letter "W" like us) and Two Liz Frazer's cast instead of the familiar Janet Davis. I like Liz in other movies as the uploads but she does not carry this properly and Janet Davis would have been the better choice.
