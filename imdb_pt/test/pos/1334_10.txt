Despite his critics, I enjoyed it immensely. Eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum. Soderberg has done the hard edge arts before, won the Oscar, is at the top of his game. Ocean's 12 is light, commercial, cute, Steve's day at Midway if you want. I'm not usually a fan of Zeta-Jones, but even I must admit that Kate is impressive in this movie. He's finishing the screams of an upcoming game and I'll be one of the millions who will gather to see George's 120 minutes and Matt and Brad parlay through Clooney's digs on Lake Como as they steal a rich evil guy again and again . If we tolerate 3 portions of The Lord of the Rings, I ask if we can drool over Clooney's salt and pepper lid just one more time?
