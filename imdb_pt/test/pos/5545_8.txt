This is a fun movie with subtle intent. His off-beat comedy is hilarious to me, unfunny to my friends. The soundtrack is perfect. <br /> <br /> I own this on VHS and watched it often because it's simply a fun and funny love story with great performances from all the directors (albeit using only Joan Cusack) as a great hair perch has been a waste of her talent I know, I know, she was still young ...). <br /> <br /> On a sad note, I decided to check the DVD last night (instead of watching my VHS tape), and it was SHOCKED to find many crucial cutscenes. And in the copy I watched, there were no special features of deleted scenes: it was as if the deleted scenes never existed !! I'm so glad I bought the used VHS at a flea market. <br /> <br /> Of course there was a lot of choreography in that, which is another reason why I love it so much. It takes a lot of skill, talent and genius to move through scenes like Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell and Matthew Modine from scene to scene (note the scene in which the supermarket carts converge, the rolling on the floor during the Miami shooting, the disaster There's a very "theatrical" feeling for this movie, which can be the turn-off for so many whose bad comments follow: I know some viewers who do not understand very well this style, confuse the exaggerations and the exaggerated performances of bad performance and worse direction. Not so. Jonathan Demme does a great job bringing to life the whole company and their respective roles. <br /> <br /> The opening credits and first scene are also among my all-time favorites (plus opening credits favorites / first scene: Fly Away Home) <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Matthew Modine has been so fiercely ignored by the eyes of the public; I really like him and found his PERFECT cast in the role of Mike Smith. In fact, this movie is well made from soup to nuts: everyone is believable and faithful to their role. As for the question of waiting for the public to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians - why not? I thought they got it perfectly well. <br /> <br /> Charming, fun, exciting ... what's not to like? If you want some fun, watch this quirky and colorful adventure-crowd love story.
