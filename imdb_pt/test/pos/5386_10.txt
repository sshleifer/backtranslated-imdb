I saw "Heaven-Ship" ("Himmelskibet") at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile, Italy. What a great movie! This Danish steampunk saga is the thrilling tale of the first trip to Mars in a time when wireless telegraphy has not been perfected. The spacecraft does not have a radio, and the heroes are brought back from the landing field via horsecart. Even the intertitles are delicious ... some of them written in couplets rhymed in the original Danish. <br /> <br /> The actors' performances are laughable, largely stratified from hand to forehead. But the sets are surprising, easily surmounting anything Georges Melies did a decade earlier (or Die Frau im Mond, a decade later). Of course, the plot is simplistic. The spacecraft's crew consists of seven skinny men and one overweight. Guess which one cracks. Curiously, everyone in this movie (except the dubious Professor Dubius) ardently believes in God. Even the Martians. <br /> <br /> Impressively, scenarists have the good sense to recognize that a trip to Mars is not a joke: title cards state that scientists take two years to build their spacecraft (which has a propeller)) and six months to get to Mars. During the construction sequence, there is an extremely impressive setup that must have been choreographed: dozens of workers rush through the construction site in different directions, without hesitation and without collisions. Danish scientists have christened their ship "Excelsior" ("packaging materials"?) And set sail for Mars, although the Moon and Venus are closer. When the ship (which flies horizontally, not vertically) lands on Mars, it is greeted by "Marsboerne" - Martians - who become Nordic blondes, all highly developed pacifists and vegetarians. (As a highly developed meat eater, I resented that part.) Conveniently, Mars turns out to have an Earth-like atmosphere, as well as the same gravity. In an outer photo of the Martian landscape, the apparent magnitude of the Sun when viewed from Mars is the same as when viewed from Earth. I could not help but notice that all the Martian sages are men. In fact, female elders are thin on the floor: both the Earth-born hero and the Martian maiden are motherless. Martians speak a universal language, wear ankhs in their garments, and greet Earth's visitors with a globe of earth ... which of course they keep with their North Pole up. <br /> <br /> This Martian maiden is Marya. , played by a beautiful ethereal Danish actress. (Waiter, I'm going to have some of that Dane!) We see a Martian chastity dance that may have been cute or ridiculous, but it's actually very touching and beautiful. In addition, the Martian funeral scene features a shot that reminded me of a sequel to "The Seventh Seal." I wonder if Ingmar Bergman saw this movie. "Himmelskibet" has some flaws, but its design of production and its other merits far outweigh its drawbacks. Ole Olsen, who is named in the credits (and appears in a brief prologue), has no relation to Chic Johnson's vaudeville partner, "Hellzapoppin." I would give "Himmelskibet" a 12, but the scale culminates in 10 ... so a total of 10 out of 10 for this delightful trip to Mars, the blonde planet!
