Sharky's machine is easily one of Burt Reynolds's best efforts. He also stands out as one of the best contemporary crime dramas. Erotic and violent, the film is distinguished by setting the story in Atlanta and delivering a chaotic detective case to you (the viewer) on a silver platter. Dedicated and determined, Sharky must stop the murder of Dominoe, a lovely lady of the night, who is clientel is nothing ordinary. In a short time, Sharky's crime-fighting machine reveals a conspiracy of the highest order, which threatens to corrupt Atlanta's inner body. As a metropolitan Atlanta resident, I remember the excitement in the city during the production of the film. Sharky's Machine goes to great lengths to present an accurate portrait of Atlanta. Twenty years removed and another 2,000,000 people later, the film passes the test of time. Trust me, Atlanta has not changed. One of the highlights of the image is the daring acrobatics of Dar Robinson (a classic and symbolic ending). It was even featured on That's Incredible, the ABC reality show of the period. It's too bad Hollywood does not make enough movies like this. Relax, each with its popcorn, and watch the action of sterling silver cinema.
