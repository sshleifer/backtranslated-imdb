Dolemite is to me an object of my deepest affection. It has everything: a gang of prostitutes who fight with karate, Dolemite punching Willie Green's stomach (director Martin), high pumps and 100-gallon hats. Moore's comedy singles, actually toast, are close to the roots of hip hop. No wonder Dr. Dre mentioned "Dolemite" 3 times on his classic album "The Chronic". Add the best list of characters to embellish a movie, such as the horny preacher, the hamburger pimp, and, of course, "the one no one knows until the time." D'Urville Martin, a guy who probably does not get as much attention as he should around movie fan circles (I've been looking for a copy of him and Fred Williamson's films from the early days) is to be given credit for the style. 70 years for years and can not find them). <br /> <br /> Many people are really depressed in this movie and say it's too bad, and it's true that you can see boom microphones popping up everywhere (look at DP Nicholas Josef Von Sternberg, for whom I think this was a very initial effort), there are many things for this movie. Number one, there's no other movie like this. Number two, you get to see Rudy Ray Moore make a (highly sanitized; everyone who has not seen Moore's outrageous act live will have to use his imagination) cinematic version of his free gifts in addition to him living the life of his superpimp comic book character come to life. The action scenes are very bad, but the dialogue of the characters when they are talking bullshit more than makes up for it. It's full of odd little details (like the fact that the Hamburger Pimp is wearing a Dolemite T-shirt from the inside out - was it intentional or did the guy just pick up any shirt that was on set and put it on?) You come back to watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> At least I have. <br /> <br />
