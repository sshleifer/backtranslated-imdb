Before watching this movie, clean your ears, take off your eye makeup and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. She does not need. This photo will give you enough warmth to maintain your relationship for life. If you are Jewish / Russian / Ukrainian / immigrant - yes, a minority of popular films - always laughs within your memories. If you're something else or whatever you are anyway - laugh at the bitter reminder of the importance of friendship and family. Nothing in this movie will seem strange, strange as it may seem. Still, I fear that few see this movie, because it is not the kind of image people watch when they go to the movies. But please do this for humanity, and do not forget to pick up the soundtrack, for pleasure.
