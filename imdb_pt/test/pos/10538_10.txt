The comments from the previous reviewer are really harsh. One wonders if they have ever seen this beautiful sweet movie. As to being so nasty about this in front of the writer / director..well this is simply rude! For those who grew up in the eighties, it is an artistic piece of nostalgia and a sweet story well represented and produced. The production of Irish films has a lot of people with bitter rage involved with it, and the spleen's comment about it is proof of that. As people, we have a choice; Give up and moan about the people who actually go there and do things or do something yourself ... I know which is easier ... Do yourself a favor and watch this movie and see how a short film is made. .. you will not be disappointed
