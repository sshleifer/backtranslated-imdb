PUBLIC ENEMIES is a kind of setback for those gangster biographies of the early 1960s, such as PORTRAIT OF A BOCAL, MAD DOG COLL and KING OF THE ROARING TWENTIES. Although made cheap, the film has a lot of energy and the overall acting, particularly by Eric Roberts and Frank Stallone, is very good. Theresa Russell may seem very glamorous as Ma, but she has some good times. There are two action scenes worth noting: a hotel shootout and a machine gun in the middle of the street between the Barkers and the FBI. Both sequences are well done, and compared to other gangster junkies, like DILLINGER AND CAPONE, this movie shines.
