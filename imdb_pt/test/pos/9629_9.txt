The Patriot is a well-thought-out, well-produced film that draws the viewer directly into the story and keeps them engaged to the end. Granted, it is not on the same line as Under Siege, et. al., but this is definitely the trademark film of what can be described as the second era of Seagal movies. Not much action movies with a nod to a story thrown in for good measure, but a good story, combined with a point, and injected with some of Seagal's enemy action sequences. Is this the kind of movie that hardcore action adders will like? Probably not. But for those of us who not only enjoy our action but also enjoy a story well told, this is a big step forward for Seagal. It's almost like the transformation Clint Eastwood made when he tried to come out from under the shadow of his "Dirty Harry" series. Or the man, if he had continued in the singular direction they were following, would have forever been a specific role and would guarantee the brevity of their careers ...
