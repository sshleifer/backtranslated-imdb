I've always loved old movies, but this is one of my top ten favorites ... it has all the charm, quirk of the 1940s, and good old-fashioned romance and it's hilarious to boot! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes culinary articles for a famous magazine ... under the premise that she is a married housewife. Even the president of the magazine is under this illusion. Enter a handsome GI, (played by talented Dennis Morgan) just rescued from a raft along with his friend. Her simple desire is to stay at the Homemade Inn she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous home cooked meals. She now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputation ... to add to this that her fiance is in a hurry to tie the knot does not help. The humor is superb and the chemistry between the main characters is a lot of fun. Play the character-actor nicknamed "Cuddles" (which completely fits that name) and becomes even more adorable. This has become my must-see movie that I cuddle with a cup of chocolate every Christmas season. A wonderful and enjoyable movie to enjoy at Christmas or anytime!
