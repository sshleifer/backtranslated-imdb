This Norwegian film begins with a man jumping over the subway, apparently committing suicide. But the next scene shows him coming on a lonely bus in a desert. He meets a man and is sent to a mysterious city where he starts working in a modern aseptic office as an accountant. Co-workers seem cool, if kept, he soon finds a girlfriend, but the town looks totally weird, since the food has no taste, alcohol does not make him drunk and there are no children around. Is this a dream or is he in heaven or hell? Although the movies sometimes look like a lengthy episode of The Twilight Zone (even with ninety minutes, the film seems a little long), it's quite thought-provoking. The best scenes are those where exaggeration is minimal, such as when people engage in banal talk about interior decorating and retreat when discussing deeper issues. I have always felt that there was something inhuman in advanced capitalist societies, in the way they try to suppress the basic drives of human nature. And this movie is best when it criticizes this lifestyle in a devastating way. Unfortunately, the movie ends up being a long one, and the director does not seem to know how to finish it, but most of the execution time is worth it.
