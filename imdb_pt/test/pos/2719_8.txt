I thought I was losing my precious $ 50 going to watch this movie. But at the sincere request of my friend who is a fiery fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to appear for the film. Going into this cheap theater really bothered me because I had seen King Kong for $ 50 at one of the best theaters in town. Anywasy the movie starts and surprisingly I was not complaining. <br /> <br /> A great story and some wonderful wonderful acting on the part of Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma. Shabana Azmi is a divorcee who dedicated her life to the well-being of her adoptive mother and sister. Konkona Sen Sharma a schizophrenic (spare me the spelling), who imagines thing all the time. Rahul Bose also gives a stellar performance. <br /> <br /> The story is that Mithi (Sen Sharma) is schizophrenic, and after being brutally raped in his fieldwork as a reporter, his levels actually increase, his fiancee leaves her, by the person she has become . Throughout your world comes down upon it. Shabana Azmi, her older sister, takes care of her, and Mithi in her imagination believes she was married to her fiancee, has 5 children and they stay on 15th Park Avenue (which really is a place in New York). The plot continues when Mithi becomes suicidal because she believes that nobody believes her and she is being held in captivity in her house by her husband. As fate would have, Mithi and his fiancee will meet when they are both traveling. 11 years after the brutal rape, your fiancée has no existence in your real world, she can not recognize you. His fiancée, now married and the father of two children, feels it his duty to correct his mistake 11 years earlier and promises to take her to Park Avenue. and it does. He takes her to a place in Kolkata, which supposedly looks like her husband's house. As Joydeep / Jojo (Rahul Bose), his fiancée is talking on his cell phone, he loses track of Mithi. Everyone has been looking for it, but it is far from being found. She finally receives what has been denied to her, her family, her own imaginative family in her own world on 15th Park Avenue. <br /> <br /> I must say, that touched my heart. I am now a fan of the direction of Aparna Sen. The camera work is excellent. And the quality of performance is limited by spells. Konkona Sen Sharma performs solidly as the schizophrenic child. Shabana Azmi gives another mind role as the divorced older sister, who has the burden of keeping the family. Rahul Bose, another clean and quiet role (I do not know why this guy does not have big breaks, he has a lot of potential). Finally Aparna Sen, she still captivates the audience, even if she is not in front of the camera and behind her. <br /> <br /> A very well deserved 8/10 ....
