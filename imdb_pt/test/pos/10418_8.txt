This movie did a wonderful job of capturing the stereotypes of NYC. If you want a simple, cute story, you will not find it here. The related tales are intertwined in a way that does a great job of capturing the cohesive, yet contrastingly anonymous, Manhattan lifestyle. A perfect watch for those who like and can laugh at New York life in its most natural state.
