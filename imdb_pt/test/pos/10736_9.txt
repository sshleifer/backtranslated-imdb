I think not! I mean, yes, if you compare this movie to The Godfather, or maybe a slightly older film, like Casablanca, or maybe even a slightly younger movie, like The English Patient. It does not have camera work or cinematography like these other movies, but that does not mean that this is a bad movie, or is it? I think the reason this movie is underrated is because a lot of people always compare it to other big Oscar winning films (you should never do that) which makes it difficult to understand the beauty and realism in this movie. In the categories Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, this movie really deserved them all. The magnificent Dustin Hoffman gives us, once again, one of his best performances. A couple of times in this movie I forgot that it was not your son because it was so real! I've never seen a movie about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that particular role, but still so handsome. So Dustin Hoffman passed the test with winning colors, in my opinion. There are few actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can not help but think she's great). Meryl Streep, despite being in a supporting role, is incredible and real and you can not help but be drawn to her talent and the way she makes it real. Wow, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great considering his age, his tears and his relationship with his mother and father was beautiful, so I say a good job for the nice Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> As I watched this movie for the third time, alone, I could not stop crying. I tried but I could not. Thank God I was alone! This is probably the purest movie I have ever seen. Other films nominated for Best Picture were Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All That Jazz. I'm ashamed because I did not see any of them, but from what I heard, Apocalypse Now is great, but when I heard about Norma Rae, I only thought about Sally Field. I think, considering the other nominees, this movie has earned five Oscars, and will continue to play and make other people cry for a long time in the future, as in the last 28 years. Good job all the actors and actresses in this movie for giving us great performances and memories of watching this movie we will never forget. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
