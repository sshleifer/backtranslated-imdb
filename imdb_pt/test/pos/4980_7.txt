Stanwyck in his best villain, Robinson his equal - as barons of the relentless land in this fairly common western. <br /> <br /> Some good action scenes, strong use of location, color and Cinemascope. But why the obvious use of stock images in the stampede scene? <br /> <br /> Ford is as reliable as ever and Foster is as strong as Robinson's daughter, but it is the movie of the bad guys. And it's not just Stanwyck and Robinson - Brian Keith makes a surprisingly bold villain as Stanwyck's lover, and Richard Jaeckel is unforgettable as a cold-hearted killer. <br /> <br /> See the value of the camp.
