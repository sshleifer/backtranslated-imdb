I highly recommend this movie. It blurs the line between childish fantasy and everyday reality so perfectly that one must see to believe. The actors and director have a timing so perfect that in a scene, a fight between names becomes a kind of dance. I loved the plot, the actors, everything. While I think there were one or two decidedly extravagant scenes, the film was flawless.
