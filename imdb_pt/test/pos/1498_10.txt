Going back to the "good old days" of 1971 can remember clearly when we were treated to an entire season of Charles Chaplin in Film. That's what the promo guy called when we saw him on someone's old talk show. (We can not remember who it was, either MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, one or the other!) The guest talked about Sir Charles's career and how his films had been out of circulation since the 1952 exoneration of former "Little Tramp" The United States because of it being an "undesirable Alien." (No Schultz, he is NOT from another Planet!) CHARLIE had been considered a 'subversive' because of his interest and open research in various Political Systems and All of the anarchist movement of the 1920s (and before), the craze of technocracy for socialism in its various forms were just discussion at Chaplin's Hollywood festivities, inclusion of the Soviet style, which we commonly call communism. <br /> COMPOUND the Chaplin situation was so confused for one small detail. it never became an American citizen. <br /> <br /> anyhow, enough of this fund now! <br /> <br /> suffice say that he has become "Persona Non Grat is "in the United States of America. It was about time to get old movies out of mothballs and back to the movie houses. Surely it would be a great gesture to forgive us easily and quickly forget Americans. <br /> <br /> It would be a nice gesture for the great filmmaker; in addition, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was planning to pay tribute to Chaplin with a special tribute at the 1972 Oscar. This would certainly be a package full of tears, but joyous, to have America inviting Charlie back and cause he received a special Academy Lifetime Achievement Award in front of a Worldwide Television Audience at Millions. <br /> <br /> BEYOND, it would be natural to promote Chaplin's Season at the Theater! (Remember, Little Tramp was as insightful as a Bu $ ine $$ Man as he was as a filmmaker!) The program consisted of exhibitions of MODERN TIMES, CITY LIGHTS, THE GREAT DICTATOR, MONSEUR VERDOUX, A KING IN NEW YORK. and finally the CHAPEL REVOLUTION. We remember being very excited about the anticipation of the multi date film festival. <br /> <br /> In our beautiful city of Chicago, it was reserved for the Carnegie Theater on Rush Street. The festivities take off with MODERN TIMES and all other would be shown one at a time, each staying for any length whatever was necessary to satisfy the public's desire to see each image. As we remember, the last of the agenda was the REVOLUTION OF THE CHAPELS. <br /> <br /> In reverse, we looked back and wished they had started the race with REVUE; as there were undoubtedly legions of viewers (very much like us) who knew very little about their achievements in films except those Keystone, Essanay and Mutual Silent Shorts that were being shown as a regular feature on so many, Kiddy Shows across the country. Oh, well, once again, no one consulted me! <br /> <br /> CONCENTRATING in film today invited, THE CHAPLIN REVUE, we found that were actually three separate images; carefully linked by the use of narration by Chaplin himself, some animated themes and incidental music (again written by Chaplin) and some happy conversation and serious narration (Ditto, by Chaplin.) He opens the process by making use of a homemade kind of film that depicts the construction of the Chaplin Studio in Hollywood and a film made of a time trial, showing the director Chaplin demonstrating exactly what he wants for a group of actors. <br /> <br /> This segment was well done and well received by the public. Both the mood of the building and the essay were amplified, making them look like they were accelerating. (The rehearsal of course, the building, by speeding up the photographic process of the camera.) The old trick makes it look like the buildings were almost being built. This amalgam of shorts incorporated three of Chaplin's short comedies his choice with First National Pictures from about 1917 to 1923. The choice was well thought out and gave us a wide variety of subjects and humor. THE FIRST TIME WAS SHOULDER GUNS (Charles Chaplin Productions / First National Pictures, 1918) As the title suggests, it is a tale of World War I. Launched in October 1918, about a month before the Armistice Day of November 11, it was a comedy of comic Army jokes and a novel between Private Chaplin and a French girl (Miss Edna Purviance) Leviandade is quick, physical and in the great old tradition of ridiculing the Enemy, the German Army. <br /> <br /> VIEWING a fine example of the old saying about Children and Dogs Chaplin Productions / First National, 1918) traces the parallel lives of Chaplin's Tramp and a newly adopted stray, Scraps. The story of the film involves families, two of them. A Homo Sapiens, a canine and both giving us some great surprises. <br /> <br /> As a final, we PILGRIM (Chaplin / First National, 1923) was a good choice to have as final. It was clear, clear and tight. It was a tour in the area of ​​the Western Parody, comedies of this type having been made since then by every comedian and team. The "pilgrim" in history is not of his standard variety of thanksgiving; but rather a "face" or "Tenderfoot", who ventured west. The bum is not just this guy; but his character is a convict who escaped and is mistakenly considered the new clergyman of the Church of a Western city! <br /> <br /> OUR Assessment (which is Schultz and me) sucks. (That's four Derbies) <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
