It is very difficult to portray a novel of Tagore along cinematographic lines. And if you forget an obscure production of 1967, then it is the first time that chokher bali is done on a grand scale. Overall, the scenarios looked fantastic with the right touches to make a successful drama.Prasenjit, so accustomed to doing gross business stuff made a good effort. I saw the version in Bengali and found that Aishwariya's voice was dubbed, which made his delivery of dialogues a little poor. While the director did a good job portraying each of the characters subtly, there was still very little in the way of meaningful plot, probably the lack of the story itself. However, the development of the characters, including those with smaller roles, seems to be the strongest point. It is difficult to do some Tagore stories in movies, as only the visual parts seem to perform.
