This animated short is a remake of one of Tex Avery's previous short films for Fred Quimby on M-G-M (Dog Gone Tired). A fugitive convicted (who just became known as Joe) who just ran away from 'Alka Fizz Prison' tries to stay one step ahead of Droopy (known here as Sgt.McPoodle of the Mounties), but can always find him , or another. This is easily one of the funniest shorts that came out of the M-G-M animation studio. He gets most of his laughter out of the shocked reactions Joe has whenever he finds McPoodle (including some equally messy sound effects - ie car horns, screams, elephants, etc). Like any Avery M-G-M, a frenzied, frenetic, kinetic rhythm is expected (along with some nice and surreal gags - that is, Joe trying to escape from McPoodle and running off from the side of the movie). Pop this into your DVD player and laugh silly.
