Most of these reviews are coming to an end, so I'll cut into a different chase and answer a few questions I've seen here. <br /> <br /> While the characters look and seem young (hence the controversy) the actor / actress herself was 17 and 18 at the time and obviously crossed the 16th barrier. Here in the US, this is still a bit controversial, but the film's simplicity and innocence does much to make up for it. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I did not see Sean anymore; In this film, at least, his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling, whether he is angry, scared or confused. Anicee had a healthy career, whose life was unfortunately disrupted by cancer in late 2006. She was a beautiful and talented actress. <br /> <br /> FRIENDS VHS tapes can be found on Amazon.com from time to time, but usually a significant price; I saw this as low as $ 60 or more and as high as $ 152 (from this comment, there were two for that price). The follow-up video PAUL & MICHELLE is not as expensive and can be obtained (when available) on Amazon for between $ 16 and $ 70 on average.
