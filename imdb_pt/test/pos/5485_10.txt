I'm a big fan of big, tall, trashy, completely stupid action movies like The Rock, Con Air, etc. All these are so much fun to watch but, when you think about it, extremely silly. In the line of fire tells a story and says well. With plausibility, excitement and suspense, it also addressed several important moral issues that really make you think. The last scene of the movie is Eastwood and Russo sitting together on the steps of the White House, watching the pigeons for soft and peaceful music, and I felt a deep sense of satisfaction. That's because I cared about the characters and was happy for them that their story came to a happy conclusion. It sounded like a true story. As the aged secret service agent plagued by the fact that he failed to protect JFK on that fateful day in Dallas, Clint Eastwood is fantastic. He brilliantly conveys his paranoia and his personal need to stop his opponent. Across the spectrum is John Malkovich, the scary predator who tortures Eastwood about what happened in 1963, openly telling him his plan to kill the current president. This Oscar-nominated performance really comes under your skin. Throughout the film, Malkovich talks to Eastwood as if they were friends. He does not threaten him, does not lie to him, does not laugh at him, but tortures him with his unbearable friendship until the last moment. Just like this exciting main storyline, there is a lovely love story involving Rene Russo, another agent and Eastwood. Despite the age difference, they have excellent chemistry on the screen and the director wisely does not let this overwhelm him, but keeps him as part of the scenario that works very well. To summarize, I love this movie because it has a mind.
