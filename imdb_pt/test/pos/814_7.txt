The story is about a girl who works (Ann Sothern) who has a very thoughtless boyfriend (Paul Kelly). This boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that again and again he forgets the dates or appears late. The last straw is when Sothern has a birthday and Kelly says he's too busy to get her to celebrate. So, not wanting to just stay at home, she goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man (Neil Hamilton). Sparks fly, but it also becomes apparent after Sothern interrupts his relationship with Kelly, that the new boyfriend Hamilton is a type of "love them and leave them". How all this is finally solved is not very difficult to predict - just say that in the end everything works perfectly. <br /> <br /> This is a very modest little movie from Columbia Pictures - with a relatively small budget as well as second-rate stars. It's clearly a "B-movie," although there were small roles played by a Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwell - as both had yet to become famous. Now, this is not to say that these are bad actors or the production is not good. In fact, considering the production values, this is an incredible movie, since everything seems to work so well, despite having a fairly common and somewhat predictable sketch. That's because the actors and the director did a great job of presenting the story. In addition, the writers did a good job of humanizing the characters and making you care about them. The ending, in particular, is really sweet and pretty much my tear ducts have flowed! Because of these factors, the film earns 7 of 10.
