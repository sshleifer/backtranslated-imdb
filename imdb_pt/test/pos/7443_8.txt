The movie is really cool, I thought. It looks great in the original game, and some of the battle scenes are described in such high detail, it's incredible. I thought the movie might have been a bit better if they gave you a little more information before the end, but figuring out what's going on is what's holding you back in that movie. <br /> <br /> The CG is gorgeous, I do not think they could have done a better graphics job wise. Every little detail, the way they move, the way their swords look, everything is perfect. The way they make the characters look like they're real people. <br /> <br /> The music was great, and I found it interesting to hear how remixed it was from the original game, with new instruments and effects. <br /> <br /> Everyone and everyone, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes quick action and a good story line. I would definitely play the game before watching the movie.
