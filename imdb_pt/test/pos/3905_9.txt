I remember watching a movie by Elizabeth Montgomery when I was maybe 5 years old (if that) and to this day I can remember this movie (in just a few bits). It was the movie that I remembered all my life because I was so scared. I think I remember the part of the story and the house being constantly dark. The main part that was strangest for me was Elizabeth walking through the dark house and then there was someone out in the country. At the time I thought I was an old witch, but the memory of that now is very foggy, so I really can not remember who it was, but it was definitely someone in a field lurking ... and that part is what scared me majority. I really wish I could see this movie again. If anyone knows how to get a copy, please email valid908@yahoo.com
