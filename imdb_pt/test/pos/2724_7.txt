15 Park Avenue by Aparna Sen is a film about the nature of reality. <br /> <br /> A delirious young woman, prone to imagining things and hearing voices, possibly out of sheer boredom, is considered schizophrenic by her educated father and her educated older sister, mad for control. Controlled, punished and treated as an invalid (even if out of love and affection), she has a chance to develop as a normal person. When a boy volunteers to marry her, his adoptive father and sister try passionately to persuade him not to take that step. A traumatic experience, caused mainly by her protected existence, finally leads her to cross the line with no return, and she lives full time in a delusional world of her own. <br /> <br /> The family and society around them are intolerant of their illusions and want to suppress them with medication, electric shock therapy, anything, even if they all have delusions of one kind or another. <br /> <br /> Her mother does not see the irony in allowing a ghost speculator to deal with illusions. His adoptive sister is a Physics teacher, teaching among other things Quantum Mechanics, a subject in which a chain of specialists accepts multiple parallel universes and many more dimensions in space than the three we see. A friend relates with admiration an experience with a holy person claiming to hear hallucinatory voices. Far, George W. Bush has real or false illusions of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, and is allowed to invade Iraq. <br /> <br /> As some viewers have already pointed out, Aparna Sen has shied away from attacking the mother of all illusions - major religions, which is a shame. In other words, accepted reality is what a influential majority or minority believes. This has been the case since the beginning, and people far more powerful than Mithali in the film, including Bruno and Galileo, suffered as a consequence. The controversial and difficult ending of the film was needed to show that it is a film about the nature of reality, not the case study of a schizophrenic girl. <br /> <br /> The whole cast gave great performances, but Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma stood out. Aparna Sen produced an excellent philosophical film.
