'War movie' is a Hollywood genre that has been made and redone so often that clichéd dialogue, rewritten plot and exaggerated action sequences seem inevitable for any conflict that deals with large-scale combat. Every once in a while, however, comes a war movie that runs counter to the current and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War era "Cold Mountain" starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is one such film. <br /> <br /> So again, calling Cold Mountain's "a war movie is not entirely accurate." <br /> <br /> True, the movie starts with a (literally) fast and dirty battle sequence that puts Glory's director, Edward Zwick, however, "Cold Mountain" is not so much about the Civil War as about the period and the people. The story revolves around the disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who is revolted by the horrible war and with I miss the beautiful village of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe. At first glance, this configuration seems stereotyped, since romantic interest at home gives the public enough sympathy to cheer for tribulations of the reluctant soldier on the battlefield. In fact, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even s "Cold Mountain" soon takes a drastic turn, however, as the inept gone hero Inman turns out to be a defector (incidentally saving the public from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to cheer for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey home. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada's learned manners are of little use in the fields; soon it is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the Ruby Thewes course, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada rebuild the farm and, perhaps more importantly, deal with the loneliness and isolation that the war seems to have brought to Ada. <br /> Within these two scenarios, a vivid, attractive, and sometimes very disturbing picture of the war-torn south unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, highlighted by Brendan Gleeson's wonderful performances as Ruby's deadly father, Ray Winstone as an impenitent "law-man" to the south, and Natalie Portman as a deeply disturbed and isolated young mother. All were greatly affected and changed by the "war of aggression from the north," especially for the worst. The obscure and penetrating anti-war message, accentuated by an astonishing and effective score and beautiful photos of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the public not so much by terrible battle scenes as by the scary land and traumatized people for whom war was fought. Although the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed a lot in the last century, the infernal effect on earth is timelessly relevant. Director Anthony Minghella manages to keep this mood dark for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does not do justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkward at the beginning and end of the film, although the inherently distant, abstract, and even absurd nature of their relationship fits into the dark nature of the rest of the plot. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, "Cold Mountain" lacks the traits of a good-natured romance or inspirational war drama. It is a unique vision of a time that is sure not only to entertain but also truly absorb the public into the lives of a war-torn people and utterly desperate to get rid of their terrible repercussions.
