Soul Calibur is more solid than ever ... with the creation of the new character, and the chronicle of the sword mode in the home version. <br /> <br /> The arcade version is more complete, even though the character list is smaller than the homemade version, this version is definitely the prettiest of the two, eliminating all "silly / unreal" fighting styles, found in the homemade version. If you were somehow disappointed with the homemade version, or maybe thought it was "too much", you could find a much more enjoyable and direct Soul Calibur game in the arcade. Do you think you have what it takes to become a legend?
