While camera work was certainly "funky" - maybe a short Dutchman of "stoned" - the premise of the film was fantastic. It really was a satirical tone (in the true traditional of Hal Hartley) to look to God, Jesus and Devil. The interaction between Jesus and Satan provides some hilarious scenes ... Even Jesus' monologues were great - this was by far the best Jesus I have ever seen. So relaxed, Zen, Son of God, but still such a cool guy. At one level, this is a very general view of the paradoxes of Christianity, but there is still a personal level where you can relate to Jesus Christ without having a God complex (except for Martin Donovan and Hal Hartley).
