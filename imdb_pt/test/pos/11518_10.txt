LIGHTS OF NEW YORK was the first 57-minute all-taking feature directed by Bryan Foy (from the famous vaudeville family). <br /> <br /> The story has two dopey barbers (Cullen Landis, Eugene Palette) yearn for a chance to "life in the big city" and get involved with gangsters and pirate drink. One of the guys is framed for the murder of a police officer, but is saved at the last minute by a mule of arms (Gladys Brockwell). <br /> <br /> Much of the story takes place in a nightclub called The Night Hawk. , which is directed by a bandit named Hawk (Wheeler Oakman), who is eyeing a beautiful coral (Helene Costello) who is the girlfriend of Landis. Costello begins a brief dance, and we hear Harry Downing (created to resemble Ted Lewis) sing "At Dawning" in his best Al Jolson style. <br /> <br /> The acting ranges from good (Palette and Brockwell) to horrible (Oakman). Some actors fulfill their lines, but they go ahead with the scene. As noted elsewhere, the goal was to be a short 2-cylinder and was done on a tight budget. surprisingly good, all voices are clearly recorded, and there is a cinematographic touch in the silhouette of death. <br /> <br /> The film was a box office hit, although it was shown as a silent movie where theaters were not. It was not expected that this small movie would make an incredible $ 1.3 million, and for a brief period, made Costello and Landis stars and certainly launched Palette in his long career as an actor of famous characters. Co-stars include Mary Carr as the mother, Robert Elliott as the detective, Eddie Kane as the street cop and Tom Dugan as a bad guy.
