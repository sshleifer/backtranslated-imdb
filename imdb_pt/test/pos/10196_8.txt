It seems that the writer Robocop has looted the Vindicator wholesale. This is a very solid horror / action movie about a man bred in an accident to be used in vicious experiments. Anyone who has seen Robocop knows the story. Beware of Pam Grier as a grumpy and damn murderer. This highly effective, violent and bloody horror movie may not please everyone, but it's worth looking for someone who is a fan of the genre. 8/10
