Alexander Nevsky is a series of superb cinematic opera sequences that pass from shepherding to lamentation and ending in a triumphant cantata. The story takes place in 1242. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) defeats the Teutonic Knights in an ice battle on Lake Peipus. <br /> <br /> The film is a splendid historical spectacle that shows director Sergei Eisenstein in his most inventively pictorial and climax in a superb battle sequence using music instead of natural sounds. Several films have scenes strongly influenced by the Battle of Peipus Lake, including Doctor Jivago (1965), Mulan (1998) and King Arthur (2004). Alexander Nevsky was kept out of circulation due to the changing political winds, and then enshrined as perhaps the most influential Soviet historical film.
