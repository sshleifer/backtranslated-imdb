Ali G gained fame on the small screen - although the big screen has not missed any compliments either. Ali G Indahouse is a fun and fun fest - like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity, and behind it all - nothing in the movie is fluffy without a brain either. A human side of Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of ​​Ali G running for PM is bright, new and fun - and the incessant stupidity of the Staines gangster mixes well with the harsh and tough world of politics. The movie is also full of new characters - and instead of just interview after interview, we have a comedy movie that never gets repetitive or annoying. So why did not I give ten stars? Well, the ending was funny, but it also failed and failed - none of that made sense. And in parts, the movie has become offensive in trying to be funny - but that's Ali G for you - if it's not offensive, it's not itself, and it's totally and utterly ruined. The big screen debut of Ali G was a success in my opinion, and should have entered the average rating of 6-7 on IMDb. But it could also have gotten worse, and people tend to have conflicting opinions, especially in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ali G Indahouse is hilarious British comedy at its best - and funnier and smarter. Great job! 9/10
