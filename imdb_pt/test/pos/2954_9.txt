I always thought my father had a second life and looked forward to the development of 51 Birch Street when I sat down and saw her for the first time. Surprisingly, the journey of this film took me to places I did not expect and made me rethink assumptions and judgments. Truly a remarkable personal story told in a clever but direct way. I especially liked the filmmaker's use of pulling her mother's daily diary type - very effective. I read the previous review and wish to note that the sound was good when I saw this and I suspect that the film was changed or the theater could have contributed to the other writer's worst sound quality.
