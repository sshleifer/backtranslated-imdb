Rififi, directed by Jules Dassin, is aligned with the police cadres of Melville (particularly Bob le Flameur and to a certain extent with Le Cercle Rouge) to be totally focused on history and character and make sure no words are spoken that do not need, and was ahead of his time. Ionically, it still has a kind of professionalism among its characters, a kind of respect (if not for the selves than for others, a kind of duty) that sounds good in post-World War II France. His actors carry faces to these characters who say "we know what these guys are," and from there the story takes off. Maybe it's because I have a weakness for photos of assault, particularly where we see only the nuts and bolts (err, actual physical side) of how a robbery is taken. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with how the current assault is filmed in today's movies is that it's all very fast (ie, Snatch), or done in ways we've seen many times before. Dassin, like Melville years later, decided to create a nearly silent movie of theft, including sound effects. The tension that accumulates in this scene may not surpass what Melville had in "Rouge," but on its own level it attains its own greatness and momentum, and an originality crucial to what has been done before. There are a few close-ups kept, for example, as the safe is being broken, which marks some of the best I have ever seen from France at that time. An additional addition to the film, besides the new wave touch from the larval stage to the movie, which ultimately makes it a little more modern, is that the story works so well and differently. It becomes completely about the character in points and then retains the emotions. The last ten to fifteen minutes are miraculous; as in another classic asphalt film, the Asphalt Jungle is not even the last stop that matters, but all about how much one goes beyond the call of duty, putting humanism on greed. <br /> <br /> You almost wonder in all the excitement of the camera flying through the trees at high speed with the car he could do. Dassin has here a very entertaining and intuitive film of its kind, with a small musical number as well.
