I've never heard of this movie and I only managed because I'm Martin Sheen's fan. Now I am shocked by why he has not received the praise and recognition he truly deserves. The four characters make you feel for them, the father trying to assert his authority, the mother still clinging to traditional family values ​​and both trying to keep up appearances despite the total fragmentation of his family, the daughter wanting her own life and the haunted son for their experiences in Vietnam. It was felt that this was a scenario that must have occurred in thousands of "common" families after Vietnam. Emilio Estevez, like Jeremy, was superb - totally unbalanced by his war experience, which none of his relatives could relate to. The chemistry of the screen between him and his real-life father, Martin Sheen, was incredible. And there were moments when Emilio's distressed face was so much like Martin's in "Apocalypse Now." I'm sure that, just as Martin told Apocalype as one of his best films, Emilio will count this as one of his best too. The scene with the gun was totally mind-boggling, as all the emotions were there on the faces of the family. Brilliant acting for Estevez, Sheen and Kathy Bates. I watched the movie for the first time last night - and today the main story in the news was about a Gulf War veteran who shot several members of his family. How many more young people will have their lives destroyed by the war?
