Although not as hilarious as Chicken Run, Wallace and Gromit's new comedy, "The Curse of the Werewolves" (laughs), laughs more than most live action comedies. British director Nick Park, who created the characters of Wallace and Gromit, and co-director Steve Box rely on the old-fashioned stop motion animation method known as claymation to create several visually adorable characters in more than enough scenes of side division on a monstrously mutant hare to devour all the vegetables in sight. As amusing as his extravagant history is, the heart of hilarity lies in the imaginative way in which Park and company have meticulously constructed characters and gags from a clay modeling brand called Plasticina. Basically, all the scenes you see in "The Rabbit's Curse" required patient souls who made minor changes to the clay characters for a series of individual scenes that merge into a veritable assemblage of joy. Hollywood pioneered claymation as a form of animation since the silent films of the 1920s, before the industry turned its back on the complicated process. The animators at Aardman Studio were able to produce only three seconds of usable images per day. For the record, "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" took five years to do. Irregular-looking characters with thumb-prints clearly visible in their respective clay complexions look incredibly funny with their ping-pong ball eyes and exaggerated mouths. Curiously, Gromit emerges as the funniest character, a lovable mutt without a mouth, but an expressively expressionless face that says more than most of the talking characters. Wallace and Gromit are respectively masters and mutts. Like the human half of the duo, Wallace is a homily looking like an idiot without a clue that somehow manages to build machines that do incredible things. One of the funniest scenes shows the master and the dog awakened by a system of kicks, hatches and contraptions driven by springs that dress and feed them. Meanwhile, Gromit is the animal half. The current joke is that Gromit shows more common sense than his master genius. No matter how good his ideas and inventions, Wallace could not succeed without loyal Gromit giving him a hand. Our heroes run a pest protection business called 'Anti-Pesto'. Essentially, they should protect all hortifruti beds for miles, using an ungainly looking device called Bun-Van 6000, which literally sucks the rabbits out of their soil and into a huge glass container. No, Wallace and Gromit do not kill creatures. Instead, they keep them as pets, and Wallace experiments with an invention - Mind-O-Matic - designed to convert hares into carrot hates. This "Frankenstein" meets the "The Fly" approach plunges poor Wallace into deep trouble when he swaps chunks of his brain with that of a rabbit. Not long afterwards, a mysterious and awesome terror chases plant patches on full moon nights and creates chaos for everyone as the village's 517th Annual Plant Contest approaches. Initially, Wallace and Gromit were nominated for an Oscar for The Park, a project of the film school "A Grand Day Out" (1989). Since then, Aardman has released ten other animated shorts, including "Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave" (1993) and Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers (1995). "Curse of the Were-Rabbit" differs not only because it represents the debut of the duo on the big screen, but also with the impressive 85 minutes. The first two-thirds of "Were-Rabbit" contain better jokes than the last third, but Park and company never miss a chance to slip into an adult joke that kids will not have, but attentive adults will appreciate it. "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Werewolf Rabbit" is a fun joke.
