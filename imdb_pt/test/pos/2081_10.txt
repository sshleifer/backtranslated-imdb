Got this movie in TCM early in the morning. It was amazing. <br /> <br /> Beginning slow but sinister .... Scott is a dark character who attacks women. In that case, two women must have an inheritance in Southern California. <br /> <br /> The beach and neighborhood settings of the 1940s are original and intriguing. The title may have been more creative, but the theme and dismal shadows of human nature are intriguingly exposed, almost in a Hitchcockian version. Scott reminded me of the character Uncle Charley in "Shadow of a Doubt." , one of Hitch's renowned favorite films. The public learns, we really do not know what is hidden in the dark side of the human mind. This movie is a shifted gem and well worth buying. 10/10.
