I was not expecting much from this movie and was slapped in the face. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint and Laura Linney act wonderfully as the main characters in this film. Any teenager can relate to parental control and with the urge to leave as who you really are, which is basically about what this movie is. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express his ideas in words. He slowly but surely breaks his shell and becomes much less clumsy. Every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theater is full of laughter 75% of the time. The film satisfies everyone, and I hope it can soon be released in all US cinemas, because many do not get the chance to see the movie unless they live in big cities. Must see!
