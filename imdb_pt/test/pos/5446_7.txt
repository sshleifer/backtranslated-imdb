"Man of the Year" tells the story of Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams), a political comedian (like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert) who has his own television show. In his show, he talks about all kinds of things, but his main focus is political issues on which he has much opinion. One day at his show, an audience fan raises the notion that Dobbs should run for the presidency of the United States. After the episode aired, millions rushed to the web to create multiple petitions and express their opinions on why Dobbs would be a major candidate for president to the United States. A few weeks later, Dobbs decides to run for president and lowers and behold, he wins the election. Everything seems to be going as planned until a woman named Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) appears and begins some controversy over her position. A funny but serious political thriller, do you follow? <br /> <br /> Anyone who enters this movie expecting to see a comedy without a brain will surely be disappointed. I always wonder how some people are movie marketing professionals when I see how to mislead their marketing campaigns. "Man of the Year" is a great example of bad and misleading marketing because everything from the poster to the trailer to the online ads makes it look like a comedy. I honestly have to say that about 1/3 of the movie is funny, while the rest is a political thriller that makes good arguments and lets the public think. I kind of wonder, in this case, if the marketing was done on purpose, since this movie tackles very serious issues between your comedy routine. <br /> <br /> But enough about marketing, let's go to the movie itself. I really enjoyed "Man of the Year" even though I expected to see a comedy rather than a serious movie. One of the many things I'm going to give credence to this movie is that the film does a decent job alternating between comedy and drama, although at first it seems a little weird. I really think that once you discover that the movie is going to be more of a political thriller than a comedy, you feel comfortable with it. Some may not because they are led to believe they are watching a comedy and do not understand what this movie is trying to say at the end, but for these people they can blame marketers for not properly advertising this movie. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" talks about many things and seems to have a very strong opinion. As Tom Dobbs speaks, he is saying things that need to be said and not about sweets that cover them. I also think that the whole political subplot, while most critics say that it harmed the film probably because of misleading marketing, was very good. The idea of ​​computerizing the vote has been launched in recent years, and with all the problems computers face, the subject can be realistic. Also the control of large companies on voting is also addressed. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, I think everyone involved has done a good job. Robin Williams had a chance to be funny, but serious at the same time, playing Tom Dobbs. Some say that Williams has passed the latest welcome as a comedian, but I personally still think he's funny and he's a good serious actor as well. This is probably one of the few occasions when we can watch it go back and forth from serious to funny and think it works well. It's also cool to see Lewis Black co-star in a decent movie. Again I like Black when he shows up on "The Daily Show" and gets up however most of the movies he's been in were awful. This was a good film for him because I think his political views fit the story that director Barry Levinson was trying to convey. Laura Linney is a good addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress and, lastly, Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum do a very good job, as always, with these papers handed to them. "Man of the Year" was written and directed by Barry Levinson, the man who brought us movies like Rain Man, Good Morning Vietnam and Wag the Dog. Levinson does a great job writing the movie and directing it. As I said, I know a lot of critics did not like the whole political aspect of the movie, but I thought it fit it very well. It was cool to watch a movie that allowed me to think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a great job with this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, do not go into this movie expecting to see the movie that the commercials are selling to you. He laughs, but at the same time plays more like a political drama. It's not as stupid or silly as the marketing campaign leads you to believe. I really liked the fact that this movie that this movie was not a typical Hollywood movie. It tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and it worked at least for me. I like the fact that the film did not really ease any of the issues addressed nor did it have a typical Hollywood ending. I was trying to call the end from the start but, surprisingly, it did not end the way I thought it made me happy. It's a movie that will make you laugh, but then, a few minutes later, it allows you to think and wonder what will happen next. I think it's a good movie that will be hampered by its bad marketing.
