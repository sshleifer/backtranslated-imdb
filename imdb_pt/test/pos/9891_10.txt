I understand "Checking Out" will probably be released in theaters in the US in June 2006, and on DVD in November 2006. My recommendation is not to miss "Checking Out" !! This comedy movie will entertain everyone, who all relate to the characters, family relationships and various social issues that are portrayed. "Check Out" will make you laugh everywhere with a quick and clever sense of humor embedded in almost every line, and can make you cry in a moving way in a positive way as well. <br /> <br /> The subject of suicide is treated in a comic way, which at the same time can help people understand the impacts this act can have on those who have touched their lives and those who love them. We hope that the "check-out" can have a positive impact and help prevent those considering suicide from representing it, especially in the 16 to 25 age group that has the highest suicide rate in the US. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully written, perfectly fused and loaded with synchronicity and significant flashbacks in time, whose significance becomes more apparent throughout the film and especially in the end. I believe the script is worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay, Playing in Film (The Phoenix Film Festival honored "Checking Out" with the "Best Screenplay Award"). <br /> <br /> The cast is loaded with great off-the-air actors, and has a long history of great acting, naming awards and victories. I feel that Peter Falk's performance in "Checking Out" is worthy of an Oscar nomination, and is the most challenging and comprehensive of his career. The performance of Laura San Giacomo and chemistry with Peter Falk as her father is masterful, and was recognized at the Palm Beach International Film Festival with a "Best Actress Award." <br /> <br /> Even the teen characters in the film shine and are portrayed by young actors Dan Byrd (Movies: A Cinderalla Story with Hilary Duff, 3 Young Artist Award nominations, Won 1) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead : Island of Monsters, Wolf Lake, Passions, Touched by an Angel, 2 Young Star Nominations). <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare and producer Mark Lane wonderfully develop the characters, their interrelations, and the plot of this enjoyable and complex entertaining script. <br /> <br /> Mounting the movie keeps the pace of the movie moving quickly, only slowing down properly in pungent scenes so the audience never loses interest from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie that you can do the whole family to see and everyone will have fun.
