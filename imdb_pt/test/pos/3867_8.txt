SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love the Simpsons, and I've seen all the episodes that have already come out. I must admit that the first season is by far the most underrated, and this is the most underrated episode in the first season. The episode begins with the family playing Scrabble to prepare Bart for an intelligence test he needs to do in school. . He says the game is stupid and he does not want to play, but he needs to. He spells a word that annoys Homer and he chases Bart around the house. The next day, Mrs. Krabappel assures the class that the test is not part of their series, just a test that would tell them what their future would look like. Bart can not answer a question. He thinks fast. He quickly trades the test with Martin Prince, the smartest in the class. Later that day Marge and Homer are called to go to the principal's office to discuss Bart's behavior. Suddenly, out of nowhere, the school psychologist arrives and tells Skinner, Homer and Marge that Bart is a genius and must go to a special school for the gifted. Bart agrees to go since he would not need to do any homework. The next day, Homer directs Bart to the new school. He is presented to everyone and everything. Unfortunately, his day is not very good. Smart students have lunch smart, he can not read any comic book, but he does it anyway, and is criticized by his colleagues. For Bart's luck, he and Homer start having fun together, but Marge bought tickets for an opera. They go to the opera and make fun of it. The next day, he goes to his old school, but is ridiculed by his friends. They call it dexter point. While at his new school, Bart is told to do a chemistry experiment. He does it wrong and blows up the school, leaving it green. Bart is told by the psychologist to tell him why he did it. Instead, Bart tells him that he wants to go undercover and go back to his old school to watch other children. The psychologist is intrigued and asks Bart to explain it on a piece of paper. He finds this very difficult and instead writes a confession that he really is not a genius. He gives it to the psychologist. All he cares about is that he spelled the word wrong confession. That night, Homer bathes Bart and Bart says that he really is not a genius and that he betrayed the test. Homer gets angry and chases Bart around the house, while Lisa and Marge stare at them casually. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very underrated episode of the first season. <br /> <br /> 8/10
