WEEE this is still so much fun! As with most of my friends, we saw this movie on HBO when we were young, and then we were looking for a copy of it ever since. When they finally re-released, a few years ago, we had a Midnight Madness party ... and the movie was good. Of course, it's pure cheese, but it's still a lot of fun. If you did not see MM when you were young, you may not appreciate its value today.
