Do you want a movie that takes you to places? Well, this is a good choice. If you were a teenager at the time pictured in this movie - Motown Hayday - or if you want to go back and see what your parents made so much noise, I suggest you take this film and give it a watch. At the risk of sounding clich√©, you will laugh, will cry, will remember and remember. You will return to a time when violence at school was a fight. You will fondly remember your best friends at school. It's a good movie with a point of anguish, pain and realism - misunderstandings, losing friends, deciding what to do with your life. I think everyone, regardless of race, age, socioeconomic position, can take something out of this movie and really enjoy it. So take a few hours of a lazy day and check out this movie; There are far worse ways to spend your time.
