Well, that's as good as they come. There are discussions about whether Hitchcock was just a "master of commercial suspense" or perhaps a "compulsive technician" - or whether he was really "deep." No one knows exactly what these terms mean, but it is legitimate to ask whether, at its best, it could not have been all three at once. <br /> <br /> In this, it seems to be in its prime. . Almost nothing is accidental. It abounds in doubt, ambiguity and intelligence. And the story is captivating, Patricia Highsmith apparently having complexes similar to Hitchcock's. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the plot has been totally outlined elsewhere, so I will not bother getting into it. I will only point out five incidents on the screen of which Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible. Bruno Antony (Walker) followed Miriam (Laura Miller) and her two boyfriends at a carnival night with the intention of murdering her. She has noticed your attention and is innocently flattered by it. <br /> <br /> 1. Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through the Love Tunnel and then to an island in the center of the lake. Walker is right behind them, smiling, in his boat - Pluto. "Pluto." Not an allusion to the cartoon character of Walt Disney. It is a reference to Pluto, also called Hades, a god of the underworld of Greek and Roman mythology. This little touch can not be an accident. And the "underworld" that Walker represents is not just a literal hell, but the underworld of the human mind. I hate to say he's a Jungian "shadow," but that's what he is. (Carl Jung saw this movie? It was alive at the time of its release - but probably not.) 2. Now, this is a deadly serious sequence, right? Walker is a lunatic who is about to kill a woman he does not even know. Imagine how that would have been established by most directors. One night sneaking through a crowded carnival, robbing the shadow from shadow, the killer peeking from behind the canvas walls, and so on. What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker first arrives through the gates, concentrating on his victim, a little boy in a cowboy outfit holding a balloon, runs and shouts, "Bang! Bang! You're dead!" Walker shoves his head back in surprise and looks outraged at the boy. And when the boy starts to walk away, Walker throws his cigarette in the balloon and shows it, then continues his quest without another glance. This is one way in which Hitchcock treats impending doom. <br /> <br /> 3. The famous strangulation reflected in the sunglasses, which has been imitated countless times. <br /> <br /> 4. Miriam and her friends stop at one of those gadgets that you hit with a big hammer, sending a kind of hockey puck by the barrel to measure the strength of your blow. One of her boyfriend and the record does not reach the bell at the top. Under the look of admiration and admiration of Miriam, Walker smiles and rubs his hands, then picks up the hammer, hits it and the record strikes the bell. She's excited. He lowers the hammer, looks at her, smiles, and shakes his eyebrow at her like a ten year showoff! 5. After discovering Miriam's body, while the whistles blow and people shout, Walker leaves the carnival and finds a blind man waiting at the curb. Walker grabs the old man by the arm and leads him across the intersection, holding his hand gravely to stop traffic. A macabre joke. <br /> <br /> These incidents and others happen during the ten or fifteen minutes of the visit of the carnival. (Robert Walker's performance is exceptional everywhere.) It is essentially a kind of invitation to be noirish. (Cf: "Ride the Pink Horse") But the threat of the scene is undermined by Hitchcock's insistence on irony and distance. None of the familiar noir techniques is employed. There is nothing really "scary" about it. And murder itself is hardly savage. I do not think any director other than Hitchcock would have dealt with it the way he did. It would have been all menace and shadows, hideouts, failed attempts, barbs instead of smiles. <br /> <br /> Not that it's a totally flawless movie. An impeccable movie is not with us yet. Part of the middle section is a bit slow and Farley Granger, despite being a cool guy, is impassive, boring and a bit stupid. Your new girlfriend is just annoying. Hitchcock would treat the mis-assignment of guilt with deadly seriousness in "The Wrong Man." I'm not sure Hitchcock has thought about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt. The latter was imposed on him at a young age by his Catholic education. "Original Sin" - you were born with it - and everything. In filmed interviews, he always explained his fear of the police and the authorities in general, telling a story about his father leading him to the police station to scare him off after a peccadillo. We are justified in asking if this was just what psychoanalysis calls "screen memory." I hope you get the pun. I know I know. He's tense and inept, but I've spent a lot of valuable time thinking about it.
