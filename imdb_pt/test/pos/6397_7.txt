This show sucked when it first came. The first actress who played the daughter did not fit the role, the writing was a success or a failure, and Damon Wayans CLEARLY was not comfortable making such a friendly show for the family. The chemistry between him and Tisha Cambell (they are longtime friends, as well as all the Wayans of the clan with the husband of Tisha and Will Smith and Jada Pinkett) worked to redo the show. Once they returned, they reformulated their daughter, made the son much more dumb (to Eric of "Boy Meets World") and turned the youngest daughter into a genius ... (later they gave her a little genius boyfriend to make comedic guest appearances). The show, while often roller coasters of tacky bullshit walks enough to keep it as a show you can see Damon Wayans being comfortable in their own skin on set (especially since the main writers, directors and consultants were all the members of the Wayans family) and their character. Since everyone was on the show for a while, they worked for all the cast's strengths and were able to make a consistently funny show in the air. <br /> <br /> However, there are a lot of antics, many about the major antics and often a lot of chaos going on in the Kyle family's life. They made Junior TOO STUPID, they also made the eldest daughter a cute, clumsy idiot once in a while and the younger daughter was not even spared by the writers. I feel like they jumped the shark and signed the death certificate when Junior impregnated his girlfriend, she moved in and he married her and her parents were introduced (the character of Junior's wife's father makes me WINCE just thinking of him) . The show remained funny ... but it was a UPN show on ABC if that makes any sense to the reader. <br /> <br /> The reruns are funny enough, but I'm relieved that it's over ... there was nowhere to go with it. When it's bad, it's really bad. He tends to be cornball sometimes, but at least he was a black man who made a sitcom come up with syndication in a large network .. Who can say that to you now? (Given the CW merger and brownout on TV networks lately, that is). 1.
