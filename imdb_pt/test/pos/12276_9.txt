Great little short film that went on air recently on SBS here in Aus. Get a copy if you can - probably just good for some shows, because you'll eventually remember the script - and it's the twists and turns that make this movie so funny. Well directed and intriguingly scripted, it is an example of how good low budget short films can be.
