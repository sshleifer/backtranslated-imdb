I saw this movie for the first time in a video store and, being the fan of Bam Margera, I had to rent it to see what it was all about. Since I have a huge and stupid (note the stupid word) sense of humor, I found this movie absolutely hilarious. Some of the parts are useless and random, but that's what makes them so fun. You need to think that things like being slapped in the face and banging on the head with a watermelon are funny to enjoy this movie. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by the acting. These people really did a good job. Nothing worthy Oscar, but well enough to overcome the amateur level. Teenagers and young adults would probably find this more fun because of the modern slang and the situations used. I would not suggest watching this with your parents and vice versa. <br /> <br /> On the whole, the acting was great, the script was hilarious, and the story is really something you can relate to.
