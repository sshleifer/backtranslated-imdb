A very late show release, the Rush-in-Rio DVD is both attractive and disappointing. This set of two disks shows Rush at its best. After 30 years perfecting its unique sound, it's great to have this record from one of the most talented rock bands of all time. <br /> <br /> The show has more than two dozen songs, a documentary and three songs that feature several songs. angle view. Packed in a bi-fold holder with sleeve and a small insert, it has a very good price for the amount of material it contains. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Rush from the late seventies to the early eighties, and this DVD comes in great, with half the show highlighting music from that era. I will not list the songs in case you want to be surprised. If you took part in the Steam Trails tour then you will know what they are playing. <br /> <br /> Playing in Rio for the biggest audience of all time, Rush is a great pleasure for all here. In fact, that was one of the first things I noticed that was peculiar in this program. For most of this two-hour concert, you listen and watch the crowd, actively singing and dancing wildly with the music. In the beginning, it's exciting to see the fans giving Rush a well-deserved response. But after several songs, I was ready to listen and see more of the band and less of the crowd. This is by no means a hit from the Rio crowd. More power to them! It's a critique of the final DVD edition. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my second and main reason "I hate it". The video editing is terrible in my opinion. Save for the multi-angle bonus cuts, the whole show is a frenzy of visual chaos. It's as if the director wants to see how spasmodic he could be. I count changing camera angles, on average, between every one and four seconds, constantly! After three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. Which is too bad, because I wish I had watched the whole show, like I got on the show last year. Maybe this quick edition is the latest fad for show DVDs, but I really think this is a hassle and a retraction from the overall experience. As said before, I would not mind a song or two, but the whole visual aspect of this disc is rushed, or RUSHed. It's really ironic, because all the previous concert clips I've seen from Rush, mostly from Moving Pictures, are strictly filmed directly, with little round-trip alternation. It's almost annoying, visually speaking. This DVD took him to the other end. I know that many Rush fans will strongly disagree with my statements, but that's just my impression. <br /> <br /> The result: if you're a Rush fan, you'll buy this DVD regardless of my comment or any other. I still would have bought it after reading my review. Just do not expect a "normal" concert. Who knows, the things mentioned above may not bother you.
