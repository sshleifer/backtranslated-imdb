Vincenzo Buonavolunta, a man who has spent years working in a steel mill, as a maintenance man, that Italian owners are selling to the Chinese, arrives at the end of the meeting where the purchase is being organized because he wants to tell the new buyers a failure he discovered and he thinks he has the solution. He did not exactly cling to the old Italian administration or the new Chinese proprietors. He even quarrels with the translator about the exact term he wants to use to express his concern. <br /> <br /> The next thing we see is Vincenzo coming to China trying to get in touch with the new owners. To his surprise, there is someone new in charge, like Mr. Chong, the man he tried to warn in Italy, was fired. His next mission is to reach the woman who was the translator, Liu Hua. He finds her working in a library, but she tells him, in unmistakable terms, she blames him for being fired from his position. Liu, who sees the despair of Vincenzo, agrees to accompany him to find his steel mill. <br /> <br /> So Vincenzo and Liu begin a journey through some of the dark fields that involve traveling by train, steamer, bus and truck, to remote parts of the giant country. Finding the right factory proves to be elusive, at best, but Vincenzo discovers a life that is completely foreign to him, as well as finding a gentle soul who does not hesitate to help the Italian, despite his initial aversion for him. . <br /> <br /> Gianni Amelio's film is a kind of travel diary. It takes the viewer into unfamiliar territory. Some comments compare Vincenzo to Marco Polo, the great Italian traveler, although the similarities are not very palpable. The film keeps our attention in the beginning stages of the trip, but begins to get a little less pleasant, since Vincenzo is arrested after separating of Liu. Mr. Amelio is an interesting director, as he clearly demonstrates with this film for which he worked on the adaptation of Ermano Rea's novel, which we do not read. <br /> <br /> Sergio Castellitto is the only reason to watch the movie. This versatile actor brings a lot to the film, which, in a way, is a tour de force for him, as seen in almost every picture in the picture. The combination of Amelio and Castellitto proves to be a winning combination. Ling Tai, who is making his debut as Liu Hua, has some lovely moments and shows good chemistry with his co-star. <br /> <br /> Luca Bigazzi photographed the Chinese landscape in all its desolation. We see a China that is not a pretty postcard. Mr. Bigazzi captures all the gray, so typical of the areas where the film is set. Franco Piersanti's score is good for the film.
