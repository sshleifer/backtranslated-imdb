Almost four years after the outbreak of the war in Iraq and we are in a bigger hole than ever before. That's right, so all those flag fans who were so sure of the right and the strength of the American way are now chasing their tails, are not they? You bet it is. This movie said that from the beginning. It's kind of weird how much the film, or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It's almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what would happen in the future. There was a moment when I felt the hairs standing in the back of my neck when GW announced that "big combat operations ended" over a look of a broken trailer being towed with the American flag swaying in the rear. You have to see to understand what I mean, but even if you are apolitical or even pro-war, this movie will have some impact on you because it is so present in the story.
