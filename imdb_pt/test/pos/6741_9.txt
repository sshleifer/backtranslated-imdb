The viewer who said he was disappointed seems to be missing the point here. This is an excellent film, excellent and realistic portraits of a middle-class Jewish family in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, long time ago. The nuances are perfect and I felt the cast of everyone was superior. I especially found the acting done by Judith Ivey just perfection - especially the speech she has with her daughter when the daughter comes home late at night. This scene was Oscar-worthy. But really, the whole performance was fine. I recommend this movie. It's a fun family movie and it's wonderful to see how a lovely middle-class family lived in Brooklyn for so long. See and you will be glad you did. It has some very funny lines and the character of Eugene is a real comedian - very funny.
