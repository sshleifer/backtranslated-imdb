I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California, in October 1976. As we drove through the city's tourist streets, we saw a movie brand announcing "ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX." So before we even checked out the version of Lewis Carroll's classic from Disneyland a half mile away, our curiosity won and we ventured into that cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie started to amaze me when watching this kind of movie appear in Orange County, ultraconservative and conservative. <br /> <br /> Thirty-two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND in a local video. store. I wondered if this was the same movie until I looked at the back of the jacket and saw a photo of the lovely Kristine DeBell in the lead role and decided to revive some good memories. Subversive Video, to its credit, has released two versions, X and XXX in the same package. As you can see, the version my friend and I saw in Anaheim was rated X despite the original XXX advertising on the spot. Seeing this for the second time, makes me realize what a charming play director, Bud Townsend, brought to the screen. As an example of the scope of this man behind the camera in his salad days, he directed two episodes of DAATH VALLEY DAYS. <br /> <br /> Miss DeBell, appearing on the April 1976 cover of Playboy, is ideal as Alice. She brings new American innocence to the role of twenty-something librarian, eager for a better life. When her boyfriend is rejected to take their relationship to the next level, Alice reaches her turning point. This is a 'musical comedy', however the melodies are quite catchy, with strings and metals appropriate to compensate for the generally suggestive lyrics. Miss DeBell has a pleasant voice when singing about wanting to be free. That's when the magic begins. The pace of this film is surprisingly fluid, since the Wonderland genre and supporting cast are there to allow Alice to flourish in femininity. Special mention goes to TV veteran Larry Gelman as the White Rabbit who seems to be the only character not obsessed with sex, since he is always late for a compromise or something. <br /> <br /> Special features include comments. of famous feminist advocate Lena Ramone, who tells how to watch this movie while studying at college influenced her in choosing a career as an adult movie actress after graduation. What makes ALICE IN WONDERLAND such a yummy walk is your garden setting. Partially filmed in the lush and natural splendor of Stanley Park, Vancouver B.C., the film belies its pornographic roots. You do not leave here feeling like you've witnessed a despicable skin movement. So far, I have not seen the triple version of XXX. The extra sex footage added later could, in all likelihood, disrupt the overall flow and remove the light, the vivid atmosphere evident everywhere. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lewis Carroll's version is the best way to curl up and explore. Alice in Wonderland. However, for a time capsule depicting the adult film archives of the 1970s, ALICE IN WONDERLAND is worth following that white rabbit for a court walk full of merry chaos.
