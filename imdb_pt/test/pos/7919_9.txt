I believe that anyone who has enjoyed Ivan's films, the Terrible of Eisentein, would enjoy this well-crafted film. This movie played out as "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King", but without the special effect, but as better and better drama. <br /> <br /> We have the German, who dressed as KKK, conquered Novgorod of Russia. The Russian summoned Nevsky to get them to fight the German to save Russia. Nikolai Cherkasov, who played Ivan in the films Ivan the Terrible, was charismatic like Nevsky. The first 10 mins as he dealt with the passage of Mongol was captivating. <br /> <br /> Many of the scenes were beautiful even in black and white. War's anticipation did not require any dialogue like "How many enemies will we be killing," etc. With the exception of a few speeches, the film can basically be interpreted as a silent film. The fighting scene can withstand those of the Civil War fighting scene of The Birth of a Nation. <br /> <br /> Another force of the film is the great soundtrack of Sergei Prokofiev. The song gave the film an epic feel in these scenes without dialogue.
