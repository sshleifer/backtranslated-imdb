This film should be easily qualified as a film that best promotes human understanding between people. It may be somewhat annoying to try to understand that a young Jewish woman from the south could have given shelter to a German prisoner of war who escaped. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol portrays an incredible portrait of the unhappy young woman, thirsting for acceptance and love. Michael Constantine performed remarkably well as his tough dad and Esther Rolle, as housekeeper Ruth gave a superb Emmy-winning performance as a knowledgeable servant caught up in these events. <br /> <br /> Bruce Davison plays the German who is not supposedly guilty of Nazi atrocities. That's how his role appears. He escaped, but he joined the German army and he could have been a member of Hitler's youth movement. <br /> <br /> The action takes place in 1944 in Georgia, in a rural area. The people of the city are full of prejudice. Even the FBI inspector acts as if he wants something about the Jews. Notice the opposite interpretation that while McNichol is in bed, Davison is hunted and finally shot. It is interesting to see that society sees McNichol as a traitor for harboring a fugitive prisoner of war. The film also deals with an extremely complex relationship that exists between father and daughter. The outburst of Constantine by his daughter in the end is some performance. Like her mother, Barbara Barrie, little is given to do. It was annoying that she was stereotyped like the typical Jewish mother with that high lipstick on her lips. <br /> <br /> Memorably done and worth seeing.
