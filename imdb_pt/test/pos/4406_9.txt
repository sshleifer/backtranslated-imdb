As someone who used to spend hours driving down the back streets of north London in an attempt to avoid the terrible congestion, this movie immediately appealed. Add my interest in how London was in the late 70's and you have the basic premise for my version of TV heaven! On paper, the film marked all the right boxes and, having just watched "The Knowledge," the film itself would certainly satisfy, if not exceed, my high expectations. <br /> <br /> Visually, I was surprised at how different London looked back (I lived in Islington in the 1990s, long after gentrification transformed the area). It really came out as dirty, tatty and down-at-heel. London may still have bad housing properties, but the overall feel of the place is much cleaner, brighter and more pleasant today (based on what this movie shows instead of my own memories). <br /> <br /> As for history and acting, well top marks obviously go to Nigel Hawthorne as The Vampire. Absolutely brilliant! He acts deliberately unpredictably, alternating between total severity and surreal mentalities, in order to weaken the Knowledge Boys by testing and testing them. <br /> <br /> In short, this was an excellent and fun trip. back to a very specific time and place that I find infinitely fascinating. But even if you're not particularly interested in London around 1979, you'll still enjoy following the witty dialogue and friendly characters from "The Knowledge".
