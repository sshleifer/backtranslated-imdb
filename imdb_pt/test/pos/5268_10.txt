"Hail The Woman" is one of the most exciting movies I've ever seen in my entire life. I watched twice in a row and sobbed my eyes. <br /> <br /> This silent film masterpiece deserves a much wider audience; unfortunately the only surviving engraving is so badly scratched that most people will not watch it all the time, and they will miss the gem that shines beneath the brute. This film could use a digital restoration to help enhance its beauty, but I doubt it will get it from anyone, since its main theme is the spiritual restoration before Christ of the family unit, and this is not politically correct in the days of today. However, it remains a powerful topic for those whose hearts are suffering from the pain of broken family relationships. <br /> <br /> The cast is magnificent, especially Florence Vidor, who literally shines like Judith, the daughter; the ethereal Madge Bellamy as Nan, the poor girl who gets pregnant and is put aside; Theodore Roberts as the domineering domineering old man who destroys everyone around him through pride; and handsome Lloyd Hughes, as son David, afraid of his father, but really of his own life. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to watch on Christmas, especially. You will not regret being patient and visualizing it in its entirety despite its deterioration.
