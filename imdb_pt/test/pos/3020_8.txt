The cell is weak in the plot, full of holes and has a very bad acting as well. but none of that matters, as director Tarsem Singh gave us one of the most visually stunning films ever. the whole plot is just an excuse to let tarsem play and take it to the minds of a serial killer, bringing to the audience some shocking, enjoyable, breathtaking and mind-boggling images. <br /> <br /> The images of this gorgeous movie will stay with you for a long time to come. this film is a perfect case for the theory of "suspension of disbelief." forget the silly storyline, just let your senses be overwhelmed with the pictures. and J.Lo seems impressive enough to add to the rest of the work of tarsem. cinematography is harrowing, haunting music and costumes are impressive. <br /> <br /> The film is less of a film and more of a work of art. it's just that the medium is not the screen anymore, it's the big screen and the celluloid. one of the most refreshing films of this decade. The cell phone is a must watch. A bold new step in the production of films. <br /> <br /> A captivating 8 !!
