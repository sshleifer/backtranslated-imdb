This movie is basically a parody about Hitchcock Strangers on a train, which I thought was overrated anyway. The plot has Danny Devito going to see Strangers and then thinking that Billy Crystal wants them to trade the murders so that Crystal kills his mother and Devito to kill his wife. Both Devito and Crystal are great and Devito's mother is fine too. This is the debut directorial of Devito and is better than the war of the roses.
