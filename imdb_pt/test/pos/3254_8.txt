Having seen and loved this movie in Australia, I was very eager to get my footprints in for a copy. I have a DVD back in the UK only to find out that it is a very different edition. <br /> <br /> The home edition of Australain I've seen is faster. The UK, and I presume European, editions spends much more on the narrator played by Jimmy's dead brother. And in fact, that belabours and some other points for no real benefit. <br /> <br /> It's not a serious review, but the Oz edition is just faster and I think it's safer. <br /> <br /> Can not say why they thought they needed expansion to the overseas market? <br /> <br /> So, beware of the one you go to. <br /> <br /> I went to both.
