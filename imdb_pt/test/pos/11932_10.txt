Sean Astin performs another incredible performance on "Toy Soldiers". He plays the highly intelligent playful Billy Tepper, along with Wil Wheaton and Keith Coogan, who play their best friends, Joey Trotta and Jonathan "Snuffy" Bradberry. During a normal school day for Saint Anselm boys, a group of dangerous terrorists takes all boys and teachers hostage and threatens to blow up the school if the leader, the father of Luis Cali (Andrew Divoff), is not released from the American government . but these are not just ordinary boys being held hostage, most of these children are the children of very powerful people in America and half of them were expelled from other schools before coming to St. Anselm. They are mouths and actions can only kill them. When the government is desperately trying to figure out a way to help, Billy, Joey, Snuffy and a few more kids decide to solve the problem with their own hands.
