One of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy thrillers (there were several of these films in the '70s). This is about an accident in a nuclear reactor and attempts to cover it up. Jack Lemmon is the employee who realizes how dangerous the plan is and Jane Fonda is the television reporter who takes the story aboard and both players are at their best. <br /> <br /> The events portrayed in the film are: of course, terrifying and not at all overdone (much of what happens here in real life on Three Mile Island), and although it now looks something like a play of the period, however, highlights just how fragile and dangerous a world we have created for ourselves. Expect a number of similar films on the effects of global warming soon, (and do not rubbish like "The Day After Tomorrow" as well).
