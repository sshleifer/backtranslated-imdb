I'm not a big fan of music movies. "Annie" was a show I loved, but the movie was a failure. The films "The Phantom of the Opera" (and I believe there were three) did not coincide with Weber's performance. But I loved it. The DVD will occupy a place of honor among my "guardians". Even being a film adaptation, it somehow captures the taste and atmosphere of the live theater. Bette Midler, always a pleasure, is just exceptional in that role. There is good music, lots of laughter and even a tear or two. I saw most of the great musicals of the eighties and nineties. Somehow I missed this so there is no comparison to do. But if it's revived, I'll be the first in the ticket queue! But this movie is so good, I'll be in the weird position of wondering if the stage production will measure up to the movie.
