And I love it !!! Wonder Showzen will catch a cult audience and once it is canceled, DVD sales will go away the roof. This is a very funny show in their own ways. It is a parody of children's shows, Sesame Street. Our puppet characters consist of Chauncy, a furry yellow monster with a hat, whose our host. Clarence is a blue lizard that makes its own segments, where it comes out on the streets. He is a weird dog who refers to himself in the third person. Wordsworth is the intelligent whose brain always shows. Then there's the presenter and the pink puppet. It's a very funny show, not as nasty as you'd expect, but more the situations. They pick up 7-year-olds on the street, say what to say and make jokes they do not understand. My favorite segments are Clarence's videos, especially when someone does not want to be filmed. I prefer TV Funhouse, which was a similar show, but this is still a very funny show that I hope will last for years to come. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** 1/4 of *** * 30 minutes. TV MA.
