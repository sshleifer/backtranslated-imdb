Witticisms, colorful characters, family relationships, dealing with difficulties, living with fun and humor. This movie has everything and more. What a great story of "every man (and woman)", with a plot and script of the first quality. It offers just clean fun, lots of laughs, lots of smiles and pure entertainment for the whole family. Other reviewers describe the story. Am I just going to offer this comparison teaser? is part of "Best of Show", "Grumpy Old Men", "Millions", and a few other comedy and life movies in one. <br /> <br /> This gem of a movie has probably had a limited release and is probably not much available for rent. But now it's on DVD and I recommend it for purchase. If you like old-fashioned movies, fun and fun for the family, you can not miss with "Manna from Heaven". This movie is a sure cure for fire or to ward off melancholy in days of unpleasant weather or difficult times.
