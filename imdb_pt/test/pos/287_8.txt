Anyone who criticizes 'Jacqueline Hyde' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic prank they pretend to be, is simply not playing with a full deck. Just from the title, it is obvious that this low-budget horror comedy should not be taken seriously ... it is as ironic as the French kiss of a nymphomaniac, and equally exciting. Female cast members are all great and fun to watch. Check this out, Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown prince of soft terror. Unlike most soft horror movies, this is fun with charismatic and exceptionally appealing actresses. The film does not even try to follow the plot of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, but instead looks for all possible ways to create visual jokes and erotic situations. Blythe Metz, the brunette femme fatale who plays Jacqueline's sexiest and homicidal side, is a real knockout. Watch and enjoy!
