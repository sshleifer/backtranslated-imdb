The United States of Leland was an incredible movie. I kept passing the guide on my TV without knowing what it was and never having the chance to sit there and get into it. Then one morning, when I woke up early, I saw that I was about to begin. So I decided to watch. I had time and interest to watch it. When I saw that Ryan Gosling was in the movie and that he was the main character, I was immediately sucked in and could not get off my couch. The fight Leland goes through is such an inspiring story. Everyone has to deal with the same kind of thinking at some point in their life, whether it's a small detail or something as big as what he's going through. I have to sit and watch the movie again just to get all the things I might have missed the first time. As a general comment ... I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a gosling fan or someone who likes a good movie with a very good story. The fact that there are so many other big stars that also had great performances is just a bonus added! So, do what you can to take a look at the movie, I can almost be sure it will not be a waste of time.
