Leland Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to prison for the murder of an autistic boy. When pressed with the question "Why?" he does not have an answer. While in prison he meets Pearl (Don Cheadle), his teacher, who decides to solve the problem in his own hands and helps Leland figure out why he did it. Throughout this film, we learned everything about Leland's troubled life, including his ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone), his famous father Albert (Kevin Spacey) and his entire sad life. <br /> <br /> This movie is the second Matthew Ryan Hoge movie, and it's spectacular almost everywhere. This is a movie that will leave you thinking in the end, and wondering how everything works. The film is pretty bleak, but if you can handle it, you'll realize just how good the movie is. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there is no thug. There is no one you can blame for anything that happens. There are no stereotypes and the audience does not try to prove that Leland is guilty. Instead, we sat down, relaxed and watched as this kid's life unfolded throughout the film. All the problems described in the story are very real. Drug addiction, parents' expectations, overwhelming sadness; they all exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling gives one of the biggest performances of his career in this film, as the depressed teenager Leland. His father lives in Europe and does not care much for his son. The only person he loves is Becky, but she has her own problems. He knows exactly what he did, but, as he says in the movie, 'You want a reason, but maybe there is not one. Maybe this is something that just happened. There is a reason, but we did not find out until the end. As you watch the movie, the audience is surprised that a person so young can know much about the world. Leland notices things that people tend to ignore. An intriguing scene that really affected me was during one of Leland's conversations with Pearl. Pearl just betrayed his wife and when Leland asks why, Pearl replies that he is only human. So, Leland says something that never occurs to anyone: "Why do people only say this when they do something wrong?" <br /> <br /> Another fantastic acting job was given by Chris Klein. In the film he plays Allen Harris, the boyfriend of Becky's sister, Julie (Michelle Williams). Although he is not one of the main characters, I was surprised by the depth of his character. You can relate a lot to Allen. You know how much he cares about the Pollard family. It is as if they were their own flesh and blood. At the end of the movie, you realize how far it would go to help them. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a masterpiece that has been neglected by some people. If, however, you take the time to watch it, you will probably find that everything I mentioned above is true. And when you're done watching, you'll never see the world the same way again. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
