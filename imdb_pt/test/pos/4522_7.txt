Chan is in New York and is involved in an attempt to sabotage a new aircraft project. <br /> <br /> The war was more than a year after arriving in America, but World War II was already happening in all parts of the world. and so it colored everything since most people probably realized that the war was coming. Here the War is not mentioned, but the fact that the film deals with the production of airplanes, at least, alludes to it. The mystery itself is very good, the notion of airplane sabotage lends itself well to a few tense moments. To be sure, we're talking about Charlie Chan so we can be sure he would live to fight another day, but there was no guarantee of what condition he would be in, not if someone around him would survive. <br /> <br /> I really really like this movie. Not one of the nests, and far from the worst. It's one of the truly rare, truly enjoyable things. Definitely worth a look or six.
