For every fan of adulthood tales, this 3-hour adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel is pure fun. Cinematic beckons for the kinetic style of Baz Luhrman, as well as for all those prim prime and proper parts ever present on the BBC (where you are likely to have seen almost all prominent members of this cast). It is somewhat obscene and above the top in some points, but that is exactly what the novel called for. The cast is attractive and, in the cases of Anna Chancellor and Hugh Bonneville, perfect. In the case of Rachel Sterling, as our heroine Nan, you should simply ignore the fact that she is too beautiful to be confused with a boy and run with her. It's a fantasy, after all. <br /> <br /> Some fans of the novel may be left out because of the various character changes (particularly the character of Jodhi May, Florence), but <br /> <br / <br /> all changes work for the greater good of this teleplay and <br /> <br /> provide an overall value of high quality entertainment.
