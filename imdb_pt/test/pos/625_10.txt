This is definitely one of the scariest and most mysterious movies ever made. You're stuck with the movie from start to finish. Even if there are some holes in the plot, it remains exciting for the final showdown. In addition to "8 MM" and "Peeping Tom," this is one of the best films on "Snuff Movies," a taboo subject of our culture. If you like the SCREAM Trilogy, you'll probably love this.
