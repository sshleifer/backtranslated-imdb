One of my desires is to be a filmmaker, and I must say that there is no way to compete with the powerful drama The War at Home. The reason is because acting is perfect, and when you watch the movie, you know what I'm talking about. All I can suggest is watch it, I got so wrapped up in it and I was extremely impressed. <br /> <br /> Estevez's relationship with Sheen on the screen was absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> And the same thing happened to him. relationship with his mother (Kathy Bates). Some of the best scenes include these 2. As well as the relationship between Sheen and her daughter, Estevez's sister in the movie. <br /> <br /> 10/10, and definitely in my top 10. I want the DVD!
