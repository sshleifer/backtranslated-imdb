If you like who-dun-its, you'll like this movie, considered the best story of Italian detective (giallo), Fulci did. <br /> <br /> It's not Mickey Spillane, sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone. <br /> <br /> Many would take offense at local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked, however, and he would have jumped with a chance to jump into her bones. She also tries to seduce the local priest. <br /> <br /> The young boys are missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch closely to find out the killer. You can? Do not jump on the first face, it's too early, and it's too obvious. <br /> <br /> Anyone familiar with Fulci will be able to guess the killer, who died with a violent death in the end. What crazy reasoning he had.
