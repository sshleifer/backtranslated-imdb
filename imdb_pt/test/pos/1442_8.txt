A great groundbreaking film (in 1955) on an important subject. <br /> <br /> I was not expecting much from Sinatra's performance and I was pleasantly surprised by it. I loved Kim Novak! She was beautiful! <br /> <br /> I loved Elmer Bernstein's jazz score! As great as Lazlo Schifrin's for "Bullitt"! I'm very surprised that it does not seem to be available on CD (if anyone knows about the availability of the soundtrack in any other format, they should post here somewhere!). <br /> <br /> Preminger's leadership was, as always, borderline. impeccable <br /> <br /> I did not read Nelson Algren's novel, nor have I any idea how faithful the script was to him. Frankie's subplot as a "hot" card dealer was also a surprise, as were some other things. But see for yourself. Very worth seeing ...
