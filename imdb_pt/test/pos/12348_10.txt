by the way he looks at the other comments made, it seems that many people have not understood the film. It is not centered around zombies, in fact they are not zombies, they are a device regenerated by the mage to scare the girls to death, their main focus is on Meg Tilly, he wants to help you finish the game. work that he died doing in the first place, and what you get is a great movie with an incredible ending, it's hard to find on video, but every now and then it appears on HBO or Cinamax, check it out, I gave it a 10 and I recommend it .
