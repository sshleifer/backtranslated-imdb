The maritime coaching instructor Jack Webb's interpretation that molds new recruits into basic training does not require interpretation. Direct, direct, frontal, apply to this classic. At a time when reviewing the statements of our leaders is a necessity to understand what they are saying, this movie that does not play games with our language or our moral fiber. Right and wrong are clear and easily defined. If you like a clear and well understood dialogue in a disciplined military environment, this movie should suit you.
