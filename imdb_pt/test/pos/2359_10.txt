It seems b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this movie! But do it! I did not expect anything from this movie, just something to pass the time, but I was hooked from the beginning! Two interesting premises - A bank robbery went wrong, a million dollars missing and two girls on the road to start a new life - How will these two stories collide? Only when you think you know which way the movie is going, it makes a 180 and you're amazed at the big plot twists! It has a great but unexpected end, and you keep wanting more - always a good sign - rent it or even buy it, you will not be disappointed!
