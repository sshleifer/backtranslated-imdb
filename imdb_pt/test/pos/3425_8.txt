I saw this movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005. I assumed that if it was starring Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank, it would have to be at least decent. Well, after a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite satisfied with the final product. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the English Afrikaaner and Xhosa (?) Of some of the actors was kind of hard to understand, but it was like watching "Waking Ned Devine". "" Trainspotting "or any other big-screen movie I adjusted after 15 minutes, and I was trying to figure out why Hilary Swank was supposed to be South African and sounded like she was trying to put on an accent, but it sounded pretty American. But as the movie later reveals, the more she reveals about her character and how she moved to the US as a teenager, you begin to understand how she may have lost a bit of so it began to make sense that only certain words could have an Afrikaaner. <br /> <br /> I know it's a little weak for someone to use the film as an education, but one of the great things about this movie is It was interesting to see a dramatization of a judgment of Truth and Reconciliation.I had heard about the T and R process in South Africa after the fall of apartheid but I really did not know how it worked. Or The final reddit is that although some of the scenes seemed a little planned, this was, in general, a very strong film. The final sequence where the "truth" comes out was the strong ending that every movie expects. A definite must see for anyone who cares what happens outside their borders.
