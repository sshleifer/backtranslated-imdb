"Family Guy" is probably the bravest comedy ever produced. It relentlessly spits everything you can think of, from TV shows to family drama. Best of all, it's one of the few TV shows today that's really funny. <br /> <br /> The show revolves around the Griffins: Peter, the obese father whose schemes are limited by his lack of intelligence. Lois, the mother who is more or less the head of the family, though Peter considers himself to be. Chris, the fat teenage son who has as few brains as his father. Meg, the black sheep of the family who is the only one of the jokes of all. Stewie, the baby who has plans to kill his mother and rule the world. And Brian, the family dog, which is often the voice of reason, but is often corrupted. <br /> <br /> The "Family Guy" employs lots of tactics to get laughter from the audience. Most notable are the frequent cuts that distort what has just been said. They are effective because of the impeccable timing and how they work out. "Family Guy" uses spoofs to get humor too, most commonly on TV shows from the 1980s. What really makes the show so good is that one does not have to be familiar with what one is cheating on. I'm sure it would help, but the stuff is funny enough by itself. But the show does not stop there. This not only fools practically everything, but also distorts your own fakes! The show is full of humor out of color. The only reason people are not guns about the show is probably because it makes enjoyment of all races, sex and other generalities equally. There is nothing sacred here, and no one is immune to the satirical blows of "Family Guy." <br /> <br /> Placing musical numbers in a movie takes a lot of time and effort, and is a big risk. . But "Family Guy" contains some great songs. All well written and executed, and of course they are hilarious (perhaps the most famous, "The Freakin 'FCC" is captivating and hysterical because it reaches the audience frame where it hurts). <br /> <br /> Voice characterizations are right on the money. Seth McFarlane is tremendously talented. It provides the voices for Peter, Brian (who is his own natural voice) and Stewie. The voices are not only consistent and creative, it can change the tone at will, so it seems they are spoken by three different actors. Alex Borstein brings a nasal accent to Lois who is perfect for the character. Seth Green is unrecognizable as Chris (if I had not looked at IMDb, I would never have known it was him). Lacey Chabert originated the character of Meg, and while she was well, Mila Kunis actually raised the character in her sharp voice. Kunis gives Meg a new, sharper advantage she did not have with Chabert. "Family Guy" was compared to "The Simpsons", and this is fully understandable (and not just because they are produced by FOX). Both are satires of working life and while "The Simpsons" is good, "Family Guy" holds an even greater advantage. The show is totally fearless. There is no real sacred cow. The program satirizes disabilities (physical and mental), ethnicities, TV shows and movies, celebrities, politicians, religion (especially Catholicism), drug use and addiction, sexual humor of all kinds (including S & M) and some that are beyond description. Not everything that "Family Guy" shows in the public works, but as a whole, the show is always fun and often hilarious. <br /> <br /> If there is some flaw with "Family Guy", it's that jokes happen a lot of time sometimes. Particularly with the "strange moment" jokes, the sequences are stretched for so long that not only are they no longer funny, they become so annoying (and long) that a fast forward button is guaranteed. These can be effective in about 10 to 15 seconds, but the show sometimes extends beyond two minutes. It can be argued that the program rewrites its rules to suit the plot, and usually happens (for example, Brian often acts as a person, but he still acts like a dog when history demands it). But this is not a problem because the program still works. <br /> <br /> Some people argue that the program is no longer funny. Although I agree that it is not as bold as it used to be, I think it's FOX's fault, not McFarlane's and his team. The show came up with FOX, but after some glitzy ratings and spectator attendance, it was canceled. However, sales of DVDs were large enough to be picked up by Adult Swim. The show became an instant success, and was again bought by FOX. However, because the show is so great now, FOX is afraid to let writers try and try new things. While still funny, the mood is not so fresh and bold. <br /> <br /> Definitely check out this program. It's incredible.
