Rififi is a great movie that is forgotten. It's a crime drama in which a man gets out of jail and plans another job. It's a widely used story, but it's different from the others. They gather the usual suspects to work. This film takes a look at how the family is torn apart over time. The current assault scene is one of the best I've ever seen. Instead of a suspense soundtrack, the director decided to go in silence, around thirty minutes of silence. This fits perfectly with humor and is often copied these days. Of course things get out of control and people die and end up in a great ending that accumulates in suspense. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a great noir movie that not a lot of people talk about this is a great catch.
