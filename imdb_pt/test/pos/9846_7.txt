The big, top-billed James Cagney does not appear until the second third of the movie, and probably has less screen time than Dudley Digges, who plays the potentate of the eee-vill reform school. But when Jimmy arrives, as deputy commissar of something or other to reform the reform schools, he cuts the air with his hands and jumps up on his toes and spits Warner-First's energetic conversation with all the usual, panache Psychology in this antiquity, one of Warner's many efforts to assert his place as the "socially conscious" studio, is not profound: Digges is bad just because the script requires him to be, and there is the strange notion that the juvenile delinquents will become small children if they receive only a little autonomy. But it's done in that quick and spare style that the studio has specialized, and never bores. Frankie Darro, who has suffered all sorts of onscreen problems during a brief term as Warner's favorite Rotten Street Kid, is an ideal JD - a handsome and charismatic tough guy with a flat nose and a hateful look that could dry steel . No kid actor today can touch him.
