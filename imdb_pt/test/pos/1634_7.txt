Before seeing the preview of Angels and Demons, I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might prevent me from enjoying it; the huge amount of hatred against Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because the name of Dan Brown is put on all the posters. I walked in with an open mind, and hoped for the worst, but instead, what I got was a two-and-a-half-hour Roman cat-and-mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that's all good entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The movie is loose in the novel itself. The Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon (Hanks), pours into Rome after the pope's sudden death and re-election through the papal conclave. Organizing all this is the carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). However, he soon discovers a new threat, one involving a secret brotherhood that makes its known presence, an anti-matter time bomb that Vatican City is now targeting and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon, using your intellects (and trust me, you will be hearing a LOT of it) is given the task of finding and saving you using the mysterious Path of Enlightenment. Helping him on the mission is the CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), who is also co-creator of antimatter. <br /> <br /> The movie itself runs at an uneven pace. One minute, Langdon and the Swiss Guard are rushing to save a branded cardinal, the next minute he bores you with useless information about every random object he passes, evidently diminishing the book's long-awaited action / suspense sequences. It does an interesting reading on paper, but the screen can go either way. <br /> <br /> The characters are decently written on the big screen. Ewan McGregor performs as convincing as the quiet but seasoned Patrick McKenna, with a famous accent. Tom Hanks is a little more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, direct leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither his performance nor Ayelet Zurer's are worth it, and instead of being part of the story, they are just kicked out as assets. <br /> <br /> However, Angels and Demons accomplish what the DVC never could; an exciting fast-paced movie full of satisfying explosions, beautiful recreations of St. Peter's Square and the Basilica (including many of the churches) and a pulsating bomb that counts until midnight. Ron Howard does a decent job in the direction of this second adventure of Langdon, this time receiving many criticisms and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for strained (almost) pursuits. <br /> <br /> Although newcomers might call it "National Treasure 3," with a much greater threat, there is still contagious suspense suspense / suspense suspense and still bright photos of Rome to breathe. Fans of the book It may seem different to the drastic changes movies, but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates, A & D does very well at keeping the viewer locked onto the screen this time rather than on his sleepy shoulder. <br /> <br /> A good book-to-film adaptation that will attract and entertain. <br /> <br /> 7.4 / 10
