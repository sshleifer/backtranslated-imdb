Would you like to know how many MINI Cooper cars were sold thanks to this movie? Could not help but increase sales of this small car, which is presented in this film along with an attractive cast. <br /> <br /> This is a very fun chase and chase movie. He features a "cool" cast with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> The best chase scene is early on with a boat chase in Venice, Italy. The film does not exaggerate in violence, it has a very intelligent script (with a few exceptions). features interesting characters and is very firm. The game of cat and mouse between the characters of Norton and Theron is full of suspense and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Once again, however, we are manipulated to cheer by criminals portrayed as "the good guys." How many times has this happened since the days of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" in the 1960s? It's Hollywood twisted, for you. Here, one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed the gang leader and figure (Donald Sutherland) of the gang, so he is the worst of the group and the villain in the movie. Also Theron's character is in the typically exaggerated feminist mode of Hollywood in which women can do all things (including driving a car) rather than a man. A third minor irritation is Seth Green's presumptuous and clever attitude, which we must also follow because it is modern and funky. <br /> <br /> Despite these obstacles, it is an extremely entertaining film and also does not exaggerate in profanity or sex .... and, yes, these strollers are cool. Everyone I talked to saw this movie, like it.
