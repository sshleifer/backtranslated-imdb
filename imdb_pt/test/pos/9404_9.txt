I was quite impressed with Martha's narration and how it pulled the emotional strings of the audience and how it must have impacted the family. The back and forth movement of the plot was well done, and I usually do not like movies with flash-back / flash-forward effects. I felt throughout the evolution of the film that "Tommy certainly did it". This leaves you with a sense of how these people lived their almost totally devoid of one another and the consequences of not having any desire to answer the question: "It's ten o'clock.You know where your kids are?" And furthermore, "What the hell are they doing?" !! Or "Do I care?" !! Rich and spoiled ducks literally getting rid of murder. Or they thought .......
