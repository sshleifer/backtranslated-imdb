"With all the misery of the world, how can we not get drunk?" ??? Mia <br /> <br /> A beautiful aerial view of a large city becomes sinister with the approach of a fleet of aerial bombers; an angry hairdresser reacting to a perceived racial offense cuts a road through the thick hair of a businessman; a man dreams of being dragged into an electric chair after a failed magic trick, and a teacher breaks in front of his school class because his husband calls her a witch. These and about fifty other vignettes ranging from the depressing total to the madly humorous to the cheerfully uplifting populate Roy Andersson's You And Theson, his first feature since his critically acclaimed if commercially unsuccessful songs from the second floor. <br /> <br /> You, the Vivo, are filled with the same kind of imaginative pieces as the Songs, full of black humor, surreal situations and strange-looking characters. Although a bit long and less focused than his previous work, what remains constant is Andersson's unmistakable style, with its stationary camera, sterile bottoms and precision in detail. If there is a theme that joins the sketches, it is that our time on Earth is limited and "tomorrow is another day," so let us treat each other with kindness. Along the way, we are entertained with tuba and Louisiana drum music. Brass Band, dinner guests in a banquet hall stand in their chairs singing an exciting song, and a house that turns into a moving train. <br /> <br /> Emotions range from the melancholy of a daughter trying to communicate with an Alzheimer's patient to the entranced dream of a young woman to marry a handsome guitarist named Micke to the applause of a crowd of onlookers. there is a continuous narrative thread, the theme of greed and despair appears in several sketches. presents two burly individuals and his tiny dog ​​sitting on a park bench, the woman bemoaning the fact that no one understands or loves her, but she cheerfully ignores the comforting and comforting words of the man. <br /> <br /> There is also a heavy mix of irony. During what appears to be an executive lunch, one man tells another on the phone that the workers do not appreciate the quality and how good it is to enjoy the money and the things he can buy, like good wine. When he is not looking, however, a man at an adjacent table calmly takes his wallet off his jacket on the back of his chair. Although Andersson's cynicism is sometimes not well-hidden, You, the Living, have an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition. It's a cautionary tale that looks at the mess humans got into, but suggests that there is still time to turn around if we listen to the Goethe poet's warning that opens the film: "Be satisfied, you, the living, in his bed deliciously warm, before Lethe's icy wave licked his foot away.
