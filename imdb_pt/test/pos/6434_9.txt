Co-directed and starring Rutger Hauer, this short film was based on a tale by the Dutch writer Harry Murlisch. In the 10-minute length of the film, you'll be able to see a life as 'Harry' unveils his long-standing fascination for a room he constantly passes in his youth. Returning to the city many years later, he discovered that he rented the same room. <br /> <br /> Using black and white film, the textures are accented in this delicate tale of a tale. Harry's voice draws him into his world. <br /> <br /> A subtle and rigorous performance of Rutger Hauer and 2 non-speaking characters. Wonderful soundtrack from Dutch musician Dyzack. <br /> <br /> At present, it is difficult to see this movie, as it is only available in the region of DVD 2 "L'infidele" (Liv Ullman) as a bonus track. But it must be on the reissued DVD of "The Hitcher" - another performance quite different from Hauer! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you can!
