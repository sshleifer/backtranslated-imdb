Imaginary heroes is clearly the best movie of the year. It was a complete and absolute joy to watch. I was riveted. The whole audience at Sunset Five was fascinated, when the movie was over, no one moved, nothing said. I think this movie is a perfect example of the power the drama has. Especially as it gives an example of the quality of drama / work of this younger generation. <br /> <br /> There were moments in her movie, many, like at least seven, in which I was struck by such a great beauty, emotional beauty, that I really could not breathe for a while. And for a cathartic addict like me, this is the best census experience I could ask for. It is the result of powerful and masterful narrative and direction. Like heavy things like Burtolucci and these guys. <br /> <br /> Each element of the film fits well. There were no mistakes at all. The cast was incredible. I've been a big fan of Emile and Ryan for a long time, and I thought they've never been better. I was / am / will be continually stunned by this movie. And I promise I'll drag all the people I know to see. Must be seen. Must win prizes.
