Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have to be one of the best friends to work together. They've done a lot of movies together, I think they're fantastic when they work together in a movie. Out of the Sea is a fantastic comedy movie that I think to watch. I give the film 10 out of 10. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau will be remembered when the films they made together are on TV. They will be sadly lost. God bless you both.
