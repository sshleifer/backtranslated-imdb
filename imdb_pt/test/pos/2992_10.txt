I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so much! I found him among some old tapes and I did not know what it was and after reading the back of the cover to see what summer had to say about it (which, incidentally, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack of the movie more often than I mentioned what the movie really was.), I thought it looked interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older movie. <br /> <br /> "What controversy?" I thought to myself how I put the tape in the player, I was curious to know. And my expectations were certainly met. I loved! I think it's a very feminine kind of movie, but it was so sweet and adorable! It was a beautiful novel, although sometimes the direction reminded me of the camera work in 'The Graduate', which I thought to see that the director must have gotten used to some of the closes they did. <br /> OK, so it was not entirely conceivable for these two boys to run away and live alone ... but this could happen ... in a fantasy ... <br /> <br /> <br /> But the end simply me made him crazy! I was so angry at how they finished ... this kind of leaves you hanging, and I suppose they can approach what actually happens to them in the sequel ... but at the same time, I'm almost hesitant to see that. , since sequels are almost never as good as the first. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this movie to anyone aged sixteen or over! It's an incredible movie ... Amazing!
