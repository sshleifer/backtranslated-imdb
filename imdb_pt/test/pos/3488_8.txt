Formula For Murder is not a well-known Giallo, but that does not mean it's not very good! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind such cult classics as Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released at the end of the Giallo cycle, but more than supports many of the films released around the "golden" period in the early seventies. Despite the lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way of mixing Argento death scenes with some genuinely surprising twists and a series of well-defined characters. The film may not be as exciting as many other films of the genre; but this is more than compensated for by the guaranteed way that the central situation is fed to the public and the resulting tension. The plot begins by showing a false priest raping a young girl named Joanna, before pushing her up a flight of stairs. We then advanced several years and the girl is now a woman, who unfortunately is in a wheelchair. She is being trained for a sporting event by Craig; A man who also has romantic designs on her. However, her proposal is not greeted with joy by Joanna's personal assistant, who also has romantic designs on her. <br /> <br /> The film presents a twist in the middle of the path that makes up the backbone of the film, and while it is not exactly logical; it is good to watch and insinuate that you are in an interesting movie. Director Alberto de Martino is clearly not afraid to show some scandalous and bloody scenes, and the best of them in this movie shows a priest being beaten to death by a shovel - and I personally would not hesitate to name that sequence as one of my favorite scenes of murder of Giallo! The plot can be a bit uneven at times, but usually the action is very good. The director spends what seems like an eternity at the conclusion of the film; but it is absolutely filled with tension, and the way it happens is good, because it takes advantage of all the plot points prior to it. The soundtrack from Fulci's The New York Ripper also works well and, breaking a Giallo tradition, Martino's film also features some good performances by veteran David Warbeck and Christina Nagy in their unique movie role. . Overall, this movie is not one of the easiest to find Giallo; but it's worth tracking and comes recommended to fans of this type of movie.
