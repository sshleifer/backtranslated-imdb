The pair of Abbott and Costello live in this version of a classic of the era's history. In "Jack and the Beanstalk", there is everything to see, music, magic and comedy in one. Costello plays plays Jack after he hears the story being told by a boy once. We know that Jack was a poor boy who sells his cow "Dolly" for 5 magical grains. Well, he plants those 5 grains and they were, in fact, magical. He climbs into the sky, sees a great castle there, and he sings a song, unknown to find the giant (Buddy Baer). Not only he, he would dance with the woman who was also giant. She beat Jack with her elbows during the dance. That was funny! You have the harp that knows how to put the giant with ease. The goose that lays eggs of gold. And my favorite, the way Jack gets rid of the giant. He picks up the ax and starts cutting the beanstalk. Another funny one is where the ax got stuck during the chop, and the final celebration happens when people dance around the mark where the giant fell. Lots of fun and fun for the whole family too. Highly recommended! 5 stars!
