I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginners of the English language should model their conversations after their dialogue. For example, the conversation between Paul Kersey (Bronson) and Mrs. Kathryn Davis (Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and straightforward: Mrs. Davis says, "I hope you enjoy chicken. the only thing I know how to do, "to which Kersey deftly replies," Chicken is good.I like chicken. "If this is not English Grammar 101, I do not know what it is. <br /> <br /> Another thing about this character of Mrs. Davis: Kersey sleeps with her on the second date after she practically throws herself at him and tells him. she wants to see him "one last time" (being the fourth time they met) before moving to her sister's house in Binghamton, NY, to escape the chills; so he does not even blink while his body is burning on the street just minutes later. Kersey never says his first name throughout the film. Not once. Never a "Get in here, Katy," or a "This is a nice dress you're wearing, Kathryn" or "Be careful, Katie, or the creeps will get you!" <br /> <br /> And while this 'love' is developing between the two, Fraker (Gavan O'Herlihy) keeps his eyes always watchful on them. It's almost as if Kersey was using her as bait to reach Fraker as much as he uses the camera or the car. Sure enough, when Fraker bites, Kersey bites back ... in the most incredible sequence of events ever captured in movies! The final fifteen minutes are possibly rivaled only by the last thirty minutes of the Delta Force in its brilliance. And that's giving Delta Force a lot of credit. In what other movie you can see Ed Lauter take Alex Winter to catch Charles Bronson, a disturbed gang leader apparently calling a hotline to call neo-Nazi motorcyclists to help him, and agile Broadway dancers wearing knit tops? posing as street punks, all set for a soundtrack written by none other than Jimmy Page. If this is not the highest of high comedy, then nothing is funny. <br /> <br /> Truthfully speaking, there are a thousand ways to declare the unintended comedy of Death Wish 3, but the only way to truly understand it is to observe and judge for yourself.
