Of course, for that, one would expect it to be a typical, idiotic T & A movie, and it is. But it really does have some humorous moments. Given the era in which it was made, and the obvious aspect of exploration, it is still one of the best B comedies of the era. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, you will clearly see the inspiration for many. of the scenes in "Revenge of the Nerds", and numerous other films of the same genre. Most of the acting is horrible, and way over the top, but that's exactly what I expect in a movie like that. What they lack in ability to act, more than makes up for with their camp value and complete disrespect for anything worthwhile. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing about this movie is that there was obviously some money that went into it. Movies like this made today do not have the same style. If you can turn off your brain and turn your sense of humor into an hour and a half, you'll enjoy this movie. I challenge someone not to find at least SOMETHING in this movie that they think is funny, if not hilarious.
