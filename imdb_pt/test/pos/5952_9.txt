OSS 117 was fun from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It's hard to define why a movie plays or connects with you or not, and I will not try to analyze that perfect comedy, so politically incorrect that even academic roles should be devoted to it :)! <br /> <br /> Everything is old fashioned here, from women's clothing (sigh!), Mambo dance, the "singing hero" ... ("Bambino" sounds like an Italian canzonetta sung in ... Arabic: )!). <br /> <br /> Hubert is physically imposing, but dumb as hell. Of all the 007s, he looks like Sean Connery, but he's definitely nicer because he's ... silly, what he thinks all the time, laughs, has even some homoerotic fantasies and rumors about him. In short, as an anti-hero, he rocks :)! Sometimes he just raises his eyebrows or frowns, and that's all it takes to make you laugh. <br/> <br/> Bérénice Bejo is the real queen of the movie. Gracious, treacherous but with ideals. Aure Atika, on the contrary, is reduced to a kind of femme fatale. It's amazing to see her that "sexy bomb", you. <br /> <br /> You can not compare with "Austin Powers"! I agree with D. Hartley (Seattle, WA), of Amazon, to be respectful of the genre. <br /> <br /> What's your favorite scene? One of my favorite scenes is the "chicken fight" with the masked villain. But the truly perfect is when chatting at the cocktail party with their contacts, as they all mutter platitudes with confidence ... This scene just makes the comedy genre worth it.
