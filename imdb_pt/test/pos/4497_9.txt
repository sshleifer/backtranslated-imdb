I have not read the novel that the film is based on. So I can not comment on what is missing or if there have been changes. <br /> <br /> As I said above, I had a wonderful experience watching THE KITE RUNNER .. I think when I watch films about other cultures here in the USA, I learn how other peoples live and exist. <br /> <br /> The actors in this film are from Afghanistan and other countries in this area. There are three small children in this upcoming epic movie in their early roles, They were wonderful. <br /> <br /> The scenes that were supposed to be in Kabul were filmed in various parts of China, I suppose the area is similar to the actual places in the book. <br /> <br /> Mark Foster drove & he did FIND NEVRRLAND, he created the same magic here. <br /> <br /> All aspects of production are first-rate. <br /> <br /> I found this movie better than the nominees and won the Oscar. <br /> <br /> The film is under-titled, it's very clear to read. It has an appropriate PG-13 rating. SPOILER ALERT --- The child rape scene is very well treated. <br /> <br /> I can not, however, give a 4 star rating as the overall plot and plot that we have seen many, many times, Non-the- less this is a film that is worth a lot Rate Movies Rate TV Shows IMDbPro IMDbPro IMDb Resume Content Licensing Watch HD Trailers on IMDb advertisement IMDb> 9 out of 10 (based on 2 votes)
