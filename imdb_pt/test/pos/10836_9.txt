This was recommended to me by a friend who said she was cute and cute for a "Lesbian Flick" sexuality. Boy was he wrong. I guess he just did not get it. Growing up without understanding and then discovering yourself through judgment and tribulation is more like that. <br /> <br /> The characters are full and vibrant and the story has plenty of fun played through the theater performances to keep anyone interested. Rachael Stirling as "Nan" goes through so many attempts at finding the love she desires only to find out that she was the only person she was afraid to reveal as well, and rushed out. Johdi May as "Flo" was remarkable. I spent a few hours trying to remember where I had seen her before, only to find out she was The Quiet Sister "Alice" in "Last of the Mohicans" Fortunately, I was raised in a liberal family and had no trouble trying a movie like that. So many people are losing movements like this. I am happy to have advised my friend and tried. But, I'm sure I liked him better.
