Graphics is far from being the best part of the game. This is the best TH game in the series. Close to subway. That deserves strong love. It's an insane game. There are massive levels, huge unlockable characters ... it's just a massive game. Wasting your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even if the graphics are bad, it does not make a good game. In fact, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics suck. WHO CARES? As they say in Canada, this is the fun game, yeah. (You can go to Canada on THPS3) Well, I do not know if they say that, but they can. who knows. Well, the Canadian people do. Wait a minute, I'm getting off the subject. This game rocks. Buy, play, have fun, love it. IT IS PURE BRIGHT.
