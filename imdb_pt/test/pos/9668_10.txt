This is a brilliant series along the same lines as the Simpsons. Following a family as they go through life and problems, etc. A little less realistic than the Simpsons, talking baby and dog to someone? Family Guy goes where SImpsons or Futurama does not dare, moving on to the worst jokes and the bolder jokes. And believe me, it works! Almost all the jokes have hit the mark and they leave you in stitches (especially frequent flashbacks!) When my brother showed me this for the first time, I was not hooked, but after a few episodes I got hooked. You will be 2.10/10 for a truly brilliant show. Cooperating with Seth Macfarlane for bringing this show to life. :)
