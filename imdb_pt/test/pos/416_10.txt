"Ahh ... I did not ask for any incredible hits" ..... "You'll get a" Hack is simply the biggest television show ever made. A bit of me died when I called the t.v. one Friday night to get a little Hack and was not on. The show went deep into the main social issues of our culture. I found that at the end of any episode I watched; I left, having been entertained and informed. I'm really dumber now that Hack is gone. I no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate. Since Hack left, I see them as a burden and unnecessary strain on taxpayers. So for God's sake, we need to bring back the Hack!
