The most attractive factor that is in this movie masterpiece is not the beautiful main actors. It's not their excellent acting and sizzling chemistry either. <br /> <br /> For me, it's the mis-en-scene of the whole movie. The settings, the lighting, the props ... all contribute to the mood of love between the main characters. A breath of smoke from Chow's cigarette tells us his state of mind, those always full of Lizhen cheongsams reflect the constraints of decision making, the ruins of Angkor Wat relate to the deterioration of the relationship between the two leaders. The excellent use of mis-en-scene gives the film the right amount of sensation needed to give body to the complicated nature of the characters' relationship. The film leaves the public yearning for more.
