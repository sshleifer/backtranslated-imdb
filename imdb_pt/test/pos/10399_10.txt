Beyond The Clouds is an elegiac and frighteningly beautiful work of art. The overall smoothness of the light that this film is bathed in, makes you want to touch the screen. The evocative autumnal humor was only achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience. Or, in other words, an old man. I do not know of any other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal humor with a quality as sweeping as Beyond The Clouds. Almost all the people in this movie are beautiful, unless your idea of ​​a beautiful woman is a blond blonde pneumatic. The dialogue does not really matter much, not that there is much anyway, and as for stories, forget it. Some movies exist only as visual experiences, this is one of them. Do not worry if you want "simple entertainment", this is not for you. <br /> <br /> I could get excited about the visual perfection of this movie for days, but I will not. If you are interested in cinematography, photography, film direction etc., watch this movie.
