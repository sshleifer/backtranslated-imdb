I went to see this movie with caution. A suicidal comedy did not seem consistent. Having a brother who attempted suicide and seeing the devastation that has caused our entire family, I know firsthand how overwhelming it can be to deal with this issue. I must say - This movie deals with this in a way that allows the viewer "inside" someone who is suffering and simply does not know why, or how to stop it. While the film is not perfect, it respects the subject and, more importantly, makes it accessible to the masses. I know for our family, humor has helped us with a lot of pain. And Max and Grace are exactly what it presages to be - a suicidal COMEDY. It's funny. "And I also felt the characters were real and vibrant. It is also extremely intelligent, but simple. Cut to the chase and I appreciate it! I give 9 and I recommend it.
