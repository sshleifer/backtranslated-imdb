I suppose it depends on when someone actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it is. <br /> <br /> I saw this as a child on TV in 1973, when it was "The Stranger" and I loved it. This was the time when the space program for the moon was a reality when programs like "Search", "UFO" and "6M $ Man" showed a 12-year-old child what the world could do in their future. Adventure and technology. <br /> <br /> You only saw the shows once and that's when the network went on the air. The only way people could cut their shows was by making their own parody; they failed to bring their show and add their own comments about it. <br /> <br /> I did not know what this concept of "pilot" was. I watched the movie and waited for Stryker to get home; I did not know there was a possibility to continue for more than two hours. <br /> <br /> Back then, would I understand what so many people detest in the movie right now? I doubt because I do not remember as such. I understand now? It is not really to understand the story, one should not see it from its perspective, but rather from the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> If someone is watching as an American, it may be funny about the lack of security in a police state ... but if someone is a subject in that state, then compliance can be expected and security can be smaller. When things are supposed to be perfect, perfect to an extreme degree, perfect that one should not doubt, then one is not likely to wonder so quickly when things are out of order. <br/> <br/> The subplots of the film is interesting, like the old man who remembers the previous time, but observes his words, suspecting that there are spies everywhere. Or that the police declare knowledge of the values ​​to some extent because they are careful about how they control or impair their intellectual power. <br /> <br /> These days, you're likely to know exactly what the movie is about before they see it. , much of the suspense, the surprise is lost. But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the film is a perfect exchange if we consider that this film was made in the Cold War and the greatest fear of the astronaut is that he has fallen in the USSR. One arrives at a certain distance in the film before it becomes evident that such possibility is the least of his concerns. <br /> <br /> This is the main difference between "The Stranger" and "Doppelganger". The latter can be considered timeless, since any comment it has on the USSR is comparatively smaller and lost at the beginning of the film. In the first, these links are in the movie, supposedly directly at the beginning and then as a theme variation after the wings. <br /> <br /> All this said, despite my good memory for the movie, is quite easy. to see that he would not have done it as a series. Each week, Stryker would make friends, Benedict would chase, Stryker would escape. Eventually, the society of Benedict XVI would get rid of him. Someone would take the chase. A routine would develop. There may be a jab in something new, like maybe another member of the Stryker mission crew appear, but it probably would not be enough to keep the show going. <br /> <br /> If someone comes in with the knives that others have used to cut the film, chances are they will cut it too. But if one remembers that this was done during the Cold War and what fears and estimates the other side were during that time, than the popular environment contained to the viewer, then they may find some fun and intellectual themes in it.
