I thought this was a beautiful, very brave movie. These beautiful pictures - and I enjoyed wearing glasses broken with applause. Also as the best friend repeated the phrase about "..and she is a year older than me .." showed that their friendship revived and grew, but maybe some competition is left ... I loved the filming of hands feeling the fabric . The dance concert was beautiful. The beginning seemed slow, though ... it took a while to feel the characters - the husband could have been more abusive - he just seemed absent when other characters talked about him - did not really fit. The case was. the best friend and husband seemed random. The meeting of the doctors seemed to suggest that there was not much time left (to live ...), so when the infidelity was revealed, I did not feel so much sympathy for the character - more like relief! the end was so good - the lines were given. she and her husband, and the scene where she stands is brilliant!
