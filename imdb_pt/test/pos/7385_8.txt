Rickman is sexy and good but the "stranger" is less convincing - Reedus is kind of sexy but he is not a consistent actor - this may be the director's fault in this case - we should find him alluring in the extreme just because he is " beautiful "- but that is not enough. The frustrated wife is almost convincing - 7 years of marriage and she and Rickman's character should be more relaxed with each other, whether their roles are incompatible or not - they must have standards so far. I understand this, although I find that the wife is a little stiff in her role - and not convincingly attracted to the "stranger" - then that is a failure - the silent bond between Rickman's character and the "stranger" is best done, even we are not sure what it is. I miss Rickman's sexy English accent (luckily he walks in and out of the American standard). disappointing, but with some great acting.
