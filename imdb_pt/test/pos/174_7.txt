I can not believe I rarely see this title mentioned by all of you, 80s horror freaks and I definitely will not join all my fellow commentators here saying that 'Bloody Birthday' is a horrible sight. On the contrary, I enjoyed it a lot and was pleasantly surprised with the ingenuity and surprises that it offers. Do not just refer to this movie as being 'another slasher of the 80's', because the victims here are quite unlikely, just like the killers. We are introduced to three cherubic-looking young men who were born during a solar eclipse. By the time they were delivered, the planet Saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon, and because of this, the children are emotionless and seemingly unconscious. This really begins to appear around their tenth anniversary as they go on a merciless killing. <br /> <br /> Granted, this material is incredibly exaggerated and even slightly offensive, but seriously, who cares? Unlike many other horror films of this period, at least try to bring something original and imaginative. For the first time, the children's acting is good and the whole movie has a scary atmosphere and gray music. The sequences of the murders are dark and tense, and it's always scary to see them being committed by angel-faced boys. I do not know who hired the 3 kids, but they did a good job. Especially the girl and the boy with glasses are highly memorable. The dark images of the heartless trio resemble classic highlights such as "Village of the Damned," "The Bad Seed," and "Children of the Damned." This movie is far from as memorable as these landmarks, but great fun and no horror lover will regret to see it. <br /> <br /> Bloody birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt. He is not particularly the greatest genius of the cinema, but a pleasantly disturbed guy who also brought us lots of cheese animations like 'The Brain' and 'Starship Invasions'. If all this is not enough to convince you yet, Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity. And not just any nudity, but a topless dance act from MTV-VJ Julie Brown. Oh, and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant participation of Joe Penny, later the star of the TV series "Jake and the Fatman." Check out!!
