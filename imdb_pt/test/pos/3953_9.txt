James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic, but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere way. At Tristan's screening, some people were turned away from being grumpy and grumpy and doing all the work of James Dean, but I do not think that's true. Blind Spot is a positive proof of your tremendous talent. In this movie he bears himself with a different kind of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Sour and really moving. The lines of his diary cut him like a knife. You feel a keen intelligence of observation behind your words. The tone is everything. It carries through the action and suspense as well as the dark chunks of black humor. I really like the other two actors too. The blonde girl is totally beautiful and the man is hysterical in his hardy stoicism. Some of the bad guys seemed a bit sketchy, but this is a mini-point really. The film is totally solid and Franco is very cool.
