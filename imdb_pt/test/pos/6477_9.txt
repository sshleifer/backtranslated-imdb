It is hard to imagine how popular and how much impact a Norwegian immigrant and a chemist would have on the American public and how much of a national tragedy his sudden death in 1931 was seen. But Knute Rockne was an extraordinary individual who revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small, obscure Catholic college on the map. <br /> <br /> I've heard clips of Rockne's famous conversations and it's strange how Pat O Brien understood the voice and the inflection perfectly. In what turned out to be his career role, Pat O'Brien captures the integrity and fighting spirit that was Rockne. Rockne is aided by Gale Page as Bonnie Stiles Rockne, who complained of her home as a training ground for Notre Dame, but never expelled anyone from her home. <br /> <br /> Rockne's first impact on football was as a player with Notre Dame is not a coach. One fine day in the second half of a defeated football match against the heavily favored army, Rockne and his teammate Gus Dorais, played by Owen Davis, used the forward pass as an offensive weapon. Before that, football was simply a game in which you only had bigger guys on your side and ran for the defense. Rockne did not invent the pass forward, but he became popular and football became a strategy game and then very vigorous. <br /> <br /> Rockne knew how to work the media too. Those well-publicized popular conversations were not just to inspire his players. They were well publicized and it was largely due to him that college football became a major sport in the Golden Age of Sports in the 1920s. Playing a small but fundamental role is Ronald Reagan. As George Gipp, the first player Rockne trained to achieve greatness, Reagan not only got a good performance, but forever after a name that was useful in his subsequent political career. The death-bed scene that Rockne vowed to be accurate became a Republican war cry as many Republican bandits came out to win one for the Gipper. <br /> I still remember a photo widely distributed in 1981 that was one of the first. to reclaim President Ronald Reagan at the Notre Dame graduation with his old friend Pat O'Brien. Reagan has always credited O'Brien and Dick Powell of all Warner Brothers stars of the period as those who were the kindest and most encouraging to a young player in the lot trying to do good. <br /> Notre Dame herself owes her prestige to Rockne. It is quite possible that Notre Dame is a small, obscure Catholic College without the reputation football has brought to it. <br /> <br /> Although George Gipp and the famous backfield of the Four Horsemen certainly had their place in the sun, it was Rockne who had the reputation. It is no accident that Warner Brothers managed to make Amos Alonzo Stagg, Glenn 'Pop' Warner, Howard Jones and William Spaulding, Rockne contemporaries and technicians with a reputation in their own right appear in Knute Rockne, All American. It was a way to honor the guy who was number one in his profession. <br /> <br /> I think more than football fans will like Knute Rockne, All American. Although you can become one after watching the movie.
