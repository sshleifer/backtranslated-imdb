Situated in the hometown of Bam Margera, Westchester PA, 'Haggard' is a semi-true story about the life of Ryan Dunn and his friends Falcone and Vallo. Dunn was abandoned by his 2-year-old girlfriend, Glauren, who is now seeing a sip of beer, long-haired metal head called "Hellboy" and this is making Dunn crazy with jealousy. In a desperate attempt to uncover the truth about what's going on between Glauren and Hellboy, Dunn pays his friends Vallo and Falcone to invade his house and produce evidence of the case, with somewhat disastrous results for all those involved! I found this movie very funny, maybe in part because I'm a total fan of Jackass and CKY, and it has to be said that a lot of the humor will probably be lost with those who have no previous knowledge of Margera's insane comedy brand. The film contains much that will be of interest to the skaters, not least the appearance of skateboarding legend Tony Hawk as a police officer. There are also special guest appearances by Bucky Lasek, Brandon Novak, Jason Ellis and the parents of Bam, April and Phil. <br /> <br /> DVD extras include CKY music videos (with Bam's brother Jess on drums), and Bam's favorite band, HIM (Bam's character in the film bears the name of There is also a documentary and a "very hot for the idiot" sketch. <br /> <br /> In summary, as I said before This movie will be of great interest to the skaters and fans of Jackass / CKY, but I feel that Margera and I made a great effort with 'Haggard' and I, for the less, I liked it.
