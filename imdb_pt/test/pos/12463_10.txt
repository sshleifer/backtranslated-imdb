There is absolutely no doubt that this version of Tarzan is the closest to Burroughs' vision. While he cheerfully collected his royalties from the films produced during his lifetime, he often made it clear that they were little more than the bastard children of his tales. The absurd obsession of cinematographic studios in climbing Olympians like Tarzan was beyond laughable. I think we should consider ourselves lucky because they did not look at pitchers. <br /> <br /> Before this movie, the most faithful adaptations were in comics and comics. As good as some of them were, we had to wait seven decades for a filmmaker with integrity to respect the character as he had been created.
