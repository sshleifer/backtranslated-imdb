This is a slightly uneven entry, with a prominent sequence involving an over-the-hill gang reminiscing in the restaurant that once - thirty years earlier - was their hiding place; a ho-hum duologist between two aged rock musos; a noiric sequel has turned its head and an opening sequence (more epilogue) involving the aspiring theft artist Edward Baer and the current "hot" property Anna Magloulis that has its moments. No film in which Jean Rochefort appears can be lightly discarded and here he shines as one of the quintets of the mountain, in fact the film is worth seeing only for Rochefort, but each of the sequences has something to offer and definitely worth the Worth a look.
