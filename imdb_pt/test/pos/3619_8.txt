As is often the case when you try to grab a 400-page book and put it into a two-hour movie, a lot is lost. Here director John Madden (Shakespeare in love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost takes it off. What we have is a charming and emotionally convincing film that seems incomplete. <br /> <br /> There is a lot about this movie that is wonderful and fantastic. The cinematography of John Toll (director of photography for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, winning the Oscars of both) is splendid. Working with Madden, the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic sites in varied light are lush and beautiful. Madden also uses countless Greek actors as city dwellers, giving the city an authentic feel. The soundtrack is also great and the mandolin and vocals by the Italian soldiers are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and romance, which occupy most of the film. . There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment. However, by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there is not much film on the roll and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated. Although the battle scenes are well done, after the battle it is obvious that more and more commitments are being made to prevent the movie from running for long. When we get to the post-war scenes, the treatment is merely skeletal. Another downside is that DVD is particularly scarce in features. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is charming in romantic leadership as the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing instead of fighting. When fighting he must, Cage changes perfectly for a man of fierce principles and resolve and somehow remains believable in both characters. <br /> <br /> Penelope Cruz, whom the camera loves, gives an uninspired performance like Pelagia. In part, this is because Cage dominates the screen, but Cruz seems very calm in a part that must be emotionally torrential and dynamic. It allows the character to be targeted as Corelli's love interest rather than establishing him as a powerful character in and of itself. John Hurt makes a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor, who knows both human nature and medicine. However, Christian Bale seems a little exhausted and hard as the fianc√©e of Pelagia. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie on 8/10. Despite some disadvantages, this is a moving movie that is worth seeing. Photography alone is worth the price of admission.
