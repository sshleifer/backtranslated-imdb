You can not really call Roy Andersson prolific, (6 movies in 37 years). Nor can you accuse him of being conventional; it does not do 'straight-forward', at least when it comes to narrative. "You, the Living," his first film in seven years, is like a surreal documentary in which a large number of characters are observed, without doing much and if that sounds disappointing, let me assure you it is not. This is a fun, accessible and surprisingly warm movie, a piece of life away from what we usually see on screen. <br /> <br /> Of course, 'slice of life' is hardly the appropriate nickname to apply to this film, since the lives of most people will probably not be any of that. The incidents on the screen range from the almost frighteningly ordinary to the totally crazy, and while the characters can fly, sometimes to never be seen again, others to reappear as if they were eager for approval, Andersson gives everyone a kind of benign affection. . This and some fun songs ensure that the time we spend with them is a time well spent.
