Being myself a Russian myself, it's sometimes hard to get the reference jokes about American television personalities or celebrities. In addition, Family Guy is the smartest, funniest, and most politically incorrect program seen on Earth. The dubbing is excellent and seems clear enough, even for a speaker other than English, as I myself understand. The animations are also good, maybe even good for a TV show. Here we have the equivalent of the Adult Swim Channel, but nothing compares to this gem. Not even Simpsons or South Park. I hope creators will continue to entertain and have fun. I do not want to see the whole thing spiraling into mediocre entertainment.
