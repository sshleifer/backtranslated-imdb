The minutiae of what is involved in making a robbery is what makes this one of the best assault films. Then there is the theft itself, a wordless minute that has never been overcome, followed by what is probably the most pronounced example of dishonor among movie thieves when things start to disintegrate spectacularly, and we have what is unquestionably the largest of all. All the assault films. <br /> <br /> This was a tough and unemotional movie when it first appeared in 1955 and is so tough and unemotional today. (It shows a bit of the nervous brutality of Dassin's previous "Brute Force.") There is not a loose moment or duff performance throughout the film and Dassin captures the atmosphere of decadent clubs and Parisian streets like no one else and the final ride through Paris by a dying man is one of the most iconic final sequences of any movie. One classic.
