For his latest film, John Huston directed his daughter, Anjelica, in this adaptation of James Joyce's "Dubliners" story, and he gave us one of his best achievements to remember him. <br /> <br /> Joyce is as impossible to film as any, but "The Dead" at least presents a traditional narrative to work on. Much (in fact, almost everything) of the important information in the story is in the spaces between the lines, in the thoughts and expressions of the characters - there are great moments, but they are cerebral - they are not the material from which movies are made. But somehow, Huston hits, and he gets an almost perfect fit. <br /> <br /> Anjelica is magnificent, and the film is astonishing and powerful. <br /> <br /> Note: A
