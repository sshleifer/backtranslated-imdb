I rented this movie without having heard (or read) anything about it. What a pity! This movie is clever, witty, hilarious, fast and realistically ridiculous. Characters can develop without relying too much on clich√©d and tired stereotypes. It was refreshing to watch. I could not help but think that marketing would have helped launch this not-so-popular movie into the mainstream of intelligent comedy. The quality of the dialogue and the ease with which actors perform a tremendous range of strangeness, heartache, and comedy are so rare these days - I felt that the actors must have really enjoyed participating in something so rich. How the National Treasury was number one at the box office for three weeks in a row - is so weak in many ways to mention. I think I'm happy that movies like "Seeing ..." are still being made somewhere out there.
