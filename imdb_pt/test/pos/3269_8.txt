The inspiration for this movie was the fact that American Gangsters are well dressed but the Australians, well, when you can kill a guy so look at the aggressor, then you can dress as much as you want and people will not criticize you Jimmy is a fighter, an illegal boxer, sometimes security and is offered by Pando, the local gangster boss on the cross (ie the notorious Kings Cross District of Australia, not the fame of the Cross of London as many British backpackers discover the way more difficult. <br /> <br /> Due to feelings of love, he gets a job, loses a lot of money and has to take him to Pando before Pando and his heavyweights can kill him. A lot of black humor, interesting action, revelations about the underside of Australia and human nature. <br /> <br /> It is very much centered on Australian nature and explores the nature of Australian (versus American and British) criminals. <br /> <br /> A problem the fact is that each of the elements of the story does not have enough substance and depth, but it is a broad-stroked painting that covers a lot of uncovered area previously, just as a global package is worth. <br /> <br /> Team up with "Chopper" and "Dirty Deeds" for their Australian criminal fest or "Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Miller's Crossing" for an international that is falling short of the gang festival criminals. <br /> <br /> By the way, Bryan Brown is a great actor who has just made a large number of really bad movies. Here is one of his great films.
