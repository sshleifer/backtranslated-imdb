I like the good things in life as much as anyone, I suppose, but until about five years ago, opera was not part of my entertainment choices. Oh, I made a few attempts to learn what all the fuss was about; I watched several television productions - notably parts of Wagner's Ring Cycle on public television - hoping to understand the fascination of other people with the art form. And I knew that I could enjoy parts of several operas (I remember being surprised as a child, I LIKED from the passages of "Madame Butterfly" in "My Geisha" and enjoyed the opera scenes in "Moonstruck" and "Pretty Woman" ), but unlike the characters in those films, I just did not "get it." <br /> <br /> So, in 1995, I saw a live performance of "Rigoletto" presented by the New York City Opera Company, and that night I understood. "What a wonderful and glorious parade of colors and music and raw emotions!" And I mean Emotion with a capital letter E! The key, I think, is that opera music allows artists to freely exaggerate and convincingly a way that would seem silly if his words were just said. Everything depends on the music, of course, and when the music is magical, as in "Rigoletto", an opera can be a magnificent entertainment. of the family gave me a laserdisc copy of the 1982 opera production, and I discovered that since I can not see the performance live The Rigoletto performances live on a regular basis, this video version is a good substitute. Luciano Pavarotti is perfect in the Duke's side, Ingvar Wixell is excellent as his court jester Rigoletto, and the beloved daughter of Rigoletto, Gilda, is interpreted by Edital Gruberova, somewhat simple. leases on the river at f the film brings a sense of drama to the story that could never be combined on a stage. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen "Rigoletto", or if you think you do not like or do not understand opera, I urge you to find one on videotape and buy it or rent it. If you do not like it, if this production of "Rigoletto" does not make you appreciate the power of the opera's art form, just give up and move on to something else. But I suspect, if you're new to opera like I was, you'll be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Bill Anderson
