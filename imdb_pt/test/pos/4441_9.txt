Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a father and, by the process, their own lives are not so unusual. Also not uncommon are the results that reflect the lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism, and perhaps a subtle pursuit of public revenge for innumerable real, fanciful past hurts. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and captivating portrait of a fascinating father and "My Architect: The Journey of a Son" is this rare achievement. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally marked by an accident. He and his parents settled in Philadelphia, where the talented young man loved art and music. Soon he fell in love with buildings and decided that only an architect's career would respond to his creative abilities. Kahn has become an architect, but as this movie shows it took a lot to attract the attention of the leaders in his career. field. An architect suggests that he was a victim of the "yellow armband," that anti-Semitism which, along with prejudice against women, had long been a disreputable aspect in the American architectural profession. <br /> <br /> When he realized, he was seen, with clear precision, as a prophet addicted to self-assured work, exclaiming inflexible demands that his vision and only his vision be realized. This inflexibility was the reason that while he drew wonderful plans for many buildings, he built only a few. The interview with an elderly man who fired Kahn in Philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed urban center where people left their cars on the perimeter and entered the city is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Kahn was a born teacher. and some of the extensive archive footage here shows him with the students, his firm but passionate voice, his respectful and intense eyes. <br /> <br /> Many architects were interviewed by the director, writer and designer Nathaniel Kahn, the architect's only architect. son. Some are world famous - I. Pei, Robert A.M. Stone, Moshe Safdie, Frank Gehry and the still active nonagenarian, Philip Johnson. His comments paint a vivid picture of this idealistic, but ultimately financially unsuccessful, stylist of buildings that blended the castles, forts, and great buildings of past centuries into designs for the present. The Kahn buildings are shown, the most impressive being the Salk Research Labs in La Jolla, CA. To me, his style has a neo-romantic air cushioned by a lot of whitespace that repels rather than attracts human interaction. <br /> <br /> But Kahn's son was after more than the story of his father, the architect. For many years, Louis Kahn had three families: a wife with whom he had a daughter and two long-term relationships, one of whom produced one daughter, the other his son. Kahn often visited his son at his mother's house, but at the end of one night his mother and son took Kahn back to the marital home. Nathaniel clearly wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships, but he did not seem to be marked by what was certainly a strange affair for a little boy. When Nathaniel was a boy, Louis Kahn died of a massive heart attack in the men's room at Penn Station in New York after returning from India, where he had set up one of his huge projects, another which was never built. At that time, his company in Philadelphia had at least $ 500,000 in debt and if he had experienced a trip to the federal bankruptcy court was probably about to take place. <br /> <br /> Kahn has left several monumental structures of which the government building in Bangladesh is clearly the largest. A tearful local architect greets Kahn for creating a building where democracy can (and hopefully will) flourish. <br /> <br /> The architect Moshe Safdie opines that there might have been something appropriate in Kahn's suffering in a deadly heart attack at a train station given his ceaseless globetrotting. I disagree: It is sadly ironic that Kahn dies in the faceless substitution of one of the real architectural jewels of the United States, the old Pennsylvania Station, destroyed to give way to a sterile substitute without character and without continuation of civic memory. There are a number of emotional moments filmed during the journey of young Kahn, including his half-sisters and his mother, but they are genuine and moving, non-sentimental and enacted. Historians of architecture will always study Kahn. His son found reasons to remember him as a flawed, but very iconoclastic and, ultimately, private man. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
