On one level, Hari Om is a movie that uses a familiar genre - the road movie - to tell a familiar story: curious Westerners explore the mysterious East. But in the background, the film is about two people, a young French beauty (Isa) committed to living life to the fullest and a driver of motorized rickshaw (Hari Om) with aspirations of Bollywood, of very different cultures, their attraction more and more for each one. another, and the beautiful crazy chaos that is India today. The distance between them can never be overcome, but the director manages to bring the two of them as close to a case as possible, without undermining the plausibility of the story. India and its people are essential ingredients of the narrative and, with the exception of the main characters, the roles are beautifully and persuasively interpreted by the villagers recruited during the production of the film, while on the road between the indigenous towns and villages that form the scene of the movie. An important negative point for this viewer: a Keystone Kops chase near the conclusion of the movie as Hari runs away from mafiosos engaged in collecting a gambling debt. But the final scenes in which Isa and Hari say goodbye are poignant and unforgettable.
