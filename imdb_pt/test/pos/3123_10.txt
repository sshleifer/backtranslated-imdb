I do not think I really have spoilers here, but since I describe some funny scenes, I'm going to check the box saying 'it may contain spoilers' just to be on the safe side. Now ... <br /> <br /> I hardly know where to start. Now you know the basic outline of the story - horse traffickers Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) take the trouble to guide a Mormon train west to the "promised land" and along the way find a variety of essays and interesting characters, most notably the outlaw family Clegg. <br /> <br /> Anyone can enjoy this movie. You do not have to be a fan of Westerns to like this one. On the one hand, Johnson and Carey are two of the fastest friendly characters you'll see in any movie. Carey, in particular, is lively and outgoing, almost like a big kid - while Johnson is a bit more calm and wise, like an older brother figure. I get a kick out of the scene where they sell one of their "gentle horses" to the sheriff for $ 10; then inform him that the horse has "some peculiarities - you can say flaws" ... Travis jostles Sandy, who releases with a shrill whistle, sending the sheriff's new horse in a wild fit against him in the saddle. The look on his face when the horse finally knocks him down and runs away is invaluable. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the music ... even if you never thought you'd be a fan of the Sons of the Pioneers. , listen to "Shadows in the Dust" while the wagon is shown in motion with some of the people walking between the wagons. It's a really beautiful song - too bad, only half a minute or more of that is in the movie. I want to hear the whole thing at some point. <br /> <br /> One thing that impressed me a lot about this movie is that much of it must have been almost as difficult to do as the actual situation it portrays. Teams of six horses pulling wagons up steep mountain trails, struggling to get to the top - this was not a simple, easy movie. It must have been risky for the actors, the stuntmen and the animals as well. Also surrounding rivers, this film has lots of authentic-looking action involving the movement of the train of wagons. It should be mentioned that both Harry Carey Jr. and Ben Johnson were extremely competent pilots, both with many years of experience riding, tying and doing all kinds of cowboy-like things. Carey grew up on a farm where her family employed many Navaho Indians and, in fact, he learned to speak Navaho before learning to speak English. There are no rhino cowboys in this movie - "Travis" and "Sandy" were the real thing from side to side. Pay attention to the scene when Miss Denver throws the pot of water out of her wagon, hitting Travis's horse in the face ... the horse begins to jump, eventually throwing it away. Watch the look on Sandy's face when Denver tells Travis, "I'm sorry you fell off your horse." Another of my favorite scenes is when Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy) comes in contact with one of the Mormons. They are working back to back getting their gear ready, and after Sandy gets disgusted with the other mate, the two enter a back fight that quickly turns into a fist fight rolling around the ground. Even after the Ward Bond puts them on their feet and separates them, the two fighters keep trying to get into each other. Mormon (nicknamed 'Jackson' in the movie) gets one last shot at Sandy so high it hits his shoulder. It's a very funny scene from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I do not know what else I can say about this movie, other than that it has a good story, very engaging characters, beautiful landscapes and lots of balanced action with humor and a bit of drama. Oh, it was colorful, at least in the version I saw; It's not the most beautiful color film you've ever seen, but I think I prefer black and white. I give this one a ten and I do not give many 10's. One of my favorite movies, no doubt. And judging by the other comments, I have plenty of company in that assessment.
