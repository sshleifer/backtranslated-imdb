This little John Ford western without "stars", but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary feel as it traces the journey west of a feast of Mormons and may be the most authentic appearance of all Ford films, (it's on par with "The Sun Shines Bright" which he did a couple of years ago. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of plot (a group of bank robbers joins the car at one point), but the dramatic highlights of the film are almost incidental. (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr., Ward Bond, Jane Darwell, etc.), greatly increase the authenticity of the film, while the closest movie to a full-body performance is Joanne Dru's Denver. she was never credited as Bond and Johnson, who at least was finally awarded an Oscar for her work on "The Last Picture Show." As he himself put it, "it could not have happened to a nicer guy." the excellent location photography of Be rt Glennon and you will have a genuine Americana piece that could not have anyone other than Ford. This is a movie that truly honors the pioneers of America and is full of feelings and feelings.
