25 sitcoms had big-screen spin-offs. Most of them came in the 1970s. Here is a list of all: you are being served, Blackadder, bless this house, bottom, Army parents, father dear father, for the love of Ada, George and Mildred, the League of gentlemen, love your neighbor, lovers, man on the house, closer and dearest, never mind the quality Feel the width, on the buses (3), please sir, porridge, rising humidity, Steptoe and son (2), which is his funeral, until death in part (2), Up Pomeii (3), Whack-o, whatever happened to the probable boys and ops apocalypse. So there was a spin-screen of my all-time favorite series Dads Army. What the film focused on was when the men were enrolled. He showed the difficulties of getting a uniform and getting weapons. It was a great summary of the first series of the Army of the Parents. At the end of the film they catch some German spies in the church. The house keeper came dressed as alter servers and had bayonets with them and defeated the Germans. The best part in the film was when they were showing a lecture in HG and a lecture in German at the same time: German: Headquarters on the phone, you would get 10,000 bombs, (CUT TO GUARD) GODFREY: Ms. Mainwaring on the phone, you would earn 1 / 2lb of Brussel Sprouts. <br /> <br /> This was probably the second best spin-off of the show, hit only by Till Death and Part (1969). It would have been better if, at the beginning of the film, it had already been formed, it was in the middle of the war. Although it's still a great movie, good for the family.
