Being 15 I thoroughly enjoyed this movie !! I related to the character Ann August more than most would. My mother is not as eccentric as Adele, but the feelings of loneliness are the same. This film is perfect for the air aspects, and the performances of Natalie and Susan are so connected that it's the best on-screen duo I've seen in years. Your chemistry brings the characters to life, they become real people! I would recommend this movie to anyone who is wanting to get away. Because there are usually many people out there who would like to be "anywhere but here", including me! and if you can, watch this movie with your best friend or your mother. It's the tears that mix everyone around you more !!
