He finally beat me up watching my Christmas VHS in Connecticut that another movie reminded me of this. If it were not for the fact that the other was done 20 years later, I would say it was a remake. <br /> <br /> Just as Rock Hudson was a fake fishing specialist from Abercrombie & Fitch, who had to get some. In training work at a fishing tournament, Barbara Stanwyck plays a version of Martha Stewart's 40. Stanwyck is a kitchen columnist who built this whole picture of living on a small farm in Connecticut with husband and baby cooking all those wonderful delicacies. The problem is that she is single, childless, writes her column in her apartment in New York and does not know how to boil the water. But her writing is a hit with the public. The problem comes when she is abducted to cook a Christmas dinner at home for a war hero sailor played by Dennis Morgan, who also sings some songs. I have to keep the image at any cost. And his publisher, Sidney Greenstreet, likes the idea so well that he invites himself to dinner. <br /> <br /> So with the loaned farm, the baby, and Reginald Gardiner, who would like to make it come true with Stanwyck, she tries to be blatant. through. <br /> <br /> Christmas in Connecticut is now a Yuletide classic and deservedly so. The leaders are warm and humane and get great support from the assembled players. S.Z. Sakall as the Hungarian restaurant owner and friend of Stanwyck, from whom she receives her cooking information, and Una O'Connor, as the maid, have a good chemistry between them. Reginald Gardiner and Stanwyck have no chemistry whatsoever, obvious to everyone except Reggie and he's funny in his plush shirt style. <br /> <br /> Most people remember this movie as one of the few Sidney Greenstreet adventures in the comedy. If he is not a villain, a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon, Greenstreet is a few other things on the screen. Christmas in Connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to burlesque his own image and he made the most of it. <br /> <br /> In a biography of Barbara Stanwyck, she mentions that she enjoyed doing Christmas in Connecticut as a welcome change from some villainous pieces like Double Indemnity she had been doing recently. One of the things that made the film so enjoyable was that, between the shots, director Peter Godfrey and Greenstreet would do some improvised casting and team-mates with English Music Hall numbers. Made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast responded accordingly. <br /> <br /> Now if only someone were filming these numbers.
