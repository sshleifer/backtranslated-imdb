I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this difficult to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's good renaissance on DVD. Of course, it did not have the same impact on me as I would have if I had seen it in the 80s, but director Lieberman (his "Squirm" movie is excellent) makes good use of the beautiful location in Oregon and takes time to develop the characters, not just to dispatch them in creative ways. On a high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really scary and adds to the bleak process, which makes this great fun for fans of the genre. A must see if you like horror movies underestimated. Describing it would be a smart "Friday the 13th", sprinkled with some tasty pieces of "Deliverance". With that aside, there are some really cool and original moments like my favorite when a couple is swimming in a pond and the guy disappears underwater to play a trick on his girl - when you think it's the usual fright, she suddenly looks at the beach and ... I honestly can not ruin everything - you just have to watch it for yourself. Also, is the end just one of those you just have to see to believe it? came out of nowhere and it's weird and wild! The DVD includes comments from Lieberman.
