This multi-leveled thriller kept my attention everywhere. It is disturbing and informative to see how wicked human behavior can be. It is also instructive on what past wounds may motivate current behavior. No one, except Sandra Bullock's partner, is very nice. However, all are believable. Sandra did a great job. Your character, Cassie, comes alive with all your pain, fear and defense. She is a survivor and thus her life experience finally leads her to a healing moment. I really liked this movie. Tom Landers
