I was hoping this movie was stinky, but I wanted to see for myself, but I was surprised by the quality of the movie. I know that longer movies often do not fare well at the box office, but why this was pulled and can not be seen by the audience is beyond me. He kept my interest in the whole scene and the photography is breathtaking at times. The plot was good and the game of morality was good. I liked the realism that went along the lines of "Unforgiven". I had to rent this movie to see, but it was definitely worth it.
