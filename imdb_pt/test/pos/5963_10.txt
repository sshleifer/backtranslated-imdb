Wladyslaw Starewicz was a Russian-born entertainer who lived in France and did amazing things using stop-motion. I've seen some of these movies before and they present their favorite subjects - insects, frogs and various animals. They are extremely realistic and realistic and to this day are amazing to see - the quality is simply fantastic. <br /> <br /> This star has many and many frogs. They appeal to their god, Jupiter, to give them a king. Why do they need a king, imagine Jupiter - their lives are perfectly fine now. Then to teach them an unpleasant lesson, he makes a king's heron and, one by one, begins to eat his subjects! Then the frogs once again appeal to Jupiter, who states the obvious morality that it is better to be happy with what you have! <br /> <br /> While the quality of the animation is incredible, this is a very scary movie for kids. I think this would terrify them both by the real appearance of the animals and by the story itself, which is not for the faint of heart!
