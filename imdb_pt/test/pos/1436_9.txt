STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning Once heroin addict Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) walks out of prison to his clumsy partner as the jailer Sparrow (Arnold Stang), crippled devoid of a wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker) and a bit next to Molly (Kim Novak.) He is trying to become a great drummer in a band but until his big break comes along he's stuck doing the only other thing he was good at than being a junkie in high risk games. And no matter how hard he tried, even the prison did not heal him from his addiction to the devil's drugs, making him lie and deceive everyone around him, leading him to desperate measures to feed his habit. Your yearning to leave is your only motivation for a happy ending. <br /> <br /> When people think of Frank Sinatra, they usually think of classic songs like Under My Skin, New York and It Had to Be You. But for anyone to forget that he was also a renowned actor, and if his performance in the acclaimed From Here to Eternity was not enough, he will also be remembered for this cutting-edge drama, dealing with what was then ultra-taboo subject. of drug abuse. <br /> <br /> The film is often listed as one of the first to feature graphic heroin use (probably the reason behind the 15 certificate) at a time when it was a subject that was still much pushed underground. In his portrait of the main protagonist, Sinatra is well, perfectly conveying the desperation, despair and sincerity of a man losing every second chance being given to him. His cold turkey scene is much more intense than Ewan McGregor's in Trainspotting. The first co-star to make a good impression is Parker as the crippled and demanding cripple of a woman, using her husband's guilt and sense of duty to the fullest effect she can. Novak as his secret lover still gets some strong moments but is less of a star than Parker. Stang does his usual comical relief, like the clumsy sidekick who accompanies the protagonist with his strong New York accent. Director Otto Preminger allows the rhythm to creep a bit at times, but it is still a powerfully absorbing film all the way, with many unexpected twists and which should be admired for being one of the first films to bring such a dark subject to the film. life. ****
