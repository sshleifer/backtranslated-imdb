Slasher movies started may be 30 to 35 years before this movie, but believe me this among those pearl that will stay longer after you turned the TV set. Especially if you are an easily frightened person this is the movie for you for which you would not have stomach to take it complete. Even after so many years, the film has not lost its charm and emotion. <br /> <br /> No blood without blood, but the emotion is sure to cool the spine. the movie begins with the crash and stays with the same pace until the end. BGM is nerve cracking and I remember that this was the only one copied in many Indian movies these days. Favorite kings? No wonder why ... that's the only reason I wanted to see this and it did not disappoint me. "Do not turn out the lights" ... because you will not find Enrique, but it may be a smiling doll sitting right behind you! caution. not for the hearted lite ... <br /> <br /> Two beats up and I'm going with 8 out of 10 which is very low but still I preserve my ratings for Dramas ...
