People watch movies for several different reasons. This movie does not have the big budget, there are no special effects, there are no car chases and there are no blasts. Actually, reality does not have much of that either. At least not in my life. <br /> <br /> This is a very real movie about very real people, none of them perfect anyway, but together they are put in a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that, for their Instead, make the order out of chaos. I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology, since I am neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie for the characters. It is full of a whole cast of wonderful and peculiar people. In the first three minutes, Kiefer Sutherland plays the life of Detective Michael Hayden superbly and he continues to develop the character throughout the film. Excellent acting, very believable. <br /> <br /> Henry Czerny could not have been better chosen and the relationship between his 'Harvey' and Kiefer's 'Mickey' enhances the opposition of his characters. <br /> <br /> I really liked the cranky owner. , 'Mrs Ramsay', I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends !!! <br /> <br /> There are a number of more of these wonderful characters, but space is limited here, so watch the movie and enjoy them.
