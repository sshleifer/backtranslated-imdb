I play this game exactly after I see the trailer in the old magazine advertise CD ... <br /> <br /> The weather is very interesting and dark (missing in the current games / movies). The game takes place somewhere in the mid 90's, in the mysterious and mysterious mansion. You play as Adam Randell and your mission is to free the soul of your father stuck to death. <br /> <br /> The look of the game is similar to doom, but the type of game is very different. Lots of action, lots of puzzles, missions, mazes and many other interesting places and characters are featured in this classic old game. <br /> <br /> The game will run only on Windows 98 and there is no patch for Windows. XP.
