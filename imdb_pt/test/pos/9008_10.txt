This helps that the characters that this show is based on are among the best that Disney has ever created. Writing is what really makes this show. It's a total classic. Given, you need to enjoy the kind of humor to have fun with, and this is hard to explain. The humor is similar to the old school scenes of the 40s and 50s of Disney, with modern twists. Never degrade yourself in fart jokes or anything like that. Nor is it Adam Sandler's mood, though he did like it. It's exactly the same humor as the movie, expanded only by the amount of time a TV show allows. So, if you did not like the movie, you will not like it here, but IMO The Emperors New Groove was the best thing that came out of Disney since Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> A +
