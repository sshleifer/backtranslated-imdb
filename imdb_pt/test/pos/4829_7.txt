'Wicked Little Things' really separates from other zombie movies. First, all the zombies in the movie do not exactly start biting you and rip your flesh with your own hands. They kill you with a pickaxe or a shovel. and eat you after wards. Second, they can not die. In most zombie movies, you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them, but these simply will not die. Third, that's the biggest reason by which this movie separates itself, all zombies are children. How did they die just to become zombies? They were working in a coal mine when all of a sudden they were all killed in a collapse. Now they wander through the forest carrying their picks and shovels, waiting for someone to come so they can kill and eat them. Oh, they also go out at night. It's just at night. This makes the movie even more fun than it would be if they left in the morning. Despite all the violent and bloody turmoil in this movie, 'Wicked Little Things' is a great choose if you are looking for a movie about zombie children. Do not expect anything good like 'Dawn of the Dead' or 'Land of the Dead', but expect so much blood and violence that makes this movie a true zombie fan. give Rob Zombie Scout Taylor-Compton a great hand for doing a great performance like the one she did on Halloween. She really needs to start starring in more horror movies.
