This is Lucius Fulci at his best. If all the movies he did afterwards were like this. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary film is as intriguing as Dario Argento's "The bird with crystal plumage" ... <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Argento but you do not like movies of Lucius Fulci such as "The Beyond", "Manhattan Baby", "The House of the Cemetery", etc. this has nothing to do with others ... this is what the Italians call it "giallo" ... which would be something like a "who-made-it" movie in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> You will not know who the killer is until the last moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> But other than that, there's the plot: a maniac who lives in a small village begins to kill boys ... A journalist (Tomas Milian), a sexy young woman (Barbara Bouchet), a priest (Marc Porel), his mother (Irene Papas) and a witch (Florinda Bolkan) are the main characters in this tangled and bloody story. <br /> <br /> Talking about the actors, I mean that Tomas Milian is superb (as always), and Florinda Bolkan is great. She's the village witch ... Do you want to know who the killer is? <br /> <br /> I can not tell you ... but I can tell you that you need to see this movie! <br /> <br /> (10 of 10) ... of course!
