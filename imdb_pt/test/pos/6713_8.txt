Tobe Hooper (fresh out of the mainstream with 'Poltergeist') seeks the skies this time around. 'Lifeforce' is an adaptation of 'The Space Vampires' by Colin Wilson. The screenplay for 'Dan O' Bannon by Alien and Don Jakoby) varies a bit I was told: the futuristic plot was made contemporary and Hailey's comet was added to coincide with its actual passage through Earth a few weeks after the release of movies. The story concerns a spaceship mission (commander by Steve Railsback) sent to investigate Hailey's Comet as it passes through Earth. It all goes away smoothly, but upon arriving at the comet, an alien ship is found hidden in the comet's coma. The team investigates the massive structure and discovers dried creatures similar to bats. Looking deeper into the nave, there is a chamber containing three humanoids (two naked males and a pretty nude lady as well) in strange stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature. Shortly thereafter, the ship returns to Earth, but no contact can be made by NASA and another space shuttle is launched to determine the ship's status. the mission. Upon entering Churchill, it was discovered that a massive fire apparently killed the crew and all data relating to the flight. But the three humanoids remain. However, it is known that an escape pod has been thrown, but whose whereabouts are unknown. <br /> <br /> Soon they make the discovery of the origin of the alien when the attractive space vampire queen arises of its sleep to easily seduce the vital force. of the men around him. If you suck her face, she makes you like them and if you do not feed yourself after two hours, you will dry out and become dust. The purpose of the three is to drain enough of the essence of the population to power and support them and your ship to travel to the next planet so that they too will be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately the Commander survived. entry into the pod (crash lands in Texas no less) and now has a psychic bond to her real, the queen's flair and is able to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed dry London from their souls <br /> <br /> Tobe Hooper (of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)) does an admirable job in what has to be his greatest production to date. The production brought together many excellent technicians from across the film industry. Production designer John Graysmark (Newborn The Bounty (1984)) uses every four-stage bit at Elsree Studios to create the ship's spacious interiors and such. Director of photography Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a period in 'Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi' (1983) and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with great effects. Oscar winner John Dykstra, innovator of the groundbreaking effects of the original 'Star Wars' (1977) manages to push the envelope one more time, creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. Even maestro Henry Mancini appears to give the film a memorable title theme that gives this science fiction / horror hybrid a touch of adventure. In the acting department, practically falls on the shoulders of Steve Railsback and newly arrived Mathilda May (vampire queen). Railsback always brings an edge to the characters he plays and can play crazy like no one else. This comes into your hand as your mind deteriorates as the queen's grip tightens her soul. Beautiful French actress May does not have a lot of lines (were there more than ten?), But her often bare presence never gets old and you have to give her compliments to have the jingle bells to pull you out of. Virtually every queen is there to feed herself and for this she needs to seduce him with her sexual presence. Work done and where do I sign up to be a victim? I really liked how they altered the old vampire cliches and still managed to make it look new, but still easily recognizable. Almost everything is explained here: bats (their true form resembles a large bat), coffins (stasis fields resemble these), transformations (they scan their mind and can be anything), massive sexual appeal Duh) not to mention that they even include the old wait for support through the heart (this time a handful of a lead dagger to the energy center slightly below the heart). The only thing they did not touch was religion, but I think the vampires who use the cathedral at the bottom as a base can be just a wink and a nod. <br /> <br /> In short (yeah 800 words later) Lifeforce is an excellent combination of science fiction and horror that honors the theme of vampires while adding a few different wrinkles. The effects and scale of production are sufficient to keep the types of summer films involved (at least at the time) and the horror and science fiction fans involved. 4 out of 5
