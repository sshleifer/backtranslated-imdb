Upstairs, I love this movie. I love everything about it. It has a great soundtrack, has many recognizable faces and is funny as hell. There are so many tangles in this movie and each one of them is funny in one way or another. <br /> <br /> While Spicolli was lighting the screen two years ago, Drake is almost as memorable as a character. All he wants to do is have fun. He leaves home without the consent of his parents, he skips work whenever he feels like it, is obsessed with sex, loves drugs and alcohol, and tries to be a good friend. It is his indifferent attitude that makes it a joy to watch. And it comes out with some big lines. And there are so many tiny observations you do not see coming, but they make you laugh with the speed when you hit it. One particular moment is when Tommy and Bill are talking about Bill's ex-girlfriend dating someone now. At the end of the conversation, Tommy picks up his big bottle of beer and throws it casually over his shoulder. He then says goodnight and the scene ends. It's a perfect scene. Tommy's world is his own. He really lives to have fun and have fun. When the conversation is over, his time is up and he does not care who he offends in the process. He has an innocence about him. "It's casual" is your favorite saying. <br /> <br /> Another classic scene is Reggie giving a donut to Bill. He says something to him that my friends and I will never forget because we rewind the movie ten times and watch that part over and over and hurt ourselves laughing. It has to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Wild Life is a throw back to when teenage comedies were funny, cheeky, had a good ear, entertained us and just wanted us to lose ourselves in their world 90 minutes. Wildlife does all these things perfectly. If this is a movie you did not see, give it a try. It's a classic. <br /> <br /> Also check out the guy from the army store with whom Jim has problems. He is a very familiar face now and it is his first role on the big screen.
