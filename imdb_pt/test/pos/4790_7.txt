Nazarin by the acclaimed surrealistic Bunuel is obviously an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of values. It's not a visual movie and I think it would have played better on stage. Bunuel takes us through this man, the Nazarene who lives as Christ lived; a true follower, that is, in poverty, and without a care with the property and with what the next day brings. Some may call this a parallel to the history of Christ, but any follower and practitioner of the word, life must be like Christ in a certain way. But in essence, Bunuel also investigates man's greed for selfishness and the need to sin and how goodness can save us all. It's a bold statement to make this animate or recite in memory the movie for some. Truth be told, the Nazarene is also selfish because he gives without wanting in return or asking for it. His selfishness is his madness and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin, with the same face on either side. Many people represent sides of a coin in this movie, all with the two sides alike. But the film is not exactly memorable when it ends and one can attack many of its ethical piercings and effusions within the film's own doctrine. Bunuel, but not first-rate, but a "surreal" dream sequence Bunuel stages where the film's message is framed and worth noting shows the director's ability, Bunuel.
