Yes, I think this movie is a bit boring compared to other Pam Grier films. The plot is overly familiar, the dialogue is flushed and part of the acting is not very good. But it's worth seeing the long stretch near the end of the movie, where we see Mrs. Grier in a blue and sexy wetsuit, with the zipper half open. Yes, it seems a frivolous point when talking about an actress of Pam Grier's talent, but she is also an extremely beautiful woman, and in the past she had a body that would not stop. It is good to see this being displayed in a tight underwear. Rent the DVD and then tell me I'm wrong. You can not, can you? That's because you know I'm right! :-) And yes, I actually gave 10 just for the wetsuit scenes! ;-)
