Once you have seen enough movies, there is very little that you do not remember other movies. However, this was a watchable film, albeit a bit disturbing. I had to turn it off once in a while and get back to it later. Like "Silence of the Lambs," he presents the quest for a serial killer who kidnapped someone and confined him to his chamber of horrors. As "Flatliners", the main character explores a dream world through an experimental procedure. The surrealism of the dream sequences is what makes this film, how you find the characters in a situation and landscape in which literally anything can happen. And beyond this continuity and "making sense" are not necessary, which makes it the dream of a filmmaker as well. <br /> <br /> The only thing that seems a little off is the fact that, in the end, the person expects redemption from the serial killer or the exorcism of their demons. You really feel sympathy for the boy within the man, but clearly the boy's innocence can not be separated from the horrible acts of man. The focus turns how man must be saved to save his victim.
