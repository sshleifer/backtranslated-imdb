This is one of those movies that are very underrated. Again I'm voting on an underrated movie. This movie has a good story, maybe a bit forced, but it can happen. Sean Astin (one of my favorite actors) again shows us a good performance. The guy does a great job in acting, but he is never recognized for his roles. He has done well since the Goonies. Not only him, but Louis Gosset JR. does a swell job. I thought maybe this movie would have made more money in theaters, but who cares about the money anyway. All around that is a good movie that you will have on the edge of your seat sometimes and the plot will keep the movie moving itself. I liked this movie and I hope the rest of you will too.
