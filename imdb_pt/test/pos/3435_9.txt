"Skenbart" is one of the funniest films not only by Peter Dalle, but also by the Swedish film industry itself. It's a black-and-white movie to get something out of the atmosphere of the days before Christmas in December 1945, which does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, without stopping for Berlin. On the train there is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failed literature critic 'Gunnar' represented in Sweden, the famous actor Gustav Hammarsten. The lead role 'Gunnar' is the kind of person who, although his intentions are the best, seems to drag everyone around him in an extremely amusing way, to disaster and to hell, especially to from the Finnish war, return the house, wounded soldier played by the extremely funny comedian Robert Gustafsson. In the train is also a doctor, who betrays his wife with his lover. They planned together to murder the wife of the doctors who is also traveling with the same train without any knowledge about the intentions of their husbands. Will the doctor's wife sidestep the plans to murder her, and will everyone survive the unfortunate fellow "Gunnar"?
