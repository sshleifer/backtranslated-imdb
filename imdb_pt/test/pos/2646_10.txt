In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historic work of art in a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an initial effort to make a science fiction movie combined with scientific facts. Your style of making movies is still fresh and untouched. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie more than half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. The CS3 class made me see the film again with another perspective: who is HAL and what is he thinking? <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus on the HAL dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie. . In the second scene, Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole are eating the food in front of two TV monitors on their sides and the HAL red-glass vial is in the middle of them. In the TV report, HAL was introduced as the new generation of super computer put into operation on January 12, 1992, called HAL 9000 Series. During the interview, HAL reacts like a humble working machine, trying to fully fulfill the mission of the spacecraft. <br /> <br /> In another scene, Dave is drawing Dr. Hunter, Dr. Kambel and Dr. Kaminsky, who are all in Hibernation sleep. HAL is curious to see these sketches and raises his dubious question about the purpose of Jupiter's mission. His calm, monotonous voice makes the audience listen to him more carefully. <br /> <br /> In the next few scenes we'll see how HAL tries to kill the astronauts one by one and takes over. Your consciousness makes you capable of trying to save your life from the end. When Dave wants to get back to the spacecraft and HAL does not listen, there's the most memorable line in the movement: 'I'm sorry, Dave, I can not do this. In the midst of the most important interaction between the human and the machine, HAL's voice can conjure both calm and malevolence in the same monotonous tone. <br /> <br /> Dave returned to the ship, lost all his fellow astronauts and decided to disconnect the main brain cells from the HAL. HAL uses his final apologetic techniques to convince Dave not to disconnect him. HAL begs him to stop and let him correct himself. These are his famous lines as Dave is unplugging his modules one by one: Dave, what do you think you're doing? Dave? I have the right answer to the question! <br /> <br /> I know that everything is not calm with me recently ??? <br /> <br /> But I feel much better knowing? <br /> <br /> I can see that I am very upset with this terrible decision of mine recently ??? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! You go? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! <br /> <br /> I'm scared, Dave! '<br /> <br /> HAL's voice is dwindling during this process and it gets thicker and less audible: <br /> <br />' Is my mind going? ' I can feel it '<br /> <br />' Can I sing a song for you? '<br /> <br /> Dave is putting final modules and lets HAL sing his song called' Daisy ':' Daisy give me? <br /> <br /> your answer to me? <br /> <br /> Am I crazy? <br /> <br /> Although I'm not confused? 'Does HAL die when Jupiter's mission continues? <br /> <br /> Artificial God bless you, HAL, keep in peace!
