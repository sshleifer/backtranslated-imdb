Get ready to meet your Messiah - they call you Masten Thrust. Male models have become increasingly difficult to find in today's overexposed society. Every two days, an apparent model is forced to apologize in tears for a juvenile indiscretion, or he innocently leaves some young drunks on his ranch. The Last Dinosaur is the story of the last great hunt for Masten Thrust, an old gray-haired hunter who serves as the supreme model. Despite their tired features and bulbous nose, females, including Joan Van Ark, are drawn to it as Meatloaf is for cheese letters. The push is openly sexist and does not apologize for his elaborate lifestyle, which includes a red scarf and a private jet with a fireplace. <br /> <br /> The thrust embarks on a quest to find and hunt the last dinosaur on earth when ironically, after a full and rich life, he is truly the last dinosaur. Despite his propensity to shout at everyone in his presence, his employees and friends are unfailingly loyal to him. He may act as if he is perpetually drunk, but make no mistake, if he calls you 'Ding Dong' you are a 'Ding Dong'. <br /> <br /> You can not deny your own ballad, Thrust's blatant music praises him and his manhood. A sample of the lyrics includes: "Few men ever did, what he did, or even dreamed, what he dreamed / Few men even tried, what he tried, most men failed, where he prevailed." nothing new in store for him, and things that scare you and me, are just a hole for him / Few men ever lived, how he lived, or even walked, where he walked '. Even BMTG banished the artist Clay Aiken Thrust and his lyrics become a kick machine. <br /> <br /> Thrust and his team of scientists tie themselves to the Polar Borer using mini-bike helmets, although Thrust allows himself the luxury of the red scarf around The giant drill full of human digs through the earth and ice to enter a pond The dinosaurs of the air and the earth soon descend on the scientists forcing Thrust and his team to flee for their lives After escaping a dino charging Masten throws and releases a warm laugh, not so much to celebrate li But after admitting, "the game is in progress." <br /> <br /> Soon after, it is not surprising that we see some bent over cavemen lurking at visitors. Impulse, not content with simply killing a dinosaur, then decides to do its mission to bag an ample cave. Throughout the film, the solitary T-Rex contradicts the belief that dinosaurs have a brain the size of a peanut. Despite its sheer size, the local T-Rex is able to approach its victims virtually unnoticed. With the element of surprise, the T-Rex simply crushes a scientist or two and pilots the camp. Every once in a while, the arrogant and arrogant Thrust is seen screaming at someone, shooting at something or flirting with a primitive J-Lo in a masculine way. <br /> <br /> The impulse is like James Tiberius Kirk, not just in his addiction. love, but also when it comes to making complicated weapons using limited natural resources in a short period of time. The thrust and remaining crew members build a highly accurate catapult that hurls a large stone into the cunning T-Rex's skull. Realizing that even he, Masten Thrust, can not overcome this addition to his trophy case, Thrust decides to remain in his prehistoric environment. The shrinking crew then leaves Thrust to live their days with their adorable, though somewhat brave, cave woman and introduce her to her personal collection of STDs. This is just a brief synopsis of a film so complicated and rich in the BMTG tradition that it takes several visions to absorb your message and realize that Masten Thrust is the answer. The press conference, complete with a shouting thrust, grunting reporters and the introduction of the great Bunta, is a classic moment. Also look for a body, resembling a dead Ricky Schroeder lying on some trunks, and the most powerful use of someone being called the "Ding-Dong" in film history.
