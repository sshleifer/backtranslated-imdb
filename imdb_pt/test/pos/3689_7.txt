"Unconditional Love" begins with a great promise. As directed by P. J. Hogan, the film works very well until the last third of the film, when it falls flat on the floor. The screenplay that Hogan and Jocelyn Moorehouse wrote showed a myriad of possibilities that fail in the end. It seems that the artistic team behind the film had high hopes that he played differently. The reality is that this is a movie that is looking in different directions on how to bring it to a resolution that ends up failing. Do not get me wrong, the film is tremendously appealing and will resonate with many of your audience. <br /> <br /> Based on the strong cast, we decided to take a look. The tremendously talented Kathy Bates is the perfect choice to play Grace Beasley, the woman who finds at the beginning of the movie that everything is not all right in her marriage. Bates is an excellent actress who deserves much better, even when her character is not helped by what the authors do in the film. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett is always dependable in delivering. His role as lover of the late Victor Fox is well written, that is, until Dirk is drawn to come to Chicago to find Victor's killer. It is bizarre and defies all the rules of logic. Dirk does not seem capable of hurting a fly, much less hunt a killer with the help of Grace and his daughter-in-law, the incredible and funny Maudey. <br /> <br /> As interpreted by Meredith Eaton, this little woman, Maudey, is one of the best things in the movie. She is impetuous and tells how she sees. Peter Sarsgaard, one of the best actors working in movies these days, has nothing to do in the picture; he is totally lost. Dan Aykroyd also has nothing to do. We see him at the beginning and end of the movie and his Max does not make sense. He seems to want changes in his life and his marriage, only to return to Grace without any explanation, all things forgiven. <br /> <br /> English actors are good. Lynn Redgrave has a better chance than the hysterical Nola. Jonathan Pryce is seen throughout the film as a ghost singing dull songs. Julie Andrews makes a funny contribution to some invaluable scenes. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the television program presented by Sally Jesse Raphael is off and does not add anything to the movie. The best part is listening to Kathy Bates singing. What a beautiful voice she has! In fact, Bates is the best excuse to stay until the end.
