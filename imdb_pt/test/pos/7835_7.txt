Let's clear one thing, this results in 7 of 10 not in normal range, but out of range of bad movies. this is the kind of movie that you rent on purpose, where you enter intentionally knowing that it is a horrible imitation and avoided by all the others. <br /> <br /> I went with a promise of the movie, that there will be snakes on a train, and delivery! <br /> <br /> The blood itself is really good, and the characters have incredible roles. Come on, you have everything from stuffed train drivers to teenage girls dealing drugs, even an electrician engineer getting your pimp! You get to see some topless nudity, bangs, snakes, blood and a main Mexican lane rushing around to cure your girlfriend, hitting the crack pipe and blowing the smoke on your face! As I mentioned and many others, the pace of the film is a bit off, but respectable, however. <br /> <br /> Movies like this keep the tradition of our group coming together and everyone gets a buck or two to watch such masterpieces. There may be better time spent, then joining together to enjoy a good bad movie. <br /> <br /> I could learn one or two things from other bands like Alien Lock-down or Good vs. Python, but those are some great shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> A solid 7 out of 10.
