My family (two in their 40s, an 8 year old and my 71 year old mother) saw this on a preview on April 29th. We all really enjoyed the movie. The story was good, and knowing that it was based on real-life events made it much more enjoyable. Luke Wilson was a hoot (pun intended) to watch, as was Tim Blake Nelson. And seeing Neil Flynn interpret something other than "the naughty Scrubs janitor" was cool. The children in the film did well and I'm sure they will all appeal to a certain demographic group at the heartthrown level. The visuals were simply lovely and the Jimmy Buffet music added to the "Florida feel". Okay, maybe the story was a little tidy and well packaged for some adults, but hey, who cares? I can not compare it to the book, I honestly had not heard of it until the movie came out. <br /> <br /> It was just a NICE movie and it had a good message. Clear and simple.
