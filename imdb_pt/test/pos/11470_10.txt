I thought this movie was good, I loved the plot, I loved the shooting scenes except for a few, they were not needed and I also liked Ma's character, she was a biker I liked that. I have to say that in this gangster film the actors were chosen well because sometimes some actors just do not fit the role. However, although I hate to say this, but I hated the ending, I felt like I had gone in a different direction. It would also have been better with a bit more detail, it's based on a real story, but there were so many facts left out, but other than that was fine. If you like movies about the bad guys of the past, you will like this movie.
