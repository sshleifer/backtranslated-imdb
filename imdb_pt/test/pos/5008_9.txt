This show was a pleasant surprise after watching Mad TV on a Saturday night. Spike is an excellent host you can say that he is still getting used to it but he is adapting very well to his new job. I can imagine that it is a difficult transition from writer (Seinfeld) to host however, unlike a lot of new talk show hostals, he does not let airborne while trying to figure out what to do next. It is fast and every segment and section rolls to each other without problems. It also does not hurt that he's kind of sexy in a nerdy way, so he's not as tough on his eyes as Leno or Letterman. I can not remember the exact date of the episode that was my favorite, but I especially loved the idiot paparazzi skit with a fake J-Lo and Katie Holmes. Great new show !!
