When you think of Soviet cinema, Eisenstein's propaganda masterpieces or Tarkovsky's dark meditations often come to mind. They're great movies, but they're not usually the most fun stuff out there. However, the countries within the Iron Curtain apparently liked their escapist musicals as much as the states had. In fact, from the 1930s to the 1970s, forty of these extravagances of music and dance were cast for great adoration by the public. However, they are completely unknown in the West, so this documentary tries to rectify this situation. It does a great job of showing these films and putting them in the proper cultural context. Despite the fact that I've never been a fan of musicals, I found this documentary completely convincing from beginning to end. This proves that, no matter how many movies you get to see in your entire life, you're just following the surface of what's out there. <br /> <br /> As for movie clips, they are a lot of fun. While some of the musicals are blatant advertising showing workers singing about how much they love to work under the regime, some of the films (particularly the later ones) seem quite accomplished from the point of view of production. Also, they are all extremely exaggerated because of how alien they are to my western eyes. There are some similarities between them and the American musicals with which I am accustomed, but the presence of a strict government imposition on a message gives them a surreal advantage. They certainly do not look like musicals made in the West. This documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining movies I've ever seen in recent memory, and it's a must-see for any movie buff. (9/10)
