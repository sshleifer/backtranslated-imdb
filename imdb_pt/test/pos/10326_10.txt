The whole civilized world now knows that it is here that Emil Sitka says his immortal "Hold your hands, your young pigeons." But Shemp Howard, a music teacher, steals the show. Watch him teach Dee Green as she fractures the "voices of spring". Watch Shemp as he shaves by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a rope. Watch him when he gets hit by Christine McIntyre. Watch it and you will laugh and learn. Moe is not sloppy either. Watch him as he tries to induce a woman to sit in a bear trap. Larry, as always, is the Zen master of reaction. All in all, one of the best Stooge shorts. You will not find a weak moment.
