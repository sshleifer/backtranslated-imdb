I never thought I would say that about a biopic, but there is an abundance of almost excessive characterization (especially in relation to the emotions of Kenji Miyazawa) and very little about the literal occurrences in his life - in the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he should), or if his sister finally dies (she should), or if the director spends a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (this is an internal joke, in case you missed it - Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad). However, this glimpse into the mind of a writer who "sketched poetry and fairy tales from his imagination" is very intelligent, creative, fun and emotionally powerful. <br /> <br /> All this, despite the fact that everyone is animated as animals (as in many of Miyazawa's stories). <br /> <br /> Some of the visuals are truly amazing, especially considering it was made for a TV movie. Seriously, some of them (like the sequence with birds in the blue light) rival parts of Fantasia. However, I still can not stand computer animation when it is mixed with cel animation. CGI trains are terribly obvious - even more so than the Anastasia train. <br /> <br /> 8/10
