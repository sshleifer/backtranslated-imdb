I have not seen this movie for over 20 years, but it has had such a huge impact on me that I remember getting the credits and for several minutes later in total reverence. This is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was originally released. I just asked for a copy on DVD and paid for the overnight shuttle and can not wait for it to arrive. It is uplifting at times, and also very dark and a bit disturbing. It is a story of a group of ordinary kids who grow up in the center of the city and makes us feel like we are actually sitting on the sidelines instead of watching on a movie or television screen. Hard to explain, but it is something that must be experienced. The story begins in childhood and follows the lives of the four main characters during high school and how they embark on their separate journeys in life. The whole cast has done an incredible job and is by far the best work of Jodi Thelen's career. I hope the DVD is up to my memory and plan to watch it this Friday with a good friend.
