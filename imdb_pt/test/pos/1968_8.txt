Small science fiction / fantasy horror thriller about well-known video game designer Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), whose latest game - "eXistenZ" not only catches the eye of people who offer themselves to the game, but also of whom almost the woods (and her game too). Since she forced her out of sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing intern ("nerd PR") to be her bodyguard, although he only has a gun that is made of flesh and bone and bullets are teeth. Director David Cronenberg has also used some excerpts from his previous films ("Videodrome", "Scanners", "The Fly", etc.) and has put them in certain parts of the story for quite some time. Law and Leigh are right here, as are some of the supporting cast (Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccelston, and so on) that have an international twist. Dafoe is anything but demonic like Gas, a deceptive garage mechanic. One of the best scenes in the movie is witnessing Ted eat (fish and frogs) and build a gun and admit Allegra - "I can not control myself". "eXistenZ" manages to show that he (Cronenberg) lives up to his old tricks and still works like a charm.
