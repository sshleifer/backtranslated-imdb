I watched this movie with my mother. She is 81 years old and was raised to be an intolerant. She still recognizes this. I did not think she really understood what was happening, she had already decided that the boy was guilty. Spooky. I felt for this child and his family. What torture did they spend and remained faithful. This is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted with the police force and its ineptitude. I am so happy that this public defender was chosen to work on this case. It was very fortunate for this family that they had a person who cared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him. I could tell when one of the cops was lying. He would not look the defender in the eye. His eyes moved to the side as he answered the questions. It is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of their skin. I read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men. They were finally found guilty after many years. I do not remember the title, but it was the same premise. Whites doing whatever they want with the blacks. I'm sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white. No comment from it. I want to commend the director and producer of this film. I feel that the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project. I am an avid viewer of independent films. I feel they are well written and have substance. I'm glad I got this movie on the shelf. I felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly I feel about the movie and the prejudice that still exists in our modern society.
