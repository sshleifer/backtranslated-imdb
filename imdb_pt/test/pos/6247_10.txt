OK ... I've seen practically everything ... and some are considered classics that should not be (like all those Halloween movies that suck crap or even Steven's trash) ....... and some are considered to be just OK are really great ..... (like the carnival of souls) ........ and then some are simply ignored ............ like (evil ed) or (pumpkin head and brain death "Cort bud a"), then some stick in his head once seen and never leave ........... this is what this did for me .. ...... and for my money this is much better than the last house left ............ last house was great until the end ... so it blew chunks .. ... what kind of mannequin will give a job blow to someone who just killed their kids .. completely stupid .. find the movie "bully" or even "funny games" if you want realism and be crawling out ..........but this damn thing got the for years ......... a chuck motif Connors has always been scary ......... two Tanya Roberts is the best female victim ever ..... ... three the puppy being smothered in plaster still is one of the worst killings of all time in the movie ........ and the 4th thing of the telekinetic powers exploded in my mind and came totally unexpected ... not to mention the fictional wax figures dolls etc ....... must be there with psycho, last house, Texas Chainsaw, etc ....... it's a classic .............. and deservedly so ...........
