I've seen this movie for 12 years and I still remember it as if I had seen it recently. That's how much this movie affected me. Since this is a 1950s film, I think it was ahead of its time. It amazed me how in how to maintain its integrity on this subject that some might have considered taboo at that time. Very realistic in showing the tumultuous and heartwretching journey that an addict chooses to embark. We can only imagine how audiences were affected by the realism of this film in those days. <br /> <br /> I personally think it was one of Frank Sinatra's top five performances at the movies. <br /> <br /> When others are discussing movies that deal with mental illness and / or addiction, I always recommend the man with the gold arm as one of the top five to watch.
