Wow!! What a beautiful, warm and rural movie! The story centers on Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), a young male traveler whose journey takes him to a quiet rural coastal town. There he stays with the Brown family. Velvet (Liz Taylor), her younger daughter, who Mi subtly befriends, has a passion for horses and wins one at an auction. This horse is a beautiful brown stallion; referred to by his former owner as a "murderous pirate," but Velvet calls him "Pie." Shortly thereafter, Velvet suggests that he enter the Grand National race, Mi and his family are against the idea but soon agree and Velvet and Mi have started training him for Britain's most famous horse race? This film is a fine example of how British films are. I remember seeing it for the first time when I was eight and on my summer vacation. My parents taped off the TV and I instantly warmed up? watching most days instead of the large collection of Disney movies I owned. <br /> <br /> I believe it was one of the first Liz Taylor movies and a good movie! Is your character naive but sweet? Her acting is extremely convincing, especially when she portrays her love for horses. It's also a good chance to see Angela Lansbury in one of her earliest roles; who co-stars as Velvet's older sister, who spends most of the time in the movie being injured with a boy in town! I must say she was a beautiful woman when she was younger. Beautiful blonde hair and a pink face with cheeks. Although she does not have a major role in the film, she has a number of scenes - not to disappoint her fans! Parents reading this, should I emphasize ?? if you can get a copy of this, please do it! If you are children, do you love animals? I strongly suggest you show them! They may find some boring scenes, but you see Velvet riding the horse on many occasions throughout the film and it would be more defiantly entertaining the kids! A lovely and nostalgic film. I could leave now and put it on!
