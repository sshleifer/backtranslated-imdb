By 1950, John Ford had fully developed the ideas and motives that would form the nucleus of his most successful Westerns. Always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, captured more intensely in the Joad family of Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath" (1940). Within these communities, even amid Ford's highest themes of racism and pioneering spirit, there is always room for the smaller human interactions, small friendships, and novels that make life worth living. 'Wagon Master (1950)' came after Ford released the first two movies in its "cavalry" trilogy? 'Fort Apache (1948)' and 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)'? and covers a similar territory, only without the military perspective and, most strikingly, the strong leadership of John Wayne. Ben Johnson and Harry Cary Jr. are great actors, but they feel they should be passing a second violin to someone else, and Ward Bond's evil Mormon elder, as a potential contender for that role, does not have enough focus to fit the bill satisfactorily . In "Wagon Master", Ford seems so at home with its Western formula tested and approved that any character development is largely hidden. Ben Johnson's novel with Joanne Dru is treated as a must more than anything else, and the lovely Mormon girl of Harry Cary Jr is so shallow as to be almost non-existent in the final film, which allows us to ponder the survival of scenes deleted. Only in Charles Kemper's charismatic and shamefully vile Uncle Shiloh, Ford tries to do something different, and it works, even with him being surrounded by a troop of underly-trapped hunters. Where does Ford succeed in orchestrating the conglomeration of three distinct American races? the value-oriented Mormoms, the laid-back horse dealers, the eccentric travelers showmen ?? in a cohesive community of pioneers looking to a bright future. This seeming harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of Uncle Shiloh's outlaws, who exploit the illegality of the Western frontier, but end up losing to the noble cowboys who "always relied on snakes." Ford would have considered Wagon Master among the favorites of his films, and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like John Wayne or Henry Fonda. Armed only with its stock selection of regular players, Ford is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding focusing on any character, although most of the Mormom's travelers still remain completely anonymous. Although undoubtedly well done, I can not help but think that this film only does well what other Ford photos did even better: the extraordinary majesty of the Western frontier was presented more beautifully in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon '; the romances and friendly disputes among community members gained more prominence in the 'Fort Apache'; the first relations with the Native Americans, only suggested here, were examined more deeply in 'The Searchers (1956)'; the bold pioneer spirit of the early settlers was explored with more movement (though by Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) in "How the West Was Won (1962)." 'Wagon Master' is pure John Ford, but it's not a landmark.
