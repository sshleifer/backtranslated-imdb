I will divide my comment into 5 following categories, each counting a maximum of 100% (if perfect) Visual Pleasure: [100%] This film is extremely visually pleasing. I had so much fun watching it. Golf scenes are beautifully filmed and the dramatic effects on the green were quite surprising. I also loved seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bag. <br /> <br /> Director's work: [70%] Bill Paxton is more associated with acting, but this movie shows that he has talent. I did a decent job. <br /> <br /> Performance: [90%] Shia LeBeouf was very good in her role as Francis Ouimet (this guy can act well). The rest of the cast was also good. <br /> <br /> Entertainment value: [100%] I enjoyed every minute of it. It was incredibly fun. <br /> <br /> Script: [91%] Based on a true story and therefore makes the film much more special. It was intriguing from the start and I loved every scene to the end. <br /> <br /> My advice: Definitely a must watch for all lovers of sport, especially for golf (you'll all love it). Anyone who is looking for a good entertainment movie and does not hate Sports can watch it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
