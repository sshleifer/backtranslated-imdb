This surprised me. <br /> <br /> I read some comments beforehand that called it a good grade B movie and I was prepared for the worst. In the middle of the road, I suddenly realized that I was completely involved and very fond of it. There were some really tense moments that made him sit forward, fiddling nervously with the remote control or any other object within reach. Overall, this movie definitely does not deserve the B-grade mark. <br /> <br /> Credit should be given to director Gary Ellis and writers, Bill Boatman and Todd King for their movie debut. I hope these guys continue with bigger budgets and some studio support.
