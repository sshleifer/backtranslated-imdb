Hi! Being able to speak Cantonese, I found this very funny and I could hear all the jokes that someone might not understand due to language barriers. The fighting scenes are spectacular and it's a good movie. However, I have my criticisms. First of all, I think it's not as good as the first Project A -GO AND SEE NOW! :-) The reason is, AHEAD SPOILERS DO NOT READ ON IF YOU DID NOT SEE THE MOVIE !!!!!) because in Project A, Jackie ends up fighting his enemy; the man he's sent to kill, Sanpao. That's what he's been struggling to do the whole movie and the showdown is spectacular. But in A II, although he faces Chan, the scene between Jackie and his enemy is not long enough and most of the action is against the Empress's men. They are not so "bad" enough and only played a minor role in the film compared to Jackie, although their fight sequence is spectacular, they are not the ones that Jackie is hunting for throughout the film, so leaving the film. spectator dissatisfied. However, this is just my humble opinion, so do not take word for word-go and see for yourself! It's a great movie by itself! Take care and hope your admiration for Jackie grows! Sincerely, Ian PS. Do you know the police chief in A II? He's the same guy on First Strike - good to know he's still strong!
