I'm 15 years old, usually not kids my age usually watch these old classic movies. But this is one of my favorites. I was totally addicted after watching it for the first time. It's great if you think of technology and movies at the time, the music is great, the story is good, the choreography is great, you have to see it. I do not know why there is a prequel to this movie. Not many people like this movie, but I love classic love movies, they are so much better than movies now! This movie will make you smile, cry and make you start dancing. The music is absolutely attractive and beautiful. I did not see Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights (prequel), the prequel should have starred the original actors, this is what I hate about prequels, they spoil the original. Nobody wants a prequel, they want a sequel. Many people will agree that for a movie, the original, the sequel, and the third are sufficient. Also, people do not bother to watch it. Who remembers the movie about St Benard Beethoven? I think there are 5 movies in total.
