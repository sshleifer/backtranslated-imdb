Midnight of soul is Armande Assante (Simon), who starred in "The Mambo Kings" and Elizabeth Bennett (Alicia Milford). Along with Sexy Vampire Vixen, Lucila Sola (Iris), Simon lures pregnant Alicia and her husband Charles into the underworld of Soul's Midnight. Assante sinks his fangs in the script of writers Brian and Jason Cleveland and you like to see him and Iris kill him. Alicia and Charles (Robert Floyd) try to stay alive while the blood keeps their blood thirst quenched. <br /> <br /> In today's tired landscape, it is no surprise that a stabbed preacher is bitten. . Set looks cool? many details at the Borgo Hotel and interesting special effects at the end. Did I have a lot of fun watching this movie? It does not take itself too seriously and it looks great.
