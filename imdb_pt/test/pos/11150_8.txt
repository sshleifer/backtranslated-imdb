I'm very surprised that this movie only has a rating of 6.4 from the time I did this review. Although it's not exactly a great movie, I think it's one of the best films Dietrich has ever made and it's a pity he's not considered anymore. I think a lot of the reason I liked the film so much is that Dietrich's stupid persona like the "über-vamp" is not there and his role required her to really act. I hate watching film after film after film the first few days of her career where she looked more like a caricature or cliché than a real woman. I do not necessarily blame Dietrich for the silly vampire movies she did in the 1930s - the public loved them and they made her famous. But here, she showed that she really could act. After all, just looking at her in films like MOROCCO, BLONDE VENUS and THE BLUE ANGEL, who would have guessed she was well-engineered to play a gypsy! I was quite prepared to hate the movie because of this selection decision, but it worked - it was believable and very fun to watch too! The film is essentially a vehicle only for Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich - the other supporting characters are very secondary to the film. Milland is a sought-after spy in Germany before World War II and in his efforts to escape, he is faced with a lonely Gypsy (Dietrich) who instantly leads him to be a fulfillment of prophecy - in other words, his new lover! Milland is quite muffled but reluctantly agrees to travel in his wagon - even putting paint on his body and piercing his ears to make him look like a gypsy (hence the title of the film). As time goes by, he slowly begins to realize that beneath his rude exterior is a woman and that romance blossoms slowly. <br /> <br /> The movie in one word is "charming". A good romance with a good dose of comedy and fun - just the kind of image you want Hollywood to still do. Also, note the performance of Murvyn Vye as "Zoltan". He was very magnetic in the short time he was in the movies and I simply loved his deep and beautiful voice. <br /> <br /> Finally, a sad note to consider. While the film takes place in Germany, no mention is made of the upcoming Gypsy Holocaust. During the war, throughout the German territory, the Nazis exterminated a huge percentage of gypsies and therefore the last good ending to the film is a bit exaggerated.
