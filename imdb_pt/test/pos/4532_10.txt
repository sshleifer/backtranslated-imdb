this movie may not have seemed like much to some people, but it had everything I look for in a comedy. fall into funny moments accompanied by a moment or two of seriously moving scenes, great actors and just about everything a good movie should be. Although David Spade interpreted his usual snobbish character, he played this role in an unusual performance that I think he had never exceeded until he hit the screen with Joe Dirt. regardless of whether some people are not fans of Chris Farley, I saw this movie when it came out and my friends and I still talked about it ... 11 years later. this movie was what finally told me that Chris Farley was the real deal. he's the best comedian I've ever seen in my life. in the words of some, he could be clumsy, intelligent, funny, serious, crazy, sober and touching or depressing at the same time. not the same words, but the message is all that counts. one of the real great actors of our time, and one of the real great comedies of all time. along with good acting, good story, hilarious moments, serious scenes that sometimes led me to tears. This film is at the top of the hordes as a movie that ushered in a brief reign at the top of the comedy world by the late great Chris Farley. no actor before or after has captured my interests in a movie ever since. because no actor before or after put so much into his films. this movie is worth it if you do not have time to see it the next time you rent a movie.
