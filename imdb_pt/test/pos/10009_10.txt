I loved this movie from start to finish. I'm a musician and I let the drugs get in the way of my some of the things I used to love (skateboarding, drawing), but my friends were always there for me. Music was like my rehab, life support, and my drug. It changed my life. I can totally relate to this movie and I wish there was more I could tell. This movie left me speechless to be honest. I just I saw this on the Ifc channel. I usually hate having satellite, but this was a privilege to have satellite. The IFC channel shows some really great movies and without it I would never have found this movie. I'm not a big fan of international movies because I I think a lot of do not do a very good job in the translation of lines. I mean, the obvious language barrier lets you just believe what they're saying, but it's not that big of a deal. I almost never got to see this AMAZING movie. stayed up instead of going to bed..well earlier than usual.lol.I hope you all enjoy the hell of this move and i love this movie as much as i do. I wish I could type all this in capital letters, but it's the rules again, I think that's it, but it would really show my excitement about the movie. I give you three thumbs up! This movie Blew ME AWAY!
