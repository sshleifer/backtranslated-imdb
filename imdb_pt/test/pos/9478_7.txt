At the beginning of the film, Cagney's character Johnny Cave tells his gumshoes at the Office of Weights and Measures that the year before unscrupulous store owners had misled the American consumer with more money than the total National War Debt ! So he went out and bought a particularly greasy grocery store to sell him a sack of sugar that's four ounces (oh, the horrors!) And a lean chicken that his butcher's scale generously proclaimed as six pounds. , after which the skin - or in this case feathers - flies. Er, fly. When a cheater in political attire tries to disrupt an investigation into the practices of the poultry supplier, our hero becomes a lone wolf fighting the weight war on behalf of housewives across America. After all, four cents here and a quarter add up, and before we know it, we have anarchy! The news of his intransigence soon reaches the offices of the mayor and governor, and Cagney becomes a marked man. If that sounds silly, it is not - dishonest retail practices are just a plot tool (or, as Hitchcock the McGuffin would say) and, though unfamiliar, work as well here as any Treasury or G-man anthology in that the fight is led to suspicious thugs who operate outside the interests of the common good of the country. The production standards are decidedly Grade-B, but it's Cagney who makes this film the pleasure it is: this was his first film away from Warner Brothers after seeking clearance in court for his irrational contract, and he seems to be at ease and amused - tremendously - the performance transformed here is clever and crackling with its unique energy and infallible charisma. The presence of Mae Clarke lends a definite sense of Warner to the overall production. Supporting players deliver solid performances and the story cleverly progresses after an introduction that seems to get three or four rolls into the story - but sit back and enjoy the Cagney showcase and the exciting time capsule of the Depression that is .
