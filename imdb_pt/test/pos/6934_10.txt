Just watched this one again. I wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. That's why these types of movies are made to entertain people and Zombie Bloodbath 2 does it for me and everyone I've shown. <br /> <br /> The story concerns a group of teenagers in a van that works on a group of convicted fugitives who have taken over an old farm. When a scarecrow (which is actually a demon, I think) gets disturbed, it comes alive and re-animates dead bodies from the local cemeteries. This leads our heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two insane killers who are in the process of torturing some people in a small town delicatessen. Very soon it is a confrontation with humans fighting against zombies. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie! From different formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to very fast pace and great music, there was always something going on and NEVER bore you! Of course, it's cheap, but you can tell that much attention and hard work has been devoted to this film. I read other reviews and all I can say is that these people have missed the point. If you want a 35mm Full Moon fuzz, or if you like modern things like Urban Legend, then I'll tell you about it. If you like low budget things like Gates Of Hell and Evil Dead, I say, buy that now. <br /> <br /> The make-up and gore are very good, the acting is uneven at times, but most of all it's very good and the editing is very impressive. There is enough happening to fill two more movies! In fact, it's one of the best B movies I've seen in ages.
