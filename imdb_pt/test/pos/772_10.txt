A beautiful movie. One that made me think of God, but did not feel guilty or overwhelmed. It made me think about death, but do not fear, think about life, but do not hide from it. A film that gave so much love to everything I stand for and at the same time condemned it to the depths of hell. A film that made me think of love and all that I lost, but no sadness graced my eyes, for some strange reason, relief. A child of two worlds, god and theater. And a little wine and irony! I highly recommend ***** "When *** *** hits the fan, get a tent" Oh and we should all go camping. Everyday.
