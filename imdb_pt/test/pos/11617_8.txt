"Subconscious Cruelty" has to be one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. "Salo" and "Cannibal Holocaust" did not bother me much, but there is a strange psychological element in "Subconscious Cruelty". This movie invades your subconscious mind with shocking taboos, surreal visuals and one of the most disturbing movie scores and sound designs. Repulsive at times; yes, but his visual style can be compared to Avant Gard directors such as Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Dusan Makavejev and David Lynch. Take the most extreme elements of these 4 directors and play the graphic violence from a Luico Fulci movie, and you can guess what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into 4 parts. The first part "The Ovarian Eye" is very short. A narrator tells us about the parts of the brain and their functions. Then a naked woman gets her stomach cut off and an eyeball is ripped out. The second part "Human Larvae" is like the movie "Eraserhead", but with incest. It deals with the sexual obsession of a man with his pregnant sister. Where is Frued when you need it? The third part is my absolute favorite. It reminds me of "Begotten" and the 1972 short by Jame Broughton, "Dreamwood". In this segment, people have sex with the earth. The men run bloody holes in the ground, the girls masturbate with tree branches. The branches bleed when broken. Watch with horror as a man gives fellatio to a knife coming out of a woman's vagina. These people really know how to get in touch with nature. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie is the most disturbing and sometimes borders on heavy pornography. This part of the movie made me think of Jodorowsky's "Holy Mountain," "Sweet Movie," and "Cannibal Holocaust." I've never been so disturbed in my life for what I witnessed. A businessman makes his private parts separated by hooks. Yuck and there! Two women urinate on a figure of Christ and proceed to caniberally eat it as communion bread and sodomize it with a tree branch. Poor boy. The last part was so extreme that if I watch the movie again, I will close my eyes or slightly forward. Karim Hussien and Mitch Davis are obviously very talented, think they did this project there in the early 1920s. Hussein went on to direct Tarkovsky's influence "Ascension" (2002) which is a much better film and he co-writes the screenplay of Nacho Cerda after the masterpiece of somber terror "The Abandoned". "Subconscious Cruelty" is a fascinating and disturbing journey; with images that come from the unthinkable realm of everyday human minds. Well, more or less.
