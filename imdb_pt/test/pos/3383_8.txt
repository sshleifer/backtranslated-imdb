North and South is a miniseries of the "golden era" of the television miniseries in the 80s, which was a time for long and sweeping epics with high production values ​​and many star movies. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the elements less like novels in history and the general sense of history. James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances - especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as a kind of emotional anchor in the middle of the story often melodramatic. The series also contains high-level works by Kirstie Alley, Wendy Kilbourne, Hal Holbrook, Lewis Smith, Genie Francis, Georg Stanford Brown and others. The costumes, the films, the sets and the music are also first class. <br /> <br /> Do not take it as a history lesson, but take it for what it is - a well-done and sweeping epic. of a bygone age. Book 2, which followed a year later, is also excellent, but I advise viewers to skip Book 3, which came out 8 years after Book 2 and was not as good as the first two parts. Books 1 and 2 are classics, however, even with their hottest elements, and it's worth noting them.
