The third film by the Polish brothers is their best, most beautiful and imaginative film to date. While many audiences have a problem with Northfork's lack of traditional dramatic structure, "Stay with it, Jack!". The plot is hard to sum up, so just know the story includes: agents trying to evacuate a city, God in a cowboy hat, angel wings selling, and a sick orphan (but it all works). The extraordinary photography of M. David Mullen makes almost all the pictures exciting and wonderful to look at. The performances of the actors, working with the inspiring and unusual script of the Poles, are perfect and give the film an emotional impact. The member of the will-power audience will be moved by the mythology and folk tale of the story, the comedic and moving actors, and finally the incredible courage and command that Michael Polish shows behind the camera. Once again, all these incredible and seemingly disconnected elements come together magnificently in one of the most incredible things you must run and experience. A great, great, great movie !!!
