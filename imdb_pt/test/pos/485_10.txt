Cowboys and Indians is an excellent movie. The writing, acting, directing could not have been better. This was a story that asked to be told, and this group of talented individuals and teams did an excellent job in doing so. Stories like this are not pleasant, but they serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist around the world. It is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be altered. A movie that can do this is a rare and special thing. Andrew Berzins is an excellent writer, and his talents and experience in this field have come to shine in this film. <br /> <br /> Thanks for telling this story !!! <br /> <br /> Ruby
