OK, so some of the plot points may be a bit obvious, but most of all, an interesting idea that works toward a tight end. The performance is solid, particularly Lachy Hulme, who plays one of the central characters of this piece of the set. He certainly has an onscreen presence and is interesting to watch. It has a low budget feel that works for the type of thriller / horror genre Four Jacks belongs to. The film does not try to take it seriously, which adds to the overall charm. The character of Phil (Dave Serrafin) has to be one of the most annoying characters seen on the screen since Rupert Pupkin / King of Comedy. It pays to add to a stack of weekend DVDs.
