Lang makes the Hawks, as well as the Hawks, in the first part of this extraordinary western, before settling into typical deterministic Lang, gloomy and haunted by guilt at the end. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that shows its greatness almost instantly, but at the same time very subtly. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) is on horseback and being chased, we do not know why - he stumbles on the wounded Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger) and decides to take his gun and horse, but find that Creighton is in a bad way, decides to fix it first. This is mostly transmitted through facial expressions and a very brief and brief dialogue - in 2 minutes we know that Shaw is an outlaw, but basically a good guy. Shaw ends up helping Creighton on his way to civilization, then vanishes. <br /> Cut to a few weeks or months later, with Creighton recovering and in charge of an expedition to lay the telegraph wire going west of Omaha. . He hires Shaw as a scout, who tries to leave when he discovers that Creighton is in charge; but Creighton wants it anyway, paying off a debt and feeling some quality. A tenderfoot, the son of a project benefactor, is also hired, but, atypically, the Eastern Richard Blake (Robert Young) is quite competent, as shown immediately in a fun but exciting sequence of fighting the breaches. Both contractors vie for Creighton's sister, Sue (Virginia Gilmore), who - again, not typically - seems as capable of caring as any man. The camaraderie between the three men, the comic elements involving a reluctant cook and several coarse types, and the wonderful romantic elements touched dominated the first third of the movie and reminded me more of Howard Hawks' "Red River" or "Only." Angels Have Wings "than most Lang - but they are so well touched and the action progresses so naturally that it does not matter, and does not change our pleasure - if perhaps we change our expectations - as the more common Langian themes of the haunted past, the dark secrets and the immense attraction of the easier, destructive and malignant ways come to dominate the later part of the film. crew, and Shaw has to fight what, if anything, is to tell Creighton about his tortured relationship with outlaw leader Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) > Beautifully filmed in Early Technicolor and moving fairly from sound stage to western places, this is for my money easily the best western of Lang and one of his best films, transmitting as potently as any of his films to men's inability to escape from their past and build a new future. Scott is as good as I've seen him, showing more with a simple move than many actors can do in a dialogue paragraph, and the rest of the cast is evenly matched. The inevitable confrontation between the criminal life of Shaw's past and his potential future is extraordinary, and a surprise, even to a longtime devotee of Lang as I am; and even in 1941 it seems that there was no place more loaded with meaning on the fringes of civilization than the barber shop and the dusty street outside. You can shave, you may feel like a new man, but you can never really be one, as long as the old ties still trap you. <br /> Genius.
