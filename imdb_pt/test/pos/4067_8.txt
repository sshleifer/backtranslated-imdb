Contains Spoiler The movie is a good action / comedy, but I do not know if the director has cut many parts, but it seems that the bad guy died too fast. The end of the movie comes, the bad guy dies and that's it. <br /> <br /> Special effects are good and I do not regret paying to see in the movies.
