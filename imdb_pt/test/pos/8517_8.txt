If you can watch a 1983 Bond movie that is not as good as Octopussy and still enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If you can accept production values ​​that are not much above the level of a TV movie. <br /> <br /> If you can look at Sean Connery with wrinkles on his forehead underneath an obvious wig and still see James Bond. <br /> <br /> If you can get past an inexperienced Basinger, a weaker Largo and a lively Q. <br /> <br /> If you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score, not up there with Barry on his worst day. <br /> <br /> If you do not believe in the hyperbolic criticism that was received at launch. <br /> <br /> If you can face a poker battle and a video game, face them and have fun with them the same way. <br /> <br /> Yours is Never Say Never Again and everything in it. <br /> <br /> And, what's more, you'll probably like it, my son!
