This excellent film, starring Elizabeth Montgomery, is long overdue to be released on DVD. The same can be said of his previous film, also excellent, A Case of Rape. I can only hope that my comments will stimulate some enterprising soul to put the two Elizabeth Montgomery films on a DVD to be made available to their many fans. I at least believe that the role of this excellent actress was unfortunately stereotyped for her role in Bewitched, and as a result, more serious acting roles were not made available to her. I am confident that if these two films, perhaps even a trilogy with The Legend of Lizzie Borden, were released on DVD, their fans would clarify how much they consider their acting abilities serious.
