Ponyo, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is a short tale that speaks of respect for the ocean, respect for young and old humans, and respect for cultural differences. It's a new tale of a goldfish that wants to be a girl rather than retelling the Disney Little Mermaid. Miyazaki has animated by hand, a magical and capricious film for the young and the young at heart. The film begins with a wavy palette of sea anemones, jellyfish and dozens of goldfish with children's faces. There is no need for narrative, the movement of creatures and the music of Jo Hisaiahi tell the beginning. Launched last summer in Japan, Ponyo won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Animated Film and Best Score (Jezebel.com). The fantastic fish, Brunhild, leaves his ocean in a jellyfish. Upon reaching the surface, it is caught in a fishing net full of other fish, garbage and mud. She is pushed into a pot, which is rolled to the beach where Sosuke, a five-year-old (Frankie Jonas voice), retrieves it. He cuts his hand when he breaks the open jar to release the little goldfish. Brunhild savored his blood, which heals Sosuke's cut, and sets in motion his transformation to a human, at the same time throwing nature out of balance. Sosuke puts the goldfish in a green bucket and names his Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), which means soft and gelatinous. Sosuke's mother, Lisa (Tina Fey), lets him take Ponyo to school, which is right next to the asylum where she works. Lisa's madness along the picturesque winding road, past a dry dock, through the bustling fishing village, and a tree-lined road to the nursing home is representative of Miyazaki's wonderful action sequence and perfectly illustrates a father's hectic morning. Miyazaki created another strong and independent female character in Lisa. Making her a loving, sensitive and modern mother, for both Sosuke and Ponyo. Lisa's phone conversation with her husband who did not return home, Kiochi (Matt Damon) because the ship he runs must make another run, is a typical reaction of his wife. Later that night, Sosuke intercedes using a signal lamp to talk to his father as the ship passes the cliff where the house is. Lisa refuses to acknowledge Kiochi's apology and jumps and signals "Bug-off, Bug-off, Bug-off", it's a hilarious scene. But when Sosuke takes the signal light and tells his father "Good luck, I love you", Lisa hugs him and says he has a good heart, it's a very touching scene. <br /> <br /> My personal favorites are elderly, Miyazaki grandmother-type women in wheelchairs in the nursing home, Yochi (Betty White), Noriko (Cloris Leachman) and Toki (Lily Tomlin). Their exchange on Sosuke's goldfish is wonderful and reminiscent of the discussion between the Witch of Waste (Lauren Bacall) and Sophie (Jean Simmons) as they walk up a long flight of stairs in Howl's Moving Castle. The father of the god of the magic sea of ​​Ponyo, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), similar to the magician Howl, arrives to take Ponyo back to its house in the ocean. Fujimoto uses one of his elixirs to try to put nature back into balance, but the little magical Ponyo escapes again, eliciting more elixir in the process and causing a tsunami. Running on the back of giant dolphins to reach Sosuke, this little redheaded girl reminds the audience of the stubborn and adventurous Mei in My Neighbor Totoro. Ponyo is as adventurous and curious as Mei. When Fujimoto realizes what Ponyo did, he calls Gran Mamare (Kate Blanchett), the Goddess of the Ocean, to help with the situation. This wise and soothing Goddess arrives in a blue outfit that never ends. She has a private conversation with Lisa discussing the future of small children, which helps the public understand that the relationship of Sosuke and Ponyo is not lovers, but brother and sister. The simple and quiet ending to life is typical of Miyazaki's films leaving the audience full of hope.
