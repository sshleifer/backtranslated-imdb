Or at least you feel really good after that movie. It's the kind of movie in which the word "joke" really can be applied, although it's a joke in that entirely casual, intelligent, open-minded way that belongs to the French. <br /> <br /> No, Catherine Deneuve does not spend the whole movie high (sorry to disappoint any puritan with a schedule) .. but the only scene I mean involves all members of a wedding party - And it's a musical number Anyway, everything fits perfectly, and the unusual, bright and colorful family (Deneuve's mother is a lesbian, Deneuve, her daughter bon vivant) entertains and bothers us as real families ... but as it is a movie they entertain mainly. I do not want to talk much about the ending, but Deneuve ends up marrying a man about twenty years younger. This is totally believable as we see the relationship develop over time, and as the two are naturally drawn closer and closer. The end is happy; and like the rest of the movie, satisfyingly quirky as well as pitch-perfect.
