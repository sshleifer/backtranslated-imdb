As one of the other reviewers (it might have been @ Amazon), I was first introduced to Tourist Trap by the beloved and decrepit old WOR-9 in NY around January 1983. Devil Dog: The Dog of Hell, which I had been Waiting to see since it debuted on Halloween 1978, had just finished, and I thought I had my horror filled for the day (stop laughing - that three eyes "Borgost" (sp?) monster Ike Eisenmann lays on his room is <br /> <br /> As much as I still enjoy Richard Crenna wearing his horror hat made for TV, it was the first 10 minutes of Tourist Trap, following the Devil Dog that day, that really left a mark - and months later, it turned out to be the first movie I ever recorded on TV.WOR used to play quite often, like the movie Million Dollar Movie on Saturday afternoon, as others have noted.It is one of those offers that provides a powerful blow of terror on the front, a real left-and then practically resumes with the rest of the cast, dances and jabs, putting the opening scene in a larger context along the way, and then moves on to the true climax. (See Night of the Living Dead, Re-Animator). <br /> <br /> Two paragraphs and I did not mention a single dummy. Face it - the damn things are scary enough, without the music and the script. I can also remember some scary mannequins and stuff like that in the attics and basements of several relatives, and say what you like about Schmoeller and Carroll's relatively straightforward approach - no one before or after played well. In real life, a good mannequin will make you think twice - and here's the last thing you'll probably see if you're stuck in the extinct Slausen wax museum and by the roadside. Yes, there is a point ("I loved her very much"), where Chuck "Slausen" Connors is trying to pass Vincent Price. Yes, the plot could have occupied a whole paragraph in the early stages; I can not see the script being so thick. Does not matter. From the directing to the competent performance (Meryl Streep emphatically is not present, and here, which helps rather than hinder), the other useful and effective score of Pino Dinaggio (see Carrie and several other Palma films), the various lights, use of varying sound levels ... I could go on - every element of this low budget production comes together and you get a job much bigger than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> Did I mention it's scary as Hell? Stephen King spoke this film in Danse Macabre a year after its launch, and rightly so. Like most of his work, it may not be a great art, but it sure tells a scary story, and it does well. The rest of the cast may be relatively unknown (was not Jocelyn Jones in that Texas car chase film too?), But Chuck Connors and Tanya Roberts were and are, just familiar enough to the public, to make you think - Stephen's style King - may it happen to you, or to people you know. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Psycho (plot) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (general appearance), even if they are not the first associations in my life. are valid. I just wish I could comment on the DVD, which I'm looking forward to buying, as Tourist Trap has become notoriously difficult to find in video since the near complete extinction of independent video stores where I had a home beyond the WOR and cable in the decade 1980 (although TMC / Showtime appears to have appeared and played regularly now). No, there are no spoilers here, I'm afraid, there's no plot break - go see for yourself (alright, there might be a little one down, then go away if you want - better safe than sorry). The mannequins are very scary and I'd rather show than tell ... :) For the record, Tourist Trap is also full of great lines, "we're throwing a party!" As I look, heim, how do I look like?! ", to" you're so beautiful "," you can not hurt me "," I should not have to hide it - it's good! "(listen to Vincent Price's inflection again), the inevitable "you are crazy!" (delivered at the right time, and in the right tone) ... and try - just try - keep your hair loose when you hear the dummy's head shouting "Molly!" - especially after you realize your head used to be ... :) P S ... Charles Band was the producer of it, I believe, and probably owned the rights to the song by Dinaggio. Banda, as I understand it, was the brain behind Full Moon Entertainment, which may explain the subsequent use of the song in Puppet Master, and, well, the commercial approach 40 featured the Full Moon everywhere, from the nice franchises Puppet Master and Subspecies, for, uhhh ... Trancers and Bad Channels (sorry, BOC).
