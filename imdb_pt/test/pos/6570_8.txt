A city in Japan is being dominated by a horribly brutal abstract form: the spiral. It's becoming a theme in everything from animals to clouds to people and twisting them, mentally and literally. This movie shows this happening to various groups of people. Some demonic possession is implied, but nothing is entirely certain except that the best bet is to get out of the dodge. The film progresses very well from normal life to abnormal phenomena (giant and crazy snails) to the truly supernatural (dead on foot). <br /> <br /> As a fan of American horror movies, this was exactly what I needed. Maybe it was just the novelty of the movie from a different culture, but it seemed to have a very original progression, a set of characters, and the premise was definitely new. The Japanese may think that "forms of terror" (uzumaki means "spiral", I'm told) are already old, but it was good for me because I'm used to monsters / alien / virus / disaster / undead movies. In an American movie, you know who will die (the boring / nasty / lascivious / racist characters) and who will live (children / heroine / dogs / cats / cool guy). This is not true in Japanese horror. It was not predictable how they would fight against evil or how it would end. In addition, it had a new (but typically typically Japanese) color leached in the Pacific Northwest style, which was a new visual effect for me. The horrible moments were seriously scary, relying on a bit of blood, but mostly with overly exaggerated facial expressions (think of The Ring) and bodily manipulations. This should be one of the big names with earlier ideas such as the first Nightmare on Elm Street or Night of the Living Dead.
