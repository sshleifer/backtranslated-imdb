A landmark in film history, "Bronenosets Potyomkin" is one of the great movies that deserves to be called the classic. It was the image that made Sergei M. Eisenstein a figure of projection at the time. And today, it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of film that has always been. <br /> <br /> 'Potom√≠nia' is a film that NEEDS to be seen as an entity, not to be chosen. Do not just watch these clips where they just have the 'Odessa steps' sequence and then switch to 'Citizen Kane' or 'The Godfather', watch it all in its glorious 75-minute run time to truly understand and have fun. Do not expect all the infinitesimal details to be perfect, I mean, the 1920s era of silence makes Scooby Doo sound like a master of discreet realism, certain plot points may seem illogical, and some of the battle sequences seem dated, but still an immensely nice film. <br /> <br /> The most memorable moments in the movie are the mutiny on the warship, Vakulinchuk's body falling off the ship, the sailor under the tent at the end of the pier, the mother holding her dead child, the baby stroller on the steps of Odessa and the lion getting up to roar as more carnage happens. For each new pair of eyes that look at him, 'The Battleship Potemkin' comes alive again.
