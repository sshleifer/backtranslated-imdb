If I had watched this movie when I reached the bottom of the pit, I would probably have sunk into the deepest depression of my life, and could be almost desperate enough to try, the only thing is in the real world, when you steal millions of dollars. of unsuspecting individuals, everything does not come from roses (unless you're an investment banker or government affiliate), so how does it matter? I had been rejected from school after school, and that hurts, so it's a brilliant topic for a movie, and when you indulge in imagery to let yourself watch this movie without applying ramifications in the real world, it can really touch somebody else's situation , and let them know that they are not alone. The excess of soliloquy completely destroys the established educational system as we know it.
