I saw the new The D movie tonight at a special screening, and I was so impressed by its greatness that I felt I had to come to the IMDb and spread the word. Of course, I was already a big fan of D's work - I loved the HBO series and listened to their music weekly (there's nothing better to sing along), but that appreciation really made me more apprehensive for tonight's projection (for us We are all disappointed at one time or another by something we love when we try to make the jump to the big screen). With Tenacious D's "The Pick of Destiny," this is not the case. Simplifying, this movie rocks harder than anything I've ever seen and is funnier and more majestic than anything Peter Jackson, Pixar, and Will Ferrell together could produce. He tells the story of D before meeting them, creating intriguing stories of the creation of Kage and Jables, their goings on and how they were inspired to write songs about things like Lee, Sasquatch and Dio. More importantly, they reveal the true inspiration to the greatest song in the world, "Tribute," and how it came to be (which is different from the HBO series version). Once you have witnessed this, you probably will not be able to remember (hence the Tribute), but your mind will always be changed by your genius. <br /> <br /> I do not go out to movies very often. more due to the high price of tickets and the hassle of getting parking, paying scandalous concession prices, etc., but I usually make exceptions when I'm starring in someone I really love or something related to the same variety. "The Pick of Destiny" was so good that I have no qualms about seeing it again when it's released across the country, and I intend to persuade all my friends to go as well. Last week we saw "Borat" and loved it, but that's honest to goodness tenfold better. For those who truly love rock music and comic brilliance, watch this movie. The talent of these guys is so great that you should not hesitate to support their cause. You will not be disappointed, and the Lords of Rock will smile at you favorably.
