This review is based on the cut of the producer: 'Halloween 5' was a big disappointment on the way to box office in 1989. Personally, I have always loved it and I am proud to have it in my collection. But because of failure and also because of rights issues, it would be 6 years before we see another plot. The film had the qualities of being one of the best, if not the best of the series. A hardcore fan writing the script, the return not only of Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis and George Wilbur as Michael Myers, but also the return of Tommy Doyle's character from the first film, a large studio supporting the project, and a fall release all made the film sound like a hit in the making. So, what went wrong? I'll give you two good reasons: Re-filming and bad editing. Due to a poor screening test and also the unfortunate approval of Donald Pleasence, the film was changed, not for the better. The film, like parts III and 5, plummeted at the box office and garnered negative reviews from both the critics and most fans of the series. But then, thanks to the magic of smuggling, the original cut leaked and many fans, myself included, were very happy. I'm going to end this part of my analysis by saying this: This movie is, at least until now, my favorite 'Halloween' movie and I'm not afraid to admit it. <br /> <br /> Pros: The score is simply fascinating. It has some of the best essays and dialogues of the series. 'Halloween 4' emulated the original in which it was more about suspense and humor instead of blood and courage, and 6 is the same way. Great performances, especially from the late and very longing Donald Pleasence. It moves at a breathtaking pace. An interesting explanation for Michael's illness and why he will not die. Some brutal deaths. Some cool moments, my favorite is the one that surrounds the character of Kim Darby. Very cool beckons for the previous films. Some good surprises. Like the two previous sequences, this one has an incredible suspense ending. <br /> <br /> Cons: Although the explanation for Michael's evil is fascinating, it makes him a little less scary. Since when can Michael move from one place to another so fast? <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: This was the first 'Halloween' I saw in the theater. I was so excited because I really had thought that 5 would be the last and then I heard that this was happening. I liked that at the time, but over time I saw what it really was: a great movie stuck in an OK with a terrible ending. Why did filmmakers have to listen to people in the test sessions? If they had released this higher version, she could have done a lot better and the series may not be stuck in the mess she's in now. My rating: 5/5
