RIFIFI (Jules Dassin - France 1955) <br /> <br /> For me, it seems a very risky idea to try a Hollywood remake of Jules Dassin's 1955 classic RIFIFI. Planned to be released in 2007, Al Pacino will apparently take the lead, taking on the role of Tony le Stephanois. Risky business ... How will they achieve this? <br /> <br /> Ironically, Dassin was blacklisted in Hollywood and tried his luck in France and made this little work of art, appropriately called by some Grandddady of all the caper and assault films. "In my opinion , it remains a unique classic, beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable endings ever put on film. Whatever the view of the film. <br /> <br /> In the last two years, but this classic French noir should not be overlooked. Go see it, before the remake is out there, in order to have some ammo to compare the two. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura 9/10
