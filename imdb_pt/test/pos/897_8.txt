The main reason to check this out is to watch Laura Gemser in all her glory. <br /> <br /> That's reason enough for me. <br /> <br /> She goes to Africa as a guest of another rich guy. which seems to be in all these movies. Huge mansion near the jungle. Hunters who hang around for parties when zebras are not hunting. And he said that the parties become drunken drunken orgies. <br /> <br /> All kinds of high society in Emanuelle's movies seem to have out-of-control fetishes. And Emanuelle covers most of them. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato did NOT direct this. He just ripped and used the same cast. And did anyone notice the "subliminal" sexual images at the gas station? And why did most men get dressed during sex scenes? <br /> <br /> Consistency? Hardly any. BUT GODSER GODDESS IS BEAUTIFUL.
