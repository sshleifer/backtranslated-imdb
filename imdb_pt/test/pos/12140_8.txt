This is a black and white movie from France, <br /> <br /> simple plot, gangster on the run seeking & getting help etc. We have seen this kind of movie many times over the years. What makes this film different is mainly its acting and style. All the actors present themselves silently, nobody shouts and almost nobody loses the patience. There are some deaths, some surprising. There are beautiful women too, but no sex scenes. Also there are no car chases. <br /> <br /> JUST talking / It's so refreshing to hear people talking, and here we should read the subtitles as well. <br /> <br /> The performance is almost perfect for everyone. . especially the leadership played by Lino Ventura & in a smaller, BUT vital role by Jean Paul Belmondo. These two actors were among the best. <br /> <br /> I said above that the movie is flawed, there are some shortcomings of script in some points, They are smaller, acting is the thing in this movie. Production is top notch as well. IMDb User Rating: IMDb User Rating: IMDb User Rating: IMDb User Rating: IMDb User Rating: IMDb User Rating: IMDb User Rating:
