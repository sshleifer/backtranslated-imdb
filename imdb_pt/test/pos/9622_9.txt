Although generally recognized as one of the earliest martial arts films to play here in the West, its real impact comes in retrospect. Lo Lieh is very low throughout and many of the fighting scenes, although often acclaimed as groundbreaking (which were at the time of the initial release of the film), are a little tame compared to what came later (particularly after Bruce Lee, who has become the instant standard by which all others will be judged forever). This is not to say that FIVE DEEDS OF DEATH / REI BOXER is something less than a classic in its own right, because it is. Like many of the main characters in many martial arts films, the character Lieh plays is mostly down for a reason - but when he lets go, he effectively cleans the house. You can not ask for more than that.
