I've seen the Director's Cut version and can not be anything but content. Excellent acting (especially Cole Hauser, I was sad with little space for Claudia Black), subtle visual effects and photography in general and believable plot (considering the genre) without many logical holes, really unpredictable twists, construction characters. These are the film's biggest assets. Combined with style - some might consider this film a Grade B effort, but I would disagree with that. The whole thing really is very unique and elegant. <br /> <br /> And even though I'm not a Vin Diesel fan, this Riddick role was very good for him. I can not wait for Chronicles of Riddick, it's really cool this movie has a sequel ... <br /> <br /> 9/10 if you ask me
