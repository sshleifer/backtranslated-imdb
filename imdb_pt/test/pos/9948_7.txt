If you like Japanese monster movies, you'll love this action-packed battle between an alien invader intent on conquering Earth, and a "Giant Robot" with an arsenal of super weaponry. The "Emporer Guillotine" alien from the planet Gargoyle has an army of bandits called (of course) a "gargoyle gang," as well as an endless supply of huge hostile creatures that are routinely loosed on Earth to destroy buildings. , make loud noises, panic in the population, etc. A little boy, named Johnny Sokko, has the Giant Robot on his call, and sends the Robot as needed to hit and blow these creatures. Johnny joins a group of "good spies" called Unicorn, and strives to help save the world. <br /> <br /> Despite the exaggerated nature, the unintentionally humorous dialogue, and the fact that the target audience was obviously children, this film has uninterrupted action, colorful characters, decent special effects and is simply fun to watch. The battle scenes are well executed and frequent, as the plot demands. Good guys and bad guys made sure they had an endless supply of bombs, lasers, ammo and schemes to attack each other. Despite the fact that the film was built from edited episodes of a TV series, the plot really unfolds and comes to a final conclusion. <br /> <br /> The film has a positive outlook and appeals to everyone (especially children). I wish to destroy evil in its many forms. Children may be the target audience, but it's fun for everyone to laugh at their comical nonsense; yet, at the same time, hope that the good guys will prevail and "save the world." The acting is extravagant in some places, but that's the charm: there are several lines of abrupt dialogue (possibly translation errors or possibly intentional jokes from filmmakers), and you'll find yourself citing those absurd lines later. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, this movie is not high on production quality or budget. However, for what it is, sci-fi campy is enjoyable for some laughs. I would highly recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor for this sort of thing.
