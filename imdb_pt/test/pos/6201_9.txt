I do not understand why this show did not happen, there could have been several ways to stay on the line for Darwin and Farik after Season 2, obviously Darwin could not have been the UC agent infiltrating the cells and sabotaging them from the inside, but they still should have given this show at least another season. <br /> <br /> The show is well released, believable, and views the Islamic religion from the normal and extremist point of view. It tackles controversial themes in detail and has a dramatic significance that can be said of very few shows nowadays. I'm really sad that I did not know about this program until the end of 2007.
