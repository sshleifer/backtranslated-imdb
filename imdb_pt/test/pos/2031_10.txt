If you like 80's rock, you should definitely see this movie! I only saw this recently and I completely fell in love with it! <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is great fun, provides a great load of rock songs and not even a single second of the movie I find boring! It was a great idea that some of the real-life musicians were at it, doing what they do best. I was happy to see Zakk as well as Bias Elias, all of whom presented solid performances. I usually agree with many people saying that the first half of the movie was much better than the second, especially in terms of the script. This could have been worked out a little better, but not a big problem. One thing that bothered me a bit was the performance of Jennifer Aniston. I thought she was not the right person for this role, I just could not see her as a rock star. But as the movie continues, you somehow realize that she did a good job with it. of honesty and sincerity that she delivers that simply does not make her cold. To summarize, a good and funny movie that does not delve into the characters but provides you with good fun, a sense of nostalgia and, of course, the powerful vocals of Jeff Scott Soto and Mike. Matijevic!
