(the humor description of the film can be considered a spoiler - because there is not much action in fact) <br /> <br /> Great ... <br /> <br /> It is to my peculiar interest for dystopias and utopias Is it for the movie atmosphere? Or is there any more magic? If yes, it is certainly the most human ... <br /> <br /> This film is undoubtedly extremely artistic / artificial (depends on taste). I can imagine most people who hate watching slow movies (and those of Tsai Ming Liang (which I have not enjoyed at other times) are the slowest I know), suffering during the film. Yes, people are unable to slow down and let time pass - and see it without feeling like they are wasting it. One can take this piece as torture or as therapy ... <br /> <br /> The topic on the surface? Lack of communication - even if we live in rabbit cages - side by side - but not really together? People are tired, tired of something and unable to describe it - they simply do not want to meet, touch, speak, confront others ... as if they have disappeared. The large apartment block looks empty and the falling rain constantly evokes the strange melancholy inside. And sometimes it must be something abnormal, unexpected, some unwanted decay like a hole in the concrete floor - that allows us to reach each other. <br /> <br /> One of the possible ways to look at this is this: Do not inspect the inner world of the characters - consider the entire space of the movie within yourself. And ask - why is it there? Where could these depressive states and moods form? Is there a place for them, they have no right to be here? And look for the answers (if you need them) between the walls and halls of the block - instead of within the barely transparent mind of a man. <br /> <br /> The key to understanding is not-to-understand - to let a movie lend us - as an object of study - within itself - and in the end we will safely return to our more colorful reality and " normal". <br /> <br /> So maybe you reach - like me - the feeling of real hope, possible, not pathetic, that at heart we are still human ... and that state of mind can help a lot to live in this world.
