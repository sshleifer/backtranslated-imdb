All the reviews so far about this movie are negative, but I have to say that I found "The Net" engaging. Few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat, but this one did. Another advantage is that most action / suspense movies are full of language, but this one has little profanity. I found a nice movie to watch. I'm a bit biased, being a big fan of Sandra Bullock. *wink*
