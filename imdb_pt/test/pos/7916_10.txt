Alexander Nevsky is legitimately presented as a cinematic masterpiece. However, it has aged very badly. People decide not to mention this and talk about the great battles and good music. Sound effects may have been good at the time, but beyond the organ of omen, all sounds are laughable. I may be photographed by moviegoers for this, but I'm sure that the modern viewer of Alexander Nevsky will agree that blatant advertising and scary music to lessen the film. I gave this film 10/10 because it is undeniably a masterpiece. It has its big chunks however. The costumes of the Teutonic knights are superb and the battle scenes are quite good for the time. However, it is a masterpiece that shows its age.
