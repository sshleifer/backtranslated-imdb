I consider myself a big fan of horror movies. One night, I just wanted to rent some newer horror movies to make fun. So I rented Milo. I was so surprised with this movie. This scared the hell out of me. This is not something I can say very often. Usually, Halloween only scares me. <br /> <br /> Two other friends watched with me, and they had a disturbed feeling. A good feeling, if you ask me, after watching a horror movie. If you are not affected, then what is the point. <br /> <br /> This movie was original. He did not follow the normal directives of a horror movie. That's why movies like Valentine bombard me. <br /> <br /> Of course, many are left with unanswered questions, as most horror movies do. It's worth the rent though.
