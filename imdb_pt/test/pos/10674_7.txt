"Doppelganger" is a fun science fiction offering in the Twilight Zone style of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (the team behind Space: 1999, UFO, Thunderbirds, Fireball XL-5 and others). In the film, Roy Thinnes (from TV show "Invaders") and Ian Hendry star as astronauts sent on a flight to a planet that shares an exact orbit of Earth but on the opposite side of the sun; therefore, previously hidden from view. An insistent director of European space flight (surpassed by the late Patrick Wymark) gets the accelerated flight and, after a rigorous training, the astronauts are ready. Thus begins the best sequences of the film, the launch, flight and landing on "other" land. Dazzling miniature rocket work (by Derek Meddings) and an elegant space flight with dreams (something reminiscent of the best moments of "2001: A Space Odyssey") are the movie's easy highlights. The land landing "doppelganger" is both exciting and sinister. After that, the Twilight Zone aspect of the movie kicks in; with a plot drawn almost entirely from the classic TZ episode, "The Parallel." In addition, the film is still a solid science fiction, with some intriguing "mirror-world" chewing-in stuff (writing back and hand-shaking with the left hand, for example). Less successful are the scenes that depict a land of the 21st century; where all men wear high collar and Nehru coats and all women wear mini skirts. Some of the relationships with women in the movie are very "non-PC" by today's standards as well. And (in the most consistent flaw of most sci-fi of the 20th century) computers, telephones and other equipment are all big, colorful and clumsy (straight from Patrick McGoohan's "The Prisoner"). No one predicted the age of the digital microprocessor! If anyone can accept these flaws in the prediction, the film is very interesting, with a solid performance of Thinnes as a troublesome astronaut. And with a nihilistic ending of the 1960s / early 70s! For retro science fiction fans (like me) this is a worthwhile "trip"!
