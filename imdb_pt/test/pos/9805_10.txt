I rented the movie and I liked it so much that I bought it. Elijah Wood (Mikey) and Joseph Mazello (Bobby) are excellent as the two boys. Her new stepfather physically abuses Bobby. The abuse is implicit, for the most part, unseen, and has aroused much passion in me to help abused children. There is a magical quality to the film as the boys' imagination helps them find a way to deal with the abuse. You have to try to understand the story from a child's point of view. I'm still thinking about the end. I've watched the movie 3 or 4 times and each time I think of possible new meanings. I do not know exactly what Richard Donner wanted me to think, but this is a great movie! Joseph Mazello and Elijah Wood will make you hug your children.
