I found the film very interesting. I really liked the movie that the actors were great. It was entertaining. Benny, the uncle, was wonderful. He was real in character. The ending gave a wonderful twist. I would recommend you to see him. Eddie Mores' girlfriend reminded me a little of sandra bullock, she was sharp as a nail. I also like the little girls who act in the movie that she was very convincing. Benny reminded me of a friend of mine who actually lives his life while growing up in Brooklyn. I loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pan because that's how most people cook lol. I actually watched the movie twice and learned more the second time around.
