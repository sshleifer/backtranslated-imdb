Those who do not like this movie seem to think that a loved one somehow "belongs" to them and should be discarded if they go out with someone else. Fortunately, human nature is much deeper than that; loving someone deep inevitably brings suffering - though we are fortunate only by their death. <br /> <br /> This film is true in ambiance, atmosphere and dialogue with Nigel Balchin's original novel ('A Way Through the Wood'), and by pointing to a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma captures the silent despair that lies behind of many apparently idyllic lives (and the depiction of English upper-class rural life is very precise). <br /> <br /> I loved the movie and I hope it shows up Just like a DVD compatible with the UK
