I do not have much to say than this is a great end to the story. Most people said that there is enough plot and it's just eye candy. But, think about it, everything was explained in FFVII you can not add more storyline to such a big story that would ruin it. They did the best they could do and I think this should be taken more like The FMV Final .. the last fight. <br /> <br /> Graphics - 10/10, Absolutely incredible <br /> <br /> History 8.5 / 10 - do not think they could expand it much more. And the stuff they could put there was clever enough, I thought. Characters 9/10 - Well, most of them have already been explained during the game, but it still would not fit in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10, since I'm a metal fan I loved the fight music .. and piano just gets there .. It's a great ST and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Tilt / Replay 10/10 - Nice all the time. <br /> <br /> In general - 9/10 (FF Fan View 10/10) <br /> <br /> I personally think this is what was needed, a fight to end it all .. plot was already in place. Action was needed as much as people complained. I loved every second of that movie. It was a pleasure to visit the world of FFVII just one last time. <br /> <br /> Just remember that ... most of the movies that were made form a game and were directed by movie directors. a team of game directors .. I do not think I've ever seen a better game for the movie .. Thankyou Square, I think you did right!
