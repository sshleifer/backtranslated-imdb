"The Mayor Of Hell" has the feel of an old Dead End Kids movie, but with a much more difficult edge and very few points of light, preceding the first appearance of the Dead Enders for four years. James Cagney has a full-screen opening credit, even if technically, the 'mayor' of the film's title is actually portrayed by Frankie Darro, one of several boys sent to reform the school during the opening scenes. Darro's character is Jimmy Smith, a tough young man who is friends with 'Patsy' Gargan (Cagney), and is elected to the post when Gargan has a chance to humanize the conditions in a state reform school. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers made many of these types of films, trying to provide a kind of awareness in a time that knew full well the effects of crime and poverty. This film is quite bold, with no excuses for ethnic stereotypes, such as the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a Jewish boy manages a candy store in retirement school. The rules of the reformatory are quite simple - work hard and keep your mouth shut; leaves the line and you respond personally to Warden Thompson (Dudley Digges). The role of Cagney in the story seems a little ambiguous, since he makes a serious effort to improve the conditions within the reformatory, on the outside, he is still nominally in control of a crime criminal. The film's attempt to reconcile this dichotomy is insufficient in my opinion, the final attempt to wrap things up in a neat package like Gargan awaits the result of a near-fatal shot of one of his henchmen. Not exactly the kind of modeling one would look for in a movie like this. Warner Brothers would sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake entitled "Crime School," with Humphrey Bogart in the role of Cagney, and Billy Halop in Frankie Darro's part. If you're partial to Dead End Kids, you'll probably enjoy the latest movie, as it also features familiar faces like Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell. However, the ending is also a bit muddy, with Bogart's character involved in a cover-up of a jailbreak. Both films offer a romantic interest to the main characters in 'Mayor', Madge Evans is a reformist nurse who falls in love with Cagney's character. <br /> <br /> Curiously, many of the early James Cagney films are not commercially known. available, then you will have to keep your eyes open for a display on Turner Classics or get the movie from a private collector. Personally, I can not get enough of this kind of thing and find intriguing points of interest in the movies of all genres in the thirties and forties.
