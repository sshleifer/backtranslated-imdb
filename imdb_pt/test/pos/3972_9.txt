From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to get used to from the beginning, at least for me, since I expected this to be an American Pie movie. But it was a bit different - a fun-loving fun-loving high school graduate who does his OWN faculty, managing it accordingly. As you might expect, there are lots of parties and hot bikini girls, but this movie has tried more than a normal teen movie. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of speech and finally "push it into the system". The humor was varied which I loved. The whole cast featured fantastic performances - hire this one with a friend, it's a fucking crack!
