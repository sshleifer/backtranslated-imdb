This is the classic western. The good one, Glenn Ford, the dashing hero, the ex-soldier, the man who would not hold a gun again. He eventually has to defend the evil baron of the earth, Edward G. Robinson, who owns most of the valley and wants it all. Then there is Barbara Stanwyck, the royal rule of the perch. The wife of Edward G. Robinson, who will not let anyone get in the way, even making Edward G. Robinson seem weak. She is so bad that everyone pales alongside her blind ambition and cruelty to rule the valley and all who live in it. The gleam in her eyes as she sees people facing death for her is unnerving. Worth the wait. Enter a young Brian Keith and a few others and you have a drama that stands on its own. With the demanding stampedes, shootings, ambushes and close-ups of tough cowboys and you have a western. Without giving anything, there are enough twists to make it not just a standard cowboy shot. -above.
