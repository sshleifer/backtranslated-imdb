River's Edge is more than just the story of a murder. It is a blame for the wave of apathy that haunts pockets of young people for decades. Our main characters are a group from what my school would have referred to as "stoners". One of them just decided to strangle his girlfriend because she apparently had the guts to "talk to him". This dangerous young man played by Daniel Roebuck has an intensity that will scare you. He takes the other children in the group to show them the body of his girlfriend, and strangely, no one seems really scared of it. The film's balance marks the desperate circumstances in which these people live, and how guilt is eventually able to reach even within these apathetic children. <br /> <br /> River's Edge is certainly not tolerating or defending the behavior of its characters. We clearly see the dangers presented by such uncontrolled apathy and having only the urge to get drunk or loud. We are shown the dysfunctional home lives that these children have, and maybe this is meant to explain their terrible behavior. But could they only be unstable houses that lead to this kind of destructive life? Crispin Glover is your usual self. He drives through the city in complete paranoia after the murder. He tries to sympathize with why his friend had to commit the crime, but clearly he does not understand what could have made the young man do it. Dennis Hopper plays an older man with whom these kids are drugged. Although he is certainly a rebellious figure, he can not relate to the apathy and anger of the younger generation. Witness his confused reaction as Roebuck describes how killing his girlfriend made him feel. However wild the character of Hopper, even he knows that this young man should not be walking on the face of the earth. <br /> <br /> What do you think of these children? Well, there's really no way to like your characters. Some are less despicable than others, but you can not help but hate or feel sorry for them. Twenty years later, there is still a lively and good apathy in many young people out there. When do these children get lost? What makes many of them want to act as antisocial? This movie, and the questions it asks about teenagers, will stay with you for a while. This is a fact. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 stars. The Dog.
