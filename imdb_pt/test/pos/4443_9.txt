This initial film of the future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenus. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children in general. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to giallo movie fans? a newspaper reporter, an ineffective police officer, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mental retardant, a loner, and so on. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's. <br /> <br /> Unusual for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change of the most typical women at risk angle. The fact that they are children that are the target of the maniac only serves to make things a little more uncomfortable. Fulci is pushing the envelope a bit here and he goes even further in a gloriously scandalous unPC scene where a boy is subjected to the rather inadequate attention of a sexy nude young woman (Barbara Bouchet) that he is in charge of delivering a drink to. She shows herself openly and actively invites the young man to covet; finally asking if he wants to go to bed with her. Although she is clearly playing with him, it is still a rather unusual scene. Admittedly, there are one or two pieces of intentionally funny dialogue here, but it is very well photographed and Barbara Bouchet exudes high levels of confident sexual appeal. A highlight scene. Even if you feel a bit wrong in watching it! <br /> <br /> Together with Barbara Bouchet, the other prominent performance is Florinda Bolkan, who plays a madwoman who is accused of murdering the children. It is not directly responsible, but it is up to the viewer to decide whether or not their black magic may have triggered subsequent killing. Regardless, she is pursued by a crowd of lynchers and lashed by chains, while a car radio explodes rock music. This scene is very strong and unpleasant. His cruelty indicates the path that Fulci's career would follow later. <br /> <br /> Despite the visceral impact of the above murder, it may be somewhat surprising that the other killings are not bloody or committed off-screen. The only other death scene comparable to lynching is the killer's death at the end of the movie, although this sequence is kind of silly. The plot is complicated and full of false leads, although, personally, I found the identity of the killer a little predictable. This weakness is less problematic in subsequent views though ?? like most gialli, do not Torture A Duckling is eminently re-watchable. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is well done with stunning camera work, solid acting and effective music by Riz Ortolani? particularly good is a recurring unattended female vocal that seems to come from a distant hill. Fulci obviously went on to make horror films more graphically violent, but here he shows a talent for a slightly more contained material. It is still wild thing and is highly recommended for giallo movie fans.
