Why would this movie be so good, but would have an estimated $ 95,000,000 and would NOT have nominations for the prize? John Travolta knows what he's doing. He knows it's Michael, a magical, womanizer, cigar smoker who came to live with an agonizing lady and is now in a car with the National Mirror staff and his dog, Sparky, on their way to Chicago. Then it turns into a trip that is horrible and great. I do not even think the death scenes (3 to be exact) make it a tearjerker. The soundtrack is best with "Heaven Is My Home", "Up Around The Bend" and "Chains Of Fools". I have high expectations about this and I say I should have had a little more respect in the 90's. Read my comment. Goodbye!
