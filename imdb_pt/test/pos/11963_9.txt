In the 1980s, Steve Holland's Savage published three films, two of which classics of what appears to be a very small genre, absurd teen comedies. The third "How I Got Into College" does not compare to "Better Off Dead" and this, mainly because of the lack of John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong (except for a small participation). <br /> <br /> One Crazy Summer is an underrated film with many characterizations and gags. As I recall, Savage Steve's movies were vilified as being brain-dead at the time and after three movies he came on children's TV. We could use more movies of his tastes.
