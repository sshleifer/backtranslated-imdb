Continuing his return, John Travolta played a slightly distorted angel in "Michael." He may be a messenger from God, but he's not the coolest guy, as reporters Andie MacDowell and William Hurt discover. When I saw this movie for the first time, it was before I started watching "All in the Family", so I did not recognize Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now that I recognize her like this, I try to imagine Archie screaming at her for harboring an angel (whom he would probably rate alongside blacks, Jews, etc.). <br /> <br /> I know, this does not relate to the movie. But I just like to associate things in this way. Anyway, it's a very interesting film. Also starring Bob Hoskins, Teri Garr and Richard Schiff. <br /> <br /> What John and Paul said ...
