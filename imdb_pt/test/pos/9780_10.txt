After being captured and sent to Changi during World War II, I was hesitant to watch it when it was first shown on TV. My great-grandfather kept a diary while he was in captivity and when he died there his companions bought back and I was lucky enough to read it and feel that I have at least some idea of ​​what Changi really was, firsthand. This is a fantastic recount of what happened to those poor men who were sent to Changi prison and show what difficulties and cruelty they have witnessed to protect their country. It's a great story of fellowship, commitment and Australian spirit that will never give up attitude. It is worth watching if you like Australian History or anything to do with World War II. <br /> <br /> I really liked this mini and gave it 10 out of 10.
