By today's standards The DI can seem a bit cheesy. Lee Emery's version is more accurate. I graduated from training camp in Parris Island, SC, in 1964. Jim Moore is the closest to the real thing you could put on the screen in 1957. I can not comment on the plot, but I thought the ending was not realistic for the MCRD. PVT Owens is like many who find themselves in a much more difficult situation than he had hoped. Like so many, he joined the Marine Corps for all the wrong reasons. My Drill Intructors were more like GySgt Hartman than TSgt Jim Moore. A lot more. The DI is more Korean Era and Full Metal Jacket is more Vietnam Era. Today's movies allow this kind of thing onscreen. I have ID in my collection. I just found it recently on DVD.
