I do not think I've ever seen a movie in my entire life about a high school kid setting up their own college, just to impress their parents. Nowadays, movies are remakes or sequences, or graphics that have been used in many different films. This one has an original story line and to follow it, making it a comedy, just lights up the deal. With this well-thought-out story and mixed laughter, this is a good movie. Now I've seen better, but when going to the theater I was thinking of another drug / beer / brotherhood party with some sexual innuendo (also known as "American Pie" movie), but I was surprised. To summarize, I liked the movie and the next time you're flipping through the movie journal, look for times for "I accept". If you want to laugh out loud, that's it.
