After a very disappointing Part 3, I sort of wondered if I should worry about The Next Karate Kid while I could see why this saga would not continue, I still enjoyed The Next Karate Kid over the second and third Karate Kid movies. Although there are some very unrealistic moments and situations, it was very pleasant and the story is captivating and warm. <br /> <br /> Hilary Swank, this girl comes away or what? She plays a rebellious girl who lost her parents in a car accident and when Miaugi somehow "looks after" her by saying, he realizes she has karate skills. He offers you more lessons if she becomes more serious in life. Now, of course, there is the boy who likes her and the aggressors who are very similar to the first Karate Kid, but I would recommend that one. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> 7/10
