"Hell to Pay" is billed as the revival of the Western Classic ... it succeeds like a western genre film that the whole family can see and not unlike the movies the baby boomers experienced decades ago. The good ones are good and the bad ones are very bad! . Bo Svenson, Stella Stevens, Lee Majors, Andrew Prine (great in this movie) Tim Thomerson and James Drury are all great and it's fun to see them again. James Drury really shines in this, perhaps even better than his days as "The Virginian". In a way, "Hell To Pay" reminds me of those films in the '60s, where the actors you know from so many shows make an appearance. If you are a certain age, Buck Taylor, Peter Brown and Denny Miller and William Smith provide a "wow" factor because we rarely see these icons nowadays. "Hell To Pay" features screen captions along with new names in Hollywood. The most notable in the cast of "newbies" is Rachel Kimsey (Rebekah), who I've seen lately in "The Young and The Restless" and Kevin Kazakoff, who plays Kirby, a war-weary man who is torn between wanting to live and leave live or intervene to "do the right thing". William Gregory Lee is excellent as Chance, Kirby's mischievous brother and womanizer. Katie Keane plays Rachel, Rebekah's sister, a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive, but gave up her pride in the process. In a small but memorable role, Jeff Davis plays Mean Joe, a former Confederate with a poor record. I think we'll see more of these good actors in the future. "Hell To Pay" is a fun movie with a great story to tell? get the popcorn, we're going west!
