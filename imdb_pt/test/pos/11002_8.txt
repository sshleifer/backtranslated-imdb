In "The Squire of Gothos", Kirk and his team find a powerful super-being, who keeps the Captain, "Bones" and some captive crew for no apparent reason. I may be wrong, but I think this is the first episode of Star Trek I've ever seen and the program that made me hungry for more. It's not one of the best episodes, but the solid premise of an alien being that puts the Enterprise team in a corner is the kind of situation that makes the show a lot of fun to watch. In a sense, the super-humanoid anticipates one of the most famous characters in Star Trek, the enigmatic "Q" of the Next Generation. This episode is also memorable to create a unique situation: it is the first time that Uhura is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see what a captivating character Uhuara can be when the story allows. Too bad the show never fully exploited this iconic figure.
