Love and war took place on the other side of the iron curtain and, looking at it, love was as strong as in the West and war was more moving (must I say more realistic?). This film is as much about war and love as about the Soviet thaw of Mr. K.'s era. It also reminds us that the best war films were not necessarily made in the 1990s with hemoglobin and millions of dollars spent on special effects and actors traded. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic of Soviet cinema and a remarkable picture of one of the greatest human tragedies: war. <br /> <br />
