From 1996, I first watched this movie, I feel I never get to the end of my satisfaction, I feel I want to watch more and more so far, my god I do not believe it was ten years ago, and I can believe it I almost I remember every word in the dialogues. I love this movie and I love this novel, absolutely perfect. I love Willem Defoe, he has a strange voice to spell the words "black night" and I always say this for many times, I'm never bored. I love the music of Szararem, it is very spiritualistic, it made me enter into another world deep in my heart. Can anyone feel what I feel and someone could do the movie like that? I do not believe. Thank you Ondaatje thanks Mingela.
