I was expecting a good movie. What I got was an even better movie. The chemistry between James and Smith is simply incredible. Glad to see you in a great movie for the first time! <br /> <br /> The movie works because the actors play their parts perfectly. Will Smith is fantastic with his endless charm; Kevin James is hilarious, and Eva Mendes ... well, let's just say she plays this putative / sweet / annoying role to the best of her ability. <br /> <br /> What I loved about the movie was the fact that Will Smith did not even have to try to be nice. It just was !! The "date doctor" had all the right moves, said everything in the most perfect way, and never went beyond the top. <br /> <br /> The funny parts are hilarious ... and the cute and romantic pieces. are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this movie. And no, it's not a girl's movie.
