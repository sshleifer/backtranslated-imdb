In the 80's, in wrestling, the world was simple. Hulk Hogan would face Roddy Piper, or the friends of Bobby Heenan or Ted DiBiase and would win more often than ever. Occasionally he would have an ally like Randy Savage in 1988, but mostly it was about Hulk Hogan vs. Bobby Heenan, and that's how it should be. <br /> <br /> But on that night that was about to change, a new champion, a man WWE thought would be his man in the 90s, was crowned. Did not work. But the WWE was right about one thing: the Hulkamania was ready and a new order needed to be established. <br /> <br /> This historic Wrestlemania, the first to be held outside the United States, began with Rick Martel defeating Koko B Ware. . Koko has never had much luck at Wrestlemania and was knocked down shortly here. Next Colossal Connection Andre the Giant and Haku put their team titles on the line against Demolition Ax and Smash. and lost. New tag team champions crowned. <br /> <br /> The next match saw the earthquake defeating the Hercules. Hercules was another guy who did not have much luck at Wrestlemania. Good luck to Brutus Beefcake when he finished Mr. Perfect's undefeated streak. Well, I guess someone had to stop it. <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown fought for a double count in a slow but fun match, then Hart Foundation defeated Nikolai Volkov and Boris Zhukov in 19 seconds. It's not really a game, unfortunately. The barbarian defeated Tito Santana in a short match. <br /> <br /> The American dream of Dusty Rhodes and Saphire then defeated Male King Randy Savage and Queen Sherri in a confused mixed fight. This was the only female wrestling really going on in WWE right now. <br /> <br /> Next, it was a fun game as the Rockers Marty Janetty and Shawn Micheals defeated The Orient Express in a quick encounter. There were a lot of good tag teams at the moment. Jim Duggan then hit Dino Bravo in a game nothing. <br /> <br /> Then Ted DiBiase put his most wanted possession, the one million dollar Championship in line against Jake Roberts. Roberts was distracted by Virgil and counted on allowing Ted to keep his title in a fun match and one of the longest matches on the show. <br /> <br /> Then the Twin Towers collide as the Big Bossman defeats Akeem in summary Then Rick Rude wins a short game with Jimmy Snuka. <br /> <br /> We finally got to the main event with Hulk Hogan putting the WWE title on the line against Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior. This is a fun back-and-forth game won by the Warrior after Hogan lost a leg drop. The crowd was extraordinary and the match was a great spectacle. <br /> <br /> And then the torch was passed, but would the Ultimate Warrior be the Champ that the WWE expected it to be?
