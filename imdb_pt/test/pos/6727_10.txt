I saw this movie early one morning in the early 90's when I was 12 years old. I've been trying to find what it was and finally today I did! I remember liking it and being a bit scared at the end when it showed the boy's tombstone and his ghost face! Please someone could leave me not if I get a copy of this as I would like to see it again. I remember the boy being stuck in a tin mine and then befriending a boy. I can not remember that the kids were stuck there with the miners, but it must have been. The boy helps them out of the mine and turns out to be the ghost of a boy who died while working down there, I guess.
