This film was made shortly after Karen's death, that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty about how they might have contributed to their health problems. Over the years (almost 25 to be accurate), it must have been easier to deny any complicity. Richard spent the years after Karen's death remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin Mary, and from what I read, it looks like he might be planning a next generation of carpenters with his children. He seems to have regretted having made this movie, and may well be why he is unavailable in any way. It seemed to me to be a fairly honest assessment of the tragically short life and incredible talent that was Karen Carpenter.
