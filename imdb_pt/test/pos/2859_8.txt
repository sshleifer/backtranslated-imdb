Neil LaBute has a dramatic turn of his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller / comedy / road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her unlucky husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre type of amnesia and runs off in her car, unaware that there is a large stock of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the killers who follow her. <br /> <br /> What Betty is chasing, plus a fresh start (though she does not remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Only problem: Dr. David is not real, he's a novel character on the show 'A Reason To Love' and he's really an egocentric actor named George McCord. <br /> <br /> To say more about what develops It would be too much, but Nurse Betty is certainly original. His gunslingers are, like Pulp Fiction's henchmen, violent but philosophical, his view of novels, and his acting is the best feature of all. This has to be one of the best films in the cast in recent years. Renee Zellwegger is perfect for Nurse Betty, with the constant brilliance in her eyes that propels her in her quest. Morgan Freeman brings his constant state of grace to the role of an assassin at the end of his career, and Chris Rock is his partner, a man of rage and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is best comic as the vain actor / novelist doctor. There are also great supporting performances from actors such as Emmy-winning Allison Janney (The West Wing), Harriet Sansom Harris (Frasier Bebe Glazer agent) and Kathleen Wilhoite (Chloe on ER). In fact, the supporting cast is a Who's Who of actors of best television character. <br /> <br /> A unique movie that is funny at one time and creepy at the next, Nurse Betty is a mix of great acting, casting and a great screenplay.
