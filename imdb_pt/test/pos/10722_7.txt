Since 'Midnight Cowboy' I have been looking for movies with Dustin Hoffman and mostly I was not disappointed. Since 'Kramer vs. Kramer', I'm looking for movies with Meryl Streep and I did not disappoint myself. She gave a superb performance, really one of her best, in 'Sophie's Decision' and I got her involved in 'Out of Africa'. The fact that these two actors joined Kramer vs. Kramer more than 20 years ago was definitely a great idea: the result is an excellent character drama with a theme that is still very relevant in today's society. <br /> <br /> When you get divorced, everyone has a very bad time, even though the children seem to suffer more ?????? .. Beautifully led by Robert Benton in some original direction featuring some memorable scenes: even the passage takes on character and should be included in the cast! What about the breakfast scene with Billy (Justin Henry), just magnificent. Just how do you get an eight year old to act? Benton succeeded, and of course with Hoffman there seemed to be good electricity: the result is certainly engaging, captivating, and compelling. Justin Henry's performance must be among the best performances of 5 or 6 children of all time. The best thing, again, was the naturalness, there was no exaggeration, so frequent nowadays. <br /> <br /> This movie appeared again on the small screen the other night, although I have in my collection of videos for years: still worth watching and paying attention to everything. About 7Â½ of 10.
