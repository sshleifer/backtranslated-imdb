I've always liked animated ducks for some reason: Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Daffy Duck and Donald Duck. Although none of them are as disturbed as Duckman. Originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997, Duckman lasted a total of 70 episodes, but could easily have lasted forever without becoming obsolete. <br /> <br /> The title character is a disconcerted goofy, unrepentant and practically the worst living person in the world. world. He is a private detective, a widower, a peeping tone, an alcoholic, a sex maniac, a killer, a (fill in the blank). You named it, Duckman did it. But who can blame him for being so thin when the world in which he lives is so insane, outrageous and simply meaningless? Eric Tiberius Duckman (voiced by maniac Jason Alexander) could take the entire show alone, but when he's surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting characters, you know the problem is just waiting to explode at every opportunity. My favorite has to be Willibald Feivel Cornfed (or just Cornfed Pig), Duckman's incredibly unimpressive partner who is seemingly talented and highly skilled in everything and is perpetually oblivious to the infinity of addictions and incompetence of his partner. <br /> <br /> A typical plot will involve some bizarre affair that he will inevitably miss or will revolve around his highly dysfunctional home, though from time to time King Chicken (Tim Curry) Duckman's arch-nemesis, a species of Professor Moriarty in the form of a bird, shocks some diabolical scheme of revenge by being intimidated in the college. <br /> <br /> Since I was a teenager, this has been my favorite animation program, better than the Simpsons, the Family Guy and even the King of the Hill. Nothing will ever outweigh you. There has never been, or will be, anything like Duckman ever again. The level of satire, observational humor and writing is so sharp that it is deadly and the animation is done in this unique style of Klasky / Csupo (anyone who has seen Rugrats will understand). It's a wonderful, highly imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish feel of 1940. <br /> <br /> You can never have too much of this particular bird.
