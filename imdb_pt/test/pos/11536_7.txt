Jennifer Egan's novel was brought to the screen by Canadian director Adam Brooks in a film that, based on a few comments from contributors to this forum, sounds like a bad proposition, but in fact, it's much better than believed. <BR> This is a story about two sisters who loved each other very much. Faith, the fair-haired and carefree hippie, takes her younger sister, Phoebe, under her wing. Phoebe clearly loves Faith; when the eldest decides to follow her boyfriend Wolf to Europe on Berkley's summer vacation, she promises to send a postcard to Phoebe every day. Faith does this, until the cards stop arriving and one night, some time later, the family receives a phone call to inform them that Faith died in tragic circumstances. <br /> <br /> Phoebe can not forget Faith. That's why after a few years, she decides to follow the same path that the older sister took. She picks up Faith's letters and visits each place, starting in Amsterdam, then going to Paris and she wants to finish the trip in Portugal, where Faith met her premature death. In Paris, Phoebe stays with Wolf, who, by now, is no longer a hippie and is living with her girlfriend. Wolf tries to persuade Phoebe to abandon her journey and return home; She suspects that Wolf has the key to solving the mystery, and when she leaves for Portugal, she makes a discovery when she finds an image that clearly contradicts the Wolf version he told Phoebe. He feels guilty and, against the will of his girlfriend, decides to accompany Phoebe to the city where Faith died. The story changes at this point and we come back in flashbacks to what Faith experienced in Europe and what happened in her last days. <br /> <br /> The best thing about "The Invisible Circus" is the performances of the directors, something that Mr. Brooks has to take credit for. The big surprise is the reach of Cameron Diaz, who, like Faith, seems to choose pieces of light humor when she is able to do a good dramatic job under the right director. Jordana Brewster is seen as the eldest Phoebe and makes a wonderful contribution to the film. She is a stunning beauty with what seems to be a naturalness to act. Christopher Eccleston is Wolf and shows that he is also capable of making drama more serious. Sweet Camilla Belle plays the young Phoebe convincingly. Blythe Danner appears as the mother of the girls. <br /> <br /> European locations are gloriously photographed by Henry Braham. The film is also reinforced by the musical score of Nick Laird-Clowes and the original music of Petra Haden. Elizabeth Kling edited with great elegance. Ultimately, this movie shows Adam Brooks in great shape as he sets the right tone for the novel's adaptation and is rewarded for having the right cast doing wonders for him.
