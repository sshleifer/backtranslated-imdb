Frank Sinatra starred in this odd little short RKO that is now in the public domain. The film came out about the same time the war ended and is a good call for religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Sinatra singing on stage. After leaving the stage, he goes out into the alley and finds a group of children picking up another because of their religion. Instead of yelling at the boys (or helping them), Sinatra offers a good civic lesson on religious tolerance and equates prejudice with fascism. The children seem to have the lesson, but then, out of nowhere, Sinatra begins to sing a song that, frankly (understood?), The children would have hated. He had a lovely voice, but unfortunately I think this undermined the excellent message he gave children about tolerance. It's a case of a good message with a lot of singing - even if the guy who's singing is Frank Sinatra. It's also an interesting curiosity - a beautiful piece of history that is often overlooked ... moreover, it's quite touching, even if it seems a little weird.
