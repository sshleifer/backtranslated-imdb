This 1955 version of the Producers' Showcase of the musical Peter Pan with Mary Martin has the advantage of showing most of the original Broadway cast including Kathleen Nolan as Wendy who was a more natural actress than the girl hired for the series 1960. It's a shame that most people do not feel anything more black and white because in many ways this previous production - it does not even appear in IMDb listings when you put "Peter Pan" on the search engine! - is superior to the boldest color version that most people have seen. I got the original on the disc and then worked on it to make it look and sound better digitally. Now when I put the color version of 1960 it looks very gaudy in comparison. I suspect that Mary Martin herself undoubtedly preferred the original TV version of the Producers' Showcase of 1955 b / w. <br /> <br /> As a complement, the album I showed also showed the original commercials and the opening promotion. How far the 50s seem now - such innocent time compared to today. I miss it.
