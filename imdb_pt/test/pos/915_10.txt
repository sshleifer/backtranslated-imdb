Most of Kieslowski's movies look like jigsaw puzzles to me, designed to expand mind and soul. The characters are not very believable, they are idealized, they are schematic. However, the way Kieslowski presents his sinuous paths throughout life, his complicated interaction with others, with the universe, with chance or fate, makes me understand the faith, makes me (want) to believe in God. That at some point everything has a meaning, if not for me, then certainly for someone. <br /> <br /> Trois couleurs and especially "Rouge" comes closer to making me touch, feel, experience the "truth", the "meaning" than perhaps any of his other films. The only problem being that the paths of the "puzzles" explored are a bit similar to his other films and at some point they become somewhat predictable. There's still a lot of joy around here. It's like a familiar brand of wine - you know what to expect and delivery, sometimes with a newly found bouquet that may come from aging - be it wine or yourself.
