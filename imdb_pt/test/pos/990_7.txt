Although I am very familiar with the poet Dylan Thomas, I know nothing of his life. Whatever your life and specifically your marriage, I imagine that The Edge of Love manipulates things a little, but unless you're a historian or a poet, who cares. <br /> <br /> The film is less about Thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life. One is his wife Kathrine and the other is Vera, who was his first love. A romantic evening on the beach as young is something that both have tried to put behind them but can not, now grown up they are good friends. I forgot to mention that this is set during the war. Vera becomes engaged to Captain Will Killing, who gets pregnant and goes to war. While he is away, Vera begins to fall in love with Thomas again, and Kathrine loses the love for him. She is also carrying another man's son. Things get even more complex emotionally when Captain Killig returns. <br /> <br /> As you can see, it's a very novel plot, and takes shape in a slow and monotonous way, with perhaps many strings of nonsense. dialogue. But all is not lost yet. For a non-Hollywood production, I think Edge of Love is as stylish an image as possible. It is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary novels, Hollywood production or not. Part of this has to do with the posture during the war, which creates an emotional conflict that seems more convincing and less artificial, a bit like the Atonement. this one features acting and cinematography of equal talent for the nominee for Joe Wright's Oscar, but has a much greater need for steady pace and progression. Things are fine at the beginning and the end, but the middle section is where your attention can be tested unless you are deeply rooted in the story. <br /> <br /> I doubt The Edge of Love has such an effect on the viewer, but it's a good movie to check out. may even make a good movie for the night, considering it is a lot smarter than the girl movies that boyfriends are forced to endure today.
