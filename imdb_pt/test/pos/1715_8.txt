One of the most successful shows in television history is back. Now I admit that I never got to the original show ... Okay, so I never watched. But the new show is impressive. <br /> <br /> Sci-Fi debuted the first two episodes, "Rose" and "The End of the World", this weekend. We met Rose, a twenty-something clerk who is haunted by remote control mannequins. She is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls herself a doctor. Using the Internet, she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the doctor goes, death follows. When her nerdy boyfriend Mickey is replaced by an impostor, the Doctor informs him of a plan to use Earth as a fertile ground for more of these plastic monsters, which the Doctor has fought through space and time, traveling in a Tardis in disguise The police call it the box. <br /> <br /> She helps him save the world - there would be no other show otherwise - and decides to join him. But when he puts his life in danger, he is upset, and asks if her company would be worth the risk. <br /> <br /> Although the special effects are kind of lame, and some of the scenes are a little hectic, "Doctor Who" is (after two episodes on the air in the US) a clever and well written work. Apparently, the second season has already aired in the UK, so I foresee the same success here.
