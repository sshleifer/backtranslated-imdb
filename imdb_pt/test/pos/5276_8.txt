Okay, if this movie had been made much later in movie history, it would not be particularly interesting. However, in 1898, the films were in their infancy and they were almost all very upset and did not have a real story to tell - instead they just showed ordinary people doing everyday activities. If seen today, almost all of them are hopelessly boring and very, very short - often less than a minute long! And so, in light of that, this little clip from a movie is very good and can make you laugh. Two guys, a miller and a chimney sweeper hit each other - falling and throwing flour and coal dust on top of each other as they fight. That's all - the movie is over before you know it.
