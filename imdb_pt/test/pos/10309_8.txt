I saw the Bandit Queen in 2005, more than a decade after it was made amid a widespread controversy in India. Language, austere treatment and natural acting (by a relatively unknown cast at that time) may have been even more shocking to the Indian population more familiar with fantasy cinema. The film, the cast, and Shekhar Kapoor, deserve praise for the innovative effort. <br /> <br /> The plot is not much different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in India. In fact, there have been several fictional accounts of this story itself. The reason this stands out is that it is supposed to be a first-person account of someone who actually went through all this, and more that does not find place on the screen, and survived to tell the story. Survived enough to see his story turned into film at least. Phoolan Devi did not live long after being released from prison in 1994. <br /> <br /> The film scores in several respects. Cinematography is brilliant. Music is appropriate. The cast, many of whom have become more familiar names afterwards, is very good. But the script is patchy. Things go very fast and in idiots sometimes. It is understandable because there are many wires that need to be tied to make it cohesive. Or maybe I realized that because I read Mala Sen's book, which is a more detailed and better, though not as shocking, visual account of Phoolan Devi's difficulties, and which is supposed to be one of the main sources of the film. <br /> <br /> There are some factual ambiguities as well. According to Phoolan Devi, she was not present when the Behmai massacre happened, and despite claiming to be Phoolan's own dictum, she is shown to participate, and indeed to initiate the massacre. Then the final scene in which Phoolan surrenders the shows touching the Chief Minister's feet, while in reality she surrendered to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Only symbolic value, but it shows that Phoolan did not want to show servitude to a normal and alive person. It would have been good to show the chief minister some resemblance to Arjun Singh, who many remember was the CM of Madhya Pradesh at that time. <br /> <br /> But these are tiny gaps in this eminently well-made movie, a rare jewel out of the Indian film industry, made by a man who before was known as the best masala movie of the late 1980s - Mr. India.
