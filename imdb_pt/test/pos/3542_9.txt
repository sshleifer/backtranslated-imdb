What can I say? You expect that only the best BBC drama and MESSIAH will not be an exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> MESSIAH is a great suspense, a really shocking and scary tale about a serial killer that cuts through the languages ​​of the victims. and replaces them with silver spoons. Police officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of seemingly random events before more lives are lost. <br /> <br /> But be warned - despite the '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a gruesome movie. Some of the murder scenes are similar to those of SE7EN, and one or two may actually be agitated by the stomach. But if you can bear it, sit in your chair and enjoy yourself ... although you're probably on the edge of it or hiding behind it. <br /> <br /> Ranked as '15' by the BBFC for moderate violence and strong horror.
