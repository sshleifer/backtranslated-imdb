I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has something to blame, everyone is real. No cardboard heroes or cool characters, omnipotent and knowledgeable. <br /> <br /> I've read many onlookers here complaining about the morality of Anne and about James wanting to keep his love for her even though she's cheating on him but I do not agree. <br /> <br /> I found Anne (Emily Watson) absolutely wonderful and felt love for her. She was a strongly repressed woman, her actions were not planned: Once she began to break free, she was confused and made many mistakes. But so it is in real life, when you gain freedom, you are likely to make mistakes (especially at the starting point). <br /> <br /> Was she a little ungrateful? Perhaps. But we must remember that she is running with her feet for the first time. She knows that James, after all, is a good man, maybe a bit tough, serious, and work-centered; but she also feels the desire to live life as herself. <br /> <br /> Is she to blame more than him? I think not. <br /> <br /> But the upset that is happening in their lives brings about some changes. <br /> <br /> James instead of letting his wife get out of his life (as other viewers have suggested as the right choice) bites the bullet and waits, hoping for the best. He begins to understand that what he superficially was good at (his marriage) was actually a control game played by him on his wife. <br /> <br /> This is not a story with characters having emotional and precarious nature (ie, the usual Latin American clich√© or jealous Italians), this is a story of men and women who use the heart and the brain . <br /> <br /> It can be very painful, but if you really love a person (women or man) and if you are not a terribly unstable nature, you are likely to forgive him and let him go. Unless you are an envious, prehistoric, crime-prone, possessive, and mentally unstable individual. <br /> <br /> A really good movie. The last scene, when James - despite all the things that happened before - goes with Anne to the train station is really exciting: she is free and he understood what freedom means to a person. <br /> <br /> Guido
