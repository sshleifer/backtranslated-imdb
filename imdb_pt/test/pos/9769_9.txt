Apparently, this Australian film based on the novel of Nevil Shute exists in more than one way. Watch out for heavily cropped versions, sometimes shown on cable or satellite, running anywhere from 95 minutes to 2 hours. Only the full version of the 5-hour miniseries tells the story correctly. It is a very close realization of history, suffering only from editorial flaws commonly found in TV movies: harshness and episodic progression. But this excellent cast bears the story very well with the good production values ​​that accompany his work. Yuki Shimoda is notable as "Gunso Mifune", one of the guards assigned to accompany the women on their dying journey. In the end, he becomes a friend. You will agonize with him when his loss of face leads to death. Helen Morse as "Jean Paget", beautiful, but not a great beauty (she resembles Sigourney Weaver a little) records the right amount of courage and winsomeness as the occasion demands. The miniseries properly emphasizes the beautiful love stories, three of them: "Joe" and "Jean", "Noel" and "Jean", and "Jean" and Willstown. Gordon Jackson plays "Noel Strachan" attractively, but as a man a little younger than Nevil Shute indicated in the novel. The third love affair I mentioned is not given the proper emphasis, and the full meaning of the title is diminished. "Jean" is dedicated to the goal of bringing companies to Willstown that will attract young women and girls and their civilizing influence to this city abandoned by God. She wants to make "A Town Like Alice"; Alice Springs, that is. We only have a few tips on this in several scenes. If you have five hours to spare, this miniseries is a truly rewarding experience. Nevil Shute based her novel on the cruelty of the Japanese military in diverting a large group of women and children from one place to another on the Maylay Peninsula in a real occurrence. It happened in Sumatra, according to Shute, not on the peninsula. The "Joe" crucifixion by a Japanese officer for stealing chickens to feed the women is probably fiction, but the cruelty of the Japanese in dealing with prisoners is certainly a matter of record.
