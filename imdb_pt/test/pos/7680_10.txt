When I was a kid, my grandmother took me to see this movie. And I fell in love with it. I admired Dorothy Dandridge so much and wanted to be like her. I fell in love with Sidney Poitier. Pearl Bailey made me laugh. And Sammy Davis Jr. was as good as Sportin Life. The music was just inspired. When I had my first child and the movie came on TV, I let him see, and to this day he never forgot this movie. He loved it. I'll always remember Porgy and Bess. There 's a special place in my heart then and now. I really wish they would restore this movie because it was one of the best movies ever to have a "Black Cast" from all the stars.
