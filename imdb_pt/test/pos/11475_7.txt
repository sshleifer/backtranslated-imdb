Since picture 1, do you know that the good guy in the suit and tie is doomed ?? He has no luck ("Lucky Luck"), or he believes with that song on the radio of the car, and dubious talk with his best friend and partner of the company, which takes him to unknown places along a deserted road. Alberto just wanted to be alone, to make a flight out the next day with ?? well, someone we're guessing. <br /> <br /> Does the film go far? What are you going to do? to a final scene with the man listening to the same song in a taxi to the airport. In the meantime, several lucky people have found different ways out of the story, some dying, some born, some suffering anguishing anguish. This time he's really doomed? Or is he? The film is a sort of one-man show by director Fernando Fragata, who only left sound recording and special effects to other competent people. Those who typically reject Portuguese films because of poor sound and poor speech writing should look for other topics to criticize this time around. The car accident (this is not spoilers, the movie is very clever for this) contributes to a great scene, and apparently was done with cheap equipment. (US studios note: you can spare a dollar or two by hiding competent Portuguese directors!) <br /> <br /> The rest was done by Fragata, from script to dialogue, from camera work to editing. If part of the dialogue was improvised, he should be congratulated by the direction of acting and by the cast with mostly inexperienced actors. A large number of unspoken parts are credited, but most of these people were used for the video clip and for production, used extensively in the promotional trailer for the film. Does the cast have a dozen actors and actresses, of whom ten relevant people, and a large number of relationships? which are revealed step by step in an exciting and suspenseful way, reminding the best authors of the genre. 'Alfred Hitchcock' (qv) and 'Claude Chabrol' (qv) come to mind, by the game of cat and mouse between the director and his audience, and the nature of his characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this thriller and comedy for Portuguese speakers and if the film gets a decent translation of your colloquial dialogue, for anyone who likes these genres.
