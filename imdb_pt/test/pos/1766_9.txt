I was surprised, "Once More, My Darling," did not generate enough votes (at this point) for a "user rating". It's a "crazy" comedy that I have enjoyed many times over the years. Robert Montgomery's mission puts him in some very unlikely situations, and he's just the man for the job. It keeps its trademark "confusing" look throughout the movie and hysterically as well. Ann Blyth plays her precocious / eccentric pursuer, who assumes a relationship that does not exist. His character is crazy enough to deserve the nickname "killer," but remains cute and cuddly. <br /> <br /> Among the excesses of "B" films from the late 1940s and 1950s, "Once More, My Darling" is a highlight. This is worth looking for ....
