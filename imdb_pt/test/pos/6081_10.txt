A heartbreaking and deeply moving love story with powerful performances from Ralph Fiennes, Willem Defoe and Juliette Binoche. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a seriously burned man (Ralph Fiennes) who is expelled from an airplane during World War II and tells his nurse (Juliette Binoche) his story. Just before the war he fell in love with the beautiful Katherine Clifton (Kristen Scott Thomas) however she is married to Jeffery Clifton (Colin Firth) and the two begin a passionate and forbidden affair. <br /> <br /> A very scary and tragic story of love and desire against absolutely beautiful places in the desert. One must especially see if you are a fan of Anthony Minghellas work, but being prepared to shed a lot of tears is very moving especially in the end.
