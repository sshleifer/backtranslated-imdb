Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to his eyes with his mesmerizing epic "Alive," there was already legendary Mexican exploration director Ren√© Cardona, who used the same drama as his ambitious film "Survivors of the Andes." The unforgettable fatal flight of the Fairchild 571 crashed in the Argentine Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people were eventually rescued because of their strong will to survive and because they fed on the remains of their unfortunate fellow travelers. Of course you can not claim that this cheap and edited film is better than the 90's version, but I definitely appreciate and respect this movie more. After all, an exploration film requires far more opinions from both the cast and the crew, while the large-budget Marshall movie, though intense, looks more like the moneymaking routine. Sets and special effects of course can not compete with "Alive", but "Survivors ..." offers an equally impressive feeling of hopelessness and creates an even more frightening snow hell. Cardona's film is ambitious, surprisingly appealing and easily one of the most remarkable Mexican productions of all time. I'm really surprised that Cardona has this story no more exploratory and explicit. The scenes in which deceased passengers are opened and consumed are difficult to digest, but serve only to increase the credibility of the catastrophe and to emphasize the inhuman conditions of the survivors. Quite commendable by a vicious director who gained fame with his notoriously bad films like "The Night of the Bloody Monkeys" and the Holy series. The young unknown Mexican actors do a great job and the musical score is captivating. The story is well known, of course, so the script does not offer any unexpected shock. Whether it's history or Alive, you know what kind of dramas these people still have to endure before being rescued and you can only wait for them. Still, this is a good movie that should not be beat as is often the case.
