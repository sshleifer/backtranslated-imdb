"THE KING OF QUEENS", in my opinion, is a pure CBS success! Despite the fact that I have never seen all the episodes, I still really enjoy it. For this reason, it is difficult for me to tell which episode is my favorite. Even so, I must say that CBS really knows how to make a good sitcom. Before I finish, I would like to say that everyone always gives a good performance, the design of the production is spectacular, the costumes are well designed and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, if this show continues in syndication after it leaves CBS, I strongly recommend that you take it just in case it leaves the air forever.
