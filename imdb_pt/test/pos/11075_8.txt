Being from eastern Pennsylvania, right on the border of northern New Jersey, I still have the feeling that this was a documentary more than a movie. I have friends from New York and New Jersey and this movie represents the kind of lifestyle that "still" exists today in the low-income area outside the "Big City" lifestyle. If you have not seen this movie yet and wondered what REALLY happens in the urban jungle, check out this movie. There are no big names for actors, it's as if they just take these guys off the street and say "act," which increases the realism of the movie, however the performances are FANTASTIC! SEE THIS MOVIE!
