I'm sorry, but I just can not help it, I love watching the Iron Eagle. Now, do not get me wrong, I'm not saying this is a great movie. No, instead, I would say this is an endlessly entertaining movie. For the people who cut this movie to pieces for not being realistic, they are losing meaning. Of course the Iron Eagle plot was ridiculous. But I think your target audience was kids, and I'm sure I remember thinking it cool when I was little. Now I find it fun as a guilty pleasure, like Road House. This film is part of the great pantheon of the 80's, films of children who take the body of adults. You should remember D.A.R.Y.L, Real Genius, E.T., etc. If you ask me, just seeing Doug and Knotcher "Ride the Snake" at the beginning is worth the cost of the DVD. This entire sequence was so stupid! But at the same time, it was hilarious, funny, totally from the 80's, all these good things. So, bottom line, Iron Eagle is a great guilty pleasure of the '80s. Hairstyles, dance, music, dialogue, is all funny as hell. I have Iron Eagle on DVD and for me it was worth $ 9.99 at Best Buy. If you like to laugh at old-fashioned and unreal action movies, this is a must-see spectacle. Oh yeah, and I think his plot was just a little more stupid than another action photo of the 1986 fighter pilot, Top Gun.
