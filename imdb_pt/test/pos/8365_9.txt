I am a fan of Zhang Yimou and finally found this DVD title from the shelves of a Shenzhen bookstore after a long search in many places. <br /> <br /> This is a big change from the previous work of Zhang Yimou, esp in terms of style and locality. The director himself said that this is the first and only time he will attempt to make a comedy of black humor in contemporary China. You may even say that this work is experimental in nature compared to other large budgets and formal pieces. <br /> <br /> Filmed with a handheld camera and a wide-angle lens throughout the movie, the fast pace of editing and high energy performance and naturalistic tone never let you go once you grab it from the start. He presents a very realistic account of modern Chinese urban sensibilities, which in this case is set in Beijing. If you enjoy and love this kind of black humor, you will absolutely love this movie. Also look for hilarious appearances by Zhao Benshan (Happy Times) and director Zhang Yimou himself. One final point of note: I find the characters in this film, as in all other Zhang Yimou movies, exhibiting similar personality traits - stubbornness, always trying to beat the odds and raise the bet. Let me know your thoughts on this. <br /> <br /> David Lee
