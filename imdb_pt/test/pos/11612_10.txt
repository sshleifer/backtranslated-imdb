When you've waited years to see a movie you've heard about the vine over, obviously your expectations are high, right? But when that baby fell through my door, I did not know what visuals graced my TV and distorted my frail mind. First Karim Hussein is a movie fan as we all grow up with a diet of Argento / Fulci / lynch etc ..... and shows in this movie but in a good way. Although I really did not know what the hell was happening at my first notice of this jewel I was impressed with the visuals, the lighting and of course the performances of everyone who were involved in Karim must have believed that he would push the limits in filmmaking ( which I believe he would do) and that he would have a hard time convincing the actors to do the same ........ <br /> <br /> So, what can I tell you about "cruelty subconscious"? Well, without spoiling it ... it is a deep insight into the human psyche with images of violent and sexual madness that toil in madness ..... a truly unforgettable experience ..... .. < > keep an eye on Karim Hussein he can only go for better things ..... <br /> <br /> I have seen the complete uncut impression of subconscious cruelty on a double DVD disc of Inflation films that is loaded with extras ..... please note that there is a censored Hong Kong release out there, avoid this version.
