This is a great comedy, highlighting what it was like to live next to a racist fanatic. But it also shows that both main characters are really as bad as the others. Based on the ITV comedy, this is very politically incorrect. And it's all better for him, comedy after all is to entertain. The only real downsides is that there is not much of a plot. However, the cast is as big as usual. Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker form an incredible team, playing against each other in a different way. It's been many years since I've seen this movie and last week I finally got it on DVD. The fact that the movie still contains genuine moments of laughter means that I can recommend this movie as it would in 1970.
