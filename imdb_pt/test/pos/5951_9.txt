I loved this movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good parody of spies and who thinks Johnny English was an embarrassment. This is the movie that JE should have been. But it's based on a number of old French films so it's not really Bond related. <br /> <br /> The production is brilliant, you'll almost believe the film was shot in the 60's. It even has the same kind of pastel coloring film as there was in those days. Jean Dujardin does his part with the right amount of stupidity and naivety, not with pantomime nonsense like Rowan Atkinson. And even if you do not like the movie, you'll want to see it for Berenice Bejo. Ooh la la! She is the hottie ...
