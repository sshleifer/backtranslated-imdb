Time Di Uccidere (Time to Kill) by Guiliano Montaldo is a strange movie, but it's good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I will not worry about a plot summary. Most of what I read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who wrote this did not really get the picture. And you need to understand this on some level, even if you can not describe for yourself what it really is. This movie is strange in a form of "Once Upon a Time in America" ​​- just shorter. <br /> <br /> Many Hollywood stars (whatever that means ...) played in lesser-known Italian productions. It is well known that many actors who are past their peak or who slowly rise to it do so. Cage was not yet a real star when it was done. I'm not a fan of him. He is very good in some roles (Raising Arizona, Bringing Out the Dead) and weak when he plays the hero. I really do not know what to think of him in this movie, but he certainly does not portray the typical main character of the hero. This movie could have done without him, but the fact that he starred may be the only reason this has already come on DVD. <br /> <br /> The support cast is good. None of them look fake and they act like they're really there. Solid support. <br /> <br /> I've seen 3 Montaldo films (Marco Polo, Sacco & Vanzetti and this one) and I think he's one of the greatest directors of the time. Unfortunately, nobody knows him. This movie was his last in a long time (an interval of 19 years). I think this movie may have failed in the office, but by the way it was done, I think Montaldo was a personal project he really liked. <br /> <br /> The production is great. Always enough. The dusty army fields, the claustrophobic cities and the magnificent landscape play an important role. Everything seems very real. In some scenes, you almost feel the heat. The sound itself is nothing special, but the music of Ennio Morricone is very good. It's not a whistling piece when you're in the shower, but it sure works just fine. <br /> <br /> So, this movie looks, looks and sounds good. He does not serve the lessons learned from him on a gold platter, but that may be the biggest difference between Hollywood and the Euro-cinema all over. It may sound strange to give an 8 and not recommend it to people, but that's what I do. If you are looking for action; Avoid this one! If you're looking for a well done Apocalypse Now in a different time and scenario, but with a bit of similar journey in a "state of mind" (sorry if this sounds tacky but I do not know what else to call it) you just You may like this very much.
