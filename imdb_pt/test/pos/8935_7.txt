Only the British could make such a movie and have such good charm! Betty (Brenda Blethyn) wants something more from life, but she does not know what, when she realizes that she is in love with her childhood friend, Boris (Alfred Molina), owner of the local funeral home. Meanwhile, an American funeral agent (Christopher Walken) who "wants to put the fun back into funerals" is transferred to this small Welsh community with his assistant (Lee Evans) and wants to give a run to Boris for his funeral money flashy and themed. . (Star Trek play, anyone?) Brenda and Boris decide to stage Brenda's death and funeral, with hilarious results. A very nice film - if you're a fan of British comedies like "Waking Ned Devine", you'll love it.
