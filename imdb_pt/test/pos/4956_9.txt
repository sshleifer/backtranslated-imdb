Okay, yeah, it's bad, yeah, it's completely cute, yeah, it makes dobbin the mule look like an Oscar winner, but look at it as I was 13, special effects were not existent in 90% of the movies, back to good Ole days when the movies needed a plot .. Okay, so even the plot is a little dubious .. but wow I got into this movie as a kid in the 80s. Tacky rock, bad special effects, but airplanes an air fights and had queens a sight on the soundtrack .. see even the worst things have a silver lining .. all in all if you want a bad movie to show a 12 year old who hates computer effects (if there is such a movie) this is the ideal choice
