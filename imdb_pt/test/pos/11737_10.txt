Clich√© novel drama with very simple plot but very good cinematography and screenplay.The script, direction and acting was also good.The film flow is kind of manipulative in order to take the audience to tears through the excellent love music and circumstance that works, but later, after the movie, it makes someone feel raped in some way. Jones makes his character very memorable and adorable. A deeper story could have taken this movie to a higher level, but still, the film is generic. for desperate romantics, big love story fans, big soap opera fans, 50's Cinemascope filmmakers and fans of the major actors .....
