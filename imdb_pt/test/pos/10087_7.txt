Another Asian horror movie filled with intense and scary moments. Another hallmark of Asian horror is the complexity of the plot, which is here as well. MAJOR SPOILER WARNING! <br /> <br /> The film begins very simple - two sisters will live with the father and the stepmother after being placed in a mental institution after the mother has hanged herself. The sisters seem very hostile to their mother - especially the oldest - and seem to ignore their father. Everything goes well until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the big sister tells her father. Then it hits you, "your sister has been dead for years" It turns out that the older sister is still not recovered from the death of her mother and what we did not know is that the wardrobe that the mother was hanged fell on her The younger sister also killed her. As for her stepmother, she is the older sister's alter ego - revealed when the stepmother (actually, sister's alter ego) is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother comes in! I hope it has become clear to the confused Asian horror fans out there. <br /> <br /> Finally - my favorite scene is the scene in which the father invites friends to dinner and one of the friends begins to choke and a panic attack erupts. Very scary! 7 of 10
