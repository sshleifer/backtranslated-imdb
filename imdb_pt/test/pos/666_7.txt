This special BRASS EYE PAEDO-GEDDON was flooded with complaints (more about it later) when it was broadcast in 2001 after a national debate over a possible "Sarah's law" after the kidnapping and murder of the Sarah Payne school girl. In fact, the timeline was delayed while Phil Collins received legal advice after he discovered that he had been tricked by program creator Chris Morris in an initial campaign titled Nonce-sense. <br /> <br /> If the truth is said that this show is probably more remembered by the controversy than content that is in very bad taste, but I confess I laughed out loud. The issue revolves around pedophiles and how society treats them and their victims. Chris Morris plays the host who tells the audience that an infamous pedophile has been thrown into space and confesses that an eight-year-old child was accidentally placed in the capsule along with the pedophile. Cue the frightened cries of the child. As I said very bad taste <br /> <br /> Other highlights of the show include Dr Fox giving a scientific lecture that pedophiles share a nervous system identical to the crab ("No one knows this but it is a scientific fact") Labor MP Barbara Follet giving a public notice about pedophiles putting their genitals while browsing the net and Kate Thornton warning viewers that pedophiles can send gas through the Internet that makes children vulnerable to sexual predators including a victim "Who was a child innocent shy and now has the sexuality of a sixty-year-old colonel. " Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a series of photos wondering if they are considered obscene. The photos included Barbie surrounded by a marriage aid and a composite photo with a boys' head, a dog body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to John Holmes. Hey, I never said that this show was tasteful, did I? <br /> <br /> It is impossible to mention PAEDO-GEDDON without the hypocritical fall that surrounded him where politicians, child organizations and police rushed to condemn the program for mocking a very serious subject. The show was in bad taste even though I laughed all the way, but it's a scathing satire. Perhaps critics should look long in the mirror, where a liberal elite allows condemned pedophile slime to roam the streets of Britain before criticizing a mere TV show for exacerbating tensions.
