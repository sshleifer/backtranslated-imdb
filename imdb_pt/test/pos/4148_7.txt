An interesting look at the experience of immigrants, told as a fable with some very strange images. <br /> <br /> I was drawn to this film because it speaks of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I wonder what my grandfather did at the time. Traveling in to provide ballast to the ships, I can not imagine that it was very comfortable, as shown in this movie. <br /> <br /> Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would say that these laws were stricter for those who came from the Mediterranean and from Africa. Immigrants had to be free of contagious diseases or hereditary diseases. In the film, we see physical and mental examinations, the latter because of the view that low intelligence is hereditary. Single women could not enter the country, assuming that they would become prostitutes, therefore, most married single men who are already in the country, as previously agreed, on Ellis Island before entry. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a British immigrant (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who manages to marry a poor Sicilian (Vincenzo Amato). He is trying to get his family to spend with a son who is mute and a mother (Aurora Quattrocchi) who is considered weak. She was fantastic on paper, by the way. <br /> <br /> You will also see the actor, Vincent Schiavelli, on his next appearance. I do not know if his last movie was released. He makes a matchmaker and is also very good. <br /> <br /> It was a strange but nice movie. It is not for everyone, as I imagine that those who have no interest in the experience of immigrants think it is rather slow.
