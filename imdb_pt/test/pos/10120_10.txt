I just got home after seeing "Radio". I do not see such an inspiring story for a long time. My kids are ages 8 to 5 and I would like to get them so they can "feel" the message like I did - you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are, do not judge them for their differences. . Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris both deserve the Oscar for the film. I do not know why we can not have more movies like this, rather than the junk that is served in the theaters on a daily basis.
