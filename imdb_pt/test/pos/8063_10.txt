Over the years, I have been very interested in the life of this teenager who has left such a deep and indelible mark on the world. My fascination was also born of fear, as in, this could happen again. <br /> <br /> And for the years that followed, yes, I fear that 'this' will continue to happen around us and of course it was 'happening' long before Anne. Is it clear that the so-called civilized society can transform itself or an innocent country / race / continent and murder citizens in cold blood with the most fragile excuses? I leave that question out there. At the beginning of the documentary, there is a statement about the leader Adolf Hitler in that the only profound fact about Hitler that is never mentioned is that he was democratically elected and all the atrocities committed were committed as a result of a complacent propaganda of poodle-press and advertisements of fear, repeatedly for a docile population. <br /> <br /> One of the atrocities was Anne Frank, who put a face to the fields of death by the miracle of the survival of his diary. Kenneth Brannagh does a wonderful job in commenting and interviewing, he has that rare gift of minimizing his own personality, allowing subjects to speak for themselves. Many new facts and people never before interviewed are brought to life in meticulous research, which I will not go into here because they add immensely to the reality and sadness of the film. /> Glenn Close reads the selections from the diary and her voice is perfect for the paper, it brings a naivety and freshness to the paper. <br /> <br /> Anne's old childhood friends are interviewed and her last days before her death are well recorded and witnessed along with her vibrant friends. personality. <br /> <br /> This is not to be missed. A wonderful and respectful film about the rarely seen Anne. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
