Despite the apparent structural resemblance to The Simpsons - a tall, fat father, a mother, 3 children, a pet, a typical suburban home, Family Guy is actually functional and stylistically opposed to the Simpsons. His avid (and sometimes very) use of cropped picks has been his main residence since the first season. While some hit the head (Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito in season 5 are hilarious), others are less successful, appearing as planned. And they can be annoying, especially when they do not advance the plot. (The pieces of Jesus are utterly bland and insulting.) The chemistry between Stewie and Brian Griffin lends itself to the sheer gold of comedy, so much so that Chris and Meg can only fulfill the role of the obligatory teens in their typical dysfunctional family. <br /> <br /> However, the feature film Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, is MINDNUMINGLY awful. Thank God it went straight to the DVD. Unlike strenuous comparisons with the perennial Simpsons, Seth Macfarlane's approach to Family Guy is really very different - it's much more politically incorrect, and incredibly, much more cheeky. The creator of Ren and Stimpy, John Kricfalusi, famously criticized the Family Guy for having "extremely low" graphic standards from the point of view of a cartoonist. I do not think it sounds that bad, the detailing and accuracy of some of the spoofs are successful. <br /> <br /> In short, a great series to go with a big bowl of smothered ranch sauce chips and butt jokes.
