Directed by the younger brother of the great director Leo McCarey, this is a good moment of the Three Stooges, nominated for the Oscars. Here the stooges are doctors called Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine and Dr. Howard. They are not the brightest doctors, but they get the benefit of the doubt as long as they look after duty and humanity. <br /> <br /> I liked that short. Not one of their best, but some moments are hilarious though. A joke repeated more than once works every time. The part where the hospital head is supposed to operate is great. To put it more, it would ruin some of the jokes, so you should see for yourself. Just another short fine from the Three Stooges.
