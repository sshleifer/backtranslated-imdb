This is one of the biggest documentaries I've ever seen along with "Dark Days". I've skated for maybe an hour my whole life, and I still love this movie. Peralta and his excellent editor captured the feeling and the atmosphere perfectly, helped in part with some incredible filming footage. Tony Alva is one of the coolest guys in existence. I love those sports socks striped to the knee, you rock Tony! <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a visual feast, but the soundtrack should be one of the best in history if you're into rock '70s. Buy the DVD, you will not regret it.
