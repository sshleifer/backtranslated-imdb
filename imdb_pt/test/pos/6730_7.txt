So after years and years I finally screened this movie! I was dying to see how this fit my memories. I remembered sharply the shots of the ghost boy running through the mine, then waiting behind two wooden planks crossed in the mine, just looking out with a pale white face. This single shot was probably the most chilling shot of my childhood, I remember chills running down my spine. Noting this now is obviously not scary, but rather subconsciously odd to see the same images again. If someone wants a copy, send me a private message. <br /> <br /> History itself is a very standard BCFF material. It is strange that the message is unclear this time - there is no such thing as true morality (except that "ghosts are here to help us" or "do not be prejudiced against ghosts!"). greed / capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine. However, a huge act of irresponsibility by the captain, encouraging the two children to really follow the vague implications of a ghost not only in a mine, but in a new mine hole, which is totally dangerous. The captain then encourages the children to descend a huge ladder into the mines simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too. It is also a bit strange that the ghost chooses the boy to help the imprisoned adults, not just help the arrested adults to go. Oh well.
