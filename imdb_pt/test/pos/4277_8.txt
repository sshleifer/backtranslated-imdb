My husband and I watched this last night ... It was wonderful ... For the first time he was wrong to guess ahead of time the end of suspense. He moved very quickly and the acting was superb .. I love Tom Wilkinson anyway. He never made a bad movie about me. The above description of his performance reaches the nail in the head ... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is incredible. We have just watched all the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the public. There is no doubt that I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get a few hours of full entertainment.
