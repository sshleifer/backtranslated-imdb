I had the honor tonight of seeing a screening of the movie "These Girls" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. Going to the movie, I knew very little about it and only had one chance because the plot of the movie seemed interesting. So when I entered the theater only a few hours ago, I wondered what the final verdict would be: "These girls" is the story about three best friends in a small town. Keira (Caroline Dhavernas) is the leader who basically does not know what to do with her life after high school, but her father continues to push her to college, something she does not want to do. Lisa (Holly Lewis) will go to a Christian school after summer. And finally, Glory (Amanda Walsh), who plans to spend her summer nanny. But this summer will be special, since everyone blackmails Keith Clark (David Boreanaz), the older tale they care for. Fun times and lots of laughs follow ?? <br /> <br /> I usually do not like movies like "These Girls", but there's something about this movie that I really liked. I think the quality I liked the most was that it looked pretty realistic. Three girls who want to explore their sexuality choose a handsome guy who lets them all fuck him just to be blackmailed by them later. It's a pretty funny tale about growth, friendship and sex, but even though it sounds very tacky I can see most of the movie going on in real life. <br /> <br /> The subject here is probably the main reason why this movie did not get a mainstream launch in the United States. All the girls in this movie must be under 18, if I remember correctly, two of them are 17 and one is 16. Now in the US, although the sex with minors occurs daily, many production companies or financiers do not fund such film because sexual content. This information was confirmed by director John Hazlett himself in Q & A after the film. What strikes me is that the sex scenes in this movie are not graphic and the nudity is small. Not to mention that all the actresses in this movie are over 18 years in real life. Go figure. <br /> <br /> What the movie does best is that it offers lots of laughter and very strong characters. I liked all the characters in this movie and each character seemed to have a "Now and Then" feature for them. The jokes were funny because they were cleverly written, not because they were dirty or over. Everything seemed to flow very well from both comedy and drama. The script was very strong. <br /> <br /> The acting was very good for the most part. I thought all three girls were great. Caroline Dhavernas, who also starred in one of the most underrated television series of all time "Wonderfalls" was simply fantastic; as well as Holly Lewis and Amanda Walsh, who also did a good job. David Boreanaz did a good job and looked like he was having fun while filming most of the scenes. The guy threw a pothead so it was funny to see him play that role. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of meeting John Hazlett tonight who seemed to be a really nice guy and was very grateful for the comments made on the film. I'm shocked that this movie has not gone anywhere. I think with a bit of marketing behind it, it could have taken off. Unfortunately, it will be one of those direct DVD movies that few will be happy to see. I think with the small budget that Mr. Hazlett had to work, the movie went well and I think he did a good job driving this little gem. <br /> <br /> For someone who usually hates teen sex comedies I can honestly, I really liked this movie. The character's development and witty script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and be entertaining. This is a great comedy because it has heart and courage. I know I'll buy this movie when it's released on DVD on May 16, 2006. If you're a fan of ripping stories, teen sex comedies or romantic comedies, be sure to check out this movie because it's one of the funniest movies of its kind to be released in years. <br /> <br /> MovieManMenzel's final rating for "These Girls" is 8/10.
