Everyone interested in Texas needs to have this DVD. It's just a good movie about real Texas with great scenes. It took a lot of Texans to do that right. Hollywood would never have done it. There are so many subtle things that Tubb put in the film and may not even have thought about it, but it does the show. <br /> <br /> The apparitions of guests are not seen as apparitions. Each star fits perfectly and does not distract from the film. Many of the guests mingle so perfectly that when the credits roll, you will return to the movie to find the character. The strait roll is dead, it could not have been done better in real life. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is completely different from the first one, it's a little "cheesy", but okay. Somehow, the plot works. The material "mushy" is like a special post-school, but it seems believable and natural. I've never heard anyone use the Sonny Pruitt line before, other than the places I grew up with. That was the icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Definitely a collectible, up there with Pure Country, Sugarland Express, Jr. Bonner, Texasville, The Last Picture Show, Giant and, of course, Hud. <br /> <br /> Gig'em Aggies '86
