I watched this episode many times because I did not understand how Prue died. That's what happened. Prue, Piper and Phoebe try to save their innocent, A Doctor, because Shax wants to kill him. Phoebe climbs to search the Book of Shadows as Prue and Piper protect their innocents. Shax appears while Phoebe is still upstairs, so Shax throws a ball of energy to the doctor, but Prue pushes him out of the way and Prue is hit in the chest with him and hits the wall, the same with Piper. Then Phoebe descends and says the spell, since it was Phoebe who said this and not the power of three Shax that was only hurt. Phoebes calls Leo to heal Piper and Prue. Then Leo heals them. Phoebe went into the underworld to find Cole while Prue and Piper are looking for Shax on the streets. Piper and Prue see Shax and Piper using their power to blow up Shax, meanwhile, a new reporter has put it all on tape. So it's all new about the three mighty Halliwell sisters, while Phoebe does not know anything, because she's still in the Underworld. There are Repoters and people all over the Halliwell home. Then a maniac enters the house and says "Can I be part of your Coven?" and Prue says "No, this is our house out of here!" and Prue uses her powers to drive her out. As the maniac leaves the house crying saying "There are Mean Witches". The maniac gets so crazy that she shoots Piper through the stomach. Prue gets in her car and trays to go to the hospital, but people will not let her through, so Prue uses her powers to get people out of the way, making people want to kill her more. They arrived at the hospital, but Piper could not. While Phoebe is in the underworld. Phoebe discovers that they have been exposed, so Phoebe asks Cole to ask the source if he can reverse the time. Source says he'll only reverse time if Phoebe promises to stay here in the underworld, so Cole told Phoebe what the source told him. Phoebe says, "What would make you think I'd make a deal like that?" and then Cole says, "Then you can save one of your sisters' lives." Leo goes to the hospital to find Piper is really dead, so he tells Phoebe that it's true. So Phoebe agrees to stay just if Cole comes back to warn Piper and Prue about Piper's developer and death. Back at the hospital, SWAT is about filming Prue, but the second one before time is rewound when they were in the manor with the doctor, but this time Phoebe was not there to call Leo to heal Prue and Piper, so the Doctor Enter the wall too. The doctor died and Prue too. But that's what I did not get, if Piper was thrown against the wall too, how come only Prue died? Why did not they show Leo coming and healing Piper and Leo trying to cure Prue? If you know the answer, send me an email to angelpuss924@yahoo.com PS. I miss Prue, but I also like Paige and I'm glad the show has continued
