After clearing Dodge City (with a little help from Wyatt Earp) Bat Masterson goes to Liberal, Kansas, where they have a nice little war of outreach. In addition, a very interesting scheme of partnership. <br /> Randolph Scott is Bat Masterson and he is behind the villains Billy House and Steve Brodie who are driving out the owners of their farms. The landlords who are expelling are in a partnership scheme funded by Robert Ryan. It seems that he is betting the various farmers on a parcel of land to appropriate a percentage of his crop's profit. Ryan is about to lose his shirt as a result of all the pranks. <br /> <br /> As played by Scott, Bat Masterson is a Western hero who has a passion for going east and becoming a reporter that we all know he did later in life. <br /> <br /> Anne Jeffreys and Madge Meredith are involved in a romantic subplot involving Brodie and Ryan, which is a little silly and detracts from the action. Anne Jeffreys really sings well. <br /> <br /> Of course Gabby Hayes, as always, provides the great comic relief. <br /> <br /> A good addition to the Randolph Scott collection of westerns. Also interesting because his latest western movies do not have him as white as a hat here. <br /> <br /> This review is dedicated to Kasey Hayes, of the Professional Bull Riders, who is a proud resident of Liberal. , Kansas, a city with a great tradition, whether Bat Masterson bundled there or not.
