The title of my summary pretty much covers my comment. <br /> <br /> This is for me what the Teenage Turtle Ninjas were for someone 5 years older. While I lost that little wave of pop culture, I hugged the line of toys and TV series that was Mighty Max with both arms. <br /> <br /> Do you want to know how I was at it? I was like Mighty Max for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Thank God for the internet. Thanks to Demonoid, last week I was able to watch this great show from my childhood for the first time in over a decade. <br /> <br /> I'm seeing this now, having just been surprised to recognize Rob Paulson of Animaniacs, and I'm also loving the celebrity mood in "Tar Wars." 4 minutes, and they already mentioned, by name: Clint Eastwood, Governor Arnold, Dustin Hoffman, John Wayne, and Ace Ventura. Hell yes. <br /> <br /> Damn, it's only when I write this that I realize there is NO HELL, I can give this series no less than a perfect result. Any imperfections were lost in the fog of time. <br /> <br /> This is my childhood. That's Awesomeness. This is the Almighty.
