There is a good race on the price of a silk sweater. The silly one in the office shows the bargain she got for $ 22 (close up of tag). Later, Mary Astor finds the etiquette in the boss's room (evidence that Baba slept with him). Even later, Mary Astor is about to have an affair with Ricardo Cortez, looks at the price of her silk sweater ($ 14) and remembers how disgusted she was with the bimbo, as well as the fact that she spent $ 8 unless the "most obvious" woman she's ever met. It seems an obvious morality, but it was well made. The film would be stronger if Robert Ames's character had been played by a more powerful actor (he is very discreet to a home-based salesman and spends most of the film with his face turned away from the camera), and if Ricardo Cortez had received more than smile ironically. Both male protagonists are insipid and forgettable, and are hampered by the male pancake makeup so popular in this film's era. However, the character of Mary Astor is interesting, attractive and believable. Behind closed doors is worth seeing.
