James Cagney, extortor and heeler of the political wing, becomes a Deputy Commissioner of Corrections and visits a boys' reform school. The problem is that Cagney is not involved in the graft, he really wants to make a difference in the children's lives there because he comes from a background like theirs. <br /> <br /> The villain of the play is Dudley Digges, who is a graft chiseler and a hypocrite hypocrite. One of the subtexts of the plot of The Prefect of Hell is that these children are mostly immigrants and those who judge them and are in positions of power are those who have been here for generations. Note in the diner scene as Digges offers a prayer of thanks for the food they are about to receive, Digges is eating well but the kids are getting quality that you would not feed your pet. <br /> <br /> Cagney has his own problems back in town with some of his henchmen and he has to get him across. This puts Digges back in charge and riding the movie to its climax. <br /> <br /> The Mayor of Hell was a typical working class studio product. And because it was pre-code it gets pretty awful at times. A later version of that, Crime School, with Humphrey Bogart and the Dead End Kids, was a more sanitized remake. <br /> <br /> Although Cagney is well in the leading role, as well as Madge Evans, the school nurse, the acting honors go to Dudley Digges. Hard to believe the same man could portray the drunken but gentle, one-legged surgeon in Mutiny on the Bounty. But Digges is a good player and a joy to watch in every movie he's in. <br /> <br /> This movie is not often shown because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it portrays. A large number of minorities would be offended today. Still, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, a few years ago, the movie Sleepers came out and touched on some of the same problems. I think films about retirement schools do not change in a moment.
