This movie was the second movie I saw in the movies as a child. It scared the life out of me. So much so that I asked my father to get out of the way. <br /> <br /> Today, the only people who come out in half are those who have good taste in movies. <br /> <br /> I, however, still have fond memories of this imperfect masterpiece of horror. Doug McClure and Peter Cushing in the same movie! Great! Monsters made of substitute polypropylene. Scary stuff. A rubber monster is, when you think about it, it's even scarier than a real monster. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing about this movie is how good the score is. Really exciting things. <br /> <br /> There are also many prehistoric scenes on display. Nice.
