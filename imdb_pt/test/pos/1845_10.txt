I must admit I could not see this movie in the movies. As it was released early in a successful summer season, this cute little movie could not help but get a little lost in the shadow of multimillion-dollar special effects movies, could it? "Return to Me" has a beautiful and simple story at its core, and is extremely well directed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who has been in several important photos as actress herself .... together with that!). A charming story is beautifully woven with a clever comedy brought to life with superb performances from veteran and young actors. <br /> <br /> For those who say that David Duchovny did not stand a good chance of breaking his "Fox Mulder" cast, I agree. I've seen his other film work, and it's by far the best thing he could have done for himself. Minnie Driver is simply beautiful, charming, funny and lively in her role as Grace. <br /> <br /> Out of these two tracks, however, you are surrounded by Grace's family and close friends. Jim Belushi is an absolute point, Bonnie Hunt is a stable and real force. I can not, however, go without mentioning the talents of Robert Loggia and the beloved decreed Carroll O'Connor. Ironically, I watched this movie again on DVD just a day before I passed away. This was his last film, and he gave a performance that an actor of his caliber could certainly boast of leaving as the end of a great career. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Return To Me" turned what would have still been just a fun love story, and grew into a movie that became one of my favorites! Take the time to rent this one ..... it's worth the effort!
