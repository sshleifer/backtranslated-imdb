One of the best "kitchen sinks". Fantastic views of London and invaluable excerpts from working-class life of the 60's. Loach's eye seems to capture everything but makes no judgment - a taste of things to come. As with 'Kes', 'Riff-raff' and 'Sweet Sixteen', serves as a social film history of Britain. Carol White is completely convincing, you love her, fantasy, you want to take care of her, but keep your head on your self-destructive decisions and still follow her in some vain hope. Well supported by Terence Stamp, (fresh off 'The Collector', also catching 'The Hit') and a plethora of English faces (all looking very young). Perfectly set to sweet Donovan tones. Stamp sings 'Yellow is the color' in a beautiful scene, ending with him saying, "Getting better, it's not me" (music also used in 'The Rules of Attraction' - I think) Watch Carol Whites mother screen getting ready for 'go out and get a guy', putting his fake eyelashes to the sound of 'Rosie' on the radio - invaluable. A treasure for those around the time and a reminder of how good life is now in England. Incidentally, Soderburgh used clips of 'Poor Cow' in 'The Limey'.
