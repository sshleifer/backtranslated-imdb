Dude, I've never laughed much this year, and it's very hard to make me laugh. While I was waiting for some Hostel-style movie, the smile came to me from the start. This movie inside a movie shows a "victim" stabbed by a female, messing around the whole scene until finally "dying". His exaggeration leaves the director crazy and his funny reaction tells us, viewers, that Mute Witness is not a typical horror movie. <br /> <br /> The main character, the mute American makeup artist Billy Hughes, is played. by the beautiful and talented Russian actress Marina Zudina. His performance is of a high level; your character can not speak, then the body language and emotions on your face must compensate. And, oh boy, she did a wonderful job. His sister (Fay Ripley) is the girlfriend or the bride or wife of the "film director" (Evan Richards). Both were very funny most of the time. I will not ruin it anymore, but the scenes that follow the moment of the bath, with the two, the fake cops and later the furious neighbor were a brilliant black comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot gets distorted near the end, possibly misleading at a particular time. But do not worry. Such a delightful film can be seen in family or with your boy / girl / friend.
