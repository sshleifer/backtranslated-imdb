Erika Kohut is a woman with deep sexual problems. At the beginning of the movie, we see her coming home late. When her older mother protests, Erika enters into a frenzy, attacking the older woman mercilessly. Erika, as you can see, is a renowned music teacher at the conservatory where she teaches. When we see her next, she is the model of composure, but she shows a cruel side in the way she attacks a young student because she feels she is wasting her time and hers. The same goes for insecure Anna, a talented girl Erika hates, perhaps because she sees in the young woman a promise she's unwilling to promote. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, we watch Erika enter an amusement area and head to one of the huts where pornographic material is displayed. Erika becomes paralyzed as she watches the things being performed on the screen. On another occasion, Erika arrives at a drive-in where a movie is in progress. Her attention goes to a parked car in which two lovers are doing a sexual act. The camera remains in Erika while she is lost in reveries observing what the two lovers are doing, until she is surprised by the young man inside the car. When a wealthy couple invites Erika to perform at a recital in her opulent home, she meets an anxious young man, Walter, who is related to the hosts. Walter is immediately taken with Erika's joke; the young man is a talented pianist. Her eagerness to praise Erika is met with skepticism on her part. Walter decides to take a test for Erika's master master, and is accepted. So begins Walter's pursuit of Erika, who is taken by surprise when she realizes what the boy's motives really are. Erika, for her part, begins to fantasize about Walter in a way that only her mind could imagine, imagining what she wanted to do when and if they met. Walter is turned off by the letter Erika wrote him, detailing sexual acts that are disgusting to the young man. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie reminded us of the last sequence of Haneke's current "Cache". . We are taken to a concert hall where Erika will perform. She is seen peering into the lobby looking for Walter's arrival, who enters the corridor without noticing it. Erika's expression for the camera reveals much more of her mood in the last minutes of the film. As she flees from the lobby after inflicting a wound on herself, the camera abandons her and focuses on the facade of the building that appears to be onscreen for a long time. <br /> <br /> "La Pianiste" is a personal character. win for Isabelle Huppert. This magnificent actress makes one of her best screen appearances, guided by the hand of Michael Haneke, one of the most interesting directors working today. Huppert's works with economic gestures, however, she projects as much of her soul as she burns the screen with her Erika. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast works wonders under the director's direction. Annie Girardot, always excellent, is perfect as Erika's mother. She seems to be the key to what went wrong with her daughter. There is a touch of incest that is played with subtlety in the context of the film. Benoit Magimel is perfectly scaled up like Walter. This young actor does a wonderful job in the movie as the young man, so in love with a woman who is possessed by demons, that he will never be able to chase away or get her to love him in a normal way. Michael Haneke's films are always disturbing to watch, but they offer many rewards because he dares to go where other men do not. The magnificent music heard in the film is mainly from Schubert and Schumann, two composers who are Erika's favorites. The film is helped tremendously by the cinematography of Christian Berger.
