I've read all the adventures of Asterix and Obelix at least 5 times and I'm also a fan of "Les Nuls" and "Les Robins des Bois" and Jamel, so I expected a lot from this movie ... and I was finally satisfied. Unlike Asterix's first big-screen adaptation (Astérix et Obélix contre César), which was not a real success beyond the appearance of Laetitia Casta, it really captures the spirit of comics (and we have the beautiful Monica Bellucci). In the first film, the director tried to be too realistic about the time the story goes and killed the whole spirit that left Asterix hilarious. In this, all the clothes, the way of speaking and everything is identical to the work of Goscinny and Uderzo ... but, he really clings to the original story with the disadvantage of knowing everything that will happen, but Alain Chabat gave us some surprises in the end. I really enjoyed this movie, and every time the first sign of annoyance begins to appear, Jamel comes in and makes us laugh like crazy. This movie is a great mix of all the kind of humor I really like, and even if it's too much mixing, I can not help liking it. So, if you like Asterix and the humor of all those young talents that started in "Nulle part Ailleurs" (a French mix of the show tonight and the SNL), go see this movie.
