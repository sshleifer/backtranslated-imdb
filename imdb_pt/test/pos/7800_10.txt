This is my favorite Indian movie of all time. He's a comic genius. Salman Khan is hilarious. But Amir Khan steals the show with his spirited dialogue. Karisma Kapoor's clothes tell a story of their own - it makes you wonder if the designer deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the film funnier (at one point, it looks like she's wearing a diaper). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy movie that makes me laugh from the beginning to the end. There is not a moment of boredom, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves leave you with lots of laughter. I especially loved the scene where Amar (Amir Khan) "recovers his memory". I've seen this movie so many times that I've lost count. And I'm so happy to say that this time Bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic film as far as I know A.A.A is not a replica of a Hollywood movie (THANK GOD). Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who understands Hindi / Urdu and loves good comedy. <br /> <br /> Watch you'll love it !!!!!
