I saw Beyond Rangoon about 20 times, it was so good. In the beginning, when I watched, I saw the story of Laura Bowman, but then, after several screenings, I realized that it was also a side documentary. It came to my mind, a story about Aung San Suu Kyi and the struggles of women to remain strong in the face of uncertainty, danger and sadness. I would also put history and politics on the list after seeing more, since I learned a lot about Burma's past and present, and could only imagine its future. This movie is not just one that you will want to see, it is also one that you will definitely want to own a copy. It is a film that could easily be seen by the whole family, although not for children under thirteen. However, the educational benefits of this film can not and should not be underestimated.
