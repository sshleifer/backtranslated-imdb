FOUR FRIENDS was first announced on HBO in '82 as a hit. Having heard the term 'sleeper' at age 14, back then - I was eager to see one. (!) Boy - I was surprised! That movie! I really had not fallen in love with a special effects movie outside of the SIERRA MADRE - let alone a 'hippie movie' ... but having grown up with a couple of hippies - I understood the power behind mr. The Penn movie. FOUR FRIENDS is definitely unique. The script is so kind - and this cast !!! Craig Wasson sets Danilo Prozor SO GOOD! He just personifies the 'writer type' to a T-shirt - both clever and clumsy (the scene at the window ...) and strong, but very vulnerable. To me, he captures what it's like to be taken with an agirl that lasts more than a decade ... and I've always found solace in the character - and in the movie. Throughout the '80s FOUR FRIENDS was a partner in crime for me - and I got the movie whenever I could on HBO - even if I had to stay until 5 AM! And yet, always at the end - there is a sense of loss when all these wonderful characters separate from the viewers on the beach. Jodi Thelen personifies "that girl" to the maximum - it is so difficult not to be enchanted with her. This movie really is the test of time. From time to time I check my video ... or show a friend ... and still have a solid reaction. I know women who absolutely fall in love with Georgia! So many levels ..! Just an incredible piece of 60 years of humanity. Very special, very magical. I recently met Robert Grossbach's FOUR FRIENDS NOVELIZATION - and it's even more detailed than the movie! Actual dates of events, etc. A real find! And what's more - haha ​​- I found the novel while browsing a used bookstore ... in Omaha, NE of all places !!! I think you have to have an eye for it! When I was in LA at 92 working as an extra - I walked into a lil ruddy memorbilia shop - and there were a ton of photos of the movie !!! Unfortunately - I was broke and could not get in ... but man, those pictures from Georgia and the guys all together went straight for me! I met director Joe Sergant on the SKYLARK set in Emporia, KS in the summer of '92 ... and we talked about FOUR FRIENDS - pretty cool! Also ... working at a video store in Omaha in '98 - I waited for a woman who was related to Jim Metzler ..! I told her to get the word out that there was a boy in Omaha who was just fanatical about the movie - and had made the best of it. Once again - the film captures everything in the heart of Danilo's character ... great, great work - one of the most important efforts of mssrs Tesich and Penn. Steve Tesich is really missing. An incredible writer. "Isadora Duncan !!!" <br /> <br /> - C.
