Being a "fan of Wallace and Gromit", I was looking forward to this complete film. Surprisingly I saw him at the world premiere in Vlissingen (NL) at the Film by the Sea festival. A wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this very entertaining and joyful film. It's about Wallace and Gromit (which I believe do not need an introduction) to have their own pest control company in town that will host a giant vegetable contest in a few days. Everyone, including an eccentric Baroness, expect their carrot or giant melon to win the golden carrot. Unfortunately the town is plagued by many hungry rabbits. This is where W & G comes in. They have their own gadgets to control these cute creatures in a human way. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny and colorful story. Anyone who has enjoyed the three short films of W & G (which are more than great!), You'll love this complete movie. Nick Park really delivered a wonderful and original result with a great sense of humor. As in Chicken Run, it really amazes me how he can capture so many stories and emotions in just a few frames. "Work well done, boy" ;-) Oh yeah: The song was fantastic! It really completes the ride. Appreciate!
