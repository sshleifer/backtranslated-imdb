On the surface, COOLEY HIGH is a group comedy, disguised as a period piece (set in the early 60's, complete with an impeccable Motown soundtrack). But there's a lot more to this movie - it gets better every time I see it. The cast of unknowns (at the time) is excellent, and it's remarkable as a totally black movie that does not fit into any clich√© of Blaxpoitation - sometimes COOLEY HIGH almost looks like an up-to-date, urban, neo-realistic film Sometimes budget enough tight shows, but the restrictions really do serve the film - there is a courage and honesty of emotion here that lends to the film an immediacy that lacks in most similar minded movies (like Schultz 'later CAR WASH, which was more popular but largely useless) Heart-lukewarm but also true to life, this may be one of the 70's sleepers - celebrated at the time, it seems that few freaks movies know about this today. Your loss - this is a fine and good movie. <br /> <br /> The pan-and-scan DVD (without widescreen!?!) is a testament to how little this great movie mattered.
