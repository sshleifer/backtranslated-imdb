Firstly, I would like to say that I am only an amateur in commenting on films and that English is not my native language, but I felt a strong feeling compelling me to write about this film; possibly as a way to thank and congratulate C. Jay Cox, the cast and crew for such a brilliant production. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I watched "Latter Days" for the first time. <br /> <br /> At first I thought it might be similar to the movie "Priest", which I really enjoyed showing a gay priest out of the closet. But "Priest," perhaps because of his restricted Catholic ideological notions, did not meet the needs of my viewer by revealing a deep sad end. <br /> <br /> "Last Days", on the other hand, broke this concept (and some others as well, as the principles of Mormon); presenting a tender and joyful story, leading to a happy and emotional ending, and still awakening a feeling of God's blessing and hope. A great movie indeed! <br /> <br /> Somehow, the "Last Days" made me feel L-A like a city of angels. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys incredibly beautiful gay love stories!
