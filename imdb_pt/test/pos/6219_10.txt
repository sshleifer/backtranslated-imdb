This charming movie is based on a novel by Arto Paasilinna. The bestseller is one of the best books I have ever read. Here is the story: <br /> <br /> One day, journalist and photographer Kaarlo Vatanen decides to leave his past behind and begins a new life wandering through the forests and Finnish fields. With him, he has a companion, a young hare run over by a car. Vatanen has to take care of the hare because the leg is injured, so they start a journey together taking care of each other. <br /> <br /> In the course of their adventures they are almost shot by hunters, they are caught by the police, meet many people and finally reach Lapland, where they live peacefully, until a group of foreign tourists disturbs their privacy. The hare gets sick and must return to Helsinki to see the vet. <br /> <br /> Vatanen found an ideal way of life, but modern society tries to bind him to his duties and taxes. In Helsinki, Vatanen drank, labored, and imprisoned himself, but at last he and the hare fled.
