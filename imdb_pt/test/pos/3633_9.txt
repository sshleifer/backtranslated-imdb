Years ago I read the book 'The Machine'. As I re-read this little book over and over, I could never help being more and more fascinated by the writer's imagination and the richness of Brazilian culture. <br /> <br /> When I first heard of the movie, I was really scared of someone ruining one of my favorite books! Well, fortunately, my fears were not justified and the film is such a wonderful and delicate work of art. <br /> <br /> I do not remember any other movie that can bring tears to my eyes because of the beauty of the text. I also do not remember a performance as powerful as that of Gustavo Falc√£o. <br /> <br /> You can see and feel how colossal your love for Karina is. You may realize that he will move mountains and do anything for that love. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, watch through the eyes of the boy who lives inside you, enchant!
