Skenbart takes place in the 1940s, shortly after World War II. The main character Gunnar (Gustav Hammarsten) leaves the job to have the chance to "make a difference" in post-war Europe bombed. He takes a book from his favorite philosopher, Ludwig Witgenstein, and embarks on a journey that will eventually prove Witgenstein's famous statement: nothing is as it seems. <br /> <br /> There are two main plots and several subplots for this movie, which happens on a train bound for Berlin. Writer / director Peter Dalle (also acting as the conductor of the train) has assembled an impressive cast including Swedish legends Lena Nyman, Gösta Ekman and Robert Gustafsson. Overall, the acting is excellent. <br/> <br/> <br/> Skenbart offers a distorted comedy comedy combined with a more subtle black humor (like the nun who loses her faith and starts cursing violently). It's as if Killinggänget knew Peter Jackson (Braindead, Bad Taste) on Schindler's list. I laughed for most of the movie, and when I woke up the next morning, I laughed even more. A clever film for Swedish comedy fans.
