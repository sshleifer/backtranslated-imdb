The notion of marital fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today, but it is exactly the adherence of the main characters to this notion that makes the whole story so touchingly tragic. It is this notion that ennobles them and allows them to stand out, as they refer to their respective spouses, "not be like them." <br /> <br /> As Tony Leung said in the film, love simply happens. . There does not need to be a rational explanation of how this happens, it just happens. Although they did not want to lower themselves to the level of their respective spouses, it happened. Fidelity, social mores and timing conspired to make this relationship come true. Just being in love is far from enough. <br /> <br /> I had the misfortune to sit next to a young couple (still at university from the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the movie, and not started to the pains of lost love and opportunity lost). His gross inability to digest subtlety and the deeper emotions evoked made me realize how much a film like this, like the work of Wong Kar Wei, is wasted on local audiences.
