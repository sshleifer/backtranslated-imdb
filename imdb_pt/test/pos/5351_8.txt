That was very good, except for two things that I will mention in the end. The animation is great, highlighted by Nick Park and the company's trademark exaggerated teeth and mouths that make you laugh almost every time you see someone. The color was also magnificent. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film, however, is the clever comedy woven everywhere. This is another of those animated films in which there is so much to see and hear every frame that would require many previews to catch all the jokes. It's just an exaggerated funny look at the eccentric "Wallace" and his quiet, intelligent dog "Gromit." Along the way, he nudges fun people who get carried away with their vegetable gardens, something akin to how obsessive dog lovers were portrayed in the "Best Of Show." <br /> <br /> My only complaints were two typical features of today's movies, animated or not: 1 - let's make the clergyman in the movie look like a total idiot; 2 - Let's exaggerate the final action scene with predictable but overestimated outcome. Leaving aside, this is still a very fun movie that should provide lots of laughs for many people and a movie to have fun over and over again.
