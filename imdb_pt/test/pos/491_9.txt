hi <br /> <br /> Blade is a sensational action movie. the hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain did justice to their roles. <br /> <br /> The movie's action sequences are better than the Matrix! <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes is one of the best action heroes of all time. <br /> <br /> If you like action / vampire movies, this is ONE. <br /> <br /> The theme is very good considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made before. But these are the best of them. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the ride.
