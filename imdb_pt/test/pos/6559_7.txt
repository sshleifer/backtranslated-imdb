<br /> <br /> Time for the horror movie, Japanese style. Uzumaki / Spiral was a total freakfest from start to finish. A fun freakfest in that, but sometimes it was a bit too dependent on kitsch rather than horror. The story is difficult to succinctly summarize: a carefree, normal teenager begins to come face-to-face with extremely disturbing events as the small town she lives in seems to be under the control of spirals. The spirals are everywhere, in the air, clouds, dirt and everyday objects. Spirals take control of people and bad things will happen to them. Oh, another thing, people are turning randomly into snails. Because? Who knows or cares, people are turning into snails, that's enough for me. This was not as scary as it was scary, as it did not have much suspense or shocking attacks, as horror movies often do. Uzumaki prefers to crawl and crawl (as a snail can!) Instead of shaking. A favorite scene: a woman lies asleep in a hospital room when this one-legged centipede creature makes its way into the room and climbs slowly to the bed, across the sheets, covering the pillow and sleeping ear. I cringed and curled my toes. Uzumaki has a handful of really violent scenes, but they're also funny. For example, a man is obsessed with spirals, he enters his washer because he sees a spiral in it when he spins, commits suicide spiraling into the washer. The last shot we see of him is with his whole rolled up rubber body, a spiral of human flesh with a single engorged eye blinking in the middle of the washing machine. A bizarre image. Uzumaki has a blatant psychedelic approach, which adds to his charm and fun. I love horror movies like this. It's not about killing, horror movies, it's about a force of evil (the spirals!) Taking over you and trying to kill you, forcing you to kill others. Films like Uzumaki prove that there are many ways to make a horror movie and thank God for it
