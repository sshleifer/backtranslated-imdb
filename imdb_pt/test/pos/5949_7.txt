I saw the movement while in Paris in May 2006 ... I was debating between this and the impossible mission ... I am very happy to have chosen OSS 117 not only because it was funny but also could watch a FRench movie while I was in France. I had so much fun ... I recommend it. It's important to have some understanding of French society today to really appreciate the humor of this film ... I can not wait for the DVD to come out ... I do not know how some of the puns "jeu De mots" 'would translate into English I will certainly buy when You're out! Q. I saw in the 'Nice BRice', which is a movie starring Dujardin that all the kids were talking about in France. this movie is a comedy, but more stupid than you can imagine ... when comparing the two films, I have to say that Dujardin did a good job on OSS 117.
