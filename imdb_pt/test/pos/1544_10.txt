This is one of those American classics made for TV movies that are made just to watch on a rainy afternoon. Although the script is highly implausible, it never takes itself too seriously and neither does the cast that leads to a big tongue in Murder Mystery / Horror Movie Cheek is best appreciated with a bag of popcorn or box of chocolates. A great bonus from this movie is the fantastic location of the filming and despite the strange happenings and even stranger residents around Lake Tommahawk, I would not mind living there! <br /> <br /> All this is a great movie to watch. and again.
