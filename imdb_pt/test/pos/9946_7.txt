Four or five episodes of Johnnie Socko and his Flying Robot were edited together. Fun giant robot struggling against giant monsters tale aimed directly at children. Parents will naturally go wild, since the action is violent, with the robot / monsters battles reminding the professional wrestling and humans about human violence the kind of thing you'd find at the Al Capone Valentine's Day School and the Training Academy of Gangster. I liked that, but again I grew up in the series. If there is any problem, in addition to the variety of "men in suits" effects, the film is played as a series of episodes sewn together, with a climax coming up every 20 minutes. Recommended for those who ran out of Ultraman or Godzilla
