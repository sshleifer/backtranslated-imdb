This is an apocalyptic view of the hell of our contemporary world. The social critique of our superficial and commercial values ​​is what makes this film an exceptional view of the "war is hell" cliché, underscored by a mythical trip to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a devious colonel, who left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a masterpiece that failed. In particular, I thought the final stretch of the day with Brando, which encapsulates Conrad's Heart of Darkness, is pretty boring. I finally got to see Apocalypse Now Redux and the flaws were met. Redux makes the film a masterpiece, certainly among the top 100 films ever made. Brando's performance now seems complete and complete, perhaps a little less mysterious, but much deeper. Martin Sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best performing sets ever assembled. It's great to see a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. in initial screen performances that suggest that fine actors they will be recognized as. The work of Robert Duvall, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage. If you've never seen this movie, skip the original and go straight to Redux. I wish we could get a Gangs of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that potentially masterful flaw.
