Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli shows its wonderful touch animating, infusing life, in every little action of the characters in Ponyo. When Sosuke puts his little boat so carefully to reach the red fish, you know you're going to have fun watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are interesting and you really care about them. They visually remember other stories, Riisa looks like a Nausicaa grown up with a son, a wheelchair-bound old woman reminds the witch in Moving Castle of Howl. The presence of elements, wind, rain, and the sea with its large and powerful waves, is so strong that I think it has never been evoked in any other film. It is a simple story, vaguely inspired by the "little mermaid", and reaches the heart of the public, as well as Totoro, the true masterpiece of the other Miyazaki. <br /> <br /> An instant classic with a great soundtrack and captivating music during the final credits. Do not miss it.
