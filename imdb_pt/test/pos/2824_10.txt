OK, first, for all enemies: get a life! I do not see why you bother posting in those folders, when obviously you do not know anything about movies, robots or people. <br /> <br /> This film has important lessons for all of us to learn about gender, stereotypes, relationships and DESTINATION. Actually, we are all robots, programmed to respond to certain ways of certain stimuli without thinking. How many times have we seen a sunset and made some banal comment without even thinking about it? I say, THANK YOU Aqua (brilliantly played by Bernadette Peters) for making me stop and think about the incredible power of Mother Nature. <br /> <br /> It is only when Val and Aqua begin to reject their programming that they begin to understand their true desire - to find love and run away from the factory in search of a creative life. This movie should be mandatory in prisons - just think of the dreams and hopes that this could inspire in prisoners. maybe even they could overcome their "bad" programming and join us in a crime-free world. <br /> <br /> We can all learn a lot from these robots. I'm a better person for Heartbeeps.
