Again, government agencies do not stop at anything to prevent public awareness of some important events. In this case, the discovery of new underwater species that could threaten the planet's ecology. Although the creature is not E.T. he seems to be a friend of a young man, who protects him at all costs without realizing that he is just a child of the species and will get much bigger ?? and Evil This series of 2005 had a lot for this. It's family drama, sci-fi, thriller with more than a few comic moments. The characters are credible, well represented and well photographed. The show holds the attention. Of course, as in any science fiction program, the suspension of disbelief must be achieved. And I think it's here. Unfortunately, the series fell after the first season, so we never got a resolution. Enraging .. There is a general comment that I feel is worth doing here. Many TV networks and / or movie distribution companies cancel, quite arbitrarily, seemingly excellent TV series? particularly intelligent sci-fi. Now, there may be some good reasons for this, although audiences are treated with extreme disdain and rarely informed of the motives. That alone is annoying. What really makes my goat is that having canceled the series, they toss the thing as far as it is on DVD in an obvious attempt to milk the cash cow as far as possible. For previous viewers of the series, that's fine, they know what they're looking for, but ?? many of these unfinished series end in a moment of anguish. Two that come to mind immediately are "Surface" and "Odyssey 5". If you've heard of good things about the show and have not seen it, go buy the damn DVD and end up with an unresolved problem. This makes me very angry !! I liked "Surface" immensely and did not realize that the poor characters would end up in a situation that seemed totally unsustainable ?? and we will never know what happened next. I believe there must be a prominent warning about all these DVD issues in the sense that the story is unfinished. Nowadays I check the TV series purchases (the IMDB is an excellent obvious starting point) to find out if a 'complete' series is really complete or not. Buyer beware.
