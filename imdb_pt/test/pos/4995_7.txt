I think the consensus is very unanimous about this recent TV miniseries: it's okay, but it's a long way from "Lonesome Dove." It is compared to the latter simply because this is a prequel to that famous story. <br /> <br /> "Commanche Moon" is definitely a watch for any fan of westerns. Just do not expect it to be as intense as "Lonesome Dove". Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play are not as strong as the way Duvall and Jones played the same two guys. Some say it's unfair to criticize this movie because of the comparison, but you have to compare it - it's the story of the same two main Texas Ranger characters: "Woodrow Call" and "Gus McCrae." <br /> <br /> The main difference, I discovered, was that this prequel is much slower and more relational (the two Rangers and their women) sometimes. However, I did not care about this because the two main women were beautiful women and generally nice and nice people. They were well played by Linda Cardelini ("Clara Forsythe") and Elizabeth Banks ("Maggie"). They helped make this long film palatable. If you saw pictures of women in the Wild West, none of them looked as pretty as Cardelini and Banks. They were a joy to these male eyes to ogle. Maggie's son, "Newt," was also a wonderful kid - the kind of kid all parents would want to have. <br /> <br /> The most interesting character, I thought, was "Inish Scull", played by Val Kilmer. As in the Western movie, "Tombstone", Kilmer almost steals the show from the tracks. "Scull" is really an original, if I ever saw one: a strange guy, in fact. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the supporting actors here did a good job, from "Deets," from Keith Robinson to Wes Studi, to "Buffalo Hump." I always find Studi fascinating, no matter what role he plays. I wish he had played a bigger role in this miniseries. <br /> <br /> One thing that this film has in common with "Lonesome Dove" and other good westerns: scenery and photography. It's beautiful sometimes, and it's a joy to watch. We also have an excellent director of this film: Simon Wincer, who directed "Lonesome Dove" and another TV western, "Crossfire Trail". He also made two of my other favorite films, both based on his home country, Australia: "Phar Lap" and "Quigley Down Under." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although I did like it, "Commanche Moon" is not anything as good as the above mentioned movies. However, I still watched it all and regret it over, if that makes any sense. It made me want to watch Woodrow and Gus again, this time with Tommy Lee and Robert. <br /> <br /> Note: The title page says that this is 360 minutes. This must have included the TV commercials. The DVD version of two discs I saw was about 4 hours and 40 minutes.
