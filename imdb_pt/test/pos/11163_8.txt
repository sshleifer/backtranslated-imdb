He currently plays at the 2007 German Film Festival in Australia http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/ff07/enindex.htm, thanks to Peanutqueen and especially AriesGemini for his summary of the actors in this cast. In Australia, these films were subtitled in English, and although French films here always have a mainstream version, German films still need to bring together such commercial audiences. But like BMWs and Mercedes, when the Germans get it right, I really like their movies. Like PQ, the time here was so fast, many public laughter, each of the 9 men and 9 women moved to the speed dating line 5 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> While many movies are too long, I could have watched a lot more. He had the type of character and character development for a series. Over time I will reread AriesGemini100 review and reference the actors I liked and their other work, with a view to keeping an eye out for them. I agree ... most of these actors go to bigger and better things. Some very good actors in this movie. I saw in the program listed as a mockumentary. Mock or otherwise looked very real. And very romantic on your way. <br /> <br /> Live the Deutcsh!
