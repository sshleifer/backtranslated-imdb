Sorry for the "extremely clever" summary sentence. I do not know what I was thinking, but I really could not help it. <br /> <br /> I've been wanting to see 'Bloody Birthday' for a long time and I must say it was a nice surprise to find a copy of this movie by accident and for such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small South American village and it is very unlikely that this will happen. It's a shame that some of those 'jewels' of the 80's are almost completely forgotten. 'Bloody Birthday' is one of those movies that surprisingly grows old enough to stay watchable nowadays. Not a work of art, for sure, but still fun and guess what? ... You really do not have unintentional funny scenes. I know it's a shock if we keep in mind that this is a low-budget movie from the early 1980s about a bunch of evil kids who kill people. But trust me, the film can stay respectable and watchable most of the time. <br /> <br /> In 'Blood Birthday', the story revolves around three children born during a total eclipse. According to astrology, during the eclipses, the sun and moon block Saturn, which controls the emotions. As a consequence, the three children who were born that day become more and more indifferent. Once they experience no remorse, these 10-year-old boys join everyone in their path, including their own parents and siblings ... and they kill them! Body counts increase day by day and law enforcement officials believe there is a psychopath lurking on the spot. Meanwhile, Debbie, Curtis and Steven, do not hesitate to continue slaughtering people, since no one seems to suspect those sweet angel faces (?) As I was saying before, 'Bloody Birthday' Surprisingly not it is funny. I know I've said it before, but I'm really surprised by that. I was expecting some hilarious scenes, but the movie proved me wrong. True, that's not exactly what most people would consider a "serious" horror movie, but if I had to be fair I would say that the story is decently executed. One of the most important reasons why one would normally expect laughable situations (like me) is that in this type of movie where major villains are children, young actors tend to be horrible and make the whole thing ridiculous. Let's face it: kids tend to be horrible actors, which is understandable and we can not blame them for it. But to my surprise, the three young actors who played the ruthless killers in this movie seemed very disturbing and not at all funny. The rest of the actors are also good and if you are a fan of George Clooney, you can see your uncle playing a doctor in this movie. Yeah, I know right ... who cares? In addition, Julie Brown, the great actress, singer, comedian and gay icon, gives a solid performance as the older and disobedient sister and in case someone is interested in nudity: she also takes one of the scenes and gets very naked. Too bad she did not have more time on the screen! Julie is "absolutely fabulous": P <br /> <br /> So basically this movie is good if you're in the mood for some modest horror of the '80s. My only objection to' Bloody Birthday 'would be the way to justify the children's motives. This is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film. Let's see: if children who were born during an eclipse turn out to be heartless killers, then how come these three were the only ones who actually murdered people? I'm sure there were other children who were born the same day ... and during other days of total eclipse too, oh well!. Overall, no big deal, it's just a simple remark, that's all. I've seen worse, trust me. Take 'The Children' (1980), for example, in which the precocious killer gets his evil after being transformed into zombies by toxic cloud. No, believe me, 'Bloody Birthday' is much more decent and if you like simple slashers, you'll really like this one. <br /> <br /> So, now you know: you're invited to the children's birthday party ... and the hosts will be serving a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests. Come on, you can not miss it;)
