He saw the film at the closing party of the Ealing Film Festival in West London (England). We appreciated it immensely. Although Crow & the Chinese Policeman does not appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the author (screenwriter / director), dubbed / performed by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well. <br /> <br /> The rumor is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just one pint of beer. <br /> <br /> Spike was shown the movie, on video before he died and by all accounts liked it immensely.
