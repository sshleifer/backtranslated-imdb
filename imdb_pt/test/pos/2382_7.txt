Good job. That's how I would describe this Scooby-Doo animated adventure. This is so far the best of the animated Scooby movies I've seen. I enjoyed the story. I thought I had some depth to it. The film is also well paced.it do not get annoying for a minute.it also has an interesting group of characters (besides Scooby and Shaggy and their gang, of course) plus the movie was a real blast.I have lots of fun watching it . I also liked the great Scottish music. It was very captivating and contagious. Of course, we know that Scooby and Gamg will solve the mystery, but it's still fun to get to that point. The animation is also very good for this movie. love it if they did a 3D animation of Scooby Adventure, but we'll have to wait and see. For me, Scooby-Doo and the Loch Ness Monster is a 7/10
