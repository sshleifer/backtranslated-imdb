I first saw this on Thames television and I loved it. Subsequently, I saw a horrible article written by someone who certainly had not observed or listened to him. So I bought a copy and bought another copy! The only sad thing is that it is not available on PAL DVD VHS or Region 2. The Australian version is great, but this one is better! I could buy another .............
