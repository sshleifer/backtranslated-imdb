Captain Corelli's mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's best films. He does a good performance as the title character. This is a novel against the backdrop of a worn and worn island. The character of John Hurt gives his daughter, beautifully played by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie is not to blame for being completely predictable. This film also allows Cruz to become a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. When the film heats past the opening sequence, this movie keeps you focused on it. Again, Nicolas Cage did not disappoint.
