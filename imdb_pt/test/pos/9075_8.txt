My mother always told me to sit and watch this movie because it's one of her favorites, I've never done it for years until I caught a night on TV. This movie was great, I do not even know how to explain it. Not only is the cast excellent (Julia Roberts, Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin and Oliver Platt), but the story is incredible. It's weird, but not too scary and makes you think. I was speechless after this movie and I was amazed at how good actors and actresses all these five people really are. Where William Baldwin went, he's great. This movie is a must see for anyone, if you have not seen go and rent it, you will not regret it. Amazing!
