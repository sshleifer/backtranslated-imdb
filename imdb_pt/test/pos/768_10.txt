lovely. I just love the movie. I want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. His expressions are great, spectacular. the movie was excellent. Julie Walters was perfect too. I think Rupert is the only red-haired boy I love. Rupert has a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. I think the movie was great and it was great to see Rupert in something else, but Harry Potter. and he's a very good actor, so he deserves this and more. he only has one gold globe, but he probably deserves an Oscar. there are some actors who do not act very well but have an Oscar anyway. Does not matter. but he is perfect, bright and handsome
