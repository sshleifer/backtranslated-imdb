Interesting cartoon, included in the DVD of "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra". I especially like the way color was used in the background art - very artistic for Columbia, whose cartoon department usually had a very low budget (and the results looked like it!) <br /> <br /> I wonder, however, as a certain ... a finger gesture ... has passed through the censors. Granted, the gesture in question was seen much less frequently in 1937 than it is today. Do you think someone other than the animators would have noticed, especially since it was seen three times on the scene in question! And based on context, I suspect that their inclusion was intentional, something that the animators just slipped to see if the censors would notice!
