In 1952, Hollywood decided to redo Al Jolson's first-rate classic. This time, the singer's son was played by Danny Thomas. Coming home from the army, he is expected to follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives, becoming a singer. However, the young Mr. Golding is very enthusiastic about show business. <br /> <br /> At this point, he meets Peggy Lee, an aspiring singer. She acts very well and her interpretation of her favorite song, Lover, is remarkable. Movie writers were clever at not connecting the obvious Jewish guy and the non-Jewish girlfriend relationship. If anything, this is covered up. In his anger, for betraying his promise to become a singer, his father makes the traditional Jewish sign indicative of a loss in the family. This would not be done under circumstances of breach of commitment, this would be done if among the Orthodox, an interreligious marriage took place. <br /> <br /> Thomas does a great job of playing the singer's son. Its singing is the same when the movie ends on a positive note. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that technical advisors did not realize that women do not carry pocket books in the synagogue on the Sabbath or throughout this period.
