It was fascinating. I just could not look away. As the movie went on, I began to feel that I was powerful and confrontational, but I had no idea how much more intense it would be. <br /> <br /> The film gives an insight into what unfortunately is the everyday life for many school children. Some of us live outside this environment and we pass without knowing what is happening. <br /> <br /> Parents need to see this particular movie, just to see what their children are going through. Parents often dismiss their children's problems as trivial, but unfortunately for a high schooler they are huge. And unfortunately, problems can turn into a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Definitely a must see for everyone.
