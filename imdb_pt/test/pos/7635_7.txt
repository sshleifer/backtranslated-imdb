L'OSSESSA, also known as THE TORMENTED or THE SEXORCIST, or the ridiculously titled THE EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is a forgotten EXORCIST copy that contains one of the best horror moments I have ever seen. The scene is when the crucifix comes to life. This great scary scene is unforgettable and totally effective (great FXs). It's a shame that the rest of the film does not maintain the level of strangeness exemplified during the scene. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most frustrating movies of all time. Imagine the producers deciding to make an EXORCIST copy, but by doing so, they actually manage to create something truly original (a sculpture owned by the crucified man, which is shocking when you think about it), but then completely forgetting your original idea for make an annoying and uninspired EXORCIST rip. If the film had continued with the concept of sculpture owned (with the characters trying to destroy it, etc.), this film would have been rocked. But once the girl is possessed by the spirit of the sculpture, she never tells anyone where the demon came from. She, and the script, completely forgets the haunted crucifix, which is STUPID !!! <br /> <br /> If you like so-called "Euro-cult" films, the first 45 minutes are different from any other European cult. movies. But after the scene where the girl has a vision of being crucified and she becomes stigmatized, the remaining 45 minutes SUCK. Boring. It does not go anywhere fast as it tries to imitate (evil) the EXORCISTA. So watch the first 45 minutes of L'OSSESSA and enjoy the 1970s fashion, the sleaze and the incredible statue scene that comes to life, but after the first 45 minutes, tighten stop and eject, and can also cut your toenails.
