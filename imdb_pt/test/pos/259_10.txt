I watched Love Life on vacation when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida. It was a beautiful surprise to find a British film other than a derivative or explorer. A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will delight the public's pants prepared to sit and enjoy the smooth rhythm of the movie. The transitions between the scenes I found a bit of distraction, but as a whole I think Love Life is a winner, a ruby ​​in the dust. One for the whole family. A nice change to see a British movie for teenage audience that is not brimming with four letter words. Try it and see.
