This is one of my favorite comedy movies. Chris Farley is hilarious as the idiot of the crash and David Spade is perfect playing the straight man for Farley. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between the two is brilliant. The scene where the two are in the car singing alongside Superstar by The Carpenters is a classic. <br /> <br /> Chris Farley was a great comic actor who had incredible potential - he will miss you a lot. /> <br />
