With all of continental Europe under his control, Hitler prepares for the last hurdle on his way before departing for North America, Britain. With an overwhelming advantage on the aircraft, Goering's Luftwaffe looks unstoppable on paper. Once in the air, however, the RAF tenaciously disturbs the paradigm by blowing the enemy out of the sky air at a rate of seven to one. Britain's battle lasts for more than a year, while the island nation is bloody but weakened, providing a crucial time for its American allies to produce more weapons for the inevitable struggle. Using scenes more staged than the three previous documentaries in the Why We Fight series, the Battle of Britain has a propaganda more similar to the dramatized ones (some with unmistakable Warner soundtrack) clearly clear scenes for news. In an ironic twist amidst the devastation caused by German air strikes, Beethoven's Seventh Symphony is employed to highlight visual suffering. The story itself is of remarkable courage for a defiant nation that refused to yield to the devastating attacks inflicted on it by then an invincible war machine. It is the twentieth-century version of the 300 Spartans. <br /> <br /> There have been more thorough and well researched commercial efforts in this battle since the film, but the speed and motivation that the Battle of Britain has always provided has made it a more valuable document of England during its the "best time".
