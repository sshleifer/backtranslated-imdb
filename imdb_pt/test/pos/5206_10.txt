Simply the best and most realistic WWII movie I have ever seen. Not only because the German soldiers speak German and Russian soldiers speak Russian (no English in German or Russian dialect) also because of the realistic decoration in which the film was filmed. The acting is excellent. No sense of Hollywood, not even a love story ... Stalingrad should be one of the most terrible battles during the war, and in such a context there is no place for romantic feelings or scenes. What you get is a movie that will make you vibrate to the bone and have one of the best unfortunate endings a movie could have.
