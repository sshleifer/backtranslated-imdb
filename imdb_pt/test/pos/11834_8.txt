"In Love and War" is a simple TV movie to feel good, and should be seen as such. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler) <br /> <br /> It's the story of a Second World War. British soldier, Newby, captured with his command by the Italians and imprisoned in an old orphanage. When the Italians surrender to the Allies, the command is released and tries to escape. However, the Germans arrive and the command is captured again. Only Newby, wounded, remains a fugitive. The rest of the film tells how it is hidden and protected by the Partisans, and their survival. <br /> <br /> (End of the spoiler) <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, "In Love and War" is a refreshing and direct film. Half comedy, half novel, the story is simple and unmistakable. The "atmosphere" is hot and sunny, and the various stereotypes (the desperately disorganized or romantic Italians, the serious and dour Germans, and the phlegmatic and pragmatic Britons), though not original, are still good-humored. The soundtrack of Nicola Piovani also contributes to the Mediterranean flavor. <br /> <br /> Despite being far from being a "Tea with Mussolini" or a "La Vita E Bella", "In Love and War" is a simple sweet. film that will put a smile, and maybe even a little tan on your face.
