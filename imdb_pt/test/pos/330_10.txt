To tell you the truth, I do not speak Tamil and I do not understand the movie. My good friend Tamil, Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, what a long name), explained everything to me. What a great movie !!! After watching this movie, I felt I should have seen many other Tollywood films (Tamil Film Industry). The war scenes were incredible, the camera work excellent and the plot beautiful. The actress "Simran", what a beauty. Give her a prize for someone's best look. Ding, Ding, Ding, come on, I smell an OSCAR winner. I did not understand the songs, but they were great. Mani Ratnam is a great director and I hope his next movie has been a success.
