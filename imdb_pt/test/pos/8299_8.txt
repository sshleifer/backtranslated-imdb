The sturdy David Innes (solid Doug McClure) and the drastic Dr. Abner Perry (a delightfully gifted Peter Cushing) enter the center of the Earth in their mole machine. The pair discovers an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous giant animals and humans that are used both as food and as slaves by the evil telepathic pterodactyls. Director Kevin Conner, working from a cheerful script by Milton Subotsky, keeps up a steady pace and treats the exceptionally silly premise with surprising seriousness, giving this image a certain quality that is fun and captivating in equal measure. The lovably hokey special effects (not so) are quite (unintentionally) funny. The kitsch kitsch of low-priced creatures in particular is positively upside-down: men-in-oblivious-of-rubber-litter-stupid faces, equally fierce wild brutes, and a hilarious ridiculous frog action which blows very good. A special highlight is when McClure mingles with a fat and clumsy giant reptile. Another invaluable scene depicts a dinosaur holding a doll in its sloping jaws. In addition, we also received some rough brutes and an exciting climactic slave revolt. It is a total treat to see Cushing cheerfully in a rare and comical play and become an unlikely but enthusiastic action hero in the last third of the movie. The ever-hot Caroline Munro looks positively hot as the eye-catching Princess Day, and there are also good spins of support from Cy Grant as the brave warrior Ra and Sean Lynch as the treacherous coward Hoojah. Mike Vickers' neatly varied arrangement alternates between lively orchestral music and monotonous synthesizer material. Alan Hume's clear cinematography adds a brilliant glow to infectious procedures. A complete uproar.
