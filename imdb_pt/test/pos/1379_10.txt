I was trying to figure out why I liked this movie? It's not because of the money spent on it, for sure! Did I see a water gun painted there? Maybe they do not have the same kind of visual effects houses in Scotland? Or maybe they just did not have the money? The making of clearly shows a gang of very brave guys making a movie against the odds. Impressive! But what I really enjoyed was the courage of the performances. Mike Michell and Patrick White play the main parts as two normal guys. No Hollywood histrionics here. <br /> <br /> OK, so the effects work is not very good. Spaceships just do not look as good as they should in today's world and I've seen much better things on YouTube. But the film does very well when it comes to the Planet. Was it filmed in Scotland or only by a Scottish crew? Or is it just better effects work? Did they edit the water? In the end, I loved this movie and was disappointed when everyone died.
