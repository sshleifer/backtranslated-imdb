I find it hard to believe that this film has such a low rating. It is undoubtedly one of the best comedies of all time, and certainly the best Bollywood comedy of the 90s. The film did not go very well at the box office and people had diametrically opposed reactions after seeing it. My guess is that most people did not expect it to be a total comedy and expected a regular movie. If you love comedies, this is a must-see. And Aamir Khan is excellent.
