Every time I watch this movie, it really makes me want to go out and have a good night! My companion uses the speech "the weekend has landed" to get up before leaving! and me too ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great debut for the writer / director - well done mate! <br /> <br /> The acting is great, all the characters are believable and are bigger than life! The 'weird' scenes are a joy to watch, Jip is running flashbacks / explanations / Mr floppy views are great! The scene in the pub huuuuuuuge when everyone gets up and start singing the national anthem is a laugh too. There's a lot of comedy here - Howard Marks's speech about "politics of divisions" is hilarious! <br /> <br /> Oh god, you just need to see this. Remember, I felt the movie glorified the use of ecstasy a little, but, hey, that's the truth of the matter, huh? At least the film does not shy away from that fact. I suppose the movie also carries a decent message for him - do not take life too seriously, you have to let your hair fall off at some point. And of course the chat in the pub, when Moff tries to explain to his friends that he's off the drugs, is a reminder that when the party is over, you know the party is over! <br /> <br /> This is sometimes a very clever film in the use of camera, lighting, etc. It was an accomplished piece of film and a great tale of friends, love, clubs and drugs. <br /> <br /> Get out of the people of the 'rat race'! <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Have fun!
