This film exhibits a darling irony, tales of shaggy dogs and fabrics with subtle cultural references, classic parallels, masterful use of rich and saturated colors, and a fabulous interpretation of chase scenes to Keystone Cops. <br /> <br /> The work of the cast and the whole crew is charming. Literally. How else could I go on like this? <br /> <br /> This movie speaks for everyone. The skillful and moving use of so many universal archetypes: this is what makes this film so deep and satisfying. <br /> <br /> As a mature film student, I think Check Out contains all the vital elements. Claro and Bergorra, he is not the GODFATHER, but would serve perfectly as an accompaniment; The compulsory satire of tragedy that sweetly unites our collective cathartic wounds. <br /> <br /> Take you to a theater and see this movie, you will be treated to a unique masterpiece.
