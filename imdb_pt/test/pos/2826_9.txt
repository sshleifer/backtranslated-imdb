Ok, where to start. Did you know that the main robot part was offered to the famous mime Shields and Arnez? I bet you did not. But they refused complaining about the robot's make-up. Then they vanished into obscurity. Now this movie has it all. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's the dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect movie for people who love science fiction and romantic comedies. It is the first romantic comedy robot. Now it is clear that few movies are perfect and there are some problems with the characters. But there are much smaller and can be neglected. I think couples will like this movie and will want to watch it several times. 9 STARS
