This must have been one of Chaplin's most ambitious projects; He plays pretty much everything from visual jokes and sketches of blackout comedy to social relevance, romance, even some violence. The mix is ​​challenging and intriguing, and the film has many fun and clever sequences (like the one in which Chaplin and four other guys try to avoid finding a coin that will order their self-sacrifice), but the ingredients do not always click together. and the mix and tone seem kind of disharmonious. As for the famous final speech, though undeniably honest, it also seems a bit naive today, with its allusions to "a better world, where man will overcome his hatred and brutality, and his soul will fly." Great performances by Jack Oakie and the beautiful Paulette Goddard. (***)
