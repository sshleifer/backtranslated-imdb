This is definitely a good movie contrary to what other people are saying. Peline and I have seen the movie 3x and the ending is tacky, but that's part of the package ... experiencing death is the same as trying to challenge it, so the movie is cool. For those who want to see a classic Kevin Bacon movie, please see this. Take care greeting from Istanbul. we'll write 10 lines if you really want us 2 but we think it's a waste of time bye. The rest of this review should not be taken seriously because we have just written it to fill the 10-line requirement (which is crazy), but we are kind people and therefore we have adapted to the rules set for us. So people watch this movie not because we write 10 lines, but because it's good. and by the way we wrote 12 lines !!
