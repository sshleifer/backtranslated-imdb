These two main characters, Erkan and Stefan, are a comedy act in Munich. I wanted to know if this is one of those typical comedy movies where the story is not important or just does not exist. But when I saw this movie I was very happy that there is a cool story and the main characters really fit it. <br /> <br /> All very fun and not an ordinary German movie.
