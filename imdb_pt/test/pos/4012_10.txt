This is probably my favorite TV show. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! It always makes me laugh and I feel good when I watch this show. There is something about it that is incredible, hard to describe. <br /> <br /> It seems that some or all of the episodes are synchronized with music albums as well. Here are some examples. (Episodes begin again when they are finished - but DO NOT play final credits until the end, but always play opening credits.) With most episodes the album plays once and episodes are played twice, but some continue.) <RADIOHEAD, PINK FLOYD, BOB Dylan. 2.02 'Double bogey' Kid Computer A / OK (episode plays at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> 2.14 'Saturn' Kid A / Meddle / Love Photo <br /> <br /> 2.19 'World Without Alex' Kid A / Wish You Were Here / Pablo Honey (episode plays at least 4 times) <br /> <br / <br /> There are clues in the episodes that tell which albums they sync. Kid A can sync with all episodes!
