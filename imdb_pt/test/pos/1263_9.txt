This movie is superb, it has the same first-budget movie sense of 'Pi' and 'Clerks', but it has the style of 'Memento' (also by writer / director Christopher Nolan). The score, sound effects, photography and editing are almost prototypes of 'Memento', and history shows that Christopher Nolan is best when he writes and directs. Do not be intimidated by the visual and low budget acting, or even for the short duration of the movie, and just watch!
