I was amazed at how big Black Snake Moan turned out to be. Being a fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson id id give this a try. Well, when that was over I was just left stunned by how big this movie really was. I mean everything was very, very accurate for that matter. This movie shows how great director and writer Craig Brewer (who made Hustle & Flow another great movie) can simply pick up anything, even something that looks like Luddites and make it well, I like how it's just a good time like if it was a movie that only makes it a good way. I also love that he does not show great stereotypes of the south and how he was portrayed in things as the most repulsive place to be, but not this film makes very precise and because of it very re-recognizable. The cating in this was just phenomenal especially by Christina Ricci (who deserves an Oscar for this role), the ever great Samuel L. Jackson, and even Justin Timberlake did a great job too. Everything is great about it and although it's not a movie from everyone, it pays to be seen by anyone who can enjoy a good time.
