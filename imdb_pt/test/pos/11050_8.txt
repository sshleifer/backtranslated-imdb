I read all the negative reviews for "Anna Christie". You know, the complaints about the static camera, the outdated acting and the verbosity of the script. But when I saw him yesterday, I found him remarkably moving and pleasant. Yes, Clarence Brown's camera remains stationary for the most part, and I'm sure one of the microphones was hidden in the light of the ship. Yes, there is a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences. It's an early talkie with primitive technicalities. But ... then there's Garbo, Marie Dressler, George F. Marion and Charles Bickford, all proving that the great acting is timeless. <br /> <br /> I believe that "Anna Christie" is still one of Garbo's most iconic performances. And it is a wonderful performance of the Divine in a role that is really very atypical for her. Yes we saw Garbo tired and almost beaten, but never with bags under his eyes or with the injection of doses of whiskey. Garbo has played so many fancy roles (delicious), that seeing her portraying a contemporary woman is fascinating. She is not overworked with heavy dresses or makeup. This performance sounds pretty gross from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The plot, from the play O'Neill, follows the tired Swedish ex-prostitute Anna and her meeting with her drunken and seafaring father. Anna has had enough trouble for any twenty-year-old girl, as she tells us, unkindly, with Marthy (Dressler) in a bar. She finds solace in a sea life and romance with a rude, but kind-hearted fisherman (Charles Bickford). But his past threatens to ruin everything. <br /> <br /> Charles Bickford is neglected in Garbo's long (largely inferior) lineage of leading men. He is an actor who can actually share the screen with her and not be swallowed by his magical presence. The pair have great chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with each other. Dressler can never be accused of underplaying, and once again the great lady lives up to her old tricks, but she is great and convincing in her role, never annoying as in the terrible "Dinner At Eight." I've never heard of George F. Marion before, but he was wonderful as Garbo's father. <br /> <br /> This is pre-code, and a bit obscure and gloomy by MGM standards. I really enjoyed it and although it may creak in some places, it is still wonderful.
