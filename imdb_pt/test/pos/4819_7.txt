What often threatens to turn into a gritty drama about the incomprehensible youth of the middle class ends with a surprisingly somber and somber film by John Frankenheimer (his first, although it began on television, directing, among other things, an earlier version of this script). <br /> <br /> Are we still in those semi-mythical ?? 50 when the teenagers drove jalopies and jeans were still bibs. James MacArthur (adopted son of playwright Charles and actress Helen Hayes, and later joining pop culture as Danno of Hawaii 5-0) engages in a small incident in a movie theater that increases his impact on the entrepreneur (Whit Bissell) and be booked at the police station. His father (James Daly), a great movie producer, gets the call, does not listen to his son's version of the story, and pulls the strings to get him out. <br /> <br /> But MacArthur continues to carry a chip on his shoulder, which even his friendly mother (Kim Hunter) can not bring down. Things got worse on Coldwater Canyon property until MacArthur, trying to defend himself, staged a rerun of the original incident ... <br /> <br /> Does not the film avoid attitudes ?? and clich√©s ?? of their time, but presents them with a considerable nuance: each character receives an honorable audience; each point of view has its merits (and reactions to the film will depend on what viewers bring to it). There are flaws (the word "crummy," a standard rebellious euphemism of the time, is used about 30 times too often), but they are outweighed by forces. The film benefits from a strong cast (the most notable among them, the excellent actor James Gregory, as police detective) and a resolute and non-exploitative way of telling his story. From a point of view in the new millennium, the hot water MacArthur finds may seem a bit tepid, but the Unknown Stranger remains honest and honorable. <br /> <br />
