This production was a surprise to me. I absolutely love obscure movies from the thirties, but I was not prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story. If, by chance, you are not convinced in the first half, wait for the end. Of course, you should look at brazen racism as being purely current. A fascinating viewing experience, but I think PAW DO CAT is not yet available on video / DVD. Watch your PBS listings!
