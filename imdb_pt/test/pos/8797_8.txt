This movie has a brilliant soundtrack and excellent acting from some rather unfamiliar faces. I especially like the Welsh bad boy characters from the docks who show up as American rappers acting harshly. The joke between Jip and Koop is brilliant, they are best friends almost as if it were true in real life. I have experienced some of the things in this movie and let me first say that these people are not acting (especially the one seen with Jop and Koop talking and sniffing coke). Danny Dyer is invaluable as Moff, the 'party recipe' dealer and has the funniest lines in the movie ... <br /> <br /> "I'm happier when I'm out of my head, feeling the music, you get me .... yeaahhh! I knew you would not let me down, I knew that !!! "
