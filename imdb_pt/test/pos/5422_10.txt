I only saw this once - in 1986, at an "artistic" theater in Minneapolis ... but I remember how I saw it a thousand times this morning. Hilary ("Sawing for Teens", playing Scrabble with all the "and" tiles), beautifully animated (removing the eyes, shaking them back into position, then putting them back), and poignant (the end of the world, the meanness of a snit) ... <br /> <br /> Visualization necessary for the human race. Calling this simple caricature is like calling the GREAT GATSBY for nifty typing.
