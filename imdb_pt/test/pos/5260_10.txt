People who do not like this movie seem to have some academic vetting against it - those of us who do not have the original can fully enjoy it. <br /> <br /> My husband who had never seen the original said, "I do not want to see a female movie." I assured him that "women" is just a great movie, not a girl's movie. He had a good time. He was very happy to have gone and liked it more than the "boy" movie we saw the day before "burn after reading". <br /> <br /> SPOILER: I even think the new ending is better. Maybe not so much fun, but it was beautiful. At first I could not understand why they made certain changes in the plot. <br /> <br /> But when I got to the end and Debra Messing gives birth and brings the first male into the movie, I cried. Is that something to love about men? they are our children.
