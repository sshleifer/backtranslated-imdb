First of all - I almost never watch Swedish films, and this is actually the second time in my life that I watch a Swedish movie at the movies! So I think it's one of the best Swedish films ever! The combination of excitement and humor is GREAT, and sometimes you do not even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which, however, is a bad idea. What an awkward idiot! And poor Robert Gustafsson - the wounded soldier - always gets in the way ... OUCH !!! But he still has his great mood. A positive face. Robert Gustafsson has made some less good movies in recent years, and that's really a relief. He's great in this movie. After all - this is one of the best Swedish films of all time, and Peter Dalle did a great job! Congratulations!
