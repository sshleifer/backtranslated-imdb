There is no doubt that indie film Eddie Monroe is one of the best independent films I have seen in a long time. The highlight for me was Paul Vario's performance. I saw Paul for the first time, or "Big Paulie," as he was called in the indie hit of Danny Provenzano, "This Thing Of Ours." Fortunately, Eddie Monroe's filmmaker (s) did the same and used Paul's undeniable skills in a leading role. Outside came a performance (on camera and in the use of voice-over as well) which shows worthy of great budget studio papers in the very near future. It is refreshing to see a trained actor who is committed to the trade, who prove the same to the public. Keep up the good work Big Paulie and we'll be seeing you in Hollywood soon! Not bad for a Canarsie kid, huh?
