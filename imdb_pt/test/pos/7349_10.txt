Viva La Bam was one of those performances that I did not have high expectations before I saw them, and I never knew that before seeing my friend watching. I had thought Jackass was pretty funny, but the acrobatics were just that, funny and I never got on the show. When I first watched Viva La Bam for the first time, it was the complete opposite effect, I loved it. I had more than one TV show that many reality shows have today. I was addicted and wanted to see what new scheme they would prepare for each episode. All the way to the last episode kept my interest and although some of the ideas seemed to be rewritten at times, it always had a younger and fun touch. Viva La Bam is one of those shows that make you hooked and I still have to see another show that is very similar.
