When I saw the ad for the first time, I was like, 'Oh, here we go. He did the High School Musical but he can not keep up with it now he's showing up at other Disney shows. Personally, I love The Life Suite and I'm a big fan of Ashely Tisdale. But for some reason, I do not really like Zac Efron, although all my friends think he's the best since Jesse McCartney. But he really pisses me off. Anyway, I watched the show (giving a break from English course) and was pleasantly surprised. The performances were good in every way, especially the regular characters from The Suite Life, and Zac Efron was not as bad as I had anticipated. All in all, a good show.
