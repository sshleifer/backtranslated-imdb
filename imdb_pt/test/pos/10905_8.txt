this film is extremely funny and enjoyable, with appropriate, funny and experienced castings. I find this film enjoyable not only by the elements of humor, but also by music in various scenes. Kevin Kline, a good comedian, did a good job of being funny in many parts of the film along with Tom Selleck, who is unbelievably different from many of his other films. The humor inside this movie is goofy, which makes several exaggerations in many scenes, especially in the initial bits. Joan Cusack is also incredibly funny and exaggerated; and the same goes for all other castles. This movie has lots of goofy mood elements and is nice if you want to laugh.
