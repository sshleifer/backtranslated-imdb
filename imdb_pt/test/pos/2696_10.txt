In a bad weather, if it's not simply horrible, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It's in my opinion one of the top 5 comedy shows of all time. Nothing has been so good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to get me to label someone as a comic genius. These guys really understand what's funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and could not get half the laughs of seeing KOQ just once. Other funny people on this show are Carrie, Janet Heffernan, Spence and Doug Pruzan (Carrie's boss). I'm so happy that they managed to get so many seasons of this gem. The show was a hilarious winner in an era of comic book losers. Check it out if you do not have it !!
