This movie has one of the best scenes in the club, a very good soundtrack (if you like techno / trance music) <br /> <br /> some situations (as the main character Carl starts taking drugs for example) are a little out of reality, but the plot is fun, but the characters are all a bit shallow ... <br /> <br /> I do not recommend you watch this movie if you do not like techno music <br /> For the plot / acting alone this movie is a 4/10, with the very cool special effects and the club scenes and soundtrack is a 7/10, but if you want to go to the movies just to listen to nice banners and Grab a little club feeling, it's a 10/10. <br /> <br /> Special effects are sometimes hidden, sometimes clearly visible. (ie fast moving clouds / sun / moon, morphing background, morphing cuts) <br /> <br /> I at least liked it a pity there was no dance floor in the cinema;)
