This movie reminds me a lot of Rock Hudson's later film, MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT - about a fishing writer who NEVER fished and is forced into a fishing tournament. In this case, Barbara Stanwyck is a Martha Stewart-type writer who does not know how to cook and does not really have the perfect family she describes in her articles - in fact, she has no family at all. Well, like Rock, she's maneuvered to perform - in this case, create a huge holiday dinner while vacationing in the country. As there is no family, she takes home a veteran and some friends and tried desperately not to "let the cat out of her bag" she can not do any of the things she is known to do. A cute comedy and a welcome movie for the annual movie schedule.
