This movie moved me more than I expected, and I was fully prepared to cry. The performance mainly led this film, with superb performances by Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, as well as the supporting cast. These actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they remained with me for the rest of the night, and I had difficulty shaking this war drama. The costumes and cinematography were also magical, but they were not carried away by themselves. They did not concentrate, but added the whole effect. Cold Mountain could never become my favorite movie, as this title will always belong to The English Patient, but is in the top five. The story itself was well developed and remained quite unpredictable. I did not find myself guessing which line was to follow. A heartbreaking story about humanity and war. In fact, this film was so real that it was hardly noticed in the nineteenth century. It seemed to apply at all times.
