I loved this show, but I do not remember ever loving anything it did, starting with "Emily's Americanization." A city sheriff who keeps trying to steal the city and travel to Mexico has to love it. Like everything it does, it has a tongue-twitching flavor that marks it as a Garner product. James plays the same character in many of his shows and films, but somehow never gets obsolete. <br /> <br /> PS Re: Killing the main character <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, the "good" brother was killed and replaced by the "evil" twin in an effort to increase the audience, ie make it more like every other western on the TV at the moment. I think this show was way ahead of its time and I still miss it. TV without a Jimmy G show is missing something.
