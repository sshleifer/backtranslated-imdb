S. Epatha Merkerson shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look of the life of Ruben Santiago Jr. (Marcus Franklin) as she grew up under the care of the nanny. The film gives a good study of the character of both Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture the ups and downs of life in a realistic way, as opposed to so many memories that are turned into film. The supporting cast adds a lot of sparkle and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including Mos Def, Macy Gray, Rosie Perez, Louis Schreiber, Jimmy Smits, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo and Patricia Wettig. It loses some steam and vibration at the end, and the final sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling. But overall, a great movie with a performance truly remarkable by Merkerson.
