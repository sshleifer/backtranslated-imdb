I have a 4 year old daughter, and before this movie she was all about the Disney princesses, now she has watched this movie and all she can talk about is Princess Genevieve and all her sisters. I would definitely recommend this movie to all the girls. This movie is one of the best in the Barbie collection. It shows all the good values ​​that any mother would like to encourage in little girls. With the great songs and dance moves, my daughter gets up and tries to imitate the movements. The extras are also good, one of them even works like your memory is good. I would definitely say it is a must see for kids and adults.
