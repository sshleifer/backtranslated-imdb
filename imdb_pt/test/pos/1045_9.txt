Barbara Stanwyck probably did not think about it, but it's a relief to see her in a darker hairstyle (if it was not a wig) than what she had to wear in "Double Indemnity" the year before. This film, while premiering "film noir" and a great movie, gave her a big role, but, oh, that hair. Here she is more chic and certainly no fatal woman, but she is certainly a woman from the 1940s. She has grown accustomed to life without men, since most of them are at war, and as a successful columnist, Martha Stewart, she writes a homemade column in which she describes her country house while the camera does what it really is. We meet up with his boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea he's living a lie, and when he walks into Christmas at his supposed home in Connecticut, she has to raise a husband (Reginald Gardiner) and baby before we can say "Jingle Bells." Hungarian Chef S.Z. Sakall intervenes to help and ends up in a cream pie with the Irishman Una O'Connor. "It's not Goulash, it's Irish Stew." Sakall simply picks up the paprica, dumps most of it and says, "Now it's goulash," totally changing what she prepared for lunch. So when it comes to the flapjacks, he flips and she catches. For years, some of my friends and I will use this line every time pancakes come up in a conversation. "I do not turn, I'll get it!" She will not even turn one over to Greenstreet, saying, "I never opened my life." O'Connor can get on her nerves when she yells repeatedly at some movies, but here, she is delightfully kind, and her partner with Sakall is very charming. <br /> <br /> It's obvious in the romance department. that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwyck's cup of tea, especially when she meets the handsome Dennis Morgan, who is a bit bib when bathing the baby, who eats soap, making Stanwyck a little alarmed. He should suspect something instantly, but he does not suspect. But it does not matter. The film is so charming with the snowy country scenery, plenty of rocking chairs and a dog running towards them when the sled goes up. Living in New York after 25 years in Los Angeles, having grown up in a small town on the west side of New York State, made me miss this kind of Christmas. Although Central Park is beautiful after a first snow and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is also exaggerated, there is something in looking at a snow-covered tree field and occasionally glimpsing deer, rabbits or other forms of wildlife. <br /> <br /> This is a great holiday movie that can also bring the Christmas spirit out of season, and makes a great pair with another Christmas film by Barbara Stanwyck, "Remember the Night," an underrated gem. Add Christmas to "Meet John Doe," and you've found perhaps one of the busiest stars of the year-end movies.
