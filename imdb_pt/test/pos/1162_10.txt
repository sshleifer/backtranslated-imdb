This is one of my all time favorites. All the actors do a great job. Compare this movie with "Lawrence of Arabia" does not do justice to both films. "The Wind and the Lion" raises a much smaller budget with fantastic actors portraying comforting characters in a lively atmosphere. Action and beautiful photos are provided too, which guarantees a favorite movie for me.
