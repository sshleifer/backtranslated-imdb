A truly fantastic and touching film. Female melodrama at its best, with lots of comedy: great dialogue, characters and writing. Any woman can relate to the story because it's a classic: you're in love with "Mr. Right", but he has no interest in you until a guy who looks completely wrong appears and you fall madly in love. But of course, it's not that simplistic. The characters are real and all the performances are perfect. The movie is hilarious as well, every scene chokes society. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a well-written script of humor and melodrama. You can relate to all the characters and the plot moves in unexpected directions. A great understated movie.
