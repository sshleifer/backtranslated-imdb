I channel surfed past many times, mostly because the synopsis seemed so tacky, so "American Style Love". However, it turned out to be very good, very well done. The two main features are dialogue and action. Great cast. The premise is really well executed and there are not many weak moments. I think what struck me the most was how many times you thought the wheels would get out of the trolley, and instead the trolley would just corner the turns, so to speak, and the movie would keep flying. There are a few small sub-plots, particularly the relationship that develops between the character played by former Conan helper Andy Richter. Besides, I want to mention that the accompanying music was good.
