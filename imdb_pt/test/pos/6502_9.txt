Wow - most of the audience seemed to just shake their heads through much of this documentary in the pure magic displayed on the screen. <br /> <br /> The change from the early days as a New York-based Black-American phenomenon to present day as a racially diverse sub-culture (and largely based on the west coast) is well-shaped. <br /> <br /> The humble turntable is not given respect for any traditional musical instrument, but it can be much more versatile and technically complex. These DJs acquire the skills needed for any musical instrument - dexterity, rhythm and tempo, among others - and apply them to a new technology with several other variables. <br /> <br /> DJ Qbert's comment that he portrays what "music" should sound like on advanced planets and then works out, seemingly silly at first, makes more and more sense as you see these guys go and spit a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could ever create! Some critics have said that this film focuses heavily on certain 'stars' and misses an opportunity to outline the broader hip-hop culture. One movie at a time people!
