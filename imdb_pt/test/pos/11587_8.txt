The true story of a Spanish paraplegic, Ramón Sampedro, who fought for decades for the right to be ethnicized. This film, along with the winner of the same year's Best Picture Award, Million Dollar Baby, caused a stir that year with its depictions of people with disabilities desiring death. Both advocates for the disabled and (unfortunately for the advocates of disability) conservative pro-life groups protested against both the films and their Oscar nominations. The indications also came during the entire Terry Schiavo disaster, only to put everything in some historical perspective. Do protests, especially from disability groups, against the Million Dollar Baby make any sense ?? the film clearly showed, without hesitation, that the life of a paraplegic was useless. The central character of the film, Maggie Fitzgerald, becomes a paraplegic, does not seem to have any kind of advice, no help, and immediately wants to die. The film is, honestly, quite stupid and not very complex. The Sea Inside, based on true story, is certainly much more thoughtful on the subject. It's very likely to have entered the same category as Million Dollar Baby without its protesters seeing it, an incredibly common phenomenon. The film gives time to many different sides of the argument. And he declares immediately that the desire to die is only the protagonist and the protagonist. He is guilty of a couple of crimes, and I still understand why groups of people with disabilities may have a problem with that. First, there is the meeting of the protagonist with a paraplegic bishop. I do not look kindly in the way he is portrayed. His orally operated wheelchair is described as absurd, and there is almost a comic sequence in which his effeminate boy toy servants drag him into his chair, climbing the stairs. He can not even get to the room where Ramon is located, and one of the boys' toys is forced to carry the conversation between them. I had to think, dammit, maybe if Ramón lived in a house a little more accessible to wheelchairs, he would not spend his entire life in bed, and could find life more rewarding (who knows how close the movie portrays reality ). Director Amenábar (The Others) also includes some laughable scenes that try to make this suicide film more affirmation of life, as a cross-sequence in which Ramón seems thoughtful and his lawyer's baby is born. But besides some ugly moments, the movie is very good. It hurts that someone might want to die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others. However, in the end, our lives belong to us. Should not we have the right to choose? The film's strongest asset is its supporting characters and the actors who interpret them. It shows how Ramón's struggle and decisions affect those around him with beautiful precision. The family members in particular are great, and Ramon's final departure from them is absolutely desolate, and left me in tears. My favorite performance in the film comes from Lola Dueñas, whom I also felt gave the best, or at least certainly the most underrated performance, in Almodovar's Volver last year.
