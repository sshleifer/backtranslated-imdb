CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST is a perfect movie. An impeccable film about all the faults of humanity. From the outside, it may look like a movie about death, but it's actually a movie about life. I just can not recommend this movie enough. And do not be afraid, dear readers, it is not a depressing movie. As said, it is a film about the brilliance of life trained under the guise of death. You will laugh. You will cry. You will realize that life is fragile and short. And you will leave the vision with a better understanding of how precious life is. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films)
