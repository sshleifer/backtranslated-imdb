Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico were undoubtedly the weakest of the animated features of Scooby Doo. The Loch Ness monster is a considerable improvement. This time the gang goes to Scotland to see the Highland Games and visit Blake Castle, Daphne's ancestral home. And you do not know, the castle is in the fishing village of Drumnadrochit, on the banks of Loch Ness. During their stay they meet some interesting people. First, there's Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who drowned all her money to find the Loch Ness Monster. Sir Ian Locksley, the head of the National Heritage Museum of Scotland, he is firmly non-believer of Nessie. <br /> <br /> The Haggarts, the very cozy Inn on the shores of the lake. The children are a pair of local pranksters, always in malice. <br /> <br /> Del Chilman, a wild and paranoid hippie who is convinced that the monster is out there and will stop at nothing to find it. <BR> And finally, Duncan MacGubbin, the dock master who saw Nessie many times to tell. <br /> <br /> Most of these characters are stereotypes, which is a bit annoying as this is teaching younger audiences. a lot of crap and giving the wrong impression. However, if you can be immune to it, you'll be fine. Being from Scotland, I can not help but shudder with the Scottish accents imitated. Fact: We DO NOT sound like that. <br /> <br /> Soon Nessie, looking more demonic than 'normal', appears and wreaks havoc. It seems that the gang has another mystery in their hands. Shaggy's usual chase scenes, clues and wacky disguises follow. There are lots of laughs. The animation is splendid with some scenes and atmospheric locations. And the plot much better than the monster of Mexico. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing this time is the music. I miss the score of Louis Febre and the songs here are also very rotten. Where are the Hex Girls when you need them? <br /> <br /> Region 2 DVD is in anamorphic 1.78: 1 widescreen crystalline (Region 1 is not) with Dolby 5.0 sound. Some extras are included. Definitely worth staying.
