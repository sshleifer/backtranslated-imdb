I loved this movie. You can not buy it, rent it or find it ... but it's a guardian. <br /> <br /> Marvelous chemistry between Braccho and Walken ... and Ferrar .... <br /> <br /> Great action and non-stop reactions .... I loved it. <br /> <br /> I watched my pirate copy maybe 6 times in the last decade ... each time showing to someone who has never heard of Find this movie and watch. <br /> <br /> So many movies are on TV again and again - without the wit and style of this little movie. <br /> <br /> I did not know it was made for TV. .. my copy is an 8 track that I pirated years ago ... I hope it lasts.
