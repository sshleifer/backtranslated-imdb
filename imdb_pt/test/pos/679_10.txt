Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30s, 40s and 50s, she guaranteed him great entertainment, even if the image was black and white. Ida was able to capture the audience and keep him fascinated until the end of their photos. In this film, as Mrs. Helen Gordon, "High Sierra," 41 along with Robert Ryan, Howard Wilton, "Golden Gloves," 40, she still wondering how the relationship will end and how poor Mrs. Gordon may have a marriage normal and happy with love and real affection. If you liked Ida Lupino, who could do the roles of criminal in prison and in the prison of a woman who was hated, this is the movie for you to enjoy. I truly believe that Ida Lupino did not receive the true credit she deserved for her great talent in the Film Industry !!!
