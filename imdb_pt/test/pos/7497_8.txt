As I said earlier this year, in my review of Swordfish (which was scripted by screenwriter / director / film producer, Skip Woods), this is a good movie. It's right at the top of my crime list between Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, Pulp Fiction and Snatch. Basically I think this movie is to me what Reservoir Dogs was to many people - a cult classic - although I'd rather compare it to Pulp Fiction. I mean, I've never really enjoyed Tarantino's first effort, but I certainly enjoyed it as much as I like Pulp Fiction because it simply has everything a classic needs. A great story and good actors. OK, the budget may not be as great as, say, Godzilla, The Avengers of the Mission to Mars, but it sure surpasses the life of these films (and many others). <br /> <br /> The story of This Movie is about a man named Casey (Thomas Jane), who settled with his wife in Houston. Unexpectedly, an old friend of his has been disturbing his life, revealing his secrets and basically making his day a hell (and also a damn). <br /> <br /> The film is very original and very bloody / sexually colorful. . So, based on that first and last quality, I can guarantee that if you like this movie, you'll also like Swordfish, which obviously has a much bigger budget and more famous faces than this, but it's as good as bloody and not so sexually nuanced). I saw this movie for the second time last night and I really enjoyed it (again). I mean, all the characters and actors are good, although I should give very big credits to Thomas Jane and Paulina Porizkova, who were the best actors (and had the best characters) in the movie. I would also like to thank Skip Woods for being so creative and original. Brutal, sexual, offensive Maybe, but sure enough, fun and exciting to the end. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
