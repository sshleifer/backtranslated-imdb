That may be wine talking, but this could be the best movie I've seen in a long time. I spent much of the first half hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I accepted that I would never understand all of the subtitles that I was able to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Can you really hate a movie in which a team turns into a flock of birds that defecate on the enemy? What does character development matter when confronted with an alien lesbian princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha seriously wear diamond earrings? Some of this matter matters when confronted with the sumptuousness of the visuals and the cunning humor of the characters. Any battle for my heart was won as soon as I saw the protagonist dressed in Spiderman - fantastic! Many people will complain about the lack of cohesion of the story, but for a fun movie to laugh with a lot of friends you can not do better, especially if you take an alcoholic shot every time someone says "I'll love you 10,000 years."
