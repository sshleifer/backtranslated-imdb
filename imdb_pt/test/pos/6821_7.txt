Joseph Conrad's timeless romance, Heart of Darkness, was portrayed in the 1994 film. I read Conrad's novel and I must say that although he prefers the novel itself, the film was a great representation. The ensemble and costumes brought Conrad's novel to life as we followed Marlow's journey. The acting also brought the characters to life through the mannerisms, voices and personalities. If you've read the novel, I recommend you also watch this movie. If you have not yet read the novel, the film may be more difficult to follow. The Heart of Darkness by Conrad is very full of action, excitement and information to be transformed into a movie with little more than an hour and a half in duration. So if you have not read the novel, the plot of the movie may seem too confusing to follow. Overall, I gave this film seven out of ten. The basic plot of the novel was brought to the screen with great scenarios, costumes and acting. Nothing can replace Joseph Conrad's original work.
