I saw that title again in Shemaroo. I also asked my nephew that he was 17 years old to see the same with me. I'm 35 years old and he's 17 years old. He liked it and so did I. It's still funny, a bit childish times, but still very clean entertainment. Satish Shah is hilarious in various roles. This sitcom would still do better than many of the recent sitcoms on TV. But obviously some people obviously like worldly fares coming out today. It would have been good for Shafi Inamdar to continue all seasons. He is no longer alive today. I wish someone could list all the episodes here. <br /> <br /> What can forget the words "Yeh Kya Ho Raha HAi" "What a relief" "Chief Kaat Daalu" "Vyavhaar hai Vyavhaar" "30 Years Ka Experience hai" <br /> <br /> and the title track Yeh Jo hai Zindagi, teaching us to live life as it is and to take advantage of it. The lives of ordinary people. <br /> <br /> I still like this sitcom. may not seem funny at times, but certain episodes are still hilarious.
