Rainy day without much to do. We were surfing the channels of the movie network and we thought it was just starting, so we took a chance. <br /> <br /> The more we watched, the more we became involved in the story. It's the old working class underdog story trying to do this in a sport that at the time (1913 I think) was generally played by the wealthy upper class, but this movie was as interesting as Seabiscuit and this is also based on a true story. <br /> <br /> The acting is believable and the cast is brilliant. AND. . . . We are not golfers, so please do not miss this just because it is about golf. Any individual sport would serve the plot, because it is about people. Golf works well for this story because of the distinction of class and snobbery that seem to involve some who play the game. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. . . . And a good movie. Is it well set up and is not it always fun to see those who think they are better than others?
