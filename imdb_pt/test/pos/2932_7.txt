I mean, let's face it, all you have to do in modeling is pose for photos. The judgment is so exaggerated with his criticism. The show, however, is fun, especially with Tyra Banks, Nigel Barker, Alexander J and the supermodel Twiggy herself. I watched season 5, 6, 7 and in the middle of Season 8. It looks like American Idol got sexy, but I'm a guy and I just watch because of the hot girls posing in their bikinis! The show can be very annoying, when it comes to judging, Tyra tends to continue and is really discouraging. Anyway would I recommend? Yes, I recommend for women who want to get into the modeling business? Do not.
