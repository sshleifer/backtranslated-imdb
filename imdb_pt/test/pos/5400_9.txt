Before Barton skip all my comments, let's all just keep in mind that opinions are like idiots, we all have them ..... <br /> <br /> I loved Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, I loved the dialogue and I thought the acting was sublime. Underestimated just perfectly and unobtrusively. Unlike some others, I did not find this all @ predictable. <br /> <br /> I found the role of Sigourney refreshingly humorous and realistic, especially his scene confronting the bully in the trailer. <br /> <br /> I found It's nice and was not predicting recommending it to everyone. That's why there are different flavors of ice cream, something to please everyone ...
