That was it! I would never have expected the ending if I did not know what was behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hated was why Shannon was expelled and not Alyssa. I hate her, I'd rather have her character die like this from Shannon. What was funny is that in the scene where Piper is dying in the hospital bed and Prue was crying at her side I started to cry too lol. by the time it was aired, I was about 10 years old and my favorite character was Piper from the beginning so I was telling myself if she died so I would not see the show anymore! lol <br /> <br /> then everything would go back in time, it was a shock and very good. I also blame Pheobe for Prue's death because instead of being with her sisters, she had to be a naughty idiot and be with her good-for-nothing boyfriend demon. <br /> <br /> But I think this episode will now and forever be one of my favorites and a CHRMED classic. <br /> <br /> FOREVER CHARMED! Be Blessed!
