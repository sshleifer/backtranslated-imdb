I know this movie is not for everyone, and I will not push my opinions about you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie ... It was the best I've ever seen! !! It was soooo funny, and even though it was not the scariest movie I've ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat because I did not know what would happen next. If you like funny horror movies, you have to see this!
