I knew as soon as I saw the first Black Snake Moan trailer I would have to see. I was not disappointed in the film, which was written and directed by the creator of Hustle and Flow, Craig Brewer. He tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he intends to heal not only for her but also for his ... but it is much more than that. It is complex and rich and manages to leave you in a brave, sticky and sensual Memphis without making you feel like you need a shower after. <br /> <br /> The characters are (mostly) multifaceted and very well written and executed. The accents and the dialogue were brought to perfection. However, there was a weak link in the chain: Justin Timberlake. The best I can say to him is that he can cry ... he's a rare actor who can cry convincingly. However, Justin's Ronnie was flat, but as an actor he was trying very hard. I would definitely give him another chance. <br /> <br /> Lazarus and Rae (Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci, respectively) have great chemistry and great respect for each other. This is one of those films where it does not matter how good an actor is if the other is not up to the task and fortunately both actors were up to the task. <br /> <br /> The music was as good as one might expect, especially when mr. Samuel L. Jackson sings the blues. Phenomenal. <br /> <br /> On the technical side, everything was brilliance as far as I could see. It was well edited, well filmed and well mixed ... everything was great. The character and scenography were right, the cast of supporting characters (even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) was on location ... I loved it.
