Who more than Troma can take the classic tragedy and change it by today's standards? No one .... in my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio sucked. Tromeon and Juliet is a definite stretch of Shakespeare's original tragedy, but it holds up well. He is sick, demented, distorted, but still insanely funny and gratifying. For the most part, it follows the true story of Romeo and Juliet, but many Troma elements are added. Will Keenan gives a great performance as Tromeo. The acting is solid and the story is great. Many people look beyond these films, not only from the Kaufman Troma movies, but from everyone they distribute. Of course Troma movies are an acquired taste, but you need to see some of them. It's a renegade movie at its best.
