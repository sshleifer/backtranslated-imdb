Three distinct and distant lives of individuals intersect with the brutal murder of one another. The one-hour film only reveals the event that unites the three people after half the film is over. I have seen other segments of the "Dekalog", but this one seemed to me the sparest in dialogue and even more fascinating in structure. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a law student practicing a false defense argument. by a man accused of murder. Obviously, the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full-fledged lawyer, but this is never shown on the screen (at least in the 1-hour short version of Dekalog 5). We are made to imagine that this must have been the case. A taxi driver who is a misanthropo has two facets to his character: the good side feeds a mangy dog, cleans his taxi meticulously, picks up dirty rags thrown by people who have no civic sense, and remembers his wife while he dies; the bad side scares the little poodles, refuses to give a ride to a drunk - probably worried that he'll throw up in the taxi - and look at pretty girls. The repulsive protagonist who kills without mercy, knocks down bridges in fast-moving traffic and pushes strangers into urinals without any provocation, is also a person who can make innocent girls laugh. Kieslowski's film and script, therefore, have both the good and bad sides of two of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> However, the film is not about capital punishment but more a treatise on killing. The Fifth Commandment "Thou shalt not kill" is theologically exploited - ("God has spared Cain ..."), sociologically the tenderness of brutes for children and poor abandoned dogs, and psychologically (after effects of drunken night with a man friend who accidental death of his sister, whose photograph he carries with him. "What makes ordinary people become murderers - this is never fully explained, but suggestions are legions." In Kieslowski's world there is a pattern where events and people are intertwined in a cosmic sense (note the likeness of the clown to the murderer as he hangs from the mirror in the cab) Kieslowski and the young idealist lawyer seem to be asking us to look at the commandment literally and figuratively - do we kill? Are legally dead people really bad? Is there a force beyond society (the night of drunkenness that led to the life of a girl) that makes us repugnant killers? would be missing the forest to the trees to discuss the two det Sick murders in the movie - both mercilessly. The film invites the viewer to contemplate why God asks us not to kill. <br /> <br /> I understand that a longer version of the film was made by Kieslowski. But even this short one-hour version is excellent with its dark and sparse script, clever editing, interesting cinematography and top-notch direction that delivers much more than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> This segment anticipates the healthier Dekalogs 6,7 and 8.
