The 80s were invaded by all those HALLOWEEN / Friday THE 13th horror movies, so that's kind of a relief. <br /> <br /> Ten unbelievably annoying teenagers (would you like to date these idiots?) Decide to hold a Halloween party at a local funeral home called "Hull House." During a "past-life session" a demon is released accidentally, and each person gets possessed and kills the others. <br /> <br /> All of this sounds SO MUCH DEAD / DEMONS-ish, but Tenney lends some style of direction to the procedures, there are some good one-liners , the song is great, Steve Johnson's makeup prosthetics, FX, is scary, and Linnea Quigley is a lot of fun as a crazy asshole nudges eyeballs with her fingers and does a surprising new thing with a tube of lipstick! /> <br /> Great fun on a no-brainer level! After checking the voting breakdown and the other comments posted, I do not understand how this only received 4 out of 10 (?!) I give it to you, 8 out of 10.
