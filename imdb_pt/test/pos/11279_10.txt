What this movie is not: Cool, Fun <br /> <br /> What movie is this: Visually interesting, Hard to pass, Intentional <br /> <br /> I feel like this movie puts the viewer (if he or she is willing) through a time clip where they experience a world without language. Much like how animals should experience the world. You really do not watch this movie as much as you witness a series of events where you "feel" in real time. <br /> <br /> Consistently, it lasts much longer than it is comfortable. This movie could be edited for a short of 20 minutes and would be a totally different movie. It would be cool and fun, but the experience would be lost. I've seen a lot of cool movies, but I've never experienced one like that. If you can put your head in the right place for this, you should be able to really appreciate (but probably not "enjoy") what they accomplished here. 10 out of 10.
