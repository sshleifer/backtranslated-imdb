This film plunges headlong into the realm of the surreal to Lynch and Jodorowsky - with an atmosphere that is strangely convincing, cradling the viewer with the intensity of their dream-like images. <br /> <br /> Narration is to be savored - the narrator being trapped behind a painting (adjacent to the bed), which often speaks for it, vocalizing his desires and reasoning. Yes, Beardsley would sound like that. <br /> <br /> There are some flaws, but your strengths outweigh your weaknesses. The sequence with the woman pulling out of bed and crawling on the floor, trying to escape, will leave him breathless. <br /> <br /> The film has an air fin-de-si√®cle on it; and should be read as a cry of disarming the bowels of the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and bathe it.
