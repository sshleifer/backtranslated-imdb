This film has changed the art of making films, telling a complex story in a new and powerful way. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy, interspersing a modern war with strange scenes filled with technicolor smoke. The film uses music not as a score made later, but as a practical part of the scene playing on speakers, radios, etc. Coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration, capturing scenes and characters, and putting them in a completely different environment. This is a complicated and courageous thing to do. Then he picks up a super star, Brando, pays him a fortune and films it so you can barely see his face. The pure entrails that such motion requires are amazing and work beautifully. This movie belongs to the top ten.
