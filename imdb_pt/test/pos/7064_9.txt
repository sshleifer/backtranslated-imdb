Meatballs have been a staple in my family for over 26 years! We saw this movie when it first appeared and have seen it dozens of times since. Bill Murray is at his best and is most touching on the scenes in which he reaches a lonely preteen boy and befriends him, at the same time as he takes his CIT to draw malicious schemes after another! The cast of characters are fun and crazy and you really care about them and the relationships they have with each other. This is not another sloppy teenage idiot festival. It's funny, sweet and fun. Those who see this will have fun. It's a must see. Beware of Spaz - he is by far the best character! (Especially during social encampment - while Bill Murray does it for the camera - just watch Spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he chooses to dance!) By far one of my favorite comedies of all time!
