A good but not great movie, "The Great Dictator" is Chaplin's first talkie. It is a good effort, and sometimes a remarkable satire on Hitler, but unfortunately the moments of Chaplin's brilliance on offer here are diminished by the tendency to use much unnecessary dialogue. Yes, Chaplin, the silent screen master, uses a lot of words in this film, and his tendency to write long speeches and strange passages of dialogues would transition to his other films like "Limelight." Still, Chaplin was extremely adventurous in making this film and his performance in double roles is certainly memorable. Paulette Goddard does not have the sparkle she made in "Modern Times" (her off-screen case with Chaplin was cooling off at the time), but she's always worth seeing, and Jack Oakie just about steals the show as a rival dictator for A famous creation of Chaplin, Hynkel.
