When I was five, it was my favorite television show. I remembered I was on channel 11 at 2 in the afternoon every day. The premise of the show was simple, with Carole and Janis hosting the children's television program. They sang songs and read stories to us as children. It was made into a studio with only 54 episodes that was re-broadcast several times. I remember Sherlock, the puppet, in the tree. The program taught us how to count, add, subtract and the alphabet. For thirty minutes a day, I learned something new with Paula and Janis. I remember those days as pleasant memories and now I hope today's children can learn to love simpler things like hearing stories, cheap props, walking on the swings and talking to puppets. The set was ideal and simple, but it was Carole and Janis who made it worth while. I miss my childhood and those days when the most important thing was to attend the Magic Garden. Life seemed so much simpler and better. Now, I hope the kids will enjoy the show today.
