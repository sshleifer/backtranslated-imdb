Excellent story and cinematography. Biting and scathing social commentary. <br /> <br /> Extraordinary effects. Well filmed and acted. <br /> <br /> However, the parallel action between the present and the travel adventures (though very well done) sometimes creeps a little too much (about 3 hours), and interrupts too much. the flow of history. <br /> <br /> I read the book for the first time as a child, and I liked the parts about the giants and the tiny people - but the book lost me when it came to the floating island and the land of yahoos! Well, while the adventure story may sound like a children's story, it's actually a very adult story, full of symbolism about the moral decay in England at the time of Jonathan Swift, the author of the novel on which the film is based.
