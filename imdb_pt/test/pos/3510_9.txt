I watched this movie for the first time in 1990, when I was a child, and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it a lot and I was dying to get my hands on it. <br /> <br /> In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed, but I had no idea what it was called, so I went to the movie. Need to know section about IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get his name. Anyway, someone told me about the IMDb, so I researched and tried to buy the movie. So eventually I got on DVD, and now I keep this movie as one of my most valuable horror movies. I really love it, and I think anyone who watches it will be very scared in the woods the next time. 9/10
