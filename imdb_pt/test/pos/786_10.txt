A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short. <br /> <br /> Poor Buster becomes the GOAT ("scapegoat") by a dangerous killer who escaped. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful and hilarious little movie with Keaton at his absolute best.

His theme of a little man against the world, who triumphs through bravery and ingenuity, dominates his films. Through every calamity and disaster, Buster remained the Great Face of the Stone, a stoic survivor in a crazed universe.

Finally, before lung cancer took him to his 70s, he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being rediscovered. Now, well after his centennial, Buster Keaton is routinely recognized and appreciated as one of the true cinematic geniuses. And he knew how to make people laugh ...
