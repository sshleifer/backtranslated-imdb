I have to admit that when I first heard about the movie Apocalypse it was a concern. <br /> <br /> I mean, they have a lot to live, do not they? When they did a show for the first time, they won the Perrier award and when they did radio, they won a prize from Sony. When they ventured on television, they won a Bafta prize, a prize from the Royal Television Society and the Golden Rose of Montreux. <br /> <br /> When the first series aired in January 1999, it was amazing! A real breeze of fresh air in the British Comedy, and when the second series aired a year later, built on that foundation and sealed show status around the world, our statistics show that we have received visitors from every country on the planet! The "local show for local people" showed the Gents talent for live performances and opened the door for you to make more live performances such as "Art" in the far west. <br /> <br /> Fan favorite has always been the Christmas special, minus a sketch show and a tribute to the classic horror movies, but still wrapped in the delicious style of the league. <br /> <br /> And then, of course, there was the third 'hard' series, still a hit with loyal hardcore fans, of course, but maybe a little ahead of its time for a mainstream TV audience. <br /> <br /> Like I said, a lot to live on. <br /> <br /> So now we have the movie and ... Well, a movie is different, is not it? It will be seen by much larger numbers than the radio or TV shows and with the third series in mind I was worried. <br /> <br /> Well, as you know, I was lucky enough to see the movie yesterday in a screening press in London and all my doubts were blown (literally) in the first few minutes! I'm not going to give out plot lines as some reviewers have done, nor am I going to tell you the advertising phrases (although there's really only one) but I'll try to tell you what they managed to achieve with this movie! Leaving the cinema on Monday night, I could only imagine writing "Oh my God, it's brilliant, it's amazing, it's the best thing they've ever done, better than the first, second and all specials all in one!" Of course I owe my visitors a much better explanation than that! So why is this brilliant? This is a movie for everyone, the casual fan, the obsessive fan, the occasional fan and even for someone who is sitting in the wrong cinema! You do not need to watch the series to enjoy this movie; works on so many levels. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me because I am a League of Gentlemen Fan! You can say that filming was a real work of love too; the attention to detail is incredible. The sets for the TV show have always been detailed, but I'll have to watch the movie again just to look at the background! The story moves at a fast pace, action takes us from Royston Vasey to the real world, where we find the 'Creators' who are, of course, the League itself! Along the way, we came across the show's favorite characters, but always within the central story, unlike the TV show. <br /> <br /> I was glad that the movie was dark in some places, a little scary and a little weird ... just fitting for the Gentlemen's League. The Gents also got their revenge on the BBC censors, not slipping so much in the word 'mongoloid' as shouting from the rooftops! Some may think that Gents' portrayal of himself is a little indulgent, but that's the joke and with that comes my only concern, the jokes mentioned below may confuse some viewers and may seem a little too clever ... but I do not should be worried, there is always a joke waiting around the corner and talking about jokes, they come thick and fast, and in a mix of smart references, wig jokes, boo jokes, visual jokes and cock jokes! I have not laughed out loud in a movie since ... well, I do not remember! Fans who have 'with' the League from the outset are rewarded with a lot of 'in' jokes, some that work on two levels, a mainstream audience can laugh at a reference to a compact disc for a reason, while the Local show fans will laugh for another reason completely! The apparitions are great! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg form the weird double act you've seen, Simon making one of the biggest laughs in the movies just making noise! I was a little worried about the look of the 1690 movie when I first heard of it, but like a story inside a story I was just entering when ... but that would be revealing! All I need to say is that this fits wonderfully and enhances the overall feel of the movie! I'm not a professional film reviewer, so I find it hard to put into words how much I enjoyed this movie, but for now I'll just say that if the supposed benchmark of British Comedy films in recent years was the excellent 'Shaun of the Dead ', so I'm sorry, but a new benchmark has just been defined by inventive, hilarious and sometimes a little scary ... The League of Gentlemen of the Apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Jason Kenny 2005
