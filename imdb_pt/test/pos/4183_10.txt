This film, like much of his music, is underestimated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is fantastic and, in many ways, ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> The images are funny, disturbing and, at the very least, engaging. <br /> <br /> The music is incredible. <br /> <br /> This is not the "candy pop" sound with which they unfortunately are associated. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt. <br /> <br /> HEAD, alone, must put The Monkees in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me why these guys are not there?
