The best thing - and that's pretty good - about The Black Castle is that it's a Forties black and white gothic grabber with a killer crazy score that was somehow made in 1952. The star is ostensibly the British actor Richard Greene, a capable leader who reminds me of an earlier version of Roger Moore. The villain is a crazy score played by Stephen McNally, who does a credible job, except when he is called to laugh madly. Sneaking into the shadows is Boris Karloff, long-sleeved, in a decidedly secondary role of an elderly physician who may or may not be the salvation of our hero. <br /> <br /> It is the middle of the 18th century in Austria and Sir Ronald Burton (Greene) is determined to find out what happened to two close friends. They disappeared near the castle belonging to Count Karl von Bruno (McNally) at the bottom of the Black Forest. It seems that Sir Ronald and his friends were instrumental in defeating a brutal plan by Von Bruno in Africa, three years earlier involving slavery and ivory. The Count was not only stuck, but with a scar on his face and a black spot he now uses to cover a ruined eye. von Bruno vowed revenge, and it looks like he might have been partially successful. Thus, under a false name, Sir Ronald arranges a hunting invitation from the Earl, and we set off by carriage through a dark storm and wandering wolves to the earl's castle. It's a huge mass of stone towers and corridors, gloomy staircases, huge fireplaces ... and sinister passages leading to cells of damp dungeons, a torture chamber and a large pit full of crocodiles popping and pounding. She is also filled with the lovely, blond, sensitive wife of the count, Elga (Paula Corday, who is sometimes called Rita Corday), and the two close friends of the count, played by those two actors we met in the fifties. in costume, John Hoyt and Michael Ansara. There is a dangerous hunt for the leopard, forbidden kisses, joint servants, wooden plates creaking and swaying in the cold wind and venom in a glass. Not least, Dr. Meissen (Karloff) has a special vial full of a drug that will slow down bodily functions that death seems to have occurred. The risk is ... well, when the person wakes up ten hours later, it's best if he is not stuck in his coffin. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, for all the clich√©s, The Black Castle keeps moving happily. The movie takes itself seriously, but it's done enough to keep our interest, even if we end up sitting with a smile while watching. It is comforting, in a way, to notice that there are strong echoes of The Most Dangerous Game. When Burton realizes just how crazy von Bruno is, he becomes even more determined to bring von Bruno to account. And, of course, he fell in love with Elga. von Bruno, maddened by vengeance still astute and capable, is a man who loves hunting and is engorged by slaughter. Hollywood's second creative rule has always been, "If you're going to steal, steal the best." The first creative rule, of course, is "If you will steal, steal the best and turn them into liver sausages". The Black Castle is a good bite of the Austrian braunschweiger.
