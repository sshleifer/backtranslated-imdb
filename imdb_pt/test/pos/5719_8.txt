I've never seen any of John Leguizamo standing before seeing Freak, and after seeing her again in the HBO comedy recently, it was better, more lively and with things that, at age 14, I could not understand before. Spike Lee did an excellent job, keeping the visual angle on a par with Leguizamo's theatricality and personal narrative style; it is substance and style merging, but discreetly. We have Leguizamo's complaints about race and sex (the sex parts are classic), but a lot of it is about family, and what's still fresh in my mind is about his father. Even when things get dark in some of the stories, there is something new or crazy or random that Leguizamo pulls to make a laugh, and this works more often than not. If something falls by surprise (for me anyway), it may be the tic of your personality here and there. But overall, it's kind of fun stuff that is not intoxicating but is so true to itself that it burns. Find him if he can!
