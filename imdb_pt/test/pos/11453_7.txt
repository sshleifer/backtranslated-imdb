A group of obnoxious teenagers goes to a former funeral home for a Halloween party. They get trapped inside and become possessed by demons who have awakened accidentally. The possessed teenagers begin to kill others and appear to be led by Angela (Mimi Kinkade), who floats and speaks in a very deep voice. Teens who have not yet been possessed are forced to fight the demons and try to escape the house. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty decent horror movie with great special effects that include Linnea Quigley (who has some nudity as usual) pulling out a guy's eyeballs and pushing a tube of lipstick into his nipple. There is also a scene where a couple have sex in a coffin and a guy who is biting his tongue. This is a great movie to watch with a lot of friends late at night while eating pizza. The terrible atrocious and atrocious dialogue almost ruins everything. Overall, I would give it a 7 out of 10.
