a very good episode, though not as devastating as the end of the first season. The idea of ​​doing a flashback of Desmond worked very well, and Henry Ian Cusick was fantastic, perhaps putting the best performance of the whole series, but my only complaint would be the plot line Michael felt much like a subplot, and after three minutes from the previous episode, I thought it would characterize more. But the strength of the character and the performance of Cusicks ended it. the plot developments, as always, left more questions than answers, such as who the others are, something we do not yet know, and where Jack, Sawyer, and Kate are taking. What was the white light, what impact did it have? Locke, Eko and Desmond are dead? like the destroyed hatch around them. If they are, it would be a big mistake because these three are the most interesting characters and the series would suffer without them and Terry O'Quinn has been fantastic in both series like Locke. An appropriate end to a series better than the first.
