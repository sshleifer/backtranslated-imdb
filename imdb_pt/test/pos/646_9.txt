I love this little movie, which reminds me a little of the original Japanese jewelry, SHOULD WE DANCE? (not the exaggerated Gere / Jlo remake ...). Luckily I found it and recorded it when it was appearing on a STARZ Promo Weekend because, as far as I know, it's not available on DVD. I'm going to watch anything with Yancy Butler (anyone remembers the short TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???), and she looks positively at it. She does a dance routine for a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy HOT !! I loved all the other characters, especially those played by Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron (where she's been all those years?). This is one of those movies that I shoot from time to time and I always leave smiling after watching. Highly recommended !!!
