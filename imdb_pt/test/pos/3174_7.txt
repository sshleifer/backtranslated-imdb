An extremely realistic, well-done and "Western" Rodeo. No rehearsed star needed here, since all the cast members were ordinary people telling a real-life story about a rodeo villain and his entourage in the '60s and' 70s from the west. But especially for the Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature, especially considering the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere role of a clown as he dealt profoundly with all the ups and downs of hard-driving rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so often surrounds this lifestyle. He and Mr. Coburn have come together very well as partners, not just on the circuit itself, but also in the real world outside the corral. Also, check out Anne Archer as Coburn's Native American love interest in the latter part of the film. It must have been one of your first roles. <br /> <br /> Not so flamboyant, perhaps, as "Junior Bonner", but also rendering and impacting on his portrait. Thanks to Encore Western Channel for showing this true story of an underrated film from time to time.
