I saw The Reader at Sugar, which is not the ideal place to see anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well intertwined and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and his team well. But it was the story and the delivery that really made that brief glow. Duncan Rogers' tight script was exactly what tonight's shorts needed. He did not wander, as various offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was a simple story at its best, well launched by Rogers and beautifully rendered. Duncan Rogers is obviously a director with the ability to put together all the pieces, I look forward to your next completed project. K.
