Otto Preminger was one of the great independent film directors. Like John Huston he was a character in one of his own films, like Mr. Huston, he was a wonderful ham that came and went randomly, but the end product of his work was unmistakably his own. With few exceptions, movies are now made by corporations, not by individuals, and as a result are usually highly polished "packages," a product in much the same way as a golf ball, a dog food can, or a car. of humans in the process is almost incidental. Such is the appetite for the product that there seems to be no end to the line of well-finished, brilliant, superficially entertaining but ultimately empty films that flood the countless TV channels and movies. There is no time for a man like Mr. Preminger to stand a little far from the torrent of "product" and create a personal work of art. Of course, there was always the "spirit of art for art - money for Christ's sake" in filmmaking, but now "Ars Gratia Artis" was, in almost all names, consigned to the floor of the editing room of the story. Today, Otto Preminger would be lucky to get a job delivering pizzas in Hollywood. Half a century ago, having made the immensely influential "Laura," "Where the Sidewalk Ends," and "The Moon is Blue," he began filming Nelson Algren's controversial novel, "The Man with the Golden Arm," in his eccentric and individualistic. Instead of taking his camera to the streets, he stayed in the studio and used stylized quasi-Expressionist ensembles, peculiar cast (Mr. Frank Sinatra - hot from his success in "From Here to Eternity", the young, inexperienced but incredibly beautiful Miss Kim Novak and Arnold Stang, a man whose oddities were behind his own heart) and a remarkable Elmer Bernstein era-defining track with the participation of West Coast jazzmen. A film by Otto Preminger has always been a complete experience, to be considered as a whole, instead of dividing it into acting, direction, photography. What appeared on the screen was Preminger's vision, his creation and his interpretation of Algren's novel, not a film from Algren's novel, any of the twenty competent Hollywood hacks produced it. From the first beat of the hi-hat accompanying Saul Bass's iconic sequence of titles, we are drawn to Preminger's opinion of what is now called "The Life," in fact an obscure area occupied by cheaters, addicts, police , stone peddlers, jazz musicians, their wives and hangers. The lines are blurred in "Life," and the dog eats dogs downstairs. The inhabitants circle each other like sharks, looking for a sign of weakness to be explored. Frankie Machine (Mr. Sinatra), a professional card dealer, former drug addict and aspiring jazz drummer, is a born victim. When things get tough, he comes back to the house. Although he manages to eat cold turkey, there is absolutely no guarantee that he will not come straight back along the line. Sinatra's portrayal of an addict in the midst of retreat has divided critics, but the fact is that even fifty years later most of us probably have never seen such a thing in real life, so we do not know how accurate reality is. portraits is. When I first saw the film in the late 50's I was very impressed, watching it recently on video, it seems, to put it rudely hammy. Perhaps it is a victim of its own success as many actors later "doing" The cold turkey has, over the years, taken its performance and refined a little. Arnold Stang is excellent as Machine Pal's friend Pal, a performance he excelled only in "It's a crazy, crazy, crazy, and crazy world." Try to see it on the big screen and see it as the cinematic vision of a true author, a giant among today's pygmies - Otto Preminger.
