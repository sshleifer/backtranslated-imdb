The other reviewers are out of WAAAAY mode because the Farscape show was (temporarily) set to rest. It has nothing to do with the quality of 'slacking' shows. In fact, the exact OPOSTA is true. They kept getting better! :) I've seen all the episodes and when you just watch them in order, you really get impressed at how cool it gets as they move, and the wormhole & aeryn subplots are really very interesting and give you more vibe, no any less . Before it was kind of chaotic, slow and aimless. They spent like the first two seasons running that kind of enemy, but within two seconds they were really trying to do something :) Also I've never seen such a fun mix of girls and sexy attitudes in Sci-Fi. The blue girl - Zahn - was cool but not sexy. They literally got to the point where the girls were running around in leather corsets and high heels blowing up aliens - now tell me, what could be cooler than that? :) <br /> <br /> The real reason Farscape fired was because it was costing a lot - and that's a good thing for fans, because the show, watched end-to-end, is really like a movie 60-hour epic with all the blockbuster kinematics (okay okay they use a lot of similar games, but the CG is great and the girls are sexxxy). <br /> Blah blah - o The real reason is because TV shows are about profit. It's a BUSINESS, and the Sci Fi channel, or who was not getting as great a return from this expensive Farscape program as they could with garbage shows like 'Stargate'. Lexx was really cool until they got rid of the hot German girl and replaced her with that bizarre, fat-lipped oddity. <br /> <br /> Anyway yes, remember: Farscape kept getting better and better, until it was really like a real little movie every week. So the networks decided, "Hey, people are going to watch anything old we've played in the air, as long as it's the only science fiction thing at the time, so why are we spending all this money on Farscape?" budget 'Stargate' down the throat of people and call it a 'hit series' because that's how we all play damn night LOL :)) <br /> <br /> That's how it goes. I also have to tell you that Claudia Black is a really cool actress. After she'd had her facelift (with wide-set eyes), she was looking pretty cool - one of those dynamic types like Judy Davis, and sometimes hot, sometimes ugly - like a roller coaster. I would stop Claudia Black with Lucy Lawless in style and substance - both VERY fun to watch - not just Chrichton :) And yes, you can say that the pregnancy thing was extravagant, but how many science fiction shows have a romantic and deep subplot that does it really go somewhere and progress? It was legitimately legal as a romance story - the actors in the show are great. It's really a shame the show is in limbo for now, but I hope it comes back in more episodes soon and movies too, because I'll buy them deffinately! :-D
