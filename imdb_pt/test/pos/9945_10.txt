When I was growing up, Voyage into Space was my favorite movie. I remember the time when KTLA (Channel 5) filmed the movie all week long and I and my sisters watched every day! I still remember every part of this movie. The ending was so sad when Giant Robot was blown up along with Guillotine and then watching Johnny Sokko with all the tears streaming down his face calling for Giant Robot. There should have been a continuation of the film, in which the giant robot somehow survived the explosion. :) I can not believe there are so many other Voyage into Space fans out there. I really want to buy the movie when it's released on DVD, but my sister said the ones that are out there are now pirated and probably poor copies of the movie. I do not know why they have not released yet, more than 40 years ago. I think Voyage into Space was made in 1968. Just now, my second all-time favorite Japanese monster movie (The Gargantuan War) is finally coming out on DVD and being released on September 9 and I can not wait! :) Now if only they would do the same with Voyage into Space. Robot Giant, Johnny Sokko and Voyage to Space will never be forgotten! In my eyes and probably many others too, it will always be a childhood classic for me! :)
