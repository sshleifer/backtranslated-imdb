In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of the animation with the release of the first part of their series "Silly Symphonies", "The Skeleton Dance". Iwerks and Disney were collaborating together since the early 1920s on Disney's "Laugh-O-Gram" cartoon series; however, his friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted a bid from a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. This was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued to develop his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog). While his work maintained the same high quality, it was not very popular and in 1936 the studio was closed. Later that year, Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures, and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color. The Skeleton Frolics of 1937 is essentially a remake of the 1929 classic film "The Skeleton Dance," the film that fame and fortune. Like this short film, it is placed in an abandoned graveyard, where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play. The dead rise from their coffins, ready for the show that is about to begin, as a group of skeletons formed an orchestra and begins to play a happy tune. Now it is not easy to be a musician made of bones only, since some members of the orchestra have problems with their body parts, however, the band manages to make a good show and another group of skeletons begins to dance. A lovely couple of them face the same problems that upset the orchestra: it is difficult to dance with loose parts of the body. It all ends at dawn, and when the sun is about to rise again, the skeletons run to their graves. Directed and animated by Ub Iwerks himself, "Skeleton Frolics" faithfully follows the pattern established by "The Skeleton Dance" years before, although with one crucial difference: Iwerks made the entire film in Technicolor. The shimmering shades allowed Iwerks to create a visually more appealing film, and also used the many new techniques he had practiced since leaving Disney, creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he had conceived before. It's certainly a more experimental film than "The Skeleton Dance," although, unfortunately, that does not necessarily mean a better movie. For starters, the film is virtually identical to what it did with Disney, with the only differences being music (more on that later) and color effects. It looks beautiful, no doubt, but it definitely seems kind of uninspired, after all. <br /> <br /> However, it is not the lack of originality of the concept that actually harms the film (after all, Iwerks performs a wonderful way), but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is rather uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and capricious fun of Carl W. Stalling's "The Skeleton Dance." In other words, while DeNat's music is effective and appropriate to the theme, it's easy to forget quickly, while Stalling's music has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a musical movie, this is of great importance, and so the mediocrity of the music brings Iwerk's impeccable work of animation. Personally, I think with a better musical accompaniment, "Skeleton Frolics" would be fondly remembered as "The Skeleton Dance, although not as innovative as it is still a fun movie to watch. It's unfortunate that most of the work that Iwerks did after leaving Disney is now forgotten due to its poor success, however, it must be said that if it lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (Disney's main rival), he did not miss it of the quality of Probably it was just a case of bad luck that made the man who gave life to the Disney rat for the first time to face the failure of Disney.Despite its shortcomings, "Skeleton Frolics" is very funny and visually breathtaking The film, which although not exactly the most original and new film (one can not help thinking of "The Skeleton Dance" while watching), definitely reminds us that Iwerk skeletons are still here to haunt us in to inspire them. <br /> <br /> 8/10
