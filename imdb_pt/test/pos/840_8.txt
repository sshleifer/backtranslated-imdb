Many consider BEAST STABLE as the last of the real FEMALE PRISONER films, as it is the last of the series directed by Shunya Ito, and is followed by another film (GRUDGE SONG) by a different director. I have not yet seen the GRUDGE SONG (but it will soon ...), so I do not know how it compares to the previous FP movies - but it will be interesting to see. The way the BEAST STABLE ended did not leave much room for another predecessor - but I think I'll find out ... <br /> <br /> This entry has Scorpion running away from the police, where she connects with a street whore who ends up pregnant with your retarded brother (oh yeah - this is no lie ... you have to love those despicable stories). Scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old rival, but (as she is so good at ...) she eventually escapes and takes revenge on some people who cheated on some of her prostitutes friends ... <br /> <br /> I agree with some other reviewers, that this is a bit slower in points and more "serious" then the previous two entries. The story is a bit confusing and sometimes complicated, but many of these 70's films are - and I still love them. BEAST STABLE is very bad in the nudity area which was quite disappointing - but I thought it is strong in other areas - plot, cinematography, some good sleaze, etc ... Definitely worth it for fans of this kind of thing, or that have enjoyed the other films of the FEMALE PRISONER ... 8/10
