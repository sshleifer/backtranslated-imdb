If you ignore the fact that the plot was done many times, this is a cartoon Looney Tunes hilarious and happily enjoyable. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds are so detailed and bold colors too. The writing is extremely sharp, and the blows of vision, especially those of Daffy, constantly being plucked from the head, are brilliantly timed. I really loved the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love that Daffy is really greedy and unpleasant to be incredibly funny. I prefer him when he's manic, but he's a lot of fun here too. Bugs is still his charming and grumpy, and Elmer is funny if he's dumb too. In short, this is absolutely brilliant, and in fact my personal favorite trilogy of hunting for pure entertainment value. 10/10 Bethany Cox
