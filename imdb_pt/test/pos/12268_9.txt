This movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. The dialogue is clear, the pace is fast. This is not just a clever comedy, it's an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes of the television news. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny lines ... some of my favorites: <Ernie Merriman: (sarcastically) It must be cool to always believe that you know best, always think you are the smartest person in the room. Jane: (seriously) NO, it's not, it's horrible! <br /> <br /> Aaron: He must be cute. Jane: How do you know that? Aaron: Nobody invites an evil idiot into your room! <br /> <br /> The performances of Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks and William Hurt were absolutely brilliant! Even years later, I remember this movie well. Often overlooked is the wonderfully funny Joan Cusack! I love the scene the editorial staff is running to meet a deadline. There are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite. I highly recommend this movie.
