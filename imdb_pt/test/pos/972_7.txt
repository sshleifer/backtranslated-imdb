This is not a life-changing movie; it's not an epic or something. But it's fun and fun. It's a movie that the whole family can watch together and at the moment there are few movies suitable for kids who DO NOT have a love story! He tells a good story in a light way, without trying to dazzle the audience with exaggerated special effects, like many movies these days. It has a pretty good acting, and all the music that was used fits in well with the movie's content. The acting is very good too, the actors seem comfortable and believable in their surroundings and, most importantly, the jokes are really funny. I would recommend it for people of all ages - certainly made me laugh. :)
