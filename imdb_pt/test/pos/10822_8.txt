Even if I do not give more than the previous posts here (like the very good Ruby Liang) I wanted to share my own point of view. I hope my English is understandable. Good trip is a rhythmic presentation, light but profound, of the disorganized French disorganization, but also of courage and charm. Along a brilliantly reconstructed 1940s France with many details (Bordeaux's luxurious hotel occupied by the HQ Government and attacked by useless French high-class, to Parisian cafes near Le Pantheon / rue Mouffetard and 1930's cars) Gérard Depardieu and Yvan Attal give their second roles a bright taste;) Isabelle Adjani and Virgnie Ledoyen are very credible in their dramatically different roles, and Grégori Derangère makes a lovely performance :) <br /> <br /> Much lighter than the average (eg American) times of war in the movies and focused on civilians, Bon voyage shows a lot of things about French issues (even for a French guy like me), some of them very deep.
