To consider the film as nothing more than a documentary about skateboarding would fail to recognize several important aspects of Dogtown. Peralta (a well-known skateboarder) has created a film that not only deals with birth as we know it today as skateboarding but also examines the socio-cultural and economic circumstances in which this sport emerged and won a great appeal. In addition, his film is quite personal: Peralta's firsthand association with this cultural phenomenon serves both as an informed cinematic investigator and as a participant-subject involved. In this role he is a partisan "observer-participant", bringing together a wide range of personalities who were part of this movement and those who were deeply affected by the advent of skateboarding as a competitive sport and subculture. The film employs a unique stylistic form of film and sound editing, and the narration (by Sean Penn) and interviews take a genuine, untested form that is similar to the anarchic and nihilistic surfing spirit on the sidewalk. The film exhibits the kinetic appeal of an extended music video, seasoned with the sensitivity of an archaeologist to the importance of time, place and circumstance.
