As an end-of-course patron of the drive-in kids (1970-1980), there are many movies I've seen and forgotten. This is one I could never forget. Despite its low-budget exploration style, STORY was very well done. Isolated asylum therapy, where patients stage their fantasies to help heal their phicose, the accidental murder of the chief physician as soon as the new nurse arrives at the scene, the (presumed) attending physician, the various crazy patients, the revelation that the attending physician is really a patient, and finally the rescue of the young nurse by the simple Sam, who killed everyone else in the house so that she could escape unscathed, made a HISTORY, which held the film together. I emphasized the word HISTORY because that's what makes a movie good or great. No matter how much blood, nudity, nudity, sexual affair or outrageous behavior you put into a movie, if the story is not good, then the movie is not good. The movie credits show clips of all the actors, including the old witch with the last sentence telling you to leave and never come back, which is a great ending to this movie. If you are on video / DVD, watch and enjoy.
