FBI agents Mulder and Scully are assigned to investigate the mystery of what happened to an Arctic drill team in this' X-Files' episode that David Duchovny himself considers one of the first rockin 'episodes. It is a loving homage to John Carpenter's highly acclaimed 1982 film The Thing, and we can see the similarities. Visually, color schemes and lighting combine to give the story an infernal quality. Production design / art direction are especially impressive; the scenes from the outside of the Arctic camp are so reminiscent of the previous film that they automatically create déjà vu feelings for some viewers. Of course, our heroes are threatened by the weather, so the design of the sound, enveloping the wind, evokes memories of "The Thing". <br /> <br /> The culprit is an old worm that had been exposed to the team; once inside a host, stimulates aggressive behavior. This allows the paranoia aspect to hold up, and the way the script is created we can not be sure who is infected and who is not. This gives rise to the inevitable test scene. This episode certainly works on portraying the way tensions can cause collapses in groups. It even allows Mulder and Scully to have times when they are not sure if they can trust each other. <br /> <br /> Invited stars are a good group of actors: Xander Berkeley, Felicity Huffman and Steve Hytner as the scientists forced to accompany Mulder and Scully on the mission, and Jeff Kober as the pilot who takes them to the field. You may also see Ken Kirzinger, the portraitist of Jason Voorhees once, as one of the ill-fated team members. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, there is a direct link between 'Ice' and 'The Thing': art director Graeme Murray. , who worked on both projects. <br /> <br /> 8/10
