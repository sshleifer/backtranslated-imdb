I returned from Morocco then, where my father was connected to the German embassy, ​​when the film left in Europe; I took all my friends to see them, to show them the beauty of the country, where Jimi had touched - and stayed -; where the hippies stopped after leaving Ibiza and before joining Goa. Sean Combs recently celebrated at a friends restaurant in Marrakech, Djema el Fna was much wilder in those days than it is now; the Stones went there earlier, Brian recorded in Tangier; so it's memories and family entertainment and I'm glad that my son will know about North Africa watching this movie. Candice Bergen looks beautiful and oo7 / Connery is pretty funny indeed; and Teddy Roosevelt played by Brian Keith quite impressive.
