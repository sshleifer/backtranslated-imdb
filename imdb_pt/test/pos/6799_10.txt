It's a beautiful movie. The scenes are well illustrated. Anne Revere's dialogues are very well written and inspiring, the philosophy and thoughts that this film gives and the things it teaches make it great and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney is great in the movie and his role goes through a lot of emotional turbulence as the movie progresses. <br /> Elizabeth Taylor looks very handsome, her scenes in the film are inherently poetic, the way the camera accompanies her and the way the music makes you feel making every ethereal scene beautiful. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is a lot of fun in her role. though unrecognizable, if you saw her in the role of 'm' in the 'Candidate of Manchuria'. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp played the role of his father with complete justice and the script offers him many things to justify his role. <br /> <br /> It's a very good movie and you need to watch for family and kids to be a Christmas favorite.
