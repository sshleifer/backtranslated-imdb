The first words spoken of Garbo in this movie of 1930 electrified the public and became part of the legend of Hollywood. Garbo had become a star in his first American film, The Torrent in 1926. And the audience waited until the movie to see if Garbo could make the transition to talkies. She did. And while Pola Negri, Vilma Banky and Renee Adoree fell by the wayside because of their accents, Garbo sailed for another decade. Despite the staging of this film, Garbo is really excellent, especially in the opening scene with the equally great Marie Dressler as Marthy. The two big stars exchange dirty looks and sharp words as they measure themselves as they sip on some drinks and set the tone for the rest of the film. Garbo was 25 years old; Dressler was 60 years old. Charles Bickford is just like Matt, and George F. Marion is good as Old Chris. Marion originated this role in Broadway in 1922 and also touched on the silent version of 1923 with Blanche Sweet. This piece by Eugene O'Neill is a true classic, but strangely, it was never filmed again. Anna Christie ranks as one of Garbo's greatest performances. And despite the boldness of the film and the cruelty of the story, it really is a marvel. See this one for Garbo and Dressler!
