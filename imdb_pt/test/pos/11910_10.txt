I do not understand how people can not like this movie. You have Gossit Jr., the boy who played the lead character in Stand By Me, Sean Astin and many other great actors. Lots of action and fun that you do not see in today's movies anymore. It's really a shame. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated movie that is among other great movies like Let's Get Harry. The '80s and early' 90s created movies so good that they will never be outdated by today's standards. <br /> <br /> They have somehow tried to recreate this movie in Masterminds, but they ended up with a very bad acting. The only thing the movie had was Patrick Stewart, but obviously that was not enough.
