Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Yes, it is difficult to keep your mind away from this attractive beauty (giving a radiant and perfect performance), since it simply speaks openly. 'One Night at McCool's' is a comedy of dark humor and daring with stylish old tones but with a chaotic and intelligent narrative that has three men coveting women and she is doing it to her advantage. When you see Tyler, is not it any wonder why they're in love and doing anything? that's all to see 'her' happy and live 'her' dreams. Like Tyler, there's something quite heady about this feature in which we see the likes of Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser (which is great) and especially Michael Douglas (who plays the killer hired with cool-ease but a questionable hairstyle) really having fun with their roles. The conspiracy plot opens with the three main characters (Dillon, Goodman and Reiser) telling their story of how they came to find this divine presence and the possible effects it is having on them to lead to an insane climax. There is an unpredictable chain of events (ranging from fruity to sensual), where everything would virtually unite with a certain irony (snowball) of fate for the characters (who see them leaving their comfort zone reserved to fulfill this girl). Howard Zwart's direction is colorful, balancing the script's quick fire jokes and frantically amusing, if complicated situations. One of the best comedies under the radar in the last decade, which will have you under Tyler's thumb.
