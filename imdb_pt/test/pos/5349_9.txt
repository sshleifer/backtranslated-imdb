My only problem with The Curse of the Rabbit-of-Beings is that the film does not take time to present Wallace and Gromit to those unfamiliar with Park's short films. Strangely, "A Close Shave" manages to do this with much less time to spare. Still, I loved seeing the boys back in action and loved all the new characters, human or not. I particularly loved the voice of Ralph Fiennes as the intriguing Victor Quartermaine. It's also interesting to see the series on the big screen. The finish with the clay characters really stands out. It's a joke and great for the whole family! I buy very few DVDs, but I have all Wallace and Gromit and thank you for adding this.
