There are so many episodes that make me howl about the stories that I would like to be able to choose the best, Rocko and Bill create a strange couple that is beyond help but can interpret the victim and BS leave a difficult time just to drag Dan into his life of crime. <br /> <br /> Canadians will note the strange joke to Toronto or the federal government, and why the CBC did a good show with the Frantics. Dan was a part, the show gives a shot in them and in the episode "Dan's Umbrella", the CBC is swept by embers. When Dan says the CBC would never waste taxpayers' money on a useless venture, Rocko walks into the room and gives Dan his Friday-Night tape with Ralph Benmurgue, this show was a flop, and most of people would not understand the joke unless they knew the history of the CBC to do shows that people do not watch that they watch.
