Every Sunday is a short eleven-minute affair with the talents of two of his young junior players, a pair that would develop into prominent players in the future. It's interesting and fun to see the contrasting styles of Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin as they perform at a Sunday concert for Deanna's uncle. <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody knew how big these two girls would be. I always wondered why Mayer kept Garland and let Durbin go to Universal. LB. always had pretensions of culture and this was the guy who had Jeanette MacDonald in his studio and later hired so lovely voices of soprano like Jane Powell, Ann Blyth, Doretta Morrow, etc. <br /> <br /> Judy certainly had her glorious career at MGM, but she paid a heavy price for it. Deanna, along with Abbott & Costello and several gothic horror monsters preserved Universal images. She was smart enough to come out on top and make him stick. <br /> <br /> So, on your salad days, Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland.
