How often do you watch a movie of any kind that has a talent show with refreshments? Waldo's last stand is a soda. Here Waldo is selling lemonade, but he is not making money. Alfalfa, Spanky, Darla, Mickey and Buckwheat come to visit him, which is ironic because in both 3 men in a bathtub and came to Brawn where there was competition between Alfafa and Waldo for the affection of Darla. Back to story: The Gang relishes the lemonade to see if Waldo did the right thing. A funny moment is when Alfalfa gets a glass of lemonade and fills in Waldo and gives to Darla and Alfalfa has a look of anger on his face. Spanky proposes a show on the floor to accompany the lemonade and even Mickey agrees to be so cute. When the show starts, there's no one in the barn, but a customer walks in (Froggy). Spanky asks if he wants lemonade, but all he does is nod his head. Spanky asks him time figures in the short and every time Froggy waves without Spanky displays many expressions on his face which is funny. Spanky tries many ways to make you thirsty. One way is when, after Mickey, he said so sweetly, "These crackers are salty and made me thirsty." There are also many musical bits entertain is so short. The opening number is from Darla, who plays dances and sings. The second includes Alfafa singing off-key (as usual) with Mickey, Leonard, Spanky and Buckwheat on "How dry I am!" (I believe they sing this to make Froggy thirsty.) It also made me laugh.) The final number includes boys and girls dressed the old way. This was Waldo's last short, Our Gang. A great musical that is pure 10 out of 10.
