"Dead Man Walking" is an incredible movie. All the acting is high-level and realistic, and the script examines the issue of the death penalty on both sides, paying equal homage to both. Above all, this is a deeply moving story of redemption, death with dignity, and loss of ego. Any movie that bravely and maturely deals with it with an incredibly difficult subject deserves a rating of 10/10. Thanks, Tim Robbins!
