Well ... I would not like to give a talk to anyone, but I feel like saying some things that I consider important about this beautiful movie. I first saw it in 1976 (I was 14 years old) and then again one year later. That's it. The rest was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack, taking music and history deeper and deeper into my heart. How deep? A week ago, my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a gift. (No DVD yet). Boy .... I was surprised !! Poets have always held that deep experiences of childhood and adolescence of beauty, love, God, idealistic pursuits, remain with you forever. Since they occur primarily at the level of the heart (without intellect yet!), They define the contours of their soul as a sculptor would do with a stone. If we sometimes do not tend to forget how right they are, perhaps we would be better at understanding the meaning of every minute, every decision, every turning point in our lives. <br /> <br /> So, I confess that I feel nostalgia. But the fascinating part of this is watching the movie again and, through that time travel, enriching that understanding of why we, the people of the 60s, grew as we did. The spirit of those times is all here: a Genesis created far from the official world of economic and consumer success, make love not to quarrel, beautiful pop ballads, poetry of letters, a totally romantic view of teenage rebellion with the awakening of carefully wrapped sexuality in tender and chaste love, these two solitary spirits still filled with childlike innocence growing together as they learn to compromise and become "grown-ups." <br /> <br /> I showed the film to a group of young people from school and they were so full of simplistic and cynical comments that they considered him naive and foolish. Guys, be serious !! Cinema is an art and, as art, reflects not only human emotions, but also historical moments. And that's exactly what "Friends" does in a masterful way. It reflects an idyllic idea of ​​rebellion and new beginning that we all dreamed of when we were fifteen. Now I'm a musician and I feel like some of us artists still dream about it !! How else could we live? This is "Friends", which is "Brother Sun Sister Moon" which is "Hair". Those were the times, still strangers to AIDS, oblivious to explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs without melody, to pornography presented as "sexuality," to this new barbarian "world order" that grew after 9/11. What a comforting experience to see Paul and Michelle again, timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world. What a trip to the heart of our hearts: to Paris, to Elton John at his best, to that urban setting surrounded by 2 CV Citroëns and the VW Beetles. What fresh air from the peaceful house in Camargue, surrounded by fishing ponds and wild horses. They made us who we are, like Serrat in Spain, Brel in France, Peter Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Luther King, the Beatles, the first Bee Gees, the Spirituals of Belafonte, Gandhi, the Gospel of Elvis. <br /> <br /> People still wait: take this picture. Start with innocence and grow from there. You will find out what all this is. And from there you will have a solid and truer base; some ideals to look for in life, a way of dealing with personal and world affairs. We need that much today! Give yourself the chance and maybe one day the time for the cynics will be over. (I have an extra copy of VHS) <br /> <br /> Santiago Zuleta. Bogotá, Colombia.
