Imaginative, fast, satirical! Americans do 'zany', but the English do 'witty' - and they love to mock themselves (aha: unattractive teeth, big lips / nose, common veddy or 'veddy' snobs, obsession with 'gahden' ). Inner jokes for older people in the audience, lots of action for kids. Subtle use of devices from other classic films (see 'Back to the Future', 'Indiana Jones', 'Harvey', 'Tremors' ... and more). In addition, a great movie of friends (Gromit is a quiet but ingenious partner). Add brilliant voice work by Bonham-Carter and Fiennes (is it true? The best acting these days is being done in animation?) - have fun! I saw it with the grandchildren. Fun time for all. - canuckteach
