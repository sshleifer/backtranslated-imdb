Watching "Plots with a View" (called "Undertaking Betty" in the US), I felt that there must be more films filmed in Wales. It portrays a woman (Brenda Blethyn) in a small Welsh town trying to escape from her betraying husband. So she and the undertaker (Alfred Molina) come up with a plan ... but there will probably be some shortcomings along the way. <br /> <br /> I would say Christopher Walken's character is the cleanest in the movie (how could he not be?). But overall, the whole idea is just a really cool one, with a few "uh oh" moments ... especially the haunted house scene. It's the kind of movie I'd like to be able to get into, just to experiment. <br /> <br /> Also starring Lee Evans, Naomi Watts and Miriam Margoyles.
