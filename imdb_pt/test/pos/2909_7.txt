One can not help but be impressed by the intelligence and scale of this film, and at the same time disappointed by the lost opportunities. <br /> <br /> I found the script to be excellent, and Edmund Purdom's vocal talent quite impressive. However, as an artifact of his time, the film suffers from many Hollywood-isms, especially bad cast, very exuberant sets, and a lot of pretense. Edmund Purdom (who plays the title character) is so obviously clumsy with physical acting, I suspect he was first in Shakespeare's theater before that. <br /> <br /> So if movie people are reading this, I propose this as a great candidate for a remake, especially if you cast real Egyptians as Egyptians!
