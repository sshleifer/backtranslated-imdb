Generated is black and white distorted images. It looks like it could have come from the nineteenth century. However, the sound is crystalline, minus the synchrony and the addition of quiet sounds of nature. <br /> <br /> This movie was very critical of the struggles of life. It shows a single mother and child in a violent world that thrives on the innocent. The mother is very alien to her surroundings. This leads to much torture, pain and death. You can watch it many times and see different symbolisms, plotting devices and basically "what does that mean?". <br /> <br /> If you like art in movies then you will love it. Otherwise, do not bother.
