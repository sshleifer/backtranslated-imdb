Should we take the opening photo as a strange picture? I think we have to do it. Anyway, two women are after a closing umbrella, they go up to the talent agency and we go with them ... and then they will never be seen again. Okay, how come you do not get in the place, at the piano, or even out with the piano sound, then follow in and along, Ã  la Hitchcock ??? So I think Clouzot is already telling us in a not very subliminal way that we are following a segment of postwar society: especially as he uses a Citizen Kane type song cut in about five pieces to show the lady singing traveling of the talent agency all the way to his first roses and applause from his debut in Vaudeville. <br /> <br /> After that, we are implacable observers of more or less disgusting details of a defeated country coming out of its knees torn by the war. And no one has ever dealt with little better displeasure than Clouzot. In fact, it was a shame he never experienced Sartre's Nausea. Almost everything we see after the first few minutes makes us a little queasy. .... ok, okay, I'm exaggerating, let's settle for a general feeling of the movie. Look closely, in fact, and you'll even see one of the cops nudging your nose. And in how many movies has anyone done it. Then there is a very loud nose blowing in front of the lesbian photographer by the main police officer, and note that she does not literally blink an eye or raise an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> The point of all this is an almost feverish immersion in contiguity, apparently, until you can smell almost every scene, as well as see and feel them. <br /> <br /> As for the other aspects of the film, others here approached them in much more detail than I did. But forget the mystery here: this is the last McGuffin. Clouzot is as interested in the real killer as those two women who come out of the rain in the first seconds of the movie and are never seen again. From beginning to end all he wanted to do was follow a lot of people around, not even particularly interesting, and say, here, look at the contraction of this woman, the man who hitched his pants in all its insignificance, years and years. years before Tina Turner was singing, we do not need another hero. <br /> <br /> Even the forced lightness of the end is weakly made in a dilapidated part of Paris, and rather cold walled apartment naked. With only couples loving each other to see them, as if to say that there must be two or three million like you throughout the city, working their fingers every day for a little love at night. <br /> <br /> From that, it was only a small step for Wages of Fear and the ultimate in despair. <br /> <br /> They do not even know how to make movies like that in the US. In fact, they did not even know much about it in France, let alone now. The relentless detail of the gesture makes even the neorealists in Italy seem like bad psychologists. What I think makes Clouzot a sort of Rosselini at speed. Very nice nonsense, this movie. The only flaw, it seems to me, and as pointed out by another viewer, the main woman is not quite right. Everyone else in the movie is pretty much perfect.
