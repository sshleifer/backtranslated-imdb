Sorry to see that it was rated low by many people. The series started very well and after the first season was not so good. <br /> <br /> People tend to forget the beginning of something and just look to the end. This is not good to do, you should look at the total, not the end result. It's sad that many of the "usual" characters have died, but dammit, we had a lot of nice NEW characters. <br /> <br /> Please do not stick to some characters, but join the series, the plot. Please understand that I did not like it when Boone died, when Augur died, but well ... this needs to be done. Can you imagine that everyone continues to live the whole series when they are in danger all the time? Come on, man, if they did not die they'd be invincible. In this way you will always maintain the tension, it will survive, it will die? I realize that people bond with characters, I also do that. My favorite character was Augur, the only one who could get into all the computers he wanted. He was the only one who was mysterious, he could do things with the computer that no one else could do. <br /> <br /> I would like to make a statement to all people who vote negative, does a series that started so well deserve to have such a low rating? Should we look at the final season instead of the total? Should not we see how good the show was when it started? Should not we see how much we like?
