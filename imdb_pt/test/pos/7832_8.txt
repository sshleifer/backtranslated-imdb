Ok first, if you are not a fan of any low budget horror genre, then do not bother with it. You really need to be a fan to get the gag. <br /> <br /> The movement is basically about snakes .. on a train. A lot of them. <br /> <br /> There is an ancient curse involved and a crazy ending that I will not ruin. The bloody effect is full and real disgusting ... but the movie is mostly a bloody big gag about snakes scaring the hell out of a group of people stuck on a train. <br /> <br /> The suspense is accumulated well and there are some memorable scenes and well composed .. some of the acting is a bit hammy (see the surf dudes), but that's not really the point ... Give this movie a go. Know what to expect and you will not regret it!
