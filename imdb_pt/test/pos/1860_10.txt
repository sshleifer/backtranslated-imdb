I believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of Darwin's many misconceptions, pro and con. I would say that the real man is pictured here without sterility. He is what he is. Although the film is just a photo of the man, the technique of storytelling has expanded his life well beyond the years of the film. This is a profound film, a consideration of modern life and the way we think, and can provoke a study of the man whose thoughts (and others who have used them) have certainly affected our lives. There are some movies in which the historical context is so great that it is the main job of the actors to get out of the way. The story took the day and the actors did their job. Good work for them, I say.
