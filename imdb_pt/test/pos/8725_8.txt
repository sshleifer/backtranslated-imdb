Well, I would say this is a very nice and touching film, despite its flaws. I did not believe for one minute that Matthau knew the first thing about being a dentist. In addition, Hawn's character seemed to recover from suicidal depression early in the film. Not to mention that the whole thing looked ridiculous. However, the film succeeds due to a good pace, humor and its stars. Matthau may not have been a dentist, but he was as fun as he used to be. Bergman brought a lot of sensitivity to the film (especially during the scene where she and Matthau go out for a drink after work) and also a good deal of humor. I believe it was her performance that made my brother take notice of this movie after listening to some scenes. Hawn's performance is noteworthy, though an Oscar may have ended up doing it a little. Basically, do not take this movie too seriously and you will enjoy it.
