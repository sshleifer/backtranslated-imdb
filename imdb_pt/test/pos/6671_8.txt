* May be spoilers * Undoubtedly one of the best dramas, if not the best of the genre I've ever seen. Prot Prot alien or just crazy? This is the question you will ask yourself throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is simply amazing, as is Jeff Bridges. You can not beat this kind of acting, plus some humor, sometimes. Some of Kevin Spaceys's actions in this movie are a lot of fun. When he was in the tree, for example, and when he was talking to the "queen" mental patient, the way he hid half of his face around the wall and just looked. <br /> <br /> To put it simply From the beginning you will be hooked, and if you really love drama, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> A solid 85%.
