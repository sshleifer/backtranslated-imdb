(Some Spoilers) Sweep in New York City on a first-class rail wagon, a killer who does not kill with a gun, knife, or cue but only with his touch or breath. A murderer who is so old, or even older, then the man himself. This killer has a name that is known around the world as smallpox. <br /> <br /> Arriving in New York on a cold November afternoon the killer hidden inside Sheila Bennet, Evelyn Keyes, and as a Trojen Horse, waits until the opportunity presents itself. So like a time bomb with its fuse blowing all over the town. <br /> <br /> Sheila knows that she is being followed by a US Customs official who has been in her arms since she returned to the US from the island nation of Cuba. Having smuggled $ 50,000 into illegal unidentified diamonds, she had to be careful to send them to her husband, Matt, Charles Korvin, to be cut and sold to unsuspecting jewelers in the city. <br /> <br /> Sending the diamonds in advance, Sheila knows that if she gets caught, the diamonds will not be found in her. What she does not know is that Matt is dating twice, having an affair with her younger sister, Francie, Lola Albrght. Even worse, he plans to leave town with the diamonds leaving her, just as Francie holds the purse. Even knowing that from the beginning of Sheila's death condition, this does not come to the surface much later in the movie. The first half of "The Killer that lurked New York" is a suspense / drama crime with US Customs officials and NYC police looking for the stolen diamonds. As Sheila begins to get sick and begins to infect everyone she comes into contact with the film comes to the point of a mass panic in the streets like horror movie. <br /> <br /> Both police and customs officials, along with members of the city's Health Care Race, are running against the clock to find Sheila before she infects the entire New York City with deadly smallpox infection which she is carrying. Sheila discovered by Matt's boss, Willie Dennis, Jim Backus, that he quit his job as a night club pianist and that he was having an affair with Francie, who shocked her to realize he's a leap. <br /> <br /> Confronting Francie in her apartment, Matt not only stiffened Shelia, but also his sister. Which later leads Francie, guilty of guilt, to take her own life. In flight, not knowing she is infected with smallpox, Sheila goes to her brother Sid (with Bissell), who runs a house in the Bowery, to find a place to stay. It is only too late that Sheila and Sid discover that stolen diamonds are the last of their problems. Knowing that she is dying, Sheila goes to the office of the jeweler Arnold Moss, Art Smith, knowing that Matt's husband, who ended up beating old Moss in a bloody pulp, will be there to take revenge on him. Doucmentry-type drama, based on a true story with black-and-white photos in place, makes this film about the horrors of invisible and deadly smallpox thrown at an innocent audience that deserves to be visa.
