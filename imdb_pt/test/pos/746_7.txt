DO NOT LOOK AT THE BASEMENT This forgotten gem has a special place in my heart and in the Video Nasties list. The soundtrack of the flute-sitar-rattle is classic. The main character, though warmer than most low-budget stars, is a low-budget lead. The character Doctor Masters is well written and well represented. Some of the smaller characters are kind of dumb, but they add to the nostalgia of the movie. It's Campy. I'm not trying to lie. The character who makes this great is a Faulknarian man-child named Sam, one of the patients in this sanitarium-gone-crazy-movie. The blood is quite normal, although I think the color of blood is incredible. It's so red. This movie, I believe, was badly received because of the advertising scheme. A small soulless advertising executive grabbed his dirty hands and thought, "Let's rip the AD campaign to the Last House on the Left, which is going well." Little thugs like this ruined the movie world. All balls and no brains. In addition, the publisher may or may not have been an alcoholic. Maybe he's all drunk. You'll see what I mean. One more small note. Do not buy this from the Wally-Mart Dollar Rack. They cut to the level and unwatchable. Try to find as large a cut as possible.
