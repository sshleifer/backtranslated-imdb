I loved this movie because Bobbie Phillips can really fight! I always hate when actors are not credible in action parts. It was great to see, no offense, but a WOMAN who can skillfully perform martial arts and fight. If you compare this to most action movies with females you will DEFINITELY see what I mean. They do not have to cut the shots with someone who can fight and flow better. I was very impressed. I hope there is more!
