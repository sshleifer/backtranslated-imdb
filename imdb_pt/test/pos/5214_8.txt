This is one of the best TV movies I've ever seen! The title makes this so obvious and predictable, but come on, all TV movies are like this! <br /> <br /> The story is fantastic. It may sound ridiculous, but it is based on an incredibly true story. Gary Cole plays a military man named Dave, who feels trapped in his marriage. He abandons his wife and children and fakes his death! All so he could be with Alyson (Karen Chairs). How far is Dave going to keep his secret? <br /> <br /> The acting is top notch for TV movies. Gary Cole especially keeps the film together as a charming, soft-spoken sociopath who has an answer for everything his wife suspects. Karen Sillas does her best as a wife who discovers that her husband is a LIAR and does not know what to do about it. Teddi Siddall, who I think is Gary Cole's wife in real life, plays his part especially when she cries over her husband's "death." Wendy Makkena adds a nice touch as Alyson's sister. Linda Goranson is great in her little role as Dave's mother. <br /> <br /> Predictable, but the acting and the story take this film to several levels.
