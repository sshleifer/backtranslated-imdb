I finally got the great Sazuma DVD of this movie that is loaded with interesting extras. I read a lot about it and unfortunately lost at the Stockholm Festival. It does not arrive like I thought it would, but it's still worth watching if you like weird and unique movies. I'd rather see it again than any of the recent horror movies that are vomited in Hollywood these days. What diminishes the experience for me, are certain music tracks that sound dated and depend a lot on cheap synthesizer sounds. To me, all those tonal / harmonic elements of the score could have been taken out and replaced by David Kristians, great sound design. But this is just my opinion. Otherwise, this is a bold and rabid portrait with good meditative and poetic parts, such as the fading sequence of photographs that is beautiful. I look forward to seeing Ascension, and I applaud Mitch and Karim for their efforts in producing non-mainstream cinema. They are a great inspiration as soon as I embark on my own short film production.
