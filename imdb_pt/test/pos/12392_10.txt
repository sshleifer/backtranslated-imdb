François Truffaut, a young idiot from "Cahiers du cinema", the main bastion of the so-called New Wave, made a great show of hating this film and even accused him of dragging French cinema into mediocrity. Truffaut, who was sexually repressed, was already jealous of the way that Carné could make a huge success in a story that pushed all the right buttons of his audience and really involved it into something important, with all the traps and seduction of sensuality. In other words, where the general public and many critics saw a perceptive sociological analysis involved in a beautiful film, Truffaut saw "Girls on the Loose." Carné, after all, had all that would be seriously left out of the New Wave: intelligence, refinement, humor, a great talent as a storyteller, a great ear for dialogue, dazzling glow technical ability to make his actors do what he wanted, and a good dose of good taste. In comparison, Truffaut is a boring provincial with nothing to say. A tragic remake of "Pride and Prejudice" from the 1950s, the French response to "Rebel Without a Cause", an updated version of "Sons of Paradise", "Les Tricheurs" tells a story of young people disgruntled Parisians who lost themselves in an atmosphere of existentialism, sexual liberation and disrespect for traditional and religious values. Some (young) critics saw Carné's opinion on the subject as the moralizing inclination of an "older person," while I think what happened, quite the contrary, is that Carné being gay and knowing a thing or two about repression , he felt countless sympathy for the young iconoclasts in his history. In addition, this being a French film, there is no doubt that the rebellion in question is essentially sexual, something that still had to be decoded in American films like "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One". <br /> The young people of Carné are all extremely beautiful, graceful, elegant, spontaneous and intelligent. They are gods and goddesses. They drive the last wasps and the right cars. The cut of her suits, dresses and duffle-coats was a highlight of the fashion of the last century. Her haircuts are still glued to the wall of the local hairdresser. Their bodily form, which they have attained and maintained effortlessly, is still the modern Western ideal. They listen to the best jazz musicians. Do they know how to move, how to be sexy and how to make love? even though the pill has not yet been invented. They know how to negotiate different social classes and cultures. Unfortunately, they are defined and live by the gang code and their own heartless rituals that exclude sentimentality and make it a sin of romantic love. The only thing wrong with them is that the older ones do not talk to them and vice versa. The incidents depicted in this film have upset many languages ​​in France about the amorality and nihilism of youth, while making it a huge public and critical success. <br /> <br /> This film is so stylish and beautiful, I suspect that older viewers who watched wished they could be like the people portrayed in the film and some young filmmakers or would-be filmmakers like Truffaut developed a bad case of reflecting how they could never imagine a film as sexy or popular as this, although they would be very good at eventually targeting the nihilistic bits. On the other hand, given a certain cliché of the script (a misunderstanding of love that leads to a medical emergency), one can only imagine the terrible and pious puritanical mixture that the Americans would have drawn from the same basic script if they dared to attack the script. Curiously, the film was filmed in the same basic locations as the American musical "Funny Face" a year earlier. Where Hollywood saw the picturesque aspects of the Rive Gauche and existentialism, Carné restored its tragic and ironic dimension. Watch this trailer on YouTube: 19ZkKeoNjPo
