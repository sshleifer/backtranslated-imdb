When I saw the movie being broadcast on the TV late at night, I initially decided to give it a miss. I'm glad I started watching. Yes, the special effects are the same as Gerry Andersen's puppet shows. Some of the actors are from his other productions, he obviously used the same composer later, since the playful soundtrack could only have come from one of his productions, and the plot is as slow as a rainy weekend. Get through it all and you have a movie that shows intriguing possibilities. Is there a planet on the other side of the sun? Is it a duplicate earth? Is everything reversed and, if so, do they speak English in reverse? I love this old fashioned SF if only for wonderful model Gerry cars, airplanes, buildings and spacecrafts. Some of them are not as unlikely as they seemed then. And did you see the European Space Center logo? Very reminiscent of today's Euro logo. Stop believing and spend a few hours observing this, you'll be glad you did.
