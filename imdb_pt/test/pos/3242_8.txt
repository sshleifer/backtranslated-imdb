I'm a fan of independent films. Dialogue directed, pieces of character study are where it is for me. Some of the other posts are right: "Wannabes" will not rival "The Godfather" for the best Mafia movie ever. On the other hand, "Wannabes" is a well-written and well-directed image that has surprisingly good performances from all actors. My problem with one of the other comments: <br /> <br /> - Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in an Italian cast <br /> <br /> - Dubin is a Jewish surname and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional statuette of an Irishman. It does not stand out, on the contrary, it delivers great performance. <br /> <br /> That did not win many awards, but it deserves a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. I found it for $ 7 at Blockbuster and I was pleasantly surprised to say the least! Highly recommended.
