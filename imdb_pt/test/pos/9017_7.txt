In England we often feel very attached to the British films we like, as we are so accustomed to the usual American adjustments and accents. Being from London, where Virtual Sexuality is defined, I felt a strong emotional connection to it. The characters of Virtual Sexuality, particularly women, are exactly what British teenagers are, I felt like I was almost in the movie. I immediately related to Alex's character in the film, his shyness is quite common in most British teenagers, especially around girls. Virtual Sexuality made me feel pretty good as one of the only British movies that is not about gangsters or the middle-upper class, but about people who are watching the movie, teenagers on average. Americans would not really feel the emotional attachment, but every British teenager should watch it. Anyone from London will recognize the parts of the city from the movie, it definitely has a special place in my video box!
