This movie is very long, but worth splitting several nights. There's a cast of stars, and if you're a Patrick Swayze fan, it will make your heart pound! :-) My mother is fond of the Civil War, and a history teacher, and every summer we watched this movie (we had recorded it from TV), several nights, until we passed the whole thing. We had all the movie lines memorized, lol. Pop popcorn, sit back and enjoy the action and romance. It's a great movie for those who enjoy action, war, blood and guts, but also for those with a soft and romantic side. The clothes women wore were beautiful! Sometimes I think I was born in the wrong age, lol.
