After reading about this documentary, I rented and watched with my teenagers. It was incredibly balanced, showing the perspective on each side and leaving many questions unanswered. This is how it should be. I do not watch a documentary to know what to think.

This was a potent lesson in seeing for yourself. And he took home the basic foundation of honesty behind "Waco: The Rules of Engagement." If you simply open your eyes and look, the facts can speak for themselves.
