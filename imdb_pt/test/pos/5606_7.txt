Although not the best work of Hal Hartley (my personal favorite is "Surviving the Desire"), there's still a lot to like about this film, especially for fans of Hartley's dialogues. Even for Hartley's new audience, I would definitely recommend this movie about the "Dogma" sophomore year. This film is smarter, more faithful to its source material (the Bible), and more fun than any other movie in the pre-millennium apocalypse. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually part of the movie "2000 As Seen". (2000 Par Vu) series, so it may even be a budget film lower than the other Hartley works.Although the need for simple scenes shot with digital camera is understandable in this context, the main problem with this film is the unfortunate overuse of the blur / blur effect.I would be happy to never see this effect used on a film again, especially at the beginning, it almost makes the film unacceptable.But ignore that flaw and you will be treated to a great movie. is Magdalena (played by PJ Harvey), telling how Jesus saved her from being stoned to death, a short scene that I found surprisingly moving (Despite the fact that it was not Mary Magdalene that this happened, the woman in the Bible had no name ). <br /> <br />
