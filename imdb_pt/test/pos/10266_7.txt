I had so much fun watching Femina Ridens a few mornings ago, a little hangover. For most of the film, it's practically a duo, showing the games and the strange relationship between the crazy doctor Philipe Leroy and the dizzying Dagmar Lassander. I had seen it in some Fulci films dying in a repulsive way, but here she is young and beautiful. The film is fairly predictable and certainly smooth in front of the holding but fun all over due to its wonderful kitsch colored feel. Scenography, music, lighting and cinematography are classics of the late 60's, a surreal banquet for the eyes and ears and although the plot's general plot is not too difficult to predict, there are more than unusual events and visions memorable and bizarre sounds to keep things interesting throughout. Both leads are very good, and it is worth repeating that Dagmar Lassander is very, very well. The song, by Stelvo Cipriani, is also extremely suitable for images. Director Pierro Schivazappa invented enough cracker here, but it is not perfect. Although very attractive, there is little substance here and the elements of exploration are almost as smooth as they can be. I think this gives a kind of charm and innocence, but I can not help but think that the subject could have done with more sleaze, more threat, that kind of thing, especially since it is fairly simple to figure out what will happen. That is, I suspect a little pointless for the strongest exploring fans and certainly not for people who want sex or a lot of nudity. It's more a light and fun pop art affair, lovely, but without substance like bubble bath. Recommended mainly for lovers of the 60s, Dagmar Lassander, or sweet scenography.
