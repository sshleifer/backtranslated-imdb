A dreamy and dazzlingly atmospheric movie takes place in a small town in Northfork, Montana, in 1955. Government officials arrive to evacuate the city, about to be flooded by a new hydroelectric dam. There are other visitors in the city, the angels of another era, but they are only seen by a dying boy Irvin. A local priest (Nick Nolte, in a quiet and desolate performance) takes care of the boy. Irvin asks the angels to leave the place with them ... <br /> <br /> There is some supernatural quality in the film, some worthy lament and sublime sadness when suddenly you realize the inevitable purpose of everything - humans and their relationships, cities, countries, civilizations, the whole world as we know it. Death and birth have something in common - we traverse them in the final solitude. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the movie that affected me the same way and as deeply as "Northfork", the film so beautiful and so tender, so quiet and so powerful, so touching and so moving. Even now, after several weeks since I've seen, tears come to my eyes when I just think about it. <br /> <br /> After I saw it, I had to talk to someone about it. I sent a PM to one of my friends and asked, "Please tell me what I just saw?" And my friend replied with the words, "You have just seen one of the greatest films of modern times. One day, others will see the light."
