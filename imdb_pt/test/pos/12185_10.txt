ok ... first for the fans of Anne Rice BOOK .... <br /> <br /> the eyes of a certain lestat are not blue ... of course he is not blond in this film ... but even that Marius do not be lestat maker ... even though they COMPLETELY change the story ..... <br /> <br /> how can you say it's not a good movie .. <br /> <br /> this movie. .. it's the BEST vampire movie I've ever seen ... and lestat is pictured perfectly in it ... maybe not its features ... but I do not think you can find a better lestat ... the way he talks ... and the way he looks at mere mortals ... his arrogance ... and pure love of fame is portrayed perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you go for once ... consider this just a movie ... and do not try to relate each scene to the book ... you'll love the movie as much as I do. <br /> <br /> now ... for non-readers .. <br /> <br /> be prepared to fall absolutely in love with this movie .... there is everything ... and gothic music .. It's like an additional treat ... the dialogues ... are beautiful ... and attractive ... and even though it's a vampire movie ... you'll see yourself smiling ... at the wit of the characters ... and you will find yourself sympathizing with the vampires ... <br /> <br /> in general ... one of my favorite movies ... !!
