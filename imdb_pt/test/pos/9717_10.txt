Unfortunately, every person who asks about this series says they've never heard of it. I remember it fondly from my childhood (I was not 10 when it was released). <br /> <br /> My favorite story was "A Story Short". Something about the way the story of the "stone soup" has been woven into a larger story draws me every time. And then the storyteller explains why he has no story to tell, and it becomes a story in itself. I've always been a fan of Jim Henson, and this is just one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> I'm adding this DVD to myself with Labrynth, The Black Crystal, The Endless Story, The Promised Princess, The Last Unicorn, Willow And MirrorMask. These are all DVDs I share with my 6, 5 and 4 year old siblings.
