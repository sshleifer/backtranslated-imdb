If you are a film student, or were one, or are thinking of becoming one, the name Battleship Potemkin has or will resonate. Sergei Eistenstein, like other silent film pioneers like Griffith (though Eisenstein's innovations are not as common as Griffith's) and Murnau, had such a big impact on film history, of course that's taken for granted. The reason I bring the student film part is because at some point, whether you like it or not, your film teacher 9 times out of 10 will show the sequence "Odessa Stairs" of this movie. It is hard to say whether it is the "best" part of the various sequences of the film that deal with the times (in the present epoch) of the Russian revolution. But it leaves the biggest impact, and can be seen in many films showing suspense, or simply montage (The climax of the Untouchables comes to mind). <br /> <br /> Montage, which was not only Eistenstein's talent but also the blood of his early life in his career, is often misused in the present cinema, or, if not misused, in an inappropriate context for the story. Sometimes the mount is now used just as another device to go from point A to point B. Mount was something else for Eisenstein; he was trying to communicate as directly as possible with the urgency, passion (s) and final tragedies that were in the Russian people in time and place. Even if one does not see that all Eisenstein's narrative or "history" ideas are very well grounded (Kubrick said this), one can not deny the power to see the ships arriving at the port, the people on the stairs, and the soldiers who came everywhere with weapons. Some may find it hard to believe that this was done in the 1920s; has this power as the Passion of Joan of Arc to surpass its time and to remain in importance, if only in terms of technique and emotion. <br /> <br /> Of course, one could go on for books (which have been written hundreds of times, no less than for Eisenstein himself). In the film itself, the Battleship Potemkin is more like a dramatized newscast than a specific story from a movie. The first segment is also one of the great sequences of the film, as a riot is plotted against the captain and other head-ups of a particular ship. This is detailed almost in a manipulative manner, but somehow extremely effective; Assembly is used here as well, but in power surges that catch the eye. At other times, Eisenstein is happier to let the images speak for themselves, while the soldiers tire of food and water. He is not one of those directors who will try to put all sides in the story; he is, of course, much of the early 20th century in Russia, but he is nothing more than honest in how he views his themes and style, and that is what he achieves in the end. Some may want to check it out of film school, as the sequence of 'Stairs' is like one of those milestones of the serious tragedy in the movie, exhibiting the ugly side of the revolution. Eisenstein may not be one of the more "silent" film directors, but if the montage, the details in the picture, the non-actors and the Bolshevik themes are his cup of tea, it's really one of the obligatory attractions of a lifetime.
