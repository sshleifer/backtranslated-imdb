As one reviewer has commented, this made for TV comedy is up there among the best football parodies of all time. But ... not being able to shoot when it was first shown, now I think it's not around in any format. Ok, so this only made 17 votes so far, but an average of 9+ seems to suggest something special. Basically, I suppose it is a case of bad luck if you lost because you are no longer available to see !! Aaaaaaargh.
