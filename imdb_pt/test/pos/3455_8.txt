I watched this movie during a special preview in Reading, Berkshire. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Michael and Rory, make friends when Rory is introduced to the home that Michael already lives in. Michael is surprised to find someone who can finally understand him, since so far his brain has made people think he could not communicate. <br /> <br /> Rory introduces Michael to the life he is missing. Rory is a grumpy character, who does not let his condition (muscular dystrophy) get to him. <br /> <br /> They unite and apply for independent living, and find a beautiful apartment and assistant and have all the fun they could dream of. <br /> <br /> Do not go see this movie if you're after some "entertainment". Go see this movie if you are willing to see something a little different. <br /> <br /> The plot is strong, the actors are fantastic and despite the sadness that comes with the movie, the mood is uplifting. <BR> I fully recommend it. However, if you are like me and prone to crying - get tissues because you will need them!
