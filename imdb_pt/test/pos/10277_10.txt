This is a wonderful thriller that I've watched so many times and never get tired. It's all about the obsessive love that 5 people have with each other in Paris, (un) lucky coincidences, false identities. The music makes it really exciting. flaws in the characters, only the end is not very credible, but a definite "must-see" yet.
