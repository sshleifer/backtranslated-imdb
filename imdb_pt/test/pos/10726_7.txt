I remember going to the inn with my parents and my sister. I was in 5th grade and still a kid, and the record closed 4 years later, but the movie still remains in my memory. An adult movie, which a kid finds fun. This is a mark of excellence. Hoffman is one of the best actors in Hollywood, and this movie proves that. I like Billy put the ice cream scene on, and I remember the SCTV version there in the movie I factory myself. Remember Joe Flairty crying. Please send me an email if you like SCTV. It's not a bad movie, it's a story about a father and his son. Touching and interacting, I love the part where Hoffman talks about Killroy and how the streets change. Worth a second watch. 7/10
