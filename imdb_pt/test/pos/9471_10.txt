I got a chance to see this movie at an early screening on Brea and I've been crazy about it ever since. The film is based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, which I read and loved and saw on stage a few times, so I certainly enjoyed the references. But whether you like Shakespeare or not, it does not matter - the film continues. It's super funny, spirited and charming. Amanda Bynes is hilarious and David Cross as well. In fact, the whole cast is great - I'm just a big fan of David Cross. The cast is hot and the soundtrack takes away a lot of cool bands and some that I had not heard before but I know they have a CD coming out so I'll definitely buy it. Everyone in the audience laughed from beginning to end - all age groups. !
