First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing it now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria. <br /> <br /> But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. The portrait of Al Gore has to be one of the best cartoons of a politician I have ever seen, it was original and based on people's opinions about man. I do not want to give anything, but it made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> Also has some of the best moments of Cartman / Kyle. <br /> <br /> At all I would say that this is one of the best episodes that the show has ever had, and I recommend it to everyone.
