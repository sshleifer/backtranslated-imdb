Universal Studios. The name evokes so many memories for horror fans of beautiful frosted frames ... er ... landscapes, fields covered with fog, full moons, howling wolves, taverns and crowds carrying torches. However, it is very strange to look at these films, how little lasted the era that produced the real classics. The 1930s had their masterpieces, but these were mostly from the same directors and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today. The 1940s produced more fun movies than art, and most fans agree that the classic era of gothic horror films ended in 1945 with "House of Dracula," alternating with Abbott & Costello comedies, and was officially killed by and the arrival of the Atomic Age. <br /> <br /> So it's strange that maybe one of Universal's best Goths was made in the 50's! That alone makes the movie a weirdo, since costume dramas were coming out EVERYWHERE. It may not be comparable to the classics of all time, like the James Whale and The Wolfman movies, but it condemns all the fun elements of these movies in a delightful delight! Get ready for nothing but pure entertainment! Since various social mores have changed, the film also surrenders to violence that would not have been allowed in previous times; there is no blood, but we see the characters shot and stabbed directly, and there is even a torch burning in the face! <br /> <br /> The movie may not really be a horror movie, but it sure has the atmosphere, looks and feel of one! It begins in the dead of night with howling winds (and wolves) while two men seal the graves of two seemingly dead young lovers, BUT WAIT! One of them is not dead, but he can not move! He's stuck, but talking silently in his own mind, unable to communicate! What is your history? Now that's how you get a horror movie ... <br /> <br /> English businessman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene, giving one of his best performances) defines the name of Richard Beckett to investigate the disappearance of two friends of yours who disappeared into the castle of the Austrian countess Von Bruno (did Sacha Baron Cohen see that?). It seems that many years ago Von Bruno posed as a god to the natives in Africa to steal ivory, he was exposed by Burton's men, and the natives disfigured him. Now he's craving revenge. The movie has all the cliches, a Jonathan Harker-style walk to the castle, a hostel full of cautious villagers, deadly traps, and an overbearing servant (Lon Chaney Jr.). genuinely full of suspense, including a floor panel that activates a dungeon door (which creates an ingenious escape scene later), a hunting expedition involving an imported panther (!!! ??) and even an alligator pit. And then there's the fake Romeo-and-Juliet-style death that leads to the prologue of the movie ... <br /> <br /> The plot is clich√© and the worldview is black and white.But it's still incredibly fun, with director Nathan Juran making all the scenes pile up in the atmosphere and look fresh and new.There are several plot holes as well.Why does Ronald try to leave the castle so soon.And he never solves the mystery of what happened to his friends, though be obvious, but he does not know this when he gives up and And be sure of that before. Weird. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great. Despite being a rude veteran, Richard Greene makes Burton one of the nicest characters I've ever seen in a horror movie. Rita Corday is excellent as the earl's "peasant wife" who becomes Burton's love interest, she may have the stereotyped "fall in love with just a glance" problem of all the movie heroines of that era, but her portrait of a woman suffered in a loveless marriage with a sadistic monster is very convincing, it also shows a suspicion and sagacity of some cinematic heroines of the time, even seeing a Burton forced attempt to calm her (And to paw in her necklace, although it is simply to analyze how he has an important clue) as an attempted rape, but she never seems unpleasant in her paranoia, the public sympathizes with it. Even though he can not make Von Bruno seem truly foreign and supernatural (after all, he's a villain in a horror movie), Stephen McNally performs a truly scary performance as the sadistic nobler. When he reveals his burned eye and laughs madly, it's really scary. Lon Chaney Jr. is also great as his cowardly bastard Gargon. <br /> <br /> But the best performance is undeniably made by Boris Karloff as the mysterious doctor Dr. Meissen. He has little screen time at first, but steals all the scenes in which he is. It is a performance that is at once scary, sad, mysterious and heroic. While he looks evilly while applying leeches to one of Bruno's henchmen, spies on our hero and speaks in that famous voice of "You know I'm not good," only Karloff could do, you wonder if he's a hero or villain. , always dodging. And though he functions as the principal agent of our hero's escape, he still shows human frailties as greed and fear for his own life, even poisoning a cold-blooded man for Burton's benefit before Burton even agrees. His plan to help our hero and escape heroine also puts them directly into the clutches of Von Bruno as he organizes an incredibly sadistic (if incredibly failed) death to them that inspired similar scenes in Corman's Poe series. He may not have much time on the screen, but this is easily one of Boris best performances. <br /> <br /> Although the ending may seem abrupt and anti-climatic to some, half the fun is getting there, and there is a lot of excitement to be had. Relax and relive the days when heroes were heroes and villains were villains. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a fun escapist at its best.
