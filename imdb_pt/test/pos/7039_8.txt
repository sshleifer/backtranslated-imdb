I loved this show. I used to leave the pub ten minutes before closing and running down the road to pick it up. I remember Daniel Peacock's sketch of Gandhi on the newsstands as a masterpiece. Scenography and lighting were out of this world, creating an atmosphere in which you felt you were living. V unusual for a comedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I only found one other person (besides the other). reviewer here) who already knew that this program existed. In fact, I have to thank IMDb for coming into existence and proving to me that I had not, in fact, imagined the whole series in a drunken haze, which I was seriously beginning to believe!
