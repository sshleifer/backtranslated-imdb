There are far more complexities to the plot of this wonderful thought-provoking film than just the infidelity and cover-up of liability for the accident. I was struck by the apparent initial kindness of Wilkinson's husband, who wanted the driver, when he thought it was Everett, revealed to the police, and change of heart (and morals) when he learned that he was his wife. Plus, he was really good and / or trying to redeem himself by letting her go with Rupert. Then things changed and she decided the right thing to do was admit that she hit him. More importantly, the theme of redemption (for the accident - for infidelity - in its own strange and flawed way) is stronger in Watson's treatment of Everett. I believe that is why she undertook this effort. <br /> <br /> This seems to be a common theme in modern British novels: Brideshead Revisited, The End of the Case Comes to Mind. Love.
