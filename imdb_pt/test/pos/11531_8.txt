I picked it up at the end of the late Mexican cable and I have to complain about it. The title was translated as "Secrets" (Secrets). Well, there's a secret that has an important part in the movie, but come on! We are not stupid. We know there's a romance behind it. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is very interesting and is conveyed by its solid rock performances. The always gorgeous and gorgeous Jordana Brewster and Christopher Eccleston have great performances and have such great chemistry between them. Cameron DÃ¬az is also good, although he has minimal time on the screen. Blythe Danner is perfect and her last appearance in the film is touching, sad. Great performances <br /> <br /> Jordana's character and her ex-boyfriend travel to Europe to deal with their demons and understand why her sister died. Through flashbacks, we learn the sad truth and we can not help but feel sorry for the whole family. The end is truly in motion. <br /> <br /> So there is nudity, but it is minimal. In fact, sex scenes are artistic and not meant to be steamy or sexy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I kept watching for the charm and beauty of Joranda Brewster. And I ended up enjoying the story and the dramatic performances. <br /> <br /> Try this movie if you like solid dramatic features. Great movie. The last and last scene was very sad .. The two sisters through flashbacks.
