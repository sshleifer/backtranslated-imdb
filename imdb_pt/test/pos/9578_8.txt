I admit I've never seen "Waiting for Guffman," the 1997 critically acclaimed comedy documentary about a small town staging a parade. When the Best In Show advertisement had the slogan "From the team that brought you to Guffman," a number of critics out there suggested in their reviews that only people familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time watching this movie. For shame, critics, for shame times two! Any critic who implies something like that with any movie probably does not want to share the richness of the movie with the rest of the world, but this is a movie that I hope people will experience now that their video / dvd. "Best in Show" is undoubtedly the best comedy of 2000. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a mockumentary style, featuring the main competitors (not to mention crazy) of the annual Mayflower "Best In Show" competition where dogs of all races come to compete to see who the top dog is. We have the adorable and naive Harry Pepper (Guest) with his bloodhound, the simple Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Levy and O'Hara) with their terriors, crazy yuppies Hamilton and Meg Swan (Hitchcock & Posey), gay dog ​​groomers Scott Dolan and Stefan Vanderhoof (Higgins & McKean), and millionaire Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Coolidge) along with their trainer Christy Cummings (Lynch). They all have their minds on a simple object: the Blue Ribbon, which will be awarded to the best dog. And ... do I have to tell you the rest? <br /> <br /> Direction / scriptwriter / star The idea of ​​humor of the guest is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at, and that the idiocy of movies like "American Pie" or other movies "teenagers" meaningless will not dominate the world, after all. His idea is simple: make your comedy not just funny, but funny. But instead of following the brilliant steps of movies like "Zero Effect" and "High Fidelity," he used a rather unusual approach (and, as I understand it, he also used this approach to "Guffman"). Whether you realize it or not, a very large part of the film is improvisation. In other words, what the actors say and do probably was not written in the script, perhaps not even dreamed up by the guest and co-writer / star Levy. But with a kindly Guest hand, he and the actors performed a hilarious theatrical talent that would probably have failed if manipulated by less experienced actors. Now that's smart! <br /> <br /> The cast is, of course, what makes improvisation work the most. They are all a wonder (comic) to see, especially Guest as Pepper. But the real highlight has to be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin, the impudent announcer in the competition who can cast the most outrageously funny stories and comments that no announcer would ever dream of ... that is, if the announcer were trying to be funny. Williard can talk about the dog, suddenly, about how much he can bench press. There is even a part in which he gives an idea for a new marketing strategy: having sexy women posing in tight shirts and shorts with the dogs and suggesting something like "having a doggy style of a time." It is invaluable as is its performance. <br /> <br /> I hope people engage in this 90-minute "documentary". The film deserves so much recognition. He was nominated for the Golden Globe Best Comedy Award, but did not win. I can not see why. I mean, in the comedy department, it's better on the show. GRADE: A
