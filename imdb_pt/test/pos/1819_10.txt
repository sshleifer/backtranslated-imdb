This gem captures the life of the 80's in a brilliant way. As a 83rd grader, I must say that Valley Girl (along with the Fast Times at Ridgemont High) stands out as the class of teen movie sex. <br /> Gender. The characters are accurate representatives of the time; <br /> <br /> Girls from vapid malls, pseudo-punk rebels, preppy athletes are all represented here <br /> <br /> I've seen this more than ten times now. The song in the movie was top notch. Unfortunately, these songs have never been as popular in their time as those of arena cocks like Journey, Styx or Loverboy. Before the soundtrack, I searched for records and tapes (it was the '80s, after all!) By Josie Cotton, Sparks, Plimsouls and Modern English. <BR> <BR> This film deserves respect. It's not just a good teen movie from the '80s. It's a great movie. Period.
