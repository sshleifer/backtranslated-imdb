Jolene (Heather Graham) operates a nightclub in New York and lives with her husband, Carl (Luke Wilson), a photographer. After about 500 days of marriage, Jolene comes home to find a note from Carl that he needs "some space" ... and a bouquet of daisies, his favorite flower. Jo readily puts the daisies in the blender and pushes the button. Soon after, she embarks on a journey to find Carl somewhere west because, after all, she is "engaged" with Carl. However, when she finally crawls him in Texas, Jo camps near his home at the beginning, hoping to find clues to his decision to leave. She knows a beautiful neighbor sculptor (Goran, can not spell her name!), But Jo discourages her attraction to her. When she discovers that Carl can have a new girlfriend, she decides to consult a Mexican-American mystic (Alfonso Arau) for advice. Jo is engaged, but does this mean anything to Carl? This is a very imaginative, humorous look at the marriage vow. It's a quirky script and the eccentric style is downright contagious. Graham is great as the abandoned woman who is having difficulty releasing. Wilson does not give his best performance, but is suitable as the confused husband. The rest of the cast is very good, however, with Goran the gorgeous gorgeous as the sexy neighbor. The setting in both New York and Texas is beautiful and the facts are cool and fun. If you like romantic comedies and independent films, this is custom made for you. He walks to a different beat that is more attractive, but still delivers in the happy final category.
