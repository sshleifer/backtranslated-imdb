It is difficult, today and in the US, to understand this film. We have nothing, really, to compare. Here is an attempt at comparison: It is as if, during the last years of Saddam's regime, a filmmaker in Iraq could somehow make a film that, for the first time, portrayed life as it really was in that country. The ordinary young woman's life, with all the terror and repression in full. So the film was shown freely in Iraq. If you can imagine this event unlikely, then you can get an idea of ​​what happened to this movie in the last years of the Soviet Union. Before this film, Soviet cinema was highly censored. Soviet films would only show an ideal life in the workers' paradise. Then all of a sudden this. Alcoholism, random sex, the ugly desert that was the Soviet city, suffocating pollution, the proletariat victimizing each other and themselves, complete despair - it's all there. The people were shocked. Soviet women used to cry during the displays. Many would say that this is the story of their lives. It was a cultural earthquake that filmmakers dream of performing. It certainly accelerated the collapse of the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Reading the comments here, I see that few understand this movie. One says it was innovative because it contained real sex. For Soviet viewers of the time, sex was a minor event compared to portraying reality for the first time in Soviet cinema. <br /> <br /> Others compare to current films such as "As Good As It Gets," which can also compare Homer Illiad to John Grissam's latest novel. They just do not compare. This is not just a film, it is a social document and a transformative social force. It needs to be seen that way or you will not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> Other critics see it as a film about a dysfunctional Russian family. One of them even says it's hard to feel sorry for Vera because she keeps coming back to her family. The point is that Vera and her family are symbols of the whole of Soviet life. There was nowhere else to go, because the family in the block and in the other city was the same. This was life in the Soviet Union for most people. <br /> <br /> This is a film that can be seen on many levels: as a drama, traces the landscape of despair, as a social document, shows the living conditions of the time, as a political document shows the attitude of the people and many of the reasons for the dismemberment of the Soviet Union, and how a moral document shows the evils of a dictatorship that is out of control, and the cruelties that the victims will practice on one another. <br /> <br /> Little Vera clearly shows the human cost that socialism ends up assuming for its victims, despite the good intentions the system may have. In doing so, it helped to end the Soviet regime, thus contributing to one of the major changes in modern history. This movie hits what only a few movies have ever done. It is not only an impressive representation of history, but it also becomes a force in this shaped history.
