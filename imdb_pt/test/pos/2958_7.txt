This second feature Lone Ranger does not compare to the 1956 classic, but it's a great movie with plenty of rough acting and moving in a good clip. The Archer looks at a series of mysterious murders that have a sinister pattern for them, with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded assassins. There are more deaths and violence usually associated with the adventures of Lone Ranger and the film has a chain of racial insensitivity, whose comments are scattered throughout the script. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can join clues and expose the band out of the law and bring them to justice. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels star in a colorful presentation that shows the desert and cactus country of old Tucson to great advantage. The score is good, but the familiar theme of William Tell Overture is interrupted by vocals that are interesting but lack the flourish and beauty of the traditional Ranger theme.
