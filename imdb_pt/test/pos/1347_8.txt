My friends and I saw the movie last night in Austin at a screening for the AGLIFF (a film festival). This movie was one of the best I've seen this year. It was a great comedy - very original and sincere - and FUNNY LIKE HELL! Everyone in the audience was laughing all through the movie. Texas is a big state - with MANY small towns - and, of course, many teenagers who grew up as "fat girls." I know a lot of people are going to relate to this movie on a personal level. Ashley Fink and Robin of Jesus were amazing - they were great at these reels, it was as if the script was written with them in mind. And speaking of the script, it was very well written (very believable), and Ash is a great actor (his facial expressions alone made me laugh). It's an independent movie - but do not let that fool you ... It's a good movie! Seeing this working gauge of someone so young is truly inspiring.
