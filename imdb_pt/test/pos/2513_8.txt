This is an unusual film because it was made by Twentieth-Century Fox because it is one of the few pairs of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband, Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck had made films for many different studios (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) about the time she made THIS IS MY MY AFFAIR, but Taylor was an MGM musician so he only appeared in this movie because he was loaned to Fox - something that studios occasionally did during that time. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting because many real-life people have roles in the film, although the play is pure fiction. You'll see actors playing William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey. I do not remember any movies with McKinley or Dewey as a character, although I remember Roosevelt from THE WIND AND THE LION and a few other films. Three compliments about seeing a "minor president" in a movie as main character! <br /> <br /> The film begins with McKinley taking a young lieutenant (Robert Taylor) aside and asking him to be a special agent for him - and not telling anyone - not even the Secret Service. That's because the president fears that someone inside the agency is denouncing a gang that has been doing a long series of robberies - all based on inside information. So it's up to Taylor (who is not known for his manly roles - especially at this stage of his career) to pose as a thug and find the gang responsible and the inner man. <br /> <br /> However, there are two serious complications. First, while he is able to find gang members, one of the gang member's twin sisters is Stanwyck. Taylor discovers that he fell in love with her, but he must also do his duty and turn them over to the authorities. Second, because McKinley is the only other person who knows the truth, serious problems develop when McKinley is murdered and Taylor is on death row for the crimes !!! <br /> <br /> The film did a good job of creating a story and putting it within a historical context. Although most people today do not remember McKinley or even remember that he was murdered, the film takes place in this interesting period of time. The acting is pretty decent, as the stars are backed by Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy, though I must admit that Donlevy's role was very tame and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles. Overall, it's very interesting, well written and not very sentimental in the romance department. A good tour for all.
