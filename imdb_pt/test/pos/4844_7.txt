A very good film about anti-Semitism near the end of World War II. The scene that really speaks loudly of these people's ignorance is the church meeting when the priest is giving his speech against the "international co-workers and communists." It seems incredibly similar to the speeches Adolph Hitler used to force the throats of his people, but none of the participants in the meeting seem to make such a comparison.
