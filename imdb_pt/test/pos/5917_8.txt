It is a successful example of a 1950s biopic. It has the young, handsome, handsome hero - well, not so young on the screen; superb direction, if unlikely, by Billy Wilder; an orchestrated and agitated musical score of invigorating scales and, when necessary, celestial ropes by Franz Waxman; strong support players; an exciting story; stunning photography by Robert Burks's favorite Hitchcock; and a narrative about a unique historical event. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Jimmy Stewart as Charles Lindbergh trying to sleep in a hotel on Long Island before his epic solo flight across the Atlantic from New York to Paris. . And he can not sleep. <br /> <br /> The flight itself is filled with flashbacks of Lindbergh's personal history and the purchase and construction of his high-wing monoplane, The Spirit of St. Louis. St. Louis, Missouri, is home to the partnership that sponsored the flight. (Even in 1927, money spoke). Anyway, the film had several flashbacks and the narration of Stewart. What's the alternative? Watching the units? Thirty-three hours watching Jimmy Stewart sitting silently in the controls of his noisy plane while days and nights come and go? I found the script and the direction impressive for its time. It is clear that unpleasant things are left out, so as not to present more ambiguity than the contemporary audience could manage. <br /> <br /> My bet is that the howling mob that surrounds Lindbergh in Le Bourget ripped the plane apart for souvenirs. . And of course, nothing about the pilot's relief tube, although it had added more mood opportunities. Some of today's viewers will find some sentimental incidents if they think hard about them. Aloft, Stewart talks to a nice hitchhiker who, in a discreet and worried way, wakes him up landing on his cheek at a critical moment. Later, the St. Kitts medal that Father Hussman gave him hits softly against the glass crystal of one of the instruments, just as Stewart is desperately trying to land. The atheist Stewart is saved twice - once for a fly and once for God. <br /> <br /> But it does not matter. It's an amazing movie. That landing at Le Bourget, with an exhausted Stewart behind the joystick, confused by spotlight, sweaty with fear and collapsing with exhaustion, is really convincing. "I'm going to start this plane," he tells himself, and we can believe him. <br /> <br /> Piloting a light plane is not like driving a car. There is not a gently curving road to tell you where to go, no clue to provide guidance. You're busy every second. You should observe the instruments, check each end of the wing to see if they touch the horizon, the nose of the plane, and constantly watch up, down and to the side in search of other traffic, although this has not been a problem for Lindbergh. He was alone on the ocean. <br /> <br /> Why? In one of the film's most corny moments, Stewart and Murray Hamilton, two gypsy dwarves of the 1920s, are resting near their planes in a Midwest field. "What makes us love flying so much?" Asks Hamilton. (There is no answer.) Later, his funders try to convince him to leave the flight. Five other aviators have died trying. "But you do not understand? It has to be done," says a passionate Stewart. <br /> <br /> Well, that's not a big answer. Why does this have to be done now and why Lindbergh? Why not wait ten years and stop wasting lives in the meantime? The answer, dear Socrates, is partly in our glands. The riders are very calm and confident, given the occasional signs of excitement. Your main problem may be an addiction to an internal adrenaline rush. Just kidding. Some of my best friends are pilots. Still, Lindbergh must have been such a dude. He deserved to be treated like a hero. Not just because of the flight itself, but because of his subsequent behavior - quiet, modest, a family man. We can easily forget his admiration for Hitler as he more than compensated for this by testing the Corsair fighters in the Pacific and advising the Navy on how to adjust the planes and get the best performance out of them. <br /> <br/> See if you have the chance. If nothing else, it's a story lesson told with visual splendor.
