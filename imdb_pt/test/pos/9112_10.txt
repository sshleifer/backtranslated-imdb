I'm a big fan of Tenacious D, and I think this is not the funniest movie in the world, but the most fun. It's not a laugh a minute, but it's not what D intended it to be. I went into the movie watching all HBO shows, memorized both albums, and it made it even more enjoyable. Lots of inside jokes from previous Tenacious D albums and HBO shows. As I already knew the new album, I knew 40 minutes of the film because it is a musical comedy. I'd say you have the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best 5 minutes of any movie. Hands down. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie now!
