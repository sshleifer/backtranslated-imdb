Rated TV-14 for sexual content and language. <br /> <br /> I remembered hearing about this show in 1998 when he used to play on the Teletoon channel. I did not watch then but now he plays on the channel, Razer. I've seen about four episodes of this show and I must say, is quite intelligent and funny. <br /> <br /> The show stars Jason Alexander of Seinfeld fame and also Tim Curry of Rocky Horror Picture Show and fame. The show is about a duck who is a cop. He basically does his job as a cop while dealing with personal issues. This show is quite funny at times and animation comedy fans will like this.
