I originally saw this movie while I was working as a musician doing musical theater in the summer stock. If you've done any work in the theater - especially in a summer theater - you'll really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some really bad times to write in the movie, but overall it's a beautiful theater tribute and why people love it.
