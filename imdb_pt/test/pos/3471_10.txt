I think I was recommended this movie by the lady at the store I was hiring! For the first time she was bang on! What an excellent movie! First of all, I convinced myself that James McAvoy and Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were his accents; and in the middle of the movie I was completely convinced that Steven Robertson was a handicapped actor and for sure James McAvoy was too! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw the two actors in their 'normal' disguise, to say that I was impressed would be a euphemism !!! I remember all of Dustin Hoffmann's acclaim in the 1980s for his portrayal of autism in the movie 'Rain Man' - frankly (in my opinion, of course!) Steven Robertson's performance / portrait explodes Dustin Hoffmann's right to water - and he deserves recognition as such !! In short, one of the greatest portraits of friendship / love / human relationships of all time - and was made in Britain / Ireland with local actors - put this on your pipe and smoke Hollywood!
