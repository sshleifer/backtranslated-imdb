Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's film work that is peerless. Having recently re-recorded on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial release in 1997, it has lost nothing of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's recent Grizzly Man and Errol's Oscar winner Morris, The Fog Of War. Like the first, he details, in his brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the last one, take a look at one side of the war that few see. Yes, we see violence and heroism, but as The Fog Of War has brought us to the mind of one of the main warmongers of the last century, this film allows us to take a look at the life of a grunt that is captured by the tortured enemy, finally, triumphs. Except, by no means, shape or form, the film is as simplistic and optimistic as my brief description of it. Nor is Dieter Dengler, the titular subject of Little Dieter Needs To Fly, a German immigrant who survived the Nazi depredations (we find, for example, that in his hometown, Wildburg, in the Black Forest, his grandfather was the only man who did not to vote for Hitler, and suffered brutally for this position) after World War II in Germany, and his own arrest in the hands of the Viet Cong, when his Air Force jet was shot on Laos on February 1, 1966. While the title of the film, and the idea of ​​Dengler's passion for becoming a pilot, agitated by the impression that Allied fighter jets made of him when they razed his city as a child, make one believe that Dengler is the central subject of the film. , this is not true. The subject is the survival of Dengler, or, more precisely, his human will, the whole human will. The details of Dengler's romantic life are too much for Hollywood and are an interesting aspect to interest Herzog. Nor is it the fact that he won a Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, the D.F.C. and the Navy Cross. That thing that drove Dengler to survive so much, and remains a relatively optimistic man (though there are glimpses of darker sides), is what lies at the center of this film, and the whole canon of Herzog. Dieter Dengler's "barbaric dream away" from his past is completely matured in Herzog Country, and the use of a Malagasy corner, Oay Lahy E, during many jungle scenes, among other excellent touches in the score, shows Herzog, perhaps only with Martin Scorsese, the best image and music manipulator in the cinema. For a long time it can melt!
