I saw this movie for the first time in 1994 or 95, during my first year at school when it was in Lifetime. After I first saw it, I thought it was wonderful. Sure, it may not have run any longer, but it's as accurate as it may be in my opinion (regardless of what anyone might think). Cynthia Gibb was great at playing Karen, and Mitchell Anderson was just as good as Richard. Louise Fletcher (Yes, who played Nurse Ratched in 1975's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest") was also fine, but I found that her version of Agnes (Karen and Richard's mother) was a bit obsessed with control. I am an EXTREMELY HUGE fan of the Carpenters, and I believe Karen's voice was and still is so wonderful. It really saddens me with the fact that she's gone and left this land too soon, but thanks to the endless popularity of her music and her angelic voice, the music will continue to live. Anyway, back on the rails of this movie, it's really a mystery to me and possibly to other people (fans and not Carpenters fans) that made Karen end up having this problem with her health. Was it the media that was responsible or was it just Karen's decision? I would not believe it was her decision. It could have been the medium of an article that was printed on it somewhere in 1970, when its hit "Close to You" came out (from what was shown in the movie). There are some other moments in the movie too. Richard's fight against drugs and Karen's brief marriage. I did not hear of her loss in February 1983, for I was not yet watching the news; I had discovered years later. I do not know if there will be another movie about the Carpenters or Karen done in the future, but until then, this movie will do well. I'm going to say this: if Karen had disregarded the fake details of that article or any future articles that might have been published with similar content calling it "chubby" (which must have been a great insult), it would still be here on this Earth today. I know she's in heaven and probably entertaining everyone with her beautiful voice. God bless you, Karen !!
