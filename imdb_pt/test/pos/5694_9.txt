ATTENTION: I would advise anyone who has not yet seen the movie not to read this review. <br /> <br /> This movie was on the shelf of a movie store and since I had seen a handful of very tacky horror movies there had really low expectations for this. Well, I put it on, and almost immediately was sucked right in. While watching, I went deeper and deeper into the story and soon I was looking in complete interest. This movie is amazingly spectacular and I loved every second. The story is about a river boat ride in Australia. It seems safe enough until your boat is ambushed by a croc that is ready to eat something. When I looked into the background of the case I thought that this movie would have bad visual effects like in Lake Placid 2 and many others, but when I first saw the crocodile it became incredibly real! Do not laugh when I say this, I'm serious, but this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. He really knew how to create tension and suspense with his intense situation, I mean, think about it; You're trapped, in a tree, with no place to run, nowhere to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the water below. You can not tell me it does not scare you a little. It even gave me some shivers in my arms, as when Adam was taken by the crocodile and Grace and Lee were bewildered. This is a very attractive film. There were maybe 1 or 2 parties where I found myself a bit disinterested, but other than that, I would say this is my favorite animal attack movie I've seen.
