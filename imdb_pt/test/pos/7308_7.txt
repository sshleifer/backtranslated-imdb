Norma spent most of the 1920s playing beautiful gadgets, but her first talkie cast her as a cheeky dancer in "The Trial of Mary Dugan" and she came up with winning colors. From then on, her sweet and lovable na√Øves were cast aside and she sizzled into parts that made her the world's sophisticated women or society girls in search of emotions. "Let Us Be Gay" was made before, but was released after "The Divorce" and was an unusual twist on the top-tier dramas that Shearer created. <br /> <br /> Norma appears for the first time without makeup, like Kitty. Brown, whose main purpose in life is to please his despicable husband Bob (Rod La Rocque). She is rushing to take you to her golf game - but in reality he will see her lover. When Helen, the lover, comes home to a confrontation, Kitty confronts the situation with civility, but behind closed doors she is a mass of emotions and Bob leaves forever. <br /> <br /> Three years later, Mrs. Courtland Brown (Kitty) comes to stay as guest of the eccentric Mrs. Bouccicoult ("Marie") (Marie Dressler). Kitty is now a knockout and "Bouccy" has a job for her. She wants Kitty to romance a guest of the house, who in turn is dating her granddaughter Diane (beautiful Sally Eilers). Shock!! Horror!! The man is none other than Bob, his ex-husband !!! Kitty carries the meeting with sophistication and witty retorts - "there seems to be something strangely familiar in that man" !!! - and no one is the wiser. <br /> <br /> The film then setstles into one of those first very boring comedies, "boring." Kitty casts a spell on all men and Bob is desperate to start over. Women have all the strong roles in this movie - men are just puppets. Raymond Hackett seems to be in the movie as an extra butler - "pass me a cushion," "bring me a drink," "move this chair" instead of Diane's besieged fiance. Norma Shearer is of course the whole show, Marie Dressler adds "Bouccy" to her list of eccentric representations and Sally Eilers is a real idiot like the beautiful Diane.
