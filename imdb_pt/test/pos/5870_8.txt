This is a thoughtful film that reveals the inequalities of the so-called upper class and those who work for them, those who have and those who do not. Robert Shaw does an honorable job in his role as the responsible and proper driver, Steven Ledbetter, who helps Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles) overcome his mental depression early on. However, Steven has many mixed feelings towards this upper-class lady. He inevitably falls in love with her, which is obviously beyond the social boundaries that separate them. <br /> <br /> I did not read anything before then and just judged the movie as I saw it. I consider it a very honest story about the realities of daily life and the conflict of what we might want or expect from life and what we receive. It's a good drama that is worth seeing again.
