This is really a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it, although not so original, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together! All the characters are cool, and the story is very good, plus Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy are just awesome at it! Rene Russo is excellent in his role, and there are lots of laughs out there (especially when Deniro parodies the lines of Clint Eastwood and Danny Glover), and the final is great. Yes, it 's just another run of the detective movie "Buddy Buddy", but it works because of the fantastic chemistry between De Niro and Murphy !, as well as having some great car chase scenes too! It's nothing really good, but I found it very fun and a perfect way to pass the time! However, the main villain was very weak and was not very good at all. This is far from the best detective film "Buddy" Buddy, however, it's still a lot of fun, and I thought it was very well done and written too! And the ending was pretty funny! This really is really fun. I really enjoyed it, even if it was not so original, Robrt De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together, I recommend this one! The direction is very good! Tom Dey does a pretty good job here with great camera work, cool angles and keep the movie at a fast pace. The acting is so much fun! Robert Deniro is incredible as always and he is incredible here, he is hilarious, very nice, he had fantastic chemistry with Eddie Murhpy did his incredible things, he designed some very funny faces, he seemed to be having fun, he had some funny lines, and he had a character very cool! (From Niro Rules !!!!!!!). Eddie Murphy is also amazing here, he's hilarious, as De Niro did his usual funny things, obviously loved being in front of the camera, and while he can make it ff in his sleep, he was still a lot of fun to watch! (Murphy Rules !!!!). Rene Russo is fantastic here! She had a nice character, and while she did not have much to do, she added a lot of presence on screen, and made her character interesting always, she was great! (Russian rules !!!!). William Shatner is funny here surprisingly and did not overdo it, and brought some good laughs to the film. The main villain is well, but a bit weak and rather bland, yet he did what he had to do properly. The rest of the cast is good. Overall I would highly recommend this!. *** 1/2 of 5
