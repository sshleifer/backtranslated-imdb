This is a beautiful but simple film about a man, led to find an answer, an answer that he does not necessarily need, but structured his whole life around. It is touching, it is hilarious, it is glorious, it is tormenting, it is delicate and dynamic, I say it is great. <br /> <br /> I read Jonathan Safran Foer's book, Everything is Illuminated (mainly because I heard Elijah Wood was starring in the film adaptation), and I was just caught up in the characters. I laughed out loud more than once. And every time someone talks about it, I hear the same banal response, almost as if it were a big, long word: "It's horrible to look at the woman who saved her grandmother from the Nazis." However, this story is so philosophical; goes deeper than that. That talk about the ring and "on the case." That really makes us think. Suddenly, this story blends in with a simple search for an inner metamorphosis, and I find myself looking at things in a slightly different way now. <br /> <br /> I recommend renting this before, if at all, to read it, because the book had many obscene, downright perverted stories that were not included in the film, especially the story of Jonathan's family who did not was needed for the film. <br /> <br /> A bit of trivia, I heard, is that Wood's current girlfriend has a special turnout in this movie as the band's drummer Alex arranges to perform when Jonathan gets off the train to Ukraine. <br /> <br /> You spend half the film trying to figure out exactly what it is, and what Jonathan is talking about, because his character is as far apart as a turtle in a shell. <br /> <br /> is magnificent, and in my opinion, one of the best films of Elijah Wood.
