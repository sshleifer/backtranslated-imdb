Talkshow with Spike Feresten is one of those shows that will definitely polarize audiences. Either you like it or you do not. Personally, I find most of the bits hilarious, but there are some "huh?" moments. Staples like "Idiot Paparazzi" are always good to laugh at, but my all-time favorite has to be the one-off "Hollywood Douchebag". "Comedy for Stoners" is the only regular part that often confuses me (which is part of the argument!) Spike and his team of writers can produce a lot of new comedies, so the program never seems obsolete. Feresten's mood may not be for everyone, but it's definitely worth a try. <br /> <br /> The masses have spoken! We like this show and want more. Please note that I am not a friend or affiliate in any way with Spike Feresten, "Talkshow with Spike Feresten", or Fox network and affiliates. It's just funny!
