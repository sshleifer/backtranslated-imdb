Honestly, I loved Michael. although there was "give me a pillow I need to take a nap" parts, it was cool. I think everyone did a great job in this movie. and nora ephron is on my list of directors "ok." <br /> <br /> It's good to see John Travolta as a potbellied angel. It's not very often to see one in a movie. some people may call this boring movie, but for me I loved it. angels and everything.
