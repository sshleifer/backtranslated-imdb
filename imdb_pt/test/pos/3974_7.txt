(Synopsis) Graduating from high school Bartleby "B" Gaines (Justin Long) meets without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and get rid of all the problems he encounters but he has failed to conquer his curriculum at eight colleges. His mother and father are very disappointed that Bartleby was not accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby does not go to college, he will have no future. Several friends of Bartleby are in the same situation of being rejected by all the faculties that have applied. To satisfy his parents, Bartleby has an idea to start his own college with a website. They converted an abandoned psychiatric facility at the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. However, the site states that we accept someone. On the first day of class, they unexpectedly have a large number of accepted students who have also been rejected by all colleges. With a million dollars in cash, Bartleby must turn his fake college into a functional one. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as the dean of the college. The fun begins when they design their own resume, make their own rules, and party all night long. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The premise of starting a college without a faculty is a bit off the wall. Because it was a fake college, Bartleby did not really need a team. The film reminded me of the classic movie "Animal House", the college environment, the fraternity, many jokes and beautiful girls. These new college freshmen had a different notion of what university experience was. The film not only has a lot of humor, but also has a good message for life. People should pursue their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not be content with what other people want them to do. The ending was a bit unreal, but it's just a movie. The film was made for the young audience to have some fun. (Universal Pictures, 1:32 run time, Rated PG-13) (7/10)
