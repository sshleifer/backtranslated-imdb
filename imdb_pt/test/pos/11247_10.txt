I'm sure all the Canadians in IMDb are very familiar with Canadian content, and how much of that is ... well, let's say, dull. There are some select Canadian shows that are really worth watching, however, this is definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> Simple premise. Two guys picking up girls in a bar with certain guidelines and rules, add some witty and intelligent comments from a group of surprisingly friendly "Alfa-Males", and you have a lot of fun programming. Each episode is solid. If the "players" are below average, there are some difficult times, and there is some gentle fun about them. If the "players" are good, this leads to times when you just have to stand up and cheer, and some comical compliments are given to them. <br /> <br /> The premise is kind of worthless, I know, and as a guy who usually prides himself on being elevated above the typical and terrible reality of television, it takes a lot for me to admit that this show it's really fun and fun. <br /> <br /> One thing that should be stressed is how The Comedy Network did a terrible marketing job on this show. For a long time, I did not even know the premise, and all I knew was that somehow there was a shirtless guy who "loves cougars" involved. However, after actually watching the show, I was amazed at how surprisingly Canadian content looks (despite a sequence of opening credits pretty bad). So take a chance. I have not yet met anyone in the target audience (men ages 18 to 30) who actually watched the show (and not just annoying commercials) who did not like it. <br /> <br /> for a third season, Comedy Network. In fact, it has a good premise, unlike some other Canadian shows you had (cough * girls will be girls * cough). I usually book 10/10 reviews for "works of art", but I have so much fun watching this show and I think it was unfairly judged my many, which I had to do.
