In light of the recent typhoon that struck the country hard (ie Typhoon Ondoy), I thought of re-watching "Black Rain" (1988, Japan), Shohei Imamura's astonishing black-and-white masterpiece in destruction and sequels of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima in the closing period of World War II. The destruction and impact of both catastrophes (war and typhoon) may differ in degree and quality, but the trauma and the scar (physically and psychologically) are still there. <br /> <br /> It is a testament to the power of a film that its images remain as potent and indelible as when they were first seen. It's just that the difference now, in my case, is that observing these images took on a greater sense of poignancy and power because of a firsthand experience of an almost monumental climatic calamity. There is a sense of kinship, so to speak. Imamura has always been one of my favorite Japanese filmmakers. His films are always a pleasure to watch because of his anarchy, sensuality and earthiness: "Pornographers: Introduction to Anthropology" (1966), "Eijanaika" (1981), "Hot Water Under a Red Bridge" (2001) Palme d'Or winners "Ballad of Narayama" (1983) and "The Eel" (1997), to name a few. Given the humor of his films, who would have thought that he has served as assistant director of Yasujiro Ozu, the most austere and minimalist filmmaker in Japanese cinema? But then, it is the strict formality and domesticity of Ozu against which Imamura was rebelling. <br /> <br /> But again, with "Black Rain" you can notice the marks of Ozu. The father (or paternal figure) intending to see his daughter get married before the time ends on both, and the stillness and calmness of the scenes showing all the family members together (notably the dinner scenes or the Ozu movie ). lexicon, cinematographic lexicon, tatami) is something the revered master filmmaker would explore perennially in his works ("Tokyo Story", "Late Spring"). Essentially, the moderate and deliberate quality of "Black Rain" is a striking contrast to the cool chaos and instinctive drive of Imamura's entire filmography. <br /> <br /> Even so, this does not mean that watching the movie would not be a completely unsettling experience. "Black Rain," as aptly described by American filmmaker Leonard Maltin, is "full of astonishing black-and-white images." In the first 15 minutes of the film, Imamura gives no punches to show the immediate horrors and graphics of nuclear bombardment, one after another (stiffly burned bodies, hanging flesh, dead walking, fires and debris everywhere, madness everywhere) . An assault on viewers' senses, it definitely is, along with the somber black photograph of Takashi Kawamata (he made the lenses in Yoshitaru Nomura's crime drama "The Incident") and Toru Takemitsu's soundtrack (he made music in classics such as "Ran" by Akira Kurosawa and "Double Suicide" by Masahiro Shinoda. Even during the supposed "quiet" phase of the film (ie five years after the atomic bombing), one can never have a sense of contentment and order, with discomfort and pain still being strongly felt by survivors, not only in terms of physical ill health, but more in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma.The human race now indisputably appears, was destined to carry the legacy of the Bomba while living. <br /> <br /> I've written an article about "Black Rain" a few years before (but only in comparison to the magnificent "Tin Drum "by Volker Schlondorff, another film that deals with om monumental human madness and global catastrophe. Also, it has never been my practice to write twice about a movie I've written about before. It is in light of the recent climatic calamity that devastated our country that I was asked to revisit and write something again about this remarkable Imamura film, as there are many lessons to be learned both in the film and in the recent event. as regards the imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and action, and the long-term scars and wounds inflicted by large-scale destruction (whether human or nature induced). <br /> <br /> There have been a number of films dealing with nuclear holocaust and destruction ("Testament," "Topics," "War Game," each set within their respective countries) and "Black Rain "is among them, if not more, so much for their lack of remorse. and a shadowy portrait of the individual and communal disintegration caused by atomic devastation and by having a historical event as its basis. <br /> <br /> In a few weeks, another Hollywood disaster film, "2012" by Roland Emmerich, will finally hit (no pun intended) the big screen. As we all know, the American director's "disaster / apocalypse" movie group - "Independence Day," "Godzilla," "The Day After Tomorrow" - has no other purpose than to be mere entertainment value without perception the nature and wisdom of the apocalyptic disaster and the affected human condition. I wonder how this "gigantic" movie would exploit the trauma, disorientation, and apprehensions that are still being experienced by our people because of the recent climatic calamity. To say that this film is a cautionary tale would probably be no more than an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> But yes, I still watch "2012".
