If you consider yourself a fan of horror movies, chances are you have seen Hideo Nakata's Ring and Dark Water. They are superb, and Ring is doing well in Hollywood (maybe Dark Water is coming soon too?). While Ring is almost 100% pure beating heart breaking and nervous, a tale of two sisters is both a nervous breakdown and a mental twist. Along with The Other I consider this Korean movie a brilliant and intelligent horror film. The only flaw of this movie is that some consider its first 20 minutes rather slow. In fact, it is typical of Korean and Japanese films. I consider this carefully planned rather than slow, think of it as a "calm moment before the storm." With the full introduction of characters, the viewer will engage more closely with the character, one of the strongest points of Korean and Japanese films. <br /> <br /> Like Ring, a tale of two sisters does not exaggerate in the ghastly appearance. Instead, they let our mind do the intimidating work itself. That way, it is more frightening and frighteningly elegant at the same time. I will not be surprised if Hollywood redo this movie after bringing Ring and Grudge / Ju-On (This flick is not so good by the way, I rate it 5.5). Do not miss it!
