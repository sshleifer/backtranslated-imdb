I do not understand why it is so underrated in IMDb .. This movie is just perfection .. The best adaptation ever of the myth of Tarzan! As French, I can say that this is the best role of Christophe Lambert, ridiculous in many films, but here absolutely wonderful, charismatic, incredible! The plot is great, well told, the history magnificent, the direction, the atmosphere, the music, all things are perfect! How to believe in these sequences with Elgar's music, simply simply perfect. Greystoke is really an unbelievable, underrated movie here, I really do not know why but really appreciated
