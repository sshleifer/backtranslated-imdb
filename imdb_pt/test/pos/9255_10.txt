For all homicide addicts, this movie was great! Each character who has been on the show made an appearance in the movie. It helped to solve some (but not all) problems of the series. Unfortunately, unless you actually watched the show, most of the pleasure would be lost, since the film made heavy references to all the seasons of the show's existence. This would probably have been appropriate as an end of the series, rather than being a separate movie, but we have to get what we can get. I hope they make more movies and continue to feature the Homicide characters in Law and Order.
