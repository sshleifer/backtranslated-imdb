William H. Macy is fantastic in this Alfred Hitchcock movie. Macy stars as a movie critic who accidentally kills one of his girlfriends. The characters that follow are hilarious. James Cromwell does an excellent performance as a blackmail private detective. As always, Macy is incredibly funny and gives a phenomenal performance. Watch this movie whenever you're on TV and check out their video stores, because this is one you do not want to miss.
