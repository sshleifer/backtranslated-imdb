(This review contains a huge spoiler, but I do not know how to explain how cool it is without giving up) I've seen "Revenge of the Pinocchio" a while back. <br /> <br /> Now, you may think it's just a child-play theft. In fact, there are similarities. <br /> <br /> However, Chucky was a possessed doll that works regardless of the child. It is POSSIBLE for Pinocchio to be possessed by a demon or cursed or something. however, the puppet itself is actually completely inanimate. KID is insane and KID is the only one to kill people! Everyone, including the audience, the survivors and the Kid herself, think it's the doll. But it's the KID. <br /> <br /> Nudity is almost a pity, because otherwise I could tell everyone to see, because it's really an interesting horror movie.
