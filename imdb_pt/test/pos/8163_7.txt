LAST DAYS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Problem alarm when a LA party boy (Wes Ramsey) falls in love with a beautiful Mormon missionary (Steve Sandvoss). <br /> <br /> A huge success in the festival circuit and the limited theatrical release, this sympathetic film - the debut of screenwriter C. Jay Cox (SWEET HOME ALABAMA) - is an exercise of "opposites attract" in the how superficial the character of Ramsey is changed forever, after falling in love with the vulnerable beauty of Sandvoss, which is limited by the dictates of his religious convictions. Here the path of true love is paved with difficulties, no less than the reaction of the Mormons of Sandvoss to their recent sexuality, which results in their excommunication from the church and the wrath of their indignant parents (Mary Kay Place has a small but devastating like the boy's indignant mother). But Cox's script focuses mainly on Ramsey's path to redemption, as his hedonistic lifestyle is disoriented by the influence of Sandvoss and the responsibilities that emerge as a consequence of his maturity: He volunteers as a participant, delivering food to patients with AIDS living at home, leading to an unexpected friendship with former party-goer Erik Palladino (from TV "er"), whose illness gives Ramsey a much needed awakening. Cox's script is full of one-liners and various pearls of wisdom (in Mormonism: "Does not your church like alcohol or homosexuals? Well, I'm definitely not joining - I can not imagine the paradise without the two! "), and the characters are surprisingly complex and well-designed. Ramsey has the sexiest and sexiest role (he was first seen doing something rude to a willing participant!) But it is Sandvos who has become a gay icon with his sensitive portrait of an innocent whose Darkness into Light journey takes him . for a startling revelation about his place in the world around him. He and Ramsey are well-matched, and their inevitable sex scene (brief but memorable) is followed by a convincing sequence in which Ramsey describes a childhood trauma that defined his life to this day. <br /> <br /> Filmed in hi De-video and transferred to 35mm for theatrical display, the film's meager budget places limitations on the scope and magnitude of Cox's ambitions, although the characters and situations are strong enough to survive this minor disadvantage. Jacqueline Bisset shines as a mundane restaurant owner in the restaurant where Ramsey waits tables for a living, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("Third Rock of the Sun") steals the thunder of everyone as Sandvoss' mate, opposing the relationship of his friend with Ramsey in the religious principle ... but ONLY in principle. Although a bit flamboyant in some places, the film hurts with romantic longing and deserves applause for its honesty and compassion. Best viewed with a crowd of like-minded viewers, preferably with a loved one at your side.
