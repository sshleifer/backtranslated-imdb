Bill, Jeremy Theobald, is an inspirational writer who has yet to publish anything. Bill also has a strange and strange habit, he likes to follow people. <br /> <br /> Bill chooses a stranger on the street or subway, and follows them as if he were their shadow. Maybe Bill does this to help him get inspired to write the great novel he's dreaming about or get an article from him printed in a major magazine? Maybe it's because it fills Bill's lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance for him to pay attention to him or her? Or maybe this gives Bill someone to care for and worry about and be responsible for himself? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when following someone: after following him to the house or workplace, you stop. <br /> <br /> One day Bill follows Cobb, Alex Haw, at home, and instead of following his stop rule, he still continues to follow Cobb. Bill will soon realize how right he was with this rule he set for himself by following people and at the same time how wrong he was in breaking them. Surprisingly good low-budget film made by Christopher Noland in 1998, before it became big in Hollywood, with its classic and groundbreaking movie "Moment" two years later that has already become a big hit. cult movie. "Follow" is actually a much better movie than "Moment" because it is a conventional story and easy to follow. Compared with "Moment" that was first confusing, then when you realize what the movie is saying in your back plot is very complicated. What makes "Following" so much better is simply because it is simple, but at the same time clever of whoever watches. The film is much more direct and devastating, and you do not need to see it multiple times to get what you were trying to tell them as "Moment". "Follow" is a story within a story within a story with one of the most amazing and simply manipulated endings if you watch the movie again and realize the clues you will see. <br /> <br /> Made with an incredibly small budget of $ 6,000, this is less than most Hollywood movies offers for coffee breaks, with a name without black and white cast and little else one hour and 71 minutes. Hollywood, as well as the film industry outside Hollywood, can learn a lot from Chris Noland in how someone with nothing but talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can not; make a clever and yet penetrating movie with almost nothing in money and no big-name stars.
