I was ten when I saw Subspecies, I immediately got horny by Michael Watson and Laura Tate, they actually have great chemistry on the screen in the earlier parts of the movie. I asked for a copy in 1993 of Full Moon and I learned this: Ion and Rose, the servants, have much larger roles in the script along with the King. What most people do not know is that there was an alternate sequence that final scene: Michelle and Stefan were cornered in a room and Michelle got the idea of ​​Stefan making her a vampire to help fight Radu and his former controlled demonic friends. However, for some reason or another, this scenario never came to the camera. Another scene in the script, which can be confirmed from the original trailer, shows Stefan drinking blood from a wolf or, in fact, in the trailer, you see him coming up with blood on the chin. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 9 because it's one from my childhood and I have good memories attached to the characters; although my favorite characters are Stefan and Michelle, I think Andu Hove's Radu is pure evocative acting, a lot of feeling in her work there.
