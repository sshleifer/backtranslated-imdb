I love this movie. I only saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and had to step back so my sister could watch it. This movie is so funny. Twice I've been laughing so hard that my sides hurt. I did not expect to watch such a funny movie; I really just wanted to see why Laura Fraser is in it. I saw her for the first time in Titus, which is an incredible movie too. <br /> <br /> As other critics have said, many people are expecting a moving film. You will not be able to. What you'll get is humor, eye candy and the chance to wonder exactly what your perfect partner would be like if you could create them. You can also imagine what it would be like to get stuck in the body of the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> A hilarious sequence involves Justine herself as a naked man. I was cracking. <br /> <br /> I swear, this movie is the most imaginative teen movie I've ever seen and now it's my favorite. <br /> <br /> Just remember why the movies were originally created; as entertainment, not philosophy on the move. Remember this and you will have a great time watching Virtual Sexuality.
