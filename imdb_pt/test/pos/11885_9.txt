My Young Auntie is unique in many ways. First, this is the first action movie of Hui Ya-Hung (Kara Hui). According to She was actually doing the fight scenes after having surgery for her a few days before filming. Third, this movie is out of jail. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Wang Lung Wei trying to take away his brother's inheritance. Her brother then has Kara to marry him, so Wang can not take the treasure. The story is very good taking everything to its rightful place. <br /> <br /> In comes the action, what can I say that has not been said for movies like this, or Disciples of the 36th Chambers, The Victim? , or even the Magnificent Butcher. The fight scenes are the sales movie, and this will have no problem in doing so. Liu Chia Liang and Wang Lung Wei engaged in a fight you have to see to believe. Why these two men did not quarrel with each other is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I do not want to ruin anything for real, but you have to see My Young Aunt to have all the excitement. My only complaint is that Yuen Tak was not used as broadly as he was used in 3 Evil Masters, or even Invincible Pole Fighter (8 Diagram Pole Fighter) for great must see movies. 9,2 / 10
