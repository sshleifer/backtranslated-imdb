This is a Hollywood movie. The credentials of those involved are not revolutionary. This movie is not going to change the world. However, it is well done, well planned and well represented, which counts a lot. <br /> <br /> It's the cat-and-mouse story of a former CIA assassin who feels betrayed by pursuing a Secret Service agent who was protecting John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was killed in Dallas. The agent was understandably bothered by this failure during the subsequent years of his career and when the film began in 1992 - or certainly in contemporary America, this would-be assassin Mitch Leary (John Malkovich in a tour-de-force of creepiness in which he gives a transformative performance) was consumed with frustration and anger and decides that he will assassinate the president. He imagines he has a common cause with Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood in his calm, calm, humorous, better) that he believes should hold a grudge because the Warren Commission wrongly blamed Horrigan, Leary believes. for the assassination of President Kennedy. The tension is increased through a few phone calls from Leary to Horrigan - Leary wanting to keep Horrigan close, but not to betray her location and her plans. <br /> <br /> Ren√© Russo is excellent as Lily Raines, an agent with whom Horrigan develops an adult relationship. It is good to see a relationship between two equally competent pairs (even if Russo is a fairer young man than Eastwood at the time of filming). Russo is a calm and capable agent who is able to face the Horrigan in a quick and friendly way in friendly games. It is a good part for Russo, allowing her to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the romantic interest pattern of the older man. The acting of the protagonists, the competent direction of Wolfgang Peterson, the careful use of the music in the development of the plot and the excellent cinematography make of this film a movie that I can watch again and again.
