I just voted great because this movie took two snapshots of Americana: one in 1970, and one for each year after. <br /> <br /> Nothing really changed. <br /> <br /> Joe is actually an idiot, a big stupid idiot who is furious with everyone else in the world for his own idiocy. This is not really a spoiler, but the key to the movie is the big, corporate "never hurts" guy making friends with this semi-troglodyte Joe, and he gets some kind of ... validation of his intolerance and stupidity and sensation of being wronged. <br /> <br /> However, few would argue that the dealer boyfriend deserved to die. And those kids should not have ripped Joe and Compton off. And Joe and Compton were really getting into the hash and young skin until they were stolen. A simple movie in many ways except for the fact that in 1970 New York City was a pair of battlefields thanks to Nixon's care, and all the money going to war in Vietnam. As I write this (2/25/2007) there's a "long wait" on Netflix for this movie - which makes me happy because I think there are people out there who want to learn. This was a good snapshot - not exactly, a bit of a caricaturist - but actually very close to how it was back then. And the scariest thing is that things have not changed much. Of course, there is no more welfare, but that only means that wage slavery has won. Amazing how millionaires complain about not making enough money, then complain that $ 5.15 an hour is too much to pay for the population.
