I've always loved the Muppets. Although most of the children's entertainments were not so enjoyable, Muppet's was. Muppets are very, very funny. They are probably the friendliest child characters of all time. <br /> <br /> The Muppets not only had their own show. They have also starred in many movies. from The Muppet's Carol to Treasure Island of the Muppet. Muppet's first movie, The Muppet, was also, like the series and the other films, excellent. <br /> <br /> The Muppets movie is about how they all started. Shit, the frog used to live in a swamp. Until one day a movie executive tells you there are frog tests in Hollywood. Then Kermit takes off for Hollywood. Along the way, he comes across many people, such as Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, the Great, and Miss Piggy. Also, an evil man is trying to capture Kermit. <br /> <br /> All Muppets movies are very enjoyable. I mean, they're all so funny. This movie has many appearances in movies. Like Steve Martin, Mel Brooks, Elliot Gould, Carol Kane, Richard Pryor and Orson Welles. The Muppet movies are all very nice. I heard that Jason Segel is going to star in soon. I can not wait to see this.
