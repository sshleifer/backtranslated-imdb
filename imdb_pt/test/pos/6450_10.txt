I'm so happy that Zac was in The Suite Life of Zack and Cody because this is my favorite show and he's my favorite actor. It's a very funny episode and a funny show! I love everything about the show and the characters. All the performers are great. He's still playing Zac, and I'm so happy that almost all my favorite actors (including the High School Musical characters) are in this show. Zac Efron is so "hot" and I have an autographed photo of him! It's not a photo copy, and it came all the way from America to Australia and almost did not arrive in time for Christmas. Also, I have a Musical Mug High School with my name printed on it. (Scarlett 8)
