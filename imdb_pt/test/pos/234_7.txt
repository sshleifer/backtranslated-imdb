Although I'm not crazy about musicals, COVER GIRL is a delight to classic movie fans and especially to fans of Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. The film can be dated by today's standards and the history and songs may not be anything special, but the musical numbers are magnificently staged and there is a great cast to accompany the film. In addition, the film is a worthy introduction to Rita Hayworth's fans ... she is simply stunning in glorious Technicolor. Despite Jerome Kern's collaboration with the film, his music here is not nearly as special or memorable as his songs in SWING TIME (1936), but the songs serve the film well. The dance is nothing short of excellent, especially coming from the solo number of Gene Kelly and my favorite musical number, "Alter-Ego Dance". The fun Phil Silvers almost steals the film as Kelly's partner. Otto Kruger, Eve Arden and Edward Brophy give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles. And Rita plays a sweet and lovely girl here; a role that is a far cry from her femme fatale babies in films like BLOOD AND SAND (1941). <br /> <br /> In short, this is a delightful movie that is worth watching, even if you're not big on musicals. However, the music of the film could have been more memorable if only my favorite period composers, Irving Berlin or Cole Porter, wrote the songs for this movie. However, it is the glorious Technicolor cinematography and the imaginative dance that are the real pleasures of the film's production. While I watched Rita Hayworth do her thing, I do not think I've ever seen more beautiful or graceful redhead dancing on the screen since I saw Moira Shearer in Michael Powell's masterpiece THE RED SHOES (1948) . Just watch Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her.
