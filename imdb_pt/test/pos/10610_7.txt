Mention Bollywood to anyone with a slight familiarity with the genre and the generally invented images are cheesy about the major musical numbers populated by costumes that make Las Vegas a bastion of conservatism. This perception is not aided by the puff of condescension that pervades most of the films that approached Bollywood from the point of view of a stranger. The romantic comedy of Willard Carroll, Marigold, however, takes a different turn. It is not a simple glance at these foolish people and their mischievous antics, but a sincere appreciation of Bollywood for its vitality, its lack of irony and self-consciousness. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the director has a tremendous affection and respect for Bollywood, and at the same time, he is perplexed by his kitschier aspects. And if you have a familiarity with Bollywood, you can appreciate what it does here in making a true hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood film conventions. From one of the opening shots, a flashback of the character Salman as a child by the sea, talking to his grandmother (played by Helen! - how many Salman movies start with that same premise?) For the flashback sequence that is embedded in the movie. film that Marigold and Prem have filmed, anyone who has seen enough Bollywood movies will recognize these references. Does the story itself incorporate tried and true Hollywood and Bollywood conventions as well? the fish out of the water meets the family's duty - at the expense of personal fulfillment. The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood plot of the most comical set of the first half, giving way to a more dramatic resolution of the second. However, ultimately the film's sensitivity is that of Hollywood, with its discreet and ironic humor and its story of a woman learning to believe in herself, to achieve self-affirmation. <br /> <br /> You could not have a Bollywood-inspired movie if there were no musical numbers and this movie does not disappoint with seven of them. Unlike Bollywood, however, the songs do not come out of nowhere and carry their characters to a European location or to Goa beach; they exist as musical numbers that are part of the movie being made, remembering how the musical numbers were justified in the Busby Berkeley films as being part of a stage show. Or do they come out of a situation where music already has a reason to be there? a sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches Marigold to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians (including a special guest of the Shaan singer) playing. Everyone reflects the emotional state of the protagonists at this point in the film. Often the song will have a conventional song of one genre and put a touch of the other. So, in one of the highlights of the film in which Marigold presents himself, is the representation of music quite typical of his genre? the female star singing and dancing among a line of women? but in this case Ali Larter is blond looking like a natural Bollywood movie star, emoting and lip synching with the Hindi letters without subtitles. <br /> <br /> They are also synonymous with sumptuous Bollywood visuals and Marigold accomplishes this aspect beautifully thanks to some of the best talent working in Bollywood today. The director of photography is Anil Mehta, who was also the director of photography for Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The choreographer is Vaibhavi Merchant and the production designer is Nitin Desai, both of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. Can you really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam in this movie? in fact, the floor lit in one of the numbers was originally Dholi Taro Dhol, which coincidentally has a built-in Marigold pattern. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, Carroll obviously has a penchant for detecting acting talent, as evidenced by playing at heart? one of the first films for Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe. And in this film he again hits the target with Ali Larter. One of the main reasons why the film works is because of Larter. She makes a character malicious, nasty, nice and her subsequent transformation believable and she is smart, funny and sexy because she is intelligent and funny. She and Salman share excellent chemistry and this is one of the film's greatest strengths. <br /> Salman Khan plays the role of Prince Charming here filtered through his iconic role as Prem. This is the old school Prem, however, so expect a calm and subdued Salman - those he used to wear on his usual striptease avatar may be disappointed ?? or relieved! It is a sincere and sensitive performance of him spoiled only by the weak enunciation of his English speeches. With a refreshing lack of cynicism and shameless embrace of romantic love, the film is a love letter to the Bollywood and Hollywood films. of old.
