I loved. In fact, I watched it over and over again, and I was able to watch it again. This movie is not boring. <br /> <br /> The vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie. It's a job well done, great for today's generation. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me whenever she wants and what sexy accent she has. Donal Logue offers a great comic relief. <br /> <br /> This vampire movie is like no other. I can not wait for Blade 2.
