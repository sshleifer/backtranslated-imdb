Roy Anderssons "Du Levande" is not totally original, as it is counterpart of the previous film of Andersson, "Sånger från andra våningen". Still, the film has an aura of total originality. Some movie making conventions are still thrown out: most actors do not look like what you'd expect in the movie and the filming takes a long time. Most of the time, the camera does not move, but people move around it. The shots begin somewhere and often the scenery accumulates in astounding proportions. W.G. Sebald comes to mind in the literature with the same technique. Because of the time invested in each shot, the suspension is really high in many scenes. There is a story and it is not - it is left for the viewer to build in their own mind. This movie is positive. It is determined not to see all of this in a negative way and at the same time it will not go through social injustices. One of the messages I received was that maybe all failures and accidents are not fatal, after all. Great movie.
