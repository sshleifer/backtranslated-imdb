What can you say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It also works with a large and energetic cast, apparently enjoying themselves to the fullest, and while you may want a remastered version, I think we're lucky to have that video transfer. Pretty much a treat everywhere. There are a couple of moments a bit off but this could have been embarrassing throughout and certainly it is not. It might as well have been and today would have been too much camp. No, a very good effort that is fun, melodious and sexy enough. Beautiful performances particularly to Kristine DeBell in the lead and was that a Richard Prior not accredited as the prone Knight being vigorously (if discretely) mounted?
