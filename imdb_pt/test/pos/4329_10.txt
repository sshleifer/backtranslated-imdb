However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael to "The Others", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret while they are in the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Locke decides that time has come to discover that it is time to find out what will happen if "the button" is not pressed. However, Mr. Eko's decision to continue pressing "the button" is surprisingly strong. So when Locke invents a plan to lock Eko out of the hatch with the help of an ally, Eko comes up with surprisingly desperate measures to stop Locke from doing what he believes will be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> It's a classic episode of Lost, full of secrets, suspense and very few answers to the many questions it asks spectators. However, some of the secrets of this action-packed episode reveal that it will be truly shocking to fans. There is also a trademark end-of-season cliffhanger, which achieves the feat of being shocking and extremely confusing. One thing is guaranteed, it will keep you guessing until the end, and you will still be frustrated with more dazzling questions while waiting in agony for the Season Three to begin.
