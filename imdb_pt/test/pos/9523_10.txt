For all of us American Deneuve fans, this little gem is a bit hard to get. Fortunately, I found myself so wrapped up in the little bits I watched on youtube.com that I was willing to do anything. I found it on ebay.com, I ordered directly from France and I moved my laptop to play the DVDs from Region 2. Let me tell you it was worth it. Be warned - there are no subtitles (by chance, Pathe should not have released this on DVD, Koch Lorber should have - they are good on the subtitles). I do not speak a word of French. I can pronounce a syllable here and there, order a drink and everything. That being said, this movie was a treatment anyway. I could not fully appreciate the supposed "obscene" humor or spirited dialogue. Watching Deneuve and his companions was enough for me. I understood what was happening without the need for dialogue. This really says something about a movie when those who do not speak the language enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is wonderful. London is lovely as the wounded son-in-law. I loved the lesbian mother. And of course, what can I say about our dear Mademoiselle Deneuve? She is special. Those eyes, that smile. I could watch your movies all day. It really goes beyond beauty. People always say she's beautiful. Well, yes, she is. But she is also very talented. I believed her every second of the way. Your conversation about chocolate and vanilla with London is too sweet. His character is still arrested for smoking marijuana with a 15-year-old on the street. TO NOT LOSE! Fly to France and buy this if you have to. Great. 10
