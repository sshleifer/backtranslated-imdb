I was recommended this movie as one of the best love stories ever told. And since I'm a big fan of love, I bought the tickets and sat in the theater. After 90 minutes, I left the theater with nothing but disappointment and the theme song was the only positive thing about the movie. I was shocked by the story itself, that two people can love each other, but are so afraid of ever acting. I just could not get past the language barrier and the cultural barrier. The second time I ran into him ... I was in a different mood, had no more expectations ... and had more patience, more relaxed mind to "see" the movie ... and as soon as I opened my eyes I discovered love ... the beauty of the movie. I went beyond the language and love story and saw the acting (not for a moment I felt they were acting!) And cinematography. The first time I heard a definition of what a movie is, I was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced shots (shots) and this is the movie that matches the description. Almost all the photos have an idea behind and combined with the music ... and the light effects ... the result is just a work of art! And a masterpiece is just something you should have in your movie collection.
