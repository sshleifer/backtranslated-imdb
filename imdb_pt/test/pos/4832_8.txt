Having finally gotten the DVD of this 1997 HBO movie, we came down to see it. When I finished, the old adage "those who can not learn from the past are doomed to revive it" was echoing in the mind. First shown four years after the first bombing of the Twin Towers (and four years before the events of September 11), Path To Paradise reveals the series of immediate encounters, errors and internal decisions that led to the first bombing of the Twin Towers. and the lessons we should have learned from them. <br /> <br /> The Path to Paradise presents a beautiful cast of believable actors. Peter Gallagher and Marcia Gay Harden lead the cast as FBI agents John Anticev and Nancy Floyd who face not only the threats of terrorism but the lack of official interest from their superiors along with their NYPD colleague Lou Napoli (Paul Guilfoyle ). Art Malik, Andreas Katsulas, Shaun Toub and Tony Gillan are among those who plan and carry out the attack, all of which play their roles not as potential cliches but as real people and make the movie better. Of special mention is Ned Eisenberg as Emad Salem, the man who, had it not been for skeptical FBI officers, could have potentially informed about the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is also well produced. Despite being made for cable this movie does not feel like a low budget movie in all its production values, particularly in its sets and venues in New York. The film's fascinating cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style at times. When all of these elements are combined with the script, all of this helps give the film a sense of reality that makes events even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing about the movie is the script. . The events of the film are true (minus a dramatic license that is always needed) and in retrospect are even more shocking than they must have been when the film was first shown twelve years ago. The film reveals how a group of men managed to smuggle a bomb into the World Trade Center. They did so thanks to the lack of Arabic translators, government agencies failing to pass information to each other, the FBI ignoring links from a source and police departments failing to pick up clues. Worse still, researchers' inability to connect points is the fact that many of these same things not only allowed the 9.11 attacks to occur, but in some cases (such as a lack of translators) are problems that continue to this day. Even more chilling is the ending that actually happened and looks very prophetic today. <br /> <br /> The Path to Paradise is a film that must be essential to today's vision. The film is not only well represented and produced, but it teaches us a lesson we should have learned earlier. The lesson of the movie? That those who can not learn from the past are doomed to revive it. If you can find this movie, watch and learn from it.
