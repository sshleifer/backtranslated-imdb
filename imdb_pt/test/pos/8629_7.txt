So I think Bud and Lou liked to mess with classic stories (although they have interesting results). In that case, they are nannies and a bad boy, and Lou tries to read it "Jack and the Beanstalk", but falls asleep and dreams that he is the butcher of Jack and Bud, and they climb the beanstalk to rescue the prince and the princess. of the giant (Buddy Baer). <br /> <br /> I think my favorite scene was when Lou was trying to make the giant an omelet, and ... well, I'll let you see what happens. As this was an Abbott and Costello movie, they had some unnecessary music, but other than that, it was pretty funny. For other interpretations of classical history, "Bewitched" and "Gilligan's Island" both had episodes portraying this.
