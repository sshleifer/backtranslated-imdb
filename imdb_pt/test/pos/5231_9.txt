The details on The Big Trail were so incredible that I felt the movie was made at the moment it represents. I've never seen such real wagons! They were large, full of accessories, and even felt as if they had been filled with details under the canvas covers that should never be seen. Every speck of dirt, every scratch, every splinter was there. Modern computational technology could never recreate the scenes of the numerous carts as they move through the earth or the circle to drive the Indians away. The wagons were all real, individual vehicles, each with its own royal team of horses or oxen. <br /> <br /> The actors' clothes could not have looked more genuine. Except for John Wayne's suede clothing and Marguerite Churchill's beautiful dress, the clothes were very ordinary, ragged or dirty in an authentic way. Many of the actors and actresses were born before electricity and internal plumbing were common, and they must have felt comfortable with the environment. All Indians were real Indians instead of white-painted extras. <br /> <br /> Women of the old west had to be strong because there was a lot of work. In each scene showing the work done by wagon personnel, women are shown cutting wood, hauling logs, etc. This realism was so natural that it did not seem like a statement about the role of women of the day a fact of survival. <br /> <br /> The plot of revenge and romance is played well. Nothing is exaggerated or exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Something was lost along the way in 1930 in Hollywood. As much as I love the fake scenery and controlled environment of old movies, The Big Trail manages to feel real above all else. The more I watch big budget movies from the age of silence, the more I like them. I can think of some 1930s movies that I've seen that equate to the grandeur of the best of the 1920s. If there were home movies made on railroad trains, The Big Trail is how they would be.
