In defense of this film, I must repeat what I said earlier. The film is called Arachina, has no name and I do not refer to any name as in the actors who act in rarely seen art films. I mean, no name like at your local school decided to make an unnamed movie and it could have a budget of $ 2. So, what do you expect? Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> I felt the film was never taken seriously, which automatically takes it off the worst list of movies. This list is just for big budget all the star cast movies that one takes very seriously. The Oscar film comes to mind, most of Sylvester Stallone's films. The two leaders were not Hepburn and Tracy, but they did the job well enough for this movie. The woman kicked her ass and the guy was not an idiot. The actor who played the old man was really good. The man who played the anal retardation teacher was not Clifton Webb, but he did God's work. And the Bimbo for lack of better were interpreted by two competent actors. I laughed at the special effects of 50 cents. But that was part of the film's charm. Played as a hybrid quake meets the Night of the Living Dead. The premise of the film is like all the Giant Bug movies of the 1950s. A meteor or radiation shakes the ecosystem and, before you know it, we have giant ants, lobsters, rocks or lizards terrorizing the locals. A meteor was the cause of the problems this time around. I was very entertained. I did not expect much and I go a lot more than I expected.
