Watch with an open mind, it's very different, nothing is cute about it. Very well done Tarzan's realistic tale. Animatronic chimpanzees are well made for 1984, Christopher Lambert was brilliant mimicking the language and behavior of chimpanzees. I would not be surprised if he took lessons from Jane Goodall.
