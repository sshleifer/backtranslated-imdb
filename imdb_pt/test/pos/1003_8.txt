So keira knightly is in it ... Then we automatically compare that movie with the atonement. Apart from the fact that this film is also in wartime and its appearance is not revealing, these films are totally different. <br /> <br /> The actors work well, I think a good thing is that there is a memorable person, they are one If you want a movie where things happen, then id advise another like the story of this movie it is about human interaction and their physique damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined. <br /> <br /> This movie has genuine interaction, perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath. No, it's not exciting, but it's exciting if you can empathize with these characters. At times I wondered if this movie could have been better as a play instead of a movie. We expect a lot from movies as much as anything is possible, and yet with the theater we allow interaction and rely on belief. <br /> <br /> There are things wrong if you are looking for a blockbuster, if you do not look for anything and let the movie take you, move you, allow yourself to forget those stars, and not judge them as actors, but let them become people, you will really feel indignant. <br /> <br /> Go ahead! ! give a try!
