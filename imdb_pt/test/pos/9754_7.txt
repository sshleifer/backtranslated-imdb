HUNT FOR JUSTICE is a Canadian television drama that hit the DVD and is a source of gratitude to those who hunger for educational dramas who tell us about facts in the current story that are somehow buried in the media. The film is not a Hollywood production, it relies heavily on footage from court records, but it also introduces many of us Louise Arbor's heroic act to provoke the trial of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. <br /> <br /> Louise Arbor (veteran Canadian actress Wendy Crewson) is a Canadian judge appointed by NATO as the chief prosecutor for war crimes at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The film begins in 1996 when Arbor travels to The Hague to confront the political obstacles that are holding the court to prosecution of war criminals in the war that Yugoslavia has been waging in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, a war that has gross evidence of crimes against humanity in the form of genocide, extermination camps and other heinous abuses. Progress in bringing criminals to justice is hampered by generals (including one interpreted by William Hurt) who fear a major World War if precautions against them are breached. Arbor, with the help of his translator Pasko Odsak (Stipe Erceg), his team, including Keller (Heino Ferch) and the unexpected assistance of British captain John Tanner (John Corbett), goes on, concentrating on the impossible task of bringing all those responsible parties to justice in three specific events. Two of the top three suspects are captured, but during the tests they come to an end. This leaves only Slobodan Milosevic himself, and Arbor and his colleagues succeed in bringing the war criminal to justice in 1999. There are several moving plots employed in the narration of this well-documented tale, stories that make the point of the story more personal. Some may find footage of corpses, prisoners and death camps too strong to watch, but they are needed to show the purpose of the film. Wendy Crewson carries the power to carry the message home - the message that war crimes should never go unpunished. There is a lot of current story to be learned from this movie: writers Ian Adams, Riley Adams and M.A. Lovretta condensed the information and also made it dramatic. Director Charles Binam√© balances the docudrama with the progress of the story, never forgetting that he has a story of intrigue to tell as well. HUNT FOR JUSTICE is worth watching! Grady Harp
