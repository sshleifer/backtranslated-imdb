This movie is a perfect example of great escapism! I loved this movie and got sucked in from the beginning. Of course it's just an action movie, but are not you having fun with watching movies? <br /> <br /> The cast of this movie is very strong, with friendly characters. The friendship between the boys is so realistic and attractive, it's exciting and hilarious to see a group of teenage boys interact - especially this group of boys !! Sean Astin makes a great rebel, successfully avoiding being an early teenager. <br /> <br /> If you want fun, watch this movie! I liked it even though I was watching on a very dirty old VHS that was of terrible quality (Go DVD!)
