Okay, maybe you do not deserve an Oscar. Or a Golden Globe. Or any prize, for that matter. The acting is not prominent, there is no reason to give management credit, and it's really just another 21st century slasher movie that most people will consider decent. Or maybe even terrible. But in my opinion, it does not matter at all. And that's because I had so much fun watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the first 40 minutes are very slow, but as the movie progresses, something you will like, if you are as I was, and anyone else should be watching this movie. And that is: looking for 2 hours of fun, senseless violence. (And a final kick, which I will not ruin.) Yes, there are many flaws in this movie, but do not let the cast list on the cover fool you. Hilton offers a decent performance that no one has seen coming. Even her biggest enemies like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us a lot with her acting skills and a striptease that was not as nasty as anything an online popup promised her but not yet so unbearable to advance or shut down the DVD. <br /> <br /> The violence surprised me; no one at school or in the horror scene was talking about how they were about "these new movies called 'Saw' and 'Hostel'," but I could safely say that "Wax" was more graphic than Saw, and some scenes from death were actually In conclusion, it comes as no surprise that House of Wax was not part of the Top 250 IMDb, but it's definitely worth a look.
