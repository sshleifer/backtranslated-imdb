I was a bit scared when I went to the movies to see this movie. In fact, it is always difficult to make a movie from a comic book and the first episode of the adventures of the two greatest French heroes was good, but not fantastic. Finally, it's very funny from start to finish with unexpected gags, some cartoon scenes, no timeouts, great special effects, a great cast, great scenery, great stuff !!! <br /> <br /> However, I wonder how they will translate all the French names into English or German, because it is certainly funny in French, but how will it be in another language?
