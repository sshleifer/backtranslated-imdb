There. Good, fun, and accurate felt for most scenes. Plenty of personality variations to cover the actual people around those days without distractions from the history of exceptions. Credits show Mar Vista Peralta, California .. rising up the Venice Hill and south of Malibu. I used to live there in the days of the Heartbreak Hotel, pre-Beachboys, next to that surfer Bob Cooper on Wasatch Avenue, where the alley was used to burn surfboards that did not work. Old skateboard wheels were used in plywood cutouts to lower the sidewalk waves. Things were different in each succeeding decade as the cold innocence of the 1950s invaded the freedom and joy of the warm water of the Sun of the Sixties and then of the groundbreaking game of play and the inventive evolutionary madness of the strange seventies . The film gives you a piece of that magical moment in time; in a place where the imaginary wave was real .. the source of culturally significant influences. And BTW, there is another film that has a similarly American nervousness, and has the same genuinely original kindness with relaxed realism that helps refine the elusive eternal sensation of freshness. "Two Lane Blacktop" (with one of the best examples of freesouldoit attitude in the history of the west coast of California .. Dennis Wilson). As Mount Hellman did with that, thank you, SP, for being there with this one. GWR
