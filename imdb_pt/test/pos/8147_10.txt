Honestly, at first I watched this movie because of the free sex scenes I heard, but by watching the movie, it just made me realize that there are still good, sensible movies out there. In fact, it's one of the most well-crafted and moving movies I've ever seen. I am a bisexual teenager and the movie told me about my difficulties - sex, religion, love, acceptance, etc. This gave me an idea on how to deal with these problems with the help of myself and others around me who love me for who I am. Cox really coped well with the film sprinkling strains of lines that warm the heart and some sexuality in it. This made the film more interesting. Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain, but I do not agree. Brokeback Mountain has more drama while the latter days are well balanced.
