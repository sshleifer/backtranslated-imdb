On many levels it is very good. In fact, considering that this was a low budget British indie by a feature director for the first time with a largely novice cast, it is a magnificent achievement. I do not know how much it costs. The Â£ 8,000 number has been advertised, but you never know how reliable such a figure is. The point is that this film seems to cost a few million pounds and clearly cost a small fraction of the great special effects, excellent production design, props and effective costumes, great photography, good acting and direction, an impressive score and a mix absolutely stunning sound. Even having said that, a lot of the script was great. The characters were clearly identified and everyone had something to do. This is a movie about ten men all dressed roughly the same way in one place and it would be easy for them to be nameless, faceless, but those were ten characters - most of them were made through dialogue and the way they reacted to things . Throughout the middle act, when the plot was developing, the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters. If the whole movie were like the second act, it would be impressive. <br /> <br /> Before the ship explodes, twelve people arrive at individual escape pods or 'e-pods' that move away from the ship. They are not much more than automatic metal coffins and the poor sods inside are stuck, tight and have no real idea where they are going - but that makes sense. I like the e-pods - they are a great idea made very well and make more sense than a beautiful and spacious exhaust capsule. I also like the way we are specifically told later that they are designed to escape from ship to ship but can only make the planet fall into an emergency - because, let's face it, these guys were lucky to have their ship destroyed so close to a planet. That said, I do not think there are 116 unused e-pods still on the freighter and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to get into an e-pod - but he stays. (And has it just occurred to me: should not the captain have come down with his ship instead of being the first guy to get out?) Anyway, e-pods land on an arid planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation . - or at least in a sandy part with little vegetation on the planet, which may have chilly residues and lush forests elsewhere. No, it's a planet in a science fiction movie - it will be exactly the same. We have to accept that all e-pods go down a few miles from each other, so the ten survivors can meet, firing rockets into the sky to locate each other. The captain, a muscular mountain of a man who could have a good career in action movies if he got the right agent, decided that they should try to contact Captain Behan with whom they intended to meet. But they can not do that from the planet, they need to go into orbit. The engineer says that if they combine the power units of two e-pods, they can probably give them enough juice to stand on anti-grav equipment, high enough to blow up the atmosphere. Everything can be done in automatic, but you will need a 'pilot' to send the signal. The captain bravely volunteers for this, but in a commendable and sensible move, the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man on the e-pod, a bit tricky, is ridiculous and needs to be the lightest member of the team. This is a boy. I really liked the way he now points out that his name is David and the Captain begins to use it, treating him with dignity and respect. That was good storytelling and good characterization.
