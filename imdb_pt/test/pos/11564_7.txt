The Dakota Incident is a curiosity for several reasons. It will be obvious from the beginning that it was done long before anyone thought of political correctness. Although, Ward Bond character softens the edge with "maybe we can communicate with them, after all they are human, too" kind of dialogue. His part lies side by side with the preacher trying to communicate with the Martians in War of the Worlds. Actually, it's weird. The title is curious as well. The use of the word "Incident" contributes with importance and sophistication to the film that probably did not hurt the boxoffice. The combination of characters and costume and Linda Darnell's hat are wonderful touches that make Dakota Incident a Western artifact from the fifties.
