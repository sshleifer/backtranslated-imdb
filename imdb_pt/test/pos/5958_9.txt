Looks like M.Hazanavicius is back! The man behind "America's Class" returns with a very fun and clever sequence for those old-fashioned OSS-117s ... While directors tend to "over-upgrade" sequences of old classics (remember the avengers, urk), Hazanavicius chose to work on a very cheap hero, OSS-117, a kind of French low-budget 007, and decides to do it in an old way ... Photography, body attitudes, fights choreography and FX, everything is a tribute to the way the films were made in the 1950s. And it works because the tone and jokes of the movie are really good! Jean Dujardin perfectly incorporates this arrogant-arrogant selfish French spy, lost in a country he understands only in terms of folklore and inferiority. That's it, just as the West used to consider its colonies at that time (and, oh no, I'm not going to say it has something to do with what happens today in the same area ... ah ah) ... It looks like a Lino Ventura thawed, with something like 40 pounds less, which is perfect for the paper. The other cast members fit perfectly too, with everything you can dream of Russian spies, independent Egyptians and ex-Nazis. And, of course, women, as there has to be "femmes fatales" in any good espionage. movies ... The plot is good (it may not be brilliant, but really good enough ...), happening between real historical facts, and reminding us in a funny way how France (and others) treated their colonies in those days . It all begins in 1955 with a British spy disappearing while trawling a Russian cargo full of guns in Suez. So France sends its best friend, the OSS-117 agent, to find out what happened to the shipment and the agent ... The fact is that this agent is really as dumb as he can be, and he slides through history without even understand it, solving it in a very strange way. I have to say that I had a bad feeling about the film, since the publicity made around was rather scary, and as the French mood tends to be quite populist and flat (forget about les bronz√©s 3 or camping ...) but I was really surprised, and on the right track! I recommend if you want a good parody of Bond-esquire movies (a lot more fun than in DEBS for example but fewer skirts) or you're a fan in that genuine and sincere way of filming that they had back in 5Os . Yes, he's smart and (really!) Funny, you got Mr. Hazanavicius again!
