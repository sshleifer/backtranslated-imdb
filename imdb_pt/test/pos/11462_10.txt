any movie that has a line of dialogue that goes something like this ... "Judy is getting ready for their date, Butthole!" It has to be good! I found this on DVD unrated, unheard of and I was pleasantly surprised, a lot of hard work was put into making this movie. I really enjoyed that more than the many 1980s movies I've seen. Great addition to my movie collection. <br /> <br /> The buildup was great, set the scares for the rest of the movie. I loved GORE and T & A. I never thought that eyes being plucked looked like boils, the color of eyes was gross! I still think "Rog" looked like Tiger Woods, but darker, would anyone agree?
