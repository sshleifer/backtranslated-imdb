It does exactly what you expect, and then some. The first film was a step up from the TV show with sicker, uncensored stunts, and a factor that has increased. Surprisingly, Jackass Number Two is even more distorted. <br /> <br /> The acrobatics became more dangerous and spectacular, with some painful sensations, sprinkled with good fun skits to keep that smile turning into a wave of disgust. Knoxville, as usual, dominates the process, but this time he's right to have the limelight as he offers himself to the most dangerous and stupid of all acrobatics, with Bam Magera also being wild as ever, despite having his image in 'Viva La Bam'. Surprisingly, the infamous Wild Boys (Steve O and Chris Pontius) seem to participate in a smaller number of skits, although they are focused on the previous exits. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass or Dirty Sanchez, then definitely enjoy this movie, and will laugh at your guts during the 100 minutes of its duration if you see it as childish, disgusting or a sad snapshot of young culture today, you will find it as offensive as ever. Then f ** k off.
