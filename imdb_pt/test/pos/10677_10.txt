I saw this movie in the early 70's, when I was about 10 years old. old man on TV. It was after school, and while I was watching, I was so caught up in the idea of ​​the two astronauts going on a mission to another unknown planet that I asked my mother if I could get the tape recorder. She left me. Then I wrapped the microphone wire around the Channel button, so the microphone was hanging in front of the speaker. This movie is the first one I've ever listened to enough - and I cared enough to record. (Audio only - there were no VCRs at the moment.) The storyline will get you hooked on every word ... every minute of that movie. The ending will surprise you. After watching the journey to the far side of the sun .. You will have flash-backs in your mind about this for a long time. I reproduced the audio recording for many years ... and "saw" it repeatedly in my mind. So - maybe 15 years later ... when VCRs were common, and they were selling tapes in stores. I was always looking for it ... but never found it. But when the Internet came in one day, I looked for it and bought it in a second. So ... after 30 years after seeing it for the first time - I could see it again. WOW! ~~ It was spectacular! Just for reference .. I must have watched 50 times since.
