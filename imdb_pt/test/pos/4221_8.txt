This is the funniest sequel I've seen in a long time, it's a lot funnier than the other three and not a bit scary. There are some very bloody pieces in the movie, but not enough to make him sick. In this, he has a doll companion, hence the name. If you liked the first three, then you'll love it, go watch!
