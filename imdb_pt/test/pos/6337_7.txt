Episode # 13 of the fantastic (excuse the incredibly gay terminology) "Supernatural" TV series reallocates Sam and Dean Winchester to Missouri where they were called by an old flame of Dean to investigate a series of mysterious murders occurring in his small City . As it turns out, a large pickup truck with an invisible driver is running over African Americans on a desolate stretch of road ... As Dean tries to rekindle his past love affair, more people in the city appear as run-downs. The cause seems to be due to a racial incident passed in the 60s, causing a frustrated and hired spirit to remain in the ghost limbo, attempting to kill black motorists. "Route 666" is another good part (which is not uncommon, I noticed) that contains some notable aspects of the pair of main characters, such as Dean fucking and Sam's lament for leaving college ... The killer truck it does not seem like the most terrifying thing in the world, however, for a one-hour show it works well. It's not a fantastic episode, but a solid concept with more references to horror movies.
