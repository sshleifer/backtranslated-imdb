Damn it! and we all thought that Joan Crawford was the horror Mommy dear ... well Laura Hope Crewes as mother in this pungent 4-character film (and police) deliver the goods in this biscuit of a marital mommy dummy ..... THE SILVER CORD is a genuinely sensational pre-code drama of the RKO made in 1932, released in 1933 from a 1929 play. So surprising, frank and honest is every surprising verbal exchange between the wife of one son (Irene Dunne) along with the other's fianc√© while these two younger girls together go to war - unconcernedly angrily unwrapping the mother's clearly incestuous desires toward her hunky older son played by manly Joel MacCrea and his young boyfriend / son paid by the delicate 25-year-old actor. beautiful Eric Linden. I think this movie played for many appreciative audiences in big theaters in 1933 and offers viewers, even in 2005, a very fruity melodrama enlivened by the crackling dialogue, not afraid to call the mother exactly as she is. This movie would have been impossible to do after the censorship code came after 1934. Other comments from the viewer on IMDb support my reaction and you will find almost everyone lucky enough to see (and tape) THE SILVER CORD will agree that it is an unforgettable and poignant script in a superbly produced film. She would have played as VIRGINIA WOLF of 1932. Laura Hope Crewes must have kissed the sound stage on the RKO for this role of a lifetime ... even more than her cute spin on GWTW. Irene Dunne is as beautiful and casual and believable as ever, fighting for her husband one more time, and it's worth seeing The Divorce made in 1929 as a complementary piece to THE SILVER CORD. Joel MaCrea is certainly in the same league as Cary Grant and Randolph Scott on the beautiful and lovely stakes. I had never seen Eric Linden in a real acting role before (he played the amputated leg in the hospital horror scene at GWTW) and here he is surprising and young with an excellent role as Robert, the youngest and most sensitive son. Some verbal barbs facing him again would not pass through the Code office if they were made later. This is a very good movie, and if the viewer forgives some of the creaking of their time and settle for a matchless punch match for a 1932 movie, you will be well rewarded. At first I thought part of my mother's melodrama was dated until I realized it was a great script to make the viewer laugh at her as if she were a weak old lady ... NO. .... but neither the two other women in this power play in the movies, hence the fantastic replica dialogue. That transatlantic seen on a coil is the LEVIATHAN, the monster ship the United States won from the Germans in World War I, which was so large and heavy that crews were nervous wrecks trying to fight him in the Atlantic. It is infamous to plow a colossal wave head in a storm and shoot on the ridge at such an angle that the spine along the bottom splits and the ship splits vertically between the funnels. It jammed to pumping with steel panels and flashing rivet holes ... and mentally shattered crew and passengers. He was sunk in 1935 after being cursed and plagued with mechanical problems of horror throughout his existence. It's not a war prize, after all. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the dialogue in THE SILVER CORD is enough emotion for one night: for example: "Mom! the doctor said that there was nothing wrong with you, in fact he said it would be necessary a dynamite to kill you. " Whammo!
