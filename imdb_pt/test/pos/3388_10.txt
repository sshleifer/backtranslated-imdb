This is a great movie, all 3 were. The latter was not as good as the first two, but it was done over time and was pulling on straws. But you want to watch it because it tells the end of the story. Not just how could we think it should end. <br /> <br /> These films made me want to be there to be in all the difficulties, love, tears and laughter that the people in this movie cast. It's one of the few movies that is good every time you see it, no matter how many times that is. <br /> <br /> There are some parts in the movie that the little children will not understand and the older ones may not be old enough to watch. but it's a great movie, over 20 years old.
