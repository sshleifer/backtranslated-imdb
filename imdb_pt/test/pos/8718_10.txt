Recently I was lucky enough to see the name of Ingrid Bergman linked to a movie I had never seen (or heard of) in AMC. Which is a stroke of luck. <br /> <br /> To marvel at his impeccable and continuous performance, is not the only reason to stay up late and watch this movie. The writing is wonderfully comedic and the performances are excellent. <br /> <br /> Walter Mathau (not my favorite) was almost perfect and Goldie Hawn (surprisingly) was fabulous. Tender at times, demanding, then simply goofy. There are moments in the movie in which even the stiffest movie viewer gets caught up in the story and forgets it's a movie. <br /> <br /> This Bergman can steal a dance scene from a 20-year-old crowd. olds was amazing to watch. She is easy on her return to the screen (with 54 years of age). The support cast was great and the lines ... the lines are great. <br /> <br /> A top 5 romantic comedy of all time.
