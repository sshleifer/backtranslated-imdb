I love Sarah Waters' Fingersmith, and I was worried about the TV adaptation as I was disappointed with the BBC version of Tipping the Velvet (which though cute to be seen by Keeley Hawes not being able to sing, and Rachael Stirling did not be able to act). Fingersmith is a very well-planned novel with twists and turns, and I wondered if it could be done in just three hours. <br /> <br /> I did not need to worry. The adaptation was excellent, very little cut, and it went ahead to a violent rhythm (although I wondered if, if you had not read the book, would you miss things?). It had the appearance of a BBC classic fantasy drama and I had to remind myself that this is a contemporary book. <br /> <br /> The performance was stellar. Sally Hawkins acting as Sue Trinder and Elaine Cassidy, a slow burner, who at the end of the story was incandescent as Maud Lilley. The love, the passion, the accomplishment of the acts of betrayal that both would have to perform, were written on their faces. It was a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> I hope Rachael Stirling is watching: this is how you play a Sarah Waters character!
