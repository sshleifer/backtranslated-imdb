Wicked Little things was a very good movie. I'll say that in some parts it seemed really unbelievable, and others seemed as if there was not enough thought put into the actions of the characters, but overall it was exciting and fun. I do not understand why the rating of this movie is so low. Nor do I understand why all the ratings in the Afterdark Horrorfest movie are so low. These people are from B-Movies and nothing more. They provide great entertainment and most of them do not have many flaws at all. This is definitely worth taking a look at because you will not be disappointed with the result. Little Little Things is one of the best Afterden 1 Horrorfest Annual movies, and compared with a lot of other movies in the series, this is one of the best overall.
