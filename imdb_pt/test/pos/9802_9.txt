My opinion on the ending. Bobby died at the hands of his stepfather. Mike had tried, as he could, to drive Bobby out. Only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly. Bobby died .... Mike as a child survived creating an alternate ending in his mind ... about how Bobby left .... Mike made a plane that flew Bobby out. Children who are sexually abused and violently often create other worlds to survive. <br /> <br /> It was also great to see my old residential area. We called it San Jose Boulevard and I lived very close to where these houses were filmed. It was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses ... not studios ... It was my kitchen, bedroom and living room. And those hills ... we used to walk in them like children ... looking at our little valley ... seeing glimpses of the bay. It was a real nostalgic trip for me.
