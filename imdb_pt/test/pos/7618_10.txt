This is a truly hilarious movie that I've seen many times. Drew Barrymore is brilliant as Josie Geller, as well as David Arquette as his brother. You shrink from shame at the thought that she returned to high school, since the film is a reminder of what high school was like! His clothes are crazy and strange, and brings back memories of those who dressed a little differently! The beautiful Michael Vartan was lovely as a teacher (I wish there were teachers like that when I was in high school!) And Josie's boss is fantastic. This is a movie that you can watch again and again with a fabulous soundtrack! One for all those in school in the 90's to watch!
