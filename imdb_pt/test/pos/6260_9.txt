'Shadow Magic' recaptures the joy and astonishment of the early audiences of the film. It also shows the power of cinema in its ability to approach the world, overcome cultural barriers and preserve itself for future generations. Certainly, who truly loves the art of cinema will appreciate this film. It's a great first effort by writer / director Ann Hu, who we hope will have plenty of movies to follow.
