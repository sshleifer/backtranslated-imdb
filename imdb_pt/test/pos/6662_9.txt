Cold Mountain by Anthony Minghela (writer / director), is a carefully constructed, sensitive and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederation during the civil war, which deals with the politics of war in a very subtle and realistic way. While it accurately portrays the brutality and inhumanity of this war, it also does something that many films related to this period do not deal so effectively - Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the inside out and portrays the changes among non-slaves. people forged by war. And almost exclusively, Cold Mountain does not over-generalize Southern, Northerners or anyone else. <br /> <br /> The movie navigates through the genres when necessary - never presenting a moment of boredom. It is a novel, a war story, an action adventure and historical fiction, all very well intertwined. <br /> <br /> The story centers on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). wounded with one another for very simple reasons. As this young novel begins to sprout, Inman joins the Confederate army, taking with him a book Ada gave him and a photograph of her. Ada's character is one of the brightest aspects of the film, which is important because audiences experience this movie from a third-person perspective, but the story is clearly her from the beginning to the end. Ada is a clever southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. She starts the movie as a daddy girl with skill in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by employees most of their lives should learn. In other words, as she admits to Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she is a useless teacher. <br /> <br /> Ada's father passes, and she is left alone to administer her modest state. Without such experience, she struggles and survives by keeping Inman's memory close to her heart. Ruby comes on the scene as a tough young woman who was raised by a drunken and careless father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities Ada does not have, and as they become inseparable business partners, they grow up to love each other as best friends. Inman's experience is radically different, but it is something of a mirror image. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends dead for causes in which they do not really believe, and decides to defect. No one he meets comes to his aid when he begins the thousand-mile walk back to Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of those he meets die. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place during Inman's long walk, following both protagonists live, learn, grow and change. A continual act of desire for despair preserves his intense passionate love. For Inman, it is his only source of hope in a world of pure despair. For Ada, it's basically the same thing, but it's also a symbol and remnant of the old South - a world that is passing fast. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful pictures of Appalachian landscapes that give the film a strong sense of history. The script and the editing are also extremely strong - emphasizing the wide class and education differences reflected in the southern, lower middle class dialects. With the cast of this film, nothing less than perfection should be expected. And the cast, for the most part, rises to the occasion. My only criticism, however, is the accents adopted by the characters of Kidman and Law. An Australian and a British probably should not accurately reproduce the South American speech, but there are some occasions when these two exceptionally talented actors make mistakes distracting vocals. I admit my hypersensitivity to this and I can say with some confidence that this will not bother most people. Zellweger's performance is excellent and she creates a character I will remember in my senescence. Very highly recommended.
