"Rouge" is part of a trilogy, but is very much on its own. It is not a sequel of any kind. The ending, which I do not disclose, links the three films together, but not seeing the other two does not make it very confusing. <br /> <br /> This film surprises me because it's so simple, so subtle and simple, but it's just as effective, emotionally and intellectually as any big-budget show or star melodrama. Kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and fate. Both themes are loosely intertwined in history. The film is much more a puzzle, but the message is quite straightforward: everything happens for a reason. Love is in all our destinies, since we open ourselves to it. The title "Red" refers to the French flag, where red represents "fraternity" or fraternity. Color dominates the visuals of the film. I tend to think of it as representing love or passion, or the blood of life. It's great when a movie allows you the freedom to do this;)
