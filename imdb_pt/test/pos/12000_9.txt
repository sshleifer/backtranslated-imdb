I'm sorry to repeat myself again and again, but here's another great episode of Columbus. I think that's why I'm such a fan - most episodes are really great! The best episodes always have a prominent feature of some sort, and in this case the killer and his accomplice are possibly Columbo's youngest villains. <br /> <br /> After watching many episodes in which Columbo and his adversary act as close friends, it is good to see an episode in which moods wear out and bad feelings rise to the surface. This just gives the episode a bit more drama and bite. Columbus is quickly in the fact that the two students who claim to be helping him are not secretly laughing at him and feeding false leads. He happily plays along, deliberately turning the fumble in front of them to make them underestimate him! But of course he knows instantly when they're talking nonsense. <br /> <br /> The murder itself is another tricky one, in the shape of Bye Bye Sky High's IQ episode, with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that manages to kill the intended target while providing the assassins with an apparently watertight alibi . In the intervening years, between 1978 and 1990, the technology went from turntables and fireworks to remote control systems of cars and hidden cameras. Stephen Caffrey does a great performance as Justin Rowe, the obnoxious. pampered student. Gary Hershberger is discreet, but he's good as his "yes-man" friend, Cooper Redman. And it's good to see Robert Culp as Mr. Rowe, Justin's father. <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in every way.
