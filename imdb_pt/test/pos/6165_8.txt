Compared to Battle of Britain, this is a real movie, with real characters and a real plot. Battle of Britain is basically a documentary with the occasional Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine, but the real protagonists are the Spits, the Hurricanes, etc. Here, on the other hand, you have two well-crafted characters (actually three) and a real plot. I strongly recommend it to anyone, even for those who do not like war movies. It's well filmed, and I wonder what the director would do if he had the big capitals behind him. And I do not think it's too sentimental. It's just that in fighters you have real people with real feelings and a real life - as real as any fictional life in any great movie.
