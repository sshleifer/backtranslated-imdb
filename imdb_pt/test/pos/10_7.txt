If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the movie, I would have said it was great! However, I left the theater feeling unsatisfied. After thinking a little about it, I believe the problem was the rhythm of the end. I feel like most of the movie moved slowly, and then the end developed very fast. So, I would say the ending left me disappointed. <br /> <br /> I thought the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher portrayed their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act! In addition, the different relationships between the characters seemed very real. Also, I thought the different plot lines were well developed. Overall, it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Good characters, great plot, poorly written / edited end. Still, go see !!!
