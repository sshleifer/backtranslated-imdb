Wow.this is a moving story! First I saw 'Rescue Dawn'. I did not like that. And now I have seen the person, Dieter Dengler, about whom this story is being told by Herzog.Very Impressing.Dieter is a driven human who has encountered the most opposing emotions in his life on this earth. What extraordinary life does that person have? led. His tale about the capture by Patet Lao / Vietcong and therefore his suffering is horrible, but what is more impressive is his incredible will to survive. How could he find the strength? In a frightening way, Dieter is telling us in fluent phrases about his terrible ordeal during his captivity ... he is a great storyteller and Herzog makes him the justice that this brave man deserves. <br /> <br /> In my opinion. 'Little Dieter needs to fly' says it all! , leaving nothing to the imagination, making 'Rescue dawn' a superfluous film. The horror does not become more real than in the words of Dieter Dengler himself. It can completely paint the image.
