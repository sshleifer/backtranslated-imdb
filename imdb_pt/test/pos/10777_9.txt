Oliver Stone hits the target with this film, aided mainly by the electrifying Bogosian screen and the brilliant scathing script. Each moment pops with a steadily increasing tension, culminating in a truly memorable movie experience. If ever there was an indication of a writer's and director's ability to fuse two highly volatile temperaments into a perfect union of creativity, then that's it! The result is a powerful achievement, made more timely now, perhaps because of the disturbing fascination of our celebrity culture, and its distorted interpretations of fame. <br /> <br /> A final accusation of the growing morbidity of our society and the self-nauseating hunger for the next great emotion. <br /> <br /> A movie is not easily forgotten. I recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of human nature.
