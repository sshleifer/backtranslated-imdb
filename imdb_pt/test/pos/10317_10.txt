Not wanting to repeat what everyone else has noticed, I'm just going to say this: Almost everyone says that they loved Curly better ... but I'm going to put the BRIDEGROOM against ANY other Stooges shorts . <br /> <br /> I think it's the most hilarious thing from start to finish, besides being the most re-watchable. The uncouth corner student ... "Cousin" by Christine McIntire Basil "routine, and of course, JP by Emil Sitka are highlights, but only around the impeccable time of the Stooges" and the great writing too! <br /> <br /> Nuff said.
