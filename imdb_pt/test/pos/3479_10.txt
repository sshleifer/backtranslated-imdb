This movie was amazing, it was extremely funny and moving. Damien O'Donnell and Jeffrey Caine have put together a great movie that will appeal to all ages. James McAvoy and Steven Robertson made this brilliant film. Their acting was great, there was that real and real feeling between them, that made you really believe they were the characters they were playing. Romola Garai is incredibly beautiful and brilliant in her role. The story of these two physically challenged people and their caregiver is well placed, and you really begin to grow to know and feel the characters as the film continues, it was especially distracting in the end. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a movie with a true sense of heart, alerting the most sensitive viewer to make sure you have the fabrics you will need. <br /> <br /> Again amazing movie !!
