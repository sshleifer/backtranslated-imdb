We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a haunted tale of loneliness and lost connection in which yearning for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing much about ourselves to the other. The three tracks (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamics between them is very surprising. <br /> <br /> After all the movies that devalue older women, it is wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful and sensual as well as seductive and powerful. We are conditioned to believe that when a younger woman enters the mix, the older woman becomes jealous of the younger woman, the man leaves the older woman for the younger woman, etc., etc. In this film, however, the emotional truth is considerably more complex. Highly recommended.
