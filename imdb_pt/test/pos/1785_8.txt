Well I'm afraid my review of this special does not address very different observations from others before me, but I literally just watched - during a PBS campaign - and frankly, I'm very excited to NOT say anything. To truly appreciate the puzzle that is Barbra Streisand, you have to look back before the movies. Before the Broadway phenomenon of the mid-60's. When television was still a young medium, there was a very prominent form of entertainment in the air that is just a reminder today: the musical variety. Some musical shows were weekly series, but others were special singles, usually showing the special talent of the individual performer. This is where we get the first unobstructed view of Streisand. She was already a guest artist on other variety shows, including Garry Moore, Ed Sullivan, and struck a major hit in a single appearance along with the woman who would pass her the extraordinary truncheon Judy Garland. In 1966, COLOR ME BARBRA presented Barbra Streisand in color (hence the title), but copied the format of his first special a year before almost literally. In three distinct acts, we have an abstract Streisand (in an art museum that works after hours and sometimes transforms into works of art), a comic Streisand working in an audience already worshiped in a studio circus (inhabited by many animals cuddly and furry) and best of all, a Streisand singing in the mini-concert format only - well, frankly, just doing it. <br /> <br /> I'm amazed that she still has the film debut of FUNNY GIRL still to come, as well as composer, director and political activist. She is only 24 years old, doing extraordinary things because, as she puts it in her own introduction on camera, "we did not know we could not, so we did." The sequence of the art museum is filmed in Philadelphia over a weekend, immediately after the museum was closed to the public on Saturday night, and apparently made with just ONE color camera. However, there are cuts, break-ins and tracking shots, resulting in a rather spectacular peak moment - the modern one with a slightly beatnik twist, "Gotta Move." After getting lost in modern abstracts, jazz club bongos begin, with Streisand emerging in a psychedelic dress and a brilliant make-up in the eyes, making the captivating staccato tune with almost androgynous sex appeal. It is not until Act 3, believe it or not, that the moment is equaled or improved by another achievement: following the concert, in a white dress and pearl earrings, Streisand recites the harpoon. "Anywhere I hang my hat is home". "tearing up the final notes and revealing one of those weather belts that makes you scream like a little girl, even though she's 44. And just a big old TV.
