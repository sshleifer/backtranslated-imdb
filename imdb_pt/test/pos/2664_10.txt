I spent many sleepless nights after seeing 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece), but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I look at the universe. That changed my thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer like me) by the level of imagination. <br /> <br /> The Space Odyssey is not something you can simply "go" and see. <br /> <br /> You have to be prepared for it or it can not be understood. <br /> <br /> Actually, I do not think it can be understood, at least not at once.It is a philosophical journey into the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of the genre and still 32 years technically impressive until the powerful musical soundtrack 'Also spracht Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss and 'Blue Danube' by Johann Strauss . <br /> <br /> Take the time you want, but eventually you will have to see this movie. <br /> <br /> If it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, surely you can do it for you too . Or maybe I'm just crazy ...
