This is one of those movies where you have to put aside some of its obvious flaws (result of date and place of production) and accentuate the positive. In many ways, this is a truly superb film. <br /> <br /> Let's pardon the parody in the one line summary, but the most serious fault for an English speaker like me was the horrible caption. The impression I saw had subtitles in 1982 from Soviet Film Export, which consistently used inverted grammar, presumably to give the impression of thirteenth-century discourse. The real impact of this nonsense is that it makes it difficult to track the subtitles, which means you spend less time looking at the images. Given that the cinematographic image is the great strength of this film, this is a real issue. Other IMDB-niks wrote a lot about the elements of Stalinist propaganda in this film (just in case the viewer does not notice for themselves). They also wrote a lot about the battle on the ice scene, which is great in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Love interest almost totally lacks subtlety and yet strangely ..... almost totally lacks charm as well. But it's good to shrink from time to time. <br /> <br /> I was familiar with Prokofiev's music for this movie long before seeing the movie. Images and music complement each other beautifully. And it's the images that will stay in your mind for a long time. Bergman clearly learned a lot from these images-the images of his medieval pieces (eg, The Seventh Seal, The Virgin of Spring) by building and refining Eisenstein's ideas. This film was made in 1938 in the USSR. In this context, it is a masterpiece, albeit imperfect. <br /> <br /> For the modern viewer, I suggest you go with the flow and enjoy the many surprises displayed.
