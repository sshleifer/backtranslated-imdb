1981, Just Before Dawn is one of the best wild horror tales out there. He is one of the best slashers of the 80's and easily drops movies like The Final Terror, Do not Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water. <br /> <br /> A group of young adults come and check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However, they are not alone in the wild. A heavy-killer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hating invaders. Director Lieberman, who gave us such good films as Squirm (1976) and Blue Sunshine (1977), does a great job with this clever thriller as well. The film is very atmospheric, with a sense of tension and a strong suspense. This movie makes even the open desert look frighteningly claustrophobic. The places in Oregon are beautiful and well captured by cunning cinematography. The score is a true original and impressive in contrast to the scenic visuals. <br /> <br /> Deborah Benson contributes to great leadership, her presence was captivating. Gregg Henry performs well as Benson's lover and Chris Lemon offers some occasional charisma. The supporting cast, especially veteran actor Kennedy, also performed very well. <br /> <br /> A true gem of the slasher genre, which does not need blood to thrill. Definitely worth looking for slasher fans and horror buffs too. Look! <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
