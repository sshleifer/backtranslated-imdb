I can not believe anyone gave this movie a rating of 1 !!! and it's only a 3. average ... What's not to love about this movie? It's original, it has many scary scenes that really made me jump out of the chair and it has great special effects. The story is new, there is some nudity and it is very exaggerated. The killer was scary in his own demented way and the ending is very unexpected. I must admit that I really love this movie, one of the best horror films in Spain. If you consider yourself a true horror fan, you need to go out and try to find that movie. You will be pleasantly surprised to do so.
