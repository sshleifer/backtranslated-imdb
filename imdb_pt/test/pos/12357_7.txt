I thought it would be more fantastic a tale. But the subject is quite realistic about the story about the Death carriage that I was expecting. In fact, there is much more of a social drama. As usual in "European author films". <br /> <br /> The actors are interesting, not exaggerating as in the ordinary silent film. The images are not so good as to get stuck in your mind as in Bergman's Smultronstället. <br /> <br /> It is true that the comparison between the two films is the main point here. Smultronstället begins with a vision of a death carriage in which Sjöström's character can see his own body. There are clocks without hands. He is bound to look at what he did wrong. There is a vision of your happy family in the country. Körkarlen Sjöström's wife did not betray him before her eyes, but she wants to run away with little children, because that would never improve with him. Eventually, Edit's confession is some kind of live trial. Well, I'd just like to add that Sjöström destroying the door with an ax because his wife locked it and plans to leave with the children reminded me of The Shining. That was a lot more of a fantasy tale with death out there.
