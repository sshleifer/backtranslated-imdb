There was nothing else on the TV yesterday afternoon, so I thought "okay, let's watch it". I did not know the plot and had no expectations, I was thinking in a few minutes or else I will channel the surf again. But then the story began to unfold and the characters played beautifully for the two boys. The story had unrealistic parts and scenes, but overall it was a very good movie. Very well worth watching.
