'The Cell' is a journey in the mind of a serial killer and I mean it literally. The movie is about the journey, about the world that shows during this journey, fate does not really matter. In my opinion, this journey through the mind gives images so beautiful that other things do not matter as long as they do not distract. In fact, the story is very good. <br /> <br /> We started with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not matter, but it does look a lot like virtual reality. She and other scientists, including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe this method can work. Catherine enters the boy's mind and talks to him there, in a world that is completely created by the boy. She hopes to let him do things that ultimately will work. <br /> <br /> The real story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) has just dumped the body of one of his victims. FBI agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) are in this case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears and, at the time, after a forensic search on Dumbledore's body, Carl can be traced and captured. Two problems occur. 1. Carl has just fallen into a coma; he's been sick for a long time. 2. Your house and the house with your last kidnapped victim are not in the same place. In a way, this part of the story is quite normal. <br /> <br /> Things are about to get interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine needs to get into Carl's mind. This is dangerous for several reasons. In short: Carl is unknown territory, schizophrenic and serial killer. If Catherine begins to believe that Carl's mind is the real world, then her mind can convince her body; she could die in Carl's mind. A tape of how the last victim was killed, a fate that this girl will have in about twenty hours, ensures that Catherine will try to take the place of Carl's mind. <br /> <br /> It is the journey through this disease. which makes this movie worth watching. Director Tarsem Singh, who made video clips before that, somehow goes back to these video clips. Each room in the imaginative world is another small clip that exists of beautiful and sometimes astonishing images. For me, the visual style looked completely new, just as "Three Kings" had a new visual style a year earlier. If something like this can make you like a movie, 'The Cell' will not disappoint you. But thriller and horror genre fans may like this movie anyway. The story itself, without the great fantasy world, is good enough for that. I think you have to be a bit open-minded, of course events are not (yet) possible in our real world. Still, a very fun movie with good ideas that looks great.
