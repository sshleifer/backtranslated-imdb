The wind carried one of the most popular books ever printed. It is by far the movie of all the movies. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett made people dream all over the world and turned the protagonists into cinematographic icons. One might ask, is it really necessary to make a sequel? And ... there are some big shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> Well, there was the book first. 'Scarlett' by Alexandra Ripley is, we must admit, well written and fully respecting the world created by Margaret Mitchell. It picks up exactly where we left our heroine previously and gently takes us from Mitchell's heritage to his own fantasy. In the book Scarlett, defeated after the death of Melanie and the exit of Rhett, travels to Charleston to live with its mother-in-law in the hope of recovering the love of Rhett. His typical manipulative behavior once again evokes many of Rhett's criticisms and distances them further ... up to a certain boat trip that will change everything. Scarlett now carries a secret. The series follows the book quite accurately until Scarlett's arrival in Ireland. From then on, the book and the series split slowly. The actual ending differs, but of course the two have Scarlett and Rhett together again. <br /> <br /> The production of the series was announced with a worldwide search for the upcoming Scarlett O'Hara. Many countries have made their own television shows with young actresses auditioning for the role. Eventually, about twelve girls were chosen to take part in the final screen tests and interviews in Atlanta, Georgia. Unfortunately, the producer did not find Scarlett among these actresses. Sorry for the girls, big publicity for the show (which has already been sold to many television stations around the world before it even started filming). Robert Halmi, the producer who bought the rights to "Scarlett", said he discovered the right actress while watching TV, called her and two days later signed the agreement. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer (who starred in 'Wowow' and 'Scandal', most recently the movie that Robert Halmi was watching that faithful night) is not Vivien Leigh, but she is certainly Scarlett! Her performance is not a copy of Leigh, she does the character herself. The main difference between GWTW and 'Scarlett' is that the main character evolves and grows as a person. This is the prerogative of the series, why copy something that was done before? Considering that there is a gap of nearly seventy years between the first and second storyline, it is natural that both authors emphasize different aspects of the characters. While Mitchell works around Scarlett, dealing with the aftermath of the civil war and fighting for Tara, Ripley lets Scarlett face her demons. For me, it's the most interesting aspect of the series, we know Scarlett in a different way, as she discovers that not everything can always happen the way she wants. I totally agree with Timothy Dalton's choice as Rhett Butler. He portrays it with charm and irony and is less a cardboard figure than the performance of Clark Gable. The rest of the cast was well chosen. Julie Harris is captivating as Rhett's mother, John Gielgud gives a very entertaining performance, since grandfather Robillard and Sean Bean are always at their best, playing a dirty character, their Lord Fenton is no exception. Poor choices, however, with Stephen Collins as Belle Watling's adaptation of Ashley and Ann-Margret, were a waste of money. Costumes, scenery and locations are elaborate and convincing. The newly built Tara set looked exactly the same and is a moving sequence in the series when the house first appears. <br /> <br /> There's a point in making a sequel ... Well, six hours of romance is for me. One to watch!
