"Witchery" is a decent Euro-Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is very funny in this movie and unfortunately he is one of the best actors. Linda Blair is absolutely terrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife ... she's hilariously bad! The plot of this movie is ridiculous too. There are some holes that you can not miss, but it's still fun everywhere. <br /> <br /> The blood in "Witchery" is in panic. I loved the part where the old bag is "sucked" into the trash and ends up in the chimney to bake! And the part in which the lady "is harnessed" by the Devil was very disturbing. I would say this is a must for the gorehounds. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a well-produced film, look elsewhere. But if you like the Italian sleaze of the old-school style and above the top of the blood, "Witchery" belongs to your shelf. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the low rating here! What did you expect, "The Exorcist?" 7 of 10 children.
