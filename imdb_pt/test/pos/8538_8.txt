Ed Mal is a Swedish film about a man named Ed (of course) and his collapse into total madness after editing a series of B horror films known as "The Loose Limbs" series. Ed gets so crazy he thinks he's seeing demons and monsters, but in reality they are people he knows and people close to him, like his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time 1998 and was puzzled by what I had seen. To this day, this movie I consider to be one of the darkest comedies out there. As the film is almost funny with its bloody scenes, there are still some scary moments. <br /> <br /> This is a cool movie, but do not expect anything wonderful. It's simply a fun movie that's good to show some of your friends for some laughs. 8/10 stars
