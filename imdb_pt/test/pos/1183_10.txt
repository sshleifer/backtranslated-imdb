For people like me who were born long after the 60s, we can only learn about the time through cultural artifacts, of which "Hair" is one of them. This is certainly a well done tour de force. One can get an idea of ​​how things were for hippie culture. Probably the most impressive scene - at least for me - is when the group hangs the party of the rich. As for the final scene of the film, it can be interpreted as the symbolic end of everything the 60s represented. <br /> <br /> But no matter how you interpret this film, it is important to understand that even though the 1960s may have ended, the movements that typify them still exist in small enclaves. It is a time that people will not soon forget. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is one that I definitely recommend. Milos Forman scored another great here, well between his two masterpieces "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Ragtime" (so why did he later crap like "Man on the Moon"?!). Starring John Savage, Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo.
