I had heard of the case, but had not really paid attention all the way to how Fuhrman wrote the book, Skakel being arrested, etc. However, this movie did an excellent job at detailing Martha, the Skakel brothers, the murder, the involvement of Mark Fuhrman and the results of his investigation. I especially enjoyed the flashback scenes with Martha talking about her last summer. The actress who interpreted her literally shone with life and made it even more poignant that the real Martha was probably so. This made Martha look like a real person and not a victim. I definitely recommend watching this.
