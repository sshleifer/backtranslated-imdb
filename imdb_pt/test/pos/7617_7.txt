Unfortunately, I can relate to this movie, like I'm 17, and I have not been kissed yet, so I really feel for Josie. It's been a while since I watched this movie, but to write this review I re-re-read it, and I remembered everything I loved. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is a great actress, and this role matched her very well. at the time. The chemistry between Sam and Josie was very good, and Michael Vartan was an excellent actor in that. <br /> <br /> I loved the plot as well - as I said up there, I could relate, and it is rare for you to find a movie that you can relate to completely. <br /> <br /> All finished - I loved it. 7/10
