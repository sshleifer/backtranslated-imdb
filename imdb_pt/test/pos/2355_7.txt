I saw this movie for the first time in 1953 with my older brother. It was one of Demension's top 3 films released at the time. We saw it at least thirteen times and we were proud of it. Scott does a typical western shooting job while surrounded by Indian arrows instead of surrounding the sound. Oh, for those polaroid lenses again.
