The movie was fantastic. If you are a fan of captivating videos of Bams, idiot or your show Viva la Bam, you can not miss it. I have some friends who are not fans who liked it and others who thought it was not so good. Those who did not like him were mostly female friends, they really did not like a bit of gross humor, which personally I think made the movie so funny. I'm sure the whole movie was filmed in Bams' hometown, which includes many of his regularly visited locations. The cast is composed of all his friends and cky companions, and also includes some renowned skaters as well. The soundtrack is phenomenal with HIM music. In my opinion, Haggard has it all. A great plot, characters you will never see anywhere else. Lots of good humor music and a cast that was dedicated to the project.
