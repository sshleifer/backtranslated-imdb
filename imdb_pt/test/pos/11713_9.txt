In short, if you want to watch better movies of Burt Reynolds than this should be included. If you do not like Burt, you may still like this. If you love Burt this can become one of your favorite movies of all time! Being from Atlanta is successful, but it's also good to see a cop / action / drama happening somewhere other than NY City, Chicago, Miami or LA. The film is funny on points with good plot and good performances from a great support cast (each character is real and the thugs are not so unilateral they are very well thought out) An unusual novel in the second half and has some good old fashion shootings If Clint Eastwood made his best impression of a Burt Reynolds movie with "Every Which Way But Loose" and "Any Which Way You Can" "so Burt responded with his best Clint-type film with that, and it works great!
