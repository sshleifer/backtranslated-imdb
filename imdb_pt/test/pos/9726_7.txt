I had no idea what I was going to experience seeing this old 1940 film. However, I always enjoy seeing Laraine Day, (Katie Lattimer) who plays the role of a younger sister of Jean Muir, (Helen Lattimer) mother, Billie Burke, (Ms. Julia Lattimer). I thought I was going to get bored with the story of two sisters and a mother who is overly protective of her daughters until they meet Robert Cummings, (Ridley Crane) who has a reputation for being a millionaire playboy who has lots of girls and is a drinker heavy partying all the time. One night, Helen Lattimer goes on a date with Ridley and he gets bombed out and simply can not drive his car. It is at this point in the movie that this becomes a drama and changes the full direction of this movie, which will definitely hold your attention until the end of the movie.
