Having grown up in New Jersey and having spent many days and nights on the streets of New York in the 1970s, watching a movie like "The Seven-Ups", or its related spirit, "The French Connection", always evokes memories of a time and a place that for some might have been NYC's darkest hour, but for me, in my early twenties, it was always a fun adventure after another. I really miss those times. As one reviewer noted, "This film captures very well the cold, trivial feel of the New York winter season, exposing the underworld of the infamous crime underworld and policing the region with great finesse. A great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture ". A punctual characterization of the film and the city. The stellar attributes of this film - the plot, the cast, the characters and, of course, the car chase - are extensively described in many of the reviews here, so I will not go into it except to say that one of my favorite moments happens during car chase, when the camera focuses Richard Lynch on a shotgun for the maniacal Bill Hickman. The look of horror on Richard Lynch's face, along with defensive gestures, are so out of character for an actor far better known as a source of terror than an object of him, which is actually comedic to watch. I get a laugh every time.
