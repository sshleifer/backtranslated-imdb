In the spirit of the Great Space Coaster, but a few years before. <br /> <br /> Hot Fudge was one of the psychedelic children's shows I grew up in. Seymour was a big green puppet, with a growing smile of huge teeth that almost cracked his head, I remember him wearing a variety of Elton John-type glasses. He played the piano, and there was a Jesus staring at him in a white tuxedo, sitting next to him. They would have a moral discussion and then make a song about it. <br /> <br /> I do not remember much of anything beyond the opening theme, Seymour and Hippie. <br /> <br /> No one else I know remembers everything. I grew up in Jersey, so if it was produced in Detroit as a previous post said, it was not just local. Seymour reminded me a lot of Sherlock the Squirrel of the Magic Garden (another show of psychedelic children, if there was one.) People always talk about the effects of LSD on music and movies from the 70s, but it seems like children's writers too received a dose.
