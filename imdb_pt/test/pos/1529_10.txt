Rarely does a movie capture such intense drama and emotion. What makes this movie so unsettling is that the drama seems so real, it's almost hard to remember that it's just a movie. This is by far the performance of Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman in their careers. The film almost looks like a theatrical production the way it is staged and illuminated. The only bad thing about this movie is that it is very difficult to get a copy of it. I still have to see this different from Laserdisc. This truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and a special DVD editing treatment. It really is that good.
