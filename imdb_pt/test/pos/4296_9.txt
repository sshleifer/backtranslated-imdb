Well, what's wrong with the title "Separate Lies" (accused elsewhere of not being "exciting"). He's smart, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there is a song by Phil Collins and a James Belushi movie called "Separate Lives," which are alluded to here.) But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. OK, it's not a hilarious title "in your face", but it's not a hilarious movie. Please give British movies like this a chance. They try to make people think about important things like here: how far do you go to protect your life (even if it's a little rotten) against an unexpected disaster. Maybe you tell lies. Maybe you ignore the lies of your loved ones. This can wear off many people. <br /> <br /> American films on this subject are plentiful but often go much further, involving the use of firearms, which are not part of everyday life here in Europe. <br /> <br /> Maybe we're not that "exciting" around here, but we do not expect movie titles like slogans for movies that are not aimed at a large audience.
