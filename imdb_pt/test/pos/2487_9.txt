Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins. The premise is that the nation's dissidents (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are being captured and tried by a court and then can choose to prison or run the Punishment Park course. It's a tiresome 52-mile journey through the desert to an American flag, with the police, the National Guard and several other authority figures in pursuit. The idea is that if you get to the flag, you are free. The court consists of a bunch of conservative types, all condemning any behavior other than theirs, and there is no result other than a jail sentence or the "Punishment Park" option for anyone on trial. There are many things that are still true today, which is quite disturbing in itself. The people who run the course get water halfway, which is not true, and the pursuing officers are mostly a sadistic group that is just looking for a little practice of shooting. This is not a very graphic movie, but it is more shocking in its ideas and themes than anything else. The scary thing is that this can happen. Not a very optimistic film, but definitely worth seeing. Warning: this can make you angry. 9 out of 10.
