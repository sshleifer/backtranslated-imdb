the Mario series is back and, in my opinion, better than ever. Galaxy is the most creative marius of all; even more than super mario 64. the controls are great; some of the best for the wii. Beautiful graphic design too. the levels are very large and the good old bosses are back. there are tons to explore in this game; definitely a high level of replay value. I only have 2 complaints: 1: the story is a bit similar to Mario 64. and 2: the difficulty is not too high; although it requires some patience. Mario Fans: The game you're waiting for. Casual gamers: This game is worth more than the purchase. 9.8 out of 10.
