If you're looking for a movie where a runaway nymphomaniac is chained to a radiator by an extremely religious man from the south, look no further than Paramount Vantage's latest release, 'Black Snake Moan'. Not exactly looking for what I just described? Well then you better get used to your own local theater and still see how the character of Samuel L. Jackson Lazarus would say. As long as you have an open mind and do not take everything seriously, there is no reason not to leave the theater happy to have seen it. <br /> <br /> In the third installment of director Craig Brewer, we are taken to the deep south where, as the movie's slogan says, everything is warmer. While there we are introduced to the bluesman Godfearing, Lazarus as previously said played by Jackson, and almost always semi naked Rae; a role boldly assumed by Christina Ricci. In the film, this unlikely couple crosses paths enough that their characters learn a lesson from one another. Both lessons ultimately convey the message to us, the public that, no matter what, we are all human. No one is perfect and if everyone realized this, then we would be much better. The question of whether this will be understood, or being accepted by everyone who sees the film is another story. <br /> <br /> One thing that is not in debate is how great Jackson and Ricci are here. You would think that with the role of a woman crazy about sex, overdoing would be a given, but no, not here. Ricci breaks and demonstrates the true talent with a raw performance that is also the best so far. So we have Jackson that disappears completely and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he is. Unfortunately, the third star of the movie, Justin Timberlake, who plays Rae's military boyfriend, is not that good. At first, it fails miserably when it seems to be trying too hard. Later, it increases slightly, it is still far from the level it reached in 'Alpha Dog' in January. <br /> <br /> The other thing that Black Snake Moan boasts is a splendid soundtrack. Containing tracks from The Black Keys, John Doe, score pieces by Scott Bomar and of course four, count them, four tracks from Jackson himself. It is actually one of their songs, the main performance of the film, 'Stackolee', which is the fuel for the fire of this great collection. Only worth the ticket price. Other notable musical attractions on the soundtrack include Bomar's "The Chain," "When the Lights Go Out" by the Black Keys, and the title track which is also among the most memorable scenes in the film in which Lazarus sings Rae on a stormy night Craig Brewer's efforts can not go without mentioning though. His last film 'Hustle & Flow', which eventually surpassed the low expectations and gained critical acclaim, put it on the map. What he did with 'Black Snake Moan' will set him apart from other newcomers in the industry. He not only directed "Moan" but also wrote his screenplay. The end result is an amazing and clever story. As you watch, you feel you know exactly where you are going despite your brave composure. Just as you think you foresaw the next step, Brewer changes gears and takes a totally different path. There are however some spots in the script. The background characters are monotonous and boring, while the ending is a little disappointing. It made me anxious for something more exciting. After so many highs I think the final scenes were a little weak compared to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I imagine most people who see 'Black Snake Moan' will not like this. In fact, they will not be able to stop themselves from thinking how improbable the situations are. The depressing part about this is that there are many other films with equally improbable, yet more scandalous, scenes that are widely well received. It is the issues of race, religious motives and sexuality that the film displays that will have more effect on opinion than anything else. The idea of ​​a black man chaining a white woman in your house is enough to make most people think of seeing him. Simply put, it is not for everyone. As I said, to fully enjoy you have to go with an open mind or else you are just wasting your money. For those of you who can do this, I strongly recommend it.
