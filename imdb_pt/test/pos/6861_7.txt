An image of horror that ends up parodying, but still in its game, may scare some who are nervous or easily disgusted when they see what is under their skin. I laughed it away. It was easy to decipher the real killer and his acting did not help. It only made Potente look even better. Anatomie is not a horror image for foreigners of the genre, but the restraints should have some unintentional laughter and an interesting spike in German horror movies. 6/10
