Years ago, I did not love and respect Jimmy Cagney's movies almost as much as now. I noticed that many of Cagney's films made with Warner Brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and their acting style was far from subtle. However, the more I watched these movies, the more I found myself addicted despite these aspects. In fact, I kind of like it and I wait for them! Fans of old Hollywood movies probably understand what I'm saying - teens and other young whippersnappers do not understand! Well, when it comes to entertainment, THE HELL MAYOR does not give up from beginning to end. Although the idea of ​​an obscure character like Cagney taking charge of a retirement school is ridiculous, and although all the changes he made also seemed improbable, everything worked and provided some solid entertainment. The gang of tough bandits were pre-Dead End Kids and instead of the likes of Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and Billy Hallop, similar roles are played here by Frankie Darrow and Farina. Yes, I said "Farina." This black actor was already famous for his roles in the comedies of Our Gang and was, believe it or not, one of Hollywood's highest paid children's actors. All he needed to give up in return was to be called an insipid name and act like a stereotypical good "black." Here he really was very good and the usual black stereotypes are a little more moderate than usual. However, some will cringe at the very funny, but terribly offensive courtroom scene involving Farina and her father, Fred 'Snowflake' Toones. With horrible names like "Farina" and "Snowflake," do not say I did not warn you. <br /> <br /> In addition to this little complaint and a plot that is hard to believe, the film is exceptional and fun. Kids do a great job, just like Cagney and Dudley Digges in a truly despicable but thrilling role as the director of evil. Also, as an added bonus, you get to see perennial actor Allen Jenkins in his first studio role.
