What can you say about a small movie full of side actors and no "stars", with absolutely no bad performance, or a poorly delivered line of dialogue, and with the cold violence being balanced by the warm heart of a hand? the protagonists of the story? <br /> <br /> It is a jewel, a diamond, a valuable little gem of a Western that evokes the spirit and legend of the American West. A Western not solved by great heroes like Hickock or Cody or Masterson or Earp, but by the spread of everyday man and woman, farmers and ranchers, merchants and miners and loggers, prostitutes and boatmen, and artists of the day, some resembling riches, some for peace and quiet, others for religious freedom. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps a very spiritual story, though it does not promote any particular religion, for even the non-Mormon cowboys portrayed by Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. act kindly and noblely about all in the history regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs, and goes out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train comes on the strung medicine show people. And in true biblical style, like David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines, they are the guardian angels sent to the convoy of wagons that will eventually have to confront the clan of Clegg incarnated by evil, comparing them with the serpent in the Garden of Eden, and regretting what they have to do next. It's a sweet folk tale from the West that hits every target John Ford craves. <br /> <br /> Nowadays I have a Santa Claus from the west, whose red clothes are covered with a denim jacket, whose red sock is replaced. by a brown Stetson, carrying a tote bag of gifts and a roll of rope. For my Santa Claus I added a Winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a Colt revolver to thrust into his waist. When people in the office ask why my Santa has to carry guns, I simply reply, "Snakes!" After all, is not the spirit of the holiday season when everyone should get what they deserve? <br /> <br /> Fifty-five years later, especially after 911, the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and the story of this film are still as relevant today as they were then.
