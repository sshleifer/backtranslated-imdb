Father Hood is a fun tale of a reluctant father who is definitely a HOOD! Patrick Swayze plays Jack Charles, who is a hood always looking for a great "score" that will put him on the easy street. His wife died while he was in prison and his two children were placed in an orphanage. When he "left", did he think they were probably better at an orphanage? Besides, he still had to score his fortune. His daughter Kathleen Charles (played wonderfully by Sabrina Lloyd) leaves a welfare institution that is abusing children and appropriating money that should be spent on children. She pursues her father; tells him about how bad the place was and that his brother, Eddie Charles (played by Brian Bonsall), "just a little boy of 7 years" was being transferred to the institution she had just left and convinces her father to kidnap him. The three begin an adventure around the country, while Jack keeps telling himself that he needs to get rid of the kids! Patrick Swayze is really good at this comedy, playing a "hood" (probably a little underrated for this criminal character) that is similar to Johnny Castle's Dirty Dancing character except that Jack is appropriately funny in this comedy and more optimistic than Johnny Castle. Swayze is funny and rally does very well comedy! Halle Berry plays Kathleen Mercer, who is a reporter trying to understand the truth about the welfare system that becomes Sawyer's ally. Diane Ladd plays Rita the mother of Jack Charles's con-artist.
