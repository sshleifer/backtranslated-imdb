I quote below the words of my favorite writer, Paulo Coelho, as the commentary for this film. <br /> <br /> "When you really want something, the whole universe conspires to help you reach it." <br /> <br /> It's so easy to forget who we really are and what we want to do in life. Because there are always lots of comments and advice surrounding us to ensure safety. I had almost forgotten what passion is like. Although the adventure will get me out of the safety zone, I truly believe that fear is just the price I need to pay for the next new journey of life. <br /> <br /> Thank you for inspiring me with this beautiful story. It is the blessing to me to realize what unconditional love is. This is the most precious love of the light of the soul.
