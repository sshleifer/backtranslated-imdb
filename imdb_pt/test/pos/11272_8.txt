Begotten is one of the most original films I've ever seen. For me, it is more a study of sound, light and darkness, and movement than a real story. The kind of thing you see as a video instillation in the modern art museum than a movie enjoyed at the local theater. I will not try to interpret Mother Nature's images, the beasts in layers, the twisted and tortured body of her "son." Some things just challenge interpretation.
