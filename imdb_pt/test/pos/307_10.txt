Spoilers This review has been edited because of the word limit. The horror. The horror. ' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001) <br /> <br /> The sentence that is as famous as "Here is looking at you, boy" or "Are you talking to me?" or 'May the Force be with you', or 'I will come back', means a little more than a few phrases of effect. When it is spoken, it remains in the air with an importance and meaning that do not go unnoticed. What can fool some viewers is that they will never find an answer to the horror unless they watch the movie again and try to pay close attention to each picture. <br /> <br /> What exactly does this line do? of dialogue means? The horror of which he speaks is the reality of war. The reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn against their innate instincts and kill their fellow men with no sign of guilt. When Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) stands before the dying colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the movie, "The Horror, The Horror." is the perception of Willard's corruption. He mercilessly killed a cold-blooded man as part of his mission. This is not a typical Hollywood ending. In most cases, a character gains something, be it emotionally, physically, mentally or all three. But Willard wins and loses. He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals. And this is a shocking ending. <br /> <br /> `Apocalypse Now 'is Francis Ford Coppola's tribute to the artistic side of cinema. This movie is totally different from "The Godfather". It is hallucinogenic, visually dazzling and an ode to the guilty side of human nature. At first it seems realistic, and then it becomes strange, and then symbolic, and, in the end, original in its own unique perspective on the spiritual side of war. It is not so much a movie about the Vietnam War as it is about a movie about the war inside us. At first, it seems to be another war movie. Captain Willard (Sheen) is assigned by an Army lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to assassinate a renegade American colonel named Kurtz (Brando), who is hidden somewhere in Vietnam with a band of troops who more or less act as slaves. Willard carries out his mission "with extreme prejudice," heading for a boat along with four soldiers, including the captain of the boat, the boss (Albert Hall), the chef (Frederic Forest) and a young 'Larry' Fishburne (who later came to appear as Morpheus in 'The Matrix'). <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse Now" is, in many ways, a modern update to Homer's Odyssey. While our main character, Willard, continues his journey, he encounters a number of original and strange characters, including Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange surfing fetish, and a drugged photographer (Dennis Hopper). whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to the much smaller Jeremy Davies in "The Million Dollar Hotel," one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Davies was unable to make any connection with an audience; Hopper does. He is like the poetic vibration between Willard and Kurtz; he is like an interpreter coming and going and speaking in foreign languages. In this case, he is translating Kurtz to Willard, though I'm not so sure Kurtz needs a Willard translation. <br /> <br /> Many movies are fortunate to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. "Apocalypse Now" has many. Kilgore descending into a Vietnam village playing Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" remains one of the most remembered scenes in film history. There is sharpness to it, a brutality to it, an ironic tone to it, and also a sense of joke. When Kilgore kneels on that beach and says, "I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like victory," we all smile. <br /> <br /> I will not lie to you: 'Apocalypse Now' is a strange movie. Not exactly the easiest thing to look at. The end may frustrate some viewers if they do not understand Marlon Brando's meaningful speeches. But all that matters is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche. Horror is the achievement of war and its effects, not war itself. Kurtz says, 'You have the right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me. Brando's character, Kurtz, is left to the audience to judge. To many naive spectators, he may seem like a crazy nutcase whose power has come to his head. But that's not what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to convey. In fighting in Vietnam, Kurtz realized how good he was and how many others had him. As he walks through devastated villages, he realizes that we are naive, living our lives in the paradise of fools. We are totally naive to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they get it right. Seeing how unlucky some Vietnamese are, Kurtz realizes just how easily he could be hit by something. How easily he could end up like the people around him. And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door. Many people think horror is one thing. Are two. For Kurtz, horror is the reality of how naive he was and the reality of the impact of war on men. And after Willard kills Kurtz and hears Kurtz's last words, he realizes that too. He notices the effects of war. Seeing so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man. And what it did to him. The horror. 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
