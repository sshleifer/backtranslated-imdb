I remember this movie getting a lot of criticism from reviewers when it was new. Letterman and Leno himself had objections. Letterman called (paraphrasing) the biggest waste of film he ever saw, and Leno opposed the simple-minded portrait of himself. But Letterman had John Michael Higgins as guest on his show, so it seems he did not take anything too personal. A re-release on DVD, with opinions and people like that, might be interesting, although I suspect the days when late-night conversations captivated the nation have disappeared and not returned soon. <br /> <br /> I preferred Letterman. representation for Leno, but could never buy for anyone. They never climbed above the caricature, and I never accepted them simply as actors. For comparison: Paul Sorvino as Kissinger in Oliver Stone's "Nixon" comes to mind as an imitation that may have sounded ridiculous in the first moments, but which seemed at least plausible after the first moments of amusement dissipated. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the show for me was Treat Williams as Michael Ovitz. Williams' speech to Letterman was not as good as it was, but it was reminiscent of Alec Baldwin's entry (and quick exit) as Blake in Glengerry Glen Ross. <br /> They could have done more with the role of Johnny in all of this. I know he was not involved in the events portrayed in this film, and most audiences will be familiar with his reputation, such that Johnny Carson does not need presentations. But more context about why Dave, Jay and all comedians revere Johnny would have given this movie the missing substance in being a gossip movie. <br /> <br /> I think I should read the book ... <br /> <br /> Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson, unfortunately, did not pass Rich Rich imitating Johnny Carson. <br /> <br /> I tell you, after watching this movie, then watching the Letterman or Leno show, All I want to do is open my Johnny Carson DVDs and see the real thing.
