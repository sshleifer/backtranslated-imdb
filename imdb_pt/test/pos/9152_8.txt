Loved Ladino is a wonderful piece of the period. It portrays Paris of the 145th century in Hollywood style, but offers a darker side to the existence of what would be experienced by the poor. And the snow. It is constantly running, increasing the gravity of the scenario - brilliant! The scenario is reinforced by the strange cast of characters, including beggars, cripples and dwarfs. <br /> <br /> A brilliant performance is transformed by John Barrymore, surpassed only by the magnificent Conrad Veidt, who portrays a degenerate, dissolute. Louis XI to perfection. And yes, Veidt chooses his nose on purpose, pushing his portrait to wonderfully ironic boundaries.
