When someone watches romantic comedies, he knows what to expect; We have seen enough of them for many, many years to know how they will. There is a formula, which almost always generates movies that become popular among the public of the genre ... not always in relation to their actual quality. How to play with this and create something more interesting? This movie has a suggestion ... and works relatively well. Instead of simply following a clue, we follow him deftly helping unlucky men, those who do not have the attractive facade that would allow them to reveal the good invisible qualities they possess for the women they are in love with. The plot follows Smith as he works on his self-proclaimed most difficult case; Kevin James Alongside his help from James, we also follow Mendes, who is fed up with men who lie to get what they want (a particular scene that inspires great respect for Smith's character is that he finds one of these idiots and puts him in your place). After seeing Smith helping the disaster that is James, we see him with Mendes ... and despite his talent for helping others, he messes up ... ill ... with her. Make a wonderful point about love and how to fall in love affects us. For a romantic comedy, this mostly avoids such traps (sometimes almost on the border of feeling like a parody of the genre), although the latter scenes have the sweetness and the emotions of this type of film. Whether or not they follow the formula will not be revealed in this review. The pace is very good, never slows down and rarely moves very fast. The acting is great, as far as practically everyone goes. The characters are well-developed and come out as real people. Humor does not always work ... there are occasional jokes that are fortunately performed and one or two jokes that seem forced. However, for the most part, the movie was funny. I recommend this to anyone who loves romantic comedies and who is or fell in love. Those who do not believe in love will have difficulty with the last scenes. 7/10
