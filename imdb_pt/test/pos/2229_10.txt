Although often regarded as Peter Sellers' worst film, it is in fact an excellent outlet for corporate medical corruption and abuse of power. Often misunderstood, the film is in fact a departure from the kind of film by which Sellers was best known; satirical farce. This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (from Happy Days and Karate Kid movies), but was marked by its irreverence, irreverence and total mad demolition of the medical industry of the time. He was ahead of his time (1972) in taking the scandalous path that the Monty Python team would take to the movies some time later. As such, it was unacceptable to the traditional fan of Peter Sellers, who felt that the sharpest barbs in this mood were something they were not accustomed to. Peter Sellers's films are currently being sought out by fans, but this effort, Where Does It Hurt ?, has become almost impossible to find.
