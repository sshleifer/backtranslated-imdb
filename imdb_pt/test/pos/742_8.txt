I'm not sure what intrigues me about this movie. It is grainy, poorly written, bleached, often ridiculous, and at many points, mind numbing (the person I was watching with fell asleep twice). And there's still something in this movie that fascinates me, though I'm not sure what; maybe the character of Sam, a huge former patient who was lobotimized by the former chief physician and who is perpetually sucking a pop of ice), or the chief physician wonderfully (I forgot her name). <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch and form your own opinion; has one of the biggest finals I've ever seen in the movies.
