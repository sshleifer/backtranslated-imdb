I read some grunts about the court scenes. These people betray their ignorance. This production was simply amazing to recreate every aspect of the period in which the story occurred. Cut modes are something few people outside the courtroom have ever seen. Although the acting may seem highly stylized, it is, in fact, the closest replication possible to the behavior of individuals in their specific stations, as the director could create. The facial expressions of the actor are a marvel, particularly the dubious Marquis Changxin and the king's mother. There are, of course, reflections of both the Greek and Shakespearean tragedies in the relationship between the king, his parents and his mother. love. The juxtaposition of the king transforming from good to bad and the evil killer into good provides much food for thought about the evolution of the nature of an individual. This film would provide much to ponder in a college degree on the humanities. <br /> <br /> At the same time, he almost runs, even in the slower scenes heading toward an inexorable outcome. It is suspected of the involvement of large portions of the troop movements, which were quite impressive. This makes the Lord of the Rings fight the pale scenes by comparison. Few directors have the ability to literally put thousands of humans on the battlefield for art alone. I remember a scene in which at least 30,000 soldiers can be seen moving across a vast plain. The logistics for such a scene would have been impressive. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but simply, I can not recommend this movie highly enough.
