I just saw the Toronto International Film Festival. Neal Slavin's impressive cast includes William Macy (seen in The Contender on TIFF last year), Meat Loaf (AKA Meat Loaf Aday, AKA Michael Lee Aday), David Paymer and Laura Dern (also starring Novocaine, also this year ). Based on Arthur Miller's novel of the same name, Focus follows Christian but Jewish-looking Lawrence Newman (Macy) as he fights between hatred and anti-Semitism in his neighborhood. Between the owner of the Jewish warehouse on the street (Paymer) and the anti-Semitic neighbor who takes his card (Meat Loaf), Newman faces difficulties in dealing with internal conflicts and conflicts around him. Guilty for knowing what is right, but doing nothing that struggles with wanting to mingle and keep the peace with neighbors. Things get more complex when he meets and marries Gertrude (Dern), who everyone thinks is Jewish. Gertrude teaches her husband a few things about judging books by covers. Will Newman will regret the Jewish man in the end or will he run away? Go see it to find out. <br /> <br /> The acting was fabulous. The writing was incredible. The cinematography was excellent. The sound was well done. Technically incredible, the movie was disturbing. Refrigeration. Emotionally intense. I found myself bringing my knees to the fetal position a few times. I have a great admiration for all who worked on it. I have not seen such a good movie in a long time. That touched me. <br /> <br /> Wow.
