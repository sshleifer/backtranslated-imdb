Whenever Hayao Miyazaki does the "tri-fect" (writes, directs and animates a film), he makes a classic movie for ages. He did it again with Gake no ue no Ponyo. <br /> <br /> The story is about a fish girl who is kept on a very tight leash along with her younger sisters by her father, a bitter ex-human wizard. called Fujimoto. The fish escapes from her father and mounts a jellyfish to the beach where she is caught in a dredging operation and finds herself trapped in a bottle. This underwater sequence must be one of the most elaborately elaborate animated scenes ever made and is a reason to seek the theatrical version. Miyazaki, who is not afraid to have a busy scene, has overcome. There were literally hundreds of individually drawn sea creatures of every imaginable size, all moving at the same time. <br /> <br /> When the fish escapes from the dredging operation while it is still stuck in the bottle, a five-year-old boy named Sousuke finds her in the water and is able to break the bottle, saving her. Because she is the result of her father's magic, she is capable of fights - and her father actively tries to get her back. The boy names the fish Ponyo. Only when Sousuke learns that Ponyo can speak, her father successfully retrieves her in captivity. <br /> <br /> After a war of wills with his father, Ponyo manages to escape again with the ability to become human. She meets Sousuke again in a storm and the story goes on in many interesting ways. There is a cuteness factor in this film rivaling and undoubtedly surpassing that of Tonari in Totoro. Joe Hisaishi once again provided excellent musical support. <br /> <br /> The story itself is simple - just like the Miyazaki movies in general - and should appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers. Although I have not seen enough to be sure, the film does not appear to be a movie that will keep scholars in long discussions like Sen for Chihiro at Kamikakushi. However, this is the best entertainment movie to feel good about. I gave the film a note ten in ten.
