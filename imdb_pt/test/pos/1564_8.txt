A great performance by Emily Grace! I stumbled into this movie as I browsed through my satellite listings and got curious about the plot summary I got from my satellite service provider. I was very entertained and had a lot of compassion for the "Alice" character played by Emily Grace. The story made me guess what would happen to Alice and it was not predictable. The overall story was refreshing and had some great twists on the supporting characters. The end of the story ended fairly fairly. I'm going to buy this DVD to add to my library. I'm a new fan of Emily Grace and I anticipate seeing more of her performances.
