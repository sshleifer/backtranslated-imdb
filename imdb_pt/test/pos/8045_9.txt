This movie really proves that the world is often an unfair place, especially the movie world. "The Assignment" received almost no attention on the release and not surprisingly failed at the box office, but when the story is written, this film will certainly receive missed praise. <br /> <br /> Thank God I'm surrounded by friends who know what's good for me. Being a movie fan like myself, a highly recommended friend "The Assignment", a movie I had not even heard of. I decided to check out what Leonard Maltin gave, and not surprisingly he gave ** 1/2. Knowing that this is the same degree he gave classics like "Alien", "The Usual Suspects" and "The Matrix" (I'm not joking) I knew that its meaning does not mean that the didfly squat jack s ***. So, without hesitation, I went out and bought it on DVD. That was about 3 years ago and the film is still one of my proudest belongings in my DVD collection, despite a cover design that echoes a low-budget bubble gum with Casper Van Dien. <br /> <br /> "The Task" is skillfully directed, delivering some really intense moments that will keep you at the tip of your seat throughout the movie, plus have a sometimes brilliant story that you know will be full of laps and unexpected twists. It stars Aidan Quinn in one of his best performances, and serves him with great support from Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley, who are in great shape. <br /> Something like 40 of 42 comments like this movie, most of them can not praise it enough. So what are you waiting for? If you consider yourself a fan of action thrillers, you should have bought, rented, seen yesterday!
