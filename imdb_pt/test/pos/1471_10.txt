Well, I saw this yesterday and it was a lot better than the other making-off of VH1, too bad than this is very outdated, but you get to see all the staff that does south park, very interesting stuff. It's also funny that this documentary portrays Trey and Matt as selfish, selfish creators of snobs who do not work and spend all their time enjoying themselves or relaxing (which is kind of ironic because they work so hard on the show). <br /> <br /> He also shows the entire animation process to make an episode of South Park, interview with the actors that bring the characters voices and more. <br /> <br /> If you are a South Park fan I highly recommend this.
