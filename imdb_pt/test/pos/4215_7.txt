I'll be honest, I rented this movie solely on the fact that it was part of the series "Child's Play." I was expecting a boring part of the 4th also the series, but I was surprised. This movie was surprisingly good, and I found it very funny. There was a lot of black humor, and the idea of ​​having two dolls was a good way to spice things up. The two dolls worked well together and added a bonnie and clyde type to the film. Overall, it was great for a fourth movie in the series, with some gruesome death scenes (just note the type of Marilyn Manson being killed early on, not to mention John Ritter getting his face full of nails). Applauds writers to spice things up, and the end, though I find it a little strange leaves room for yet another sequel ... maybe "son of chucky"!
