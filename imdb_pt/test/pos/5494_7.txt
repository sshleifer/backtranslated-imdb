This is another of Eastwood's many films that mix intrigue, action and a lot of romance, along with "The Gauntlet", "Firefox" and so on. Clint's range of action is now very familiar. In this, he is taciturn and somewhat scandalous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in your performance. But the movie itself is a surprise; is above average. <br /> <br /> Clint is Frank, a Secret Service agent who, perhaps in a moment of doubt, could not get the bullet that killed JFK. He then drank, which took his family away, and now walks into the bureaucracy until he is contacted by John Malkovitch, calling himself "Booth," who creates a kind of distorted relationship with him based on his shared and disillusioned conviction. that everything is meaningless except the urge to escape from monotony and predictability. Now it's a set of rather frivolous attitudes for an artist like Clint to project, but he does very well, less robotic than normal. And he seems to carry with him, like a bundle of stone, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He tested again in the middle of the movie. He is hanging on the roof of a tall building, holding Booth's hand, and he pulls the pistol and points at Booth, who asks if he is really willing to shoot. If he, of course, saves the president from an assassination attempt by a CIA-trained killer, but he does so at the cost of his own life. Booth asks him about the situation as they hold hands in the air. And Clint even has a little speech, talking to Renee Russo, about her failure to save the president in Dallas. "If I had reacted quickly enough, I could have taken that shot ... and that would have been good for me." He is underestimated, but his voice chokes lightly, his eyes tear and his lip quivers. It's one of the few scenes in Clint's movies that can be called "on the move." We know from his new resolution that, given another chance, he would accept the bullet this time. (The irony is that he does not like the current president.) Who could? He makes pompous speeches in Colorado about how they "carved a nation out of the desert." They did not do the same thing in Las Vegas? > It is often said that a movie is as good as its villain. Not true, nothing is so simple, but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case. The reptilian John Malkovitch with his Tartar eyes is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Talk about disappointment. Okay, it can get a little dizzy, sniffing with disdain even when it puts two innocent hunters between the eyes, but it's fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little to do. Fred Thompson, as White House chief of staff, is now back in politics, a relief to movie goers. If Clint's scope of action is limited, Thompson's scope is somewhat smaller. In all the films in which he has been, he uses the same solemn and dissatisfied expression as if he were constantly tormented by some form of digestive volcanic disorder. <br /> <br /> Wolfgang Peterson's direction is as good as it was in Das Boot, which is very good. There is a lot of cross-cutting usual in the final thriller. And when Clint and Russo fall into a passionate embrace in their hotel room and run back toward the bed like two weasels in heat, Peterson shows us amusingly his feet along with a succession of objects falling to the floor - not just the usual clothes , but hand cuffs, guns, beeps, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impediments. Interrupted, Clint throws back the bed and sighs, "Now I have to put all those things back again." <br /> <br /> Well written and worth watching.
