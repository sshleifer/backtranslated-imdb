What appears to be a robbery of Porky turns out to be a moving film about being young and in love. <br /> <br /> The story concerns three friends, Gary, Ricky and David, who spend their school hours looking for sex. When a young girl arrives in town, Gary falls madly in love with her. <br /> <br /> The film ranges from a contemptible sex movie to an examination of teenage insecurities. It's funny and sad at the same time. It never completely gives way to the love story formula that seems prominent in every movie made. You know the guy knows the girl, the guy loses the girl, the guy takes the girl back in the final formula of the frame. This formula is dropped after the guy knows the girl. Maybe that's why I liked the movie so much. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is especially good and the ending is final. It may also be one of the most realistic finals I've ever seen in a love story. <br /> <br />
