I have not written a review here in ages, but re-watch all the TV shows, live shows and this I felt had to make my views on this movie known! Yeah, I feel, the perfect comedy movie. There's no love stories dovey (I really would not call the richies affection with Gina Carbonara, love would you do? Or he and eddie coming up there naked ... not love) that make the rest of the comedys go from good to trash, do not have the usual dilemmas that must be overcome in most other comedy movies ... unless you tell the fact that they poisoned the guests and need to escape the green vomit of the guests as a dilemma similar to other comedy movies ... No, this movie just defines and manages to do one thing And one thing: making a laugh. What does one require of comedy movies? Laughter. This movie only makes you laugh after you laugh without filling your laughter with some serious crap like other comedy movies! So I call it, so far, just a perfect comedy movie ever made and I will never stop watching this beautiful movie! I applaud and goodbye in such a fantastic genius!
