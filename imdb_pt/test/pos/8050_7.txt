While I do 7, I must also point out that it is historically interesting (since it stars Mae Marsh, Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore when they were all younger and lesser known) and features a rather exciting action for their day. The plot is strange for a Westerner, in which the whole problem with the Indians begins with the strangest reason I have ever seen! The Indians decide to make a giant dog banquet (no, they are not feeding dogs, but feeding on dogs) and when two Indians arrive late, there are no dogs left! So they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans from the White settlement nearby and this really touches a total war !!!! Not only is this silly, but it seems to play into the public's prejudices. I do not know if the American Indians actually ate dogs, but it sounds like the kind of stereotype that was later applied to other ethnic groups. All this for dogs! The film has great battle scenes and thrilling moments - like when Mrs. Marsh crawls across the battlefield to save a baby! Exciting things! But, STRANGE, too!
