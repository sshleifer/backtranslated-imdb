As a kid I loved the song "Never smile at a crocodile," and if I found myself in this state of affairs, it is really inspired by true events. Smiling would be the last thing on my mind. Since opening, I've never been so ingrained, trapped and finally exhausted as I was when I watched an independent low-budget Australian horror film, about three people in the Northern Territory trapped in a mangrove swamp with a very conniving crocodile waiting in the water below their. What really brought the movie alive was how realistic it was to convey the fear and uncertainty of the characters' situation to the audience. The semi-documentary camera work with an eerily sinister setting and authentic performances effectively take you out of your comfort zone. What we have is a survival tale for the patient rather than just a bloody attack. Think of "Open Water (2003)," where his budget and time constraint ensured that he would remain discreet, but that minimal barrier improved the experience. <br /> <br /> The slow story can be black and white, but it never seemed to become disposable or succumb to stereotyped patterns. Well, not in large part, and the connection between the characters was emotionally engaging, even with a simple, straightforward script. Although you can say "less is more," with actions and expressions illuminating the remaining thoughts that plague your minds. The ordeal is utterly terrifying, because the threat is very vivid and never seems to let go. This is what drives the movie's chaotic adrenaline, and in which it lasts (even when buried) to the end. The economic orientation of Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich, of the directors / writers, distances and stimulates the viewer with its tense rhythm and distressing psychological traits. In certain stretches the notch increases, with the pressure induced to suspense and amazing images. The way the night sequence is performed is immensely creepy and pulsing. The menacing crocodile manipulator toys with their fresh meat in a distressing approach to suspense. Of course, some moments seem improbable, but they never disturb or distract. Sound FX is the key, and sometimes the lack of just any corrodes. The musical score of Rafeal May is unpretentious and, in fact, does not go much into the mix, but when it does, it creates an organic sound quality. John Biggins's cinematography is wonderfully conceived and quickly aggressive when mood changes. He was always moving and claustrophobic, but none of these sudden movements. The editing was handled with clarity, and the effects were professionally catered for by live crocodile scenes. <br /> <br /> Something like this production would also have to rely on their cast to sell the story in a believable way and they do it. Diana Glenn, Andy Rodoreda and especially Maeve Dermody are persuasively good. Much responsibility lies with Dermody, and she makes a strong delivery with an inspired spin. Now this item may contain some comparisons with another killer crocodile movie "Rogue (2007)", but the two could not be different in what they want to be and how they end up. If I had to choose, I'm more inclined to this tour by your total involvement to grab you. <br /> <br /> A remarkable effort on all fronts with all involved showing potential to really look out.
