Most of the time, I only appreciate the kind of movie that allows you to escape from the current time to the future or past. This movie is pure escapism. The dance begins almost immediately, and Debra Paget in her "purple harem" bikini dress simply has no equal in film in my opinion. His dance, while sensual, is surpassed by his dance in Fritz Lang's Tiger of Eschnapur, available on DVD, where she played the dancer from the Seetha temple. <br /> <br /> A problem with the film is the closed scenario. There are few outdoor scenes filmed, and they, like other scenes, are a bit claustrophobic. The same places are used again and again, but with some secret passages and interesting waterways. His secret double identity is totally unbelievable with beauty of this magnitude. Debra still wields a saber and holds two enemy soldiers on the ladder, she could do anything. <br /> <br /> What works is Debra Paget as a princess. With her beauty, she would surely be the center of attention anywhere at any point in history. This movie, when we expect it to be available on DVD, will be a must buy. Overall, with a little humor, I loved it. <br /> <br />
