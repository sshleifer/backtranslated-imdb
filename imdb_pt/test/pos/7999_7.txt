Batman Returns should be considered quality when talking about superhero movies. His predecessor, Batman, in my opinion, is by far the biggest and best-thought comic book genre. For someone to say that Batman Returns was disappointing, he or she did not watch the movie and considered the performance of Danny Devito as the Penguin. Devito and Walken offer some memorable moments. The Batman tale is supposed to be dark and Tim Burton complied as the comics portray Batman. Batman Returns provides comic relief, action, suspense and fantasy; and should not be seen as "crap", although we are all entitled to our own opinions.
