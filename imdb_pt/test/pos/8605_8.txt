After the atomic bomb strikes Hiroshima, charred bodies are around, deformed victims try to communicate with relatives who can not recognize them, and one person after another dies of radiation sickness. This black and white film, though sad and scary, is not without humor. The story revolves around a young woman, Yasuko, who was hit by the black rain after the explosion. She is trying to get married, but everyone keeps dying, and people are worried that the same will happen to her. After finding a suitable companion (who is losing her mind after being in the war for a long time), she ends up showing signs of radiation sickness. This movie is a great picture of the atomic attacks in Japan, it will scare you and maybe make you cry. The acting is good, not overly dramatic like many other ww2 movies that were made.
