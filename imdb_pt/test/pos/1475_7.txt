Ah! When good actors take on unsightly material! If you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller, you may be disappointed. Although the situations are very real, the plot continues in a very predictable clip and you can very well see what's ahead before the actors take you there. Many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just moving stereotypes. Much of the dialogue is just silly. <br /> <br /> But! If you like to see good actors rise above this kind of material and do some of that, then you will love this movie! Sam Elliott is nothing short of brilliant at bringing the character of a Detective Falon note to life with depth and emotion. Those of you who have never seen Elliot act far beyond his ugly stoic stances will be delighted by the range of emotions he portrays in this film. And also, in his first fifty years in this movie, he looks fantastic! His bare chest scene gives hope to middle-aged men everywhere! Esai Morales does a wonderful job elevating her role as Det. Beaver eager to Falon new police partner. He could have played easily as a Robin for Elliott's Batman, but instead he breathed a genuineness and passion into that role. It does work despite some of the thigh lines he's given to say. <br /> <br /> Paul Sorvino is fun to watch! He plays the eccentric police captain. He seems to know that he is slumming in this movie and is having a ball doing it. He is also fun for us. <br /> <br /> This movie is very full of numbers, but it pays off with great performances! Sam Elliott fans should definitely get this one as it's a kick to see him spread his wings and do a lot more than he usually can do!
