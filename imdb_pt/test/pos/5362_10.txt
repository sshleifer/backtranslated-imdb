This is the kind of movie they used to do, fun, touching, disturbing, authentic, with convincing performances from people without a nose job, breasts, ophthalmological jobs, in other words, real people. Shauna Macdonald interprets female love interest, and she is so real that you want to give her a hug in the least. Imagine this, a real girl in a movie, what next? Hollywood would hate her, because her freshness is a strong criticism of all the fake Hollywood stars. This story has the same hilarious feel of Sandy Mackendrick's classic Whiskey Galore, with the gnomish humor of the Scottish islanders picking out the pretensions of intruders coming in from outside and enjoying a drink from time to time (the actual intervals between these times are usually quite low ). Director Stephen Whittaker shows a rare ability to do this, and it is shocking to discover that he died before the release of his film, at only 56 years old, which was clearly a substantial loss to the screen. Ulrich Thomsen does very well in playing a German rocket scientist who in the late 1930s goes to Scarp on the Isle of Harris to build a small rocket to carry postal packages between the islands. There he falls in love with Macdonald's seductive girl, and she reciprocates affection. Some wonderfully colorful local characters decorate the tale, and the film is pure delight. There is, of course, the threat of impending war with Hitler, and we find that Hitler executed 1000 rocket scientists who refused to build weapons of war, which is a shocking statistic. Tragic love is never far from being seen, but the lips should remain sealed in a review of what happens in the end. This film is a magnificent example of the kind of film people in Britain should do. But are they being released correctly? In a nation whose tastes have been so corrupted by reality shows, where repulsive nullities have become national heroes, is there even a market for such a movie? After all, there is no grunting sex, no close-ups of suppurated or genital wounds to anyone, no drugs taken, no stupid celebrities prancing around wanting to be looked at, and so wonders if there is anything Interested has become so decadent and tired that only the most extreme sensations can briefly relieve the tedium of its meaningless existence. Anyone who is looking for an antidote to contemporary Britain's disability can take refuge in this refreshing and honest film.
