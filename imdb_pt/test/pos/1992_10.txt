"EXistenZ" by David Cronenberg is a well-designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It addresses the problems of a culture that is connected to technology and can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. The film shocks the public with the substitution of mechanical technology for an organic and metabolic. In this context, technology is capable of being part of the human body. After playing the virtual reality game 'eXistenZ', the real world looks like a game and as a result, human behavior changes to apply violent gaming instincts even when the game is over. In eXistenZ, technology evolved from machinery to biological organisms that bind directly to the human nervous system; an idea that reflects the belief of Marshall McLuhan, who is a well-known media theorist, that computers are extensions of human consciousness. As the phone is an extension of the ear, television is an extension of the eye, the telegram is an extension of the central nervous system, high-tech virtual reality is an extension of human consciousness. In eXistenZ, technology is biological and therefore more human than it is in our world. But as technology becomes organic, humans become more mechanical, and therefore less free, unable to resist their playing impulses. eXistenZ is a virtual real simulation of man's existence. Jean Baudrillard describes a society mediated in his book Simulation and Simulation, in which all the power to act was transformed to appear. The world has passed into a pure simulation of itself. In eXistenZ, it is obvious to see Baudrillard-mediated society with the themes of the body invasion, the loss of control, and the transformation of the self into another. <br /> <br /> While you are in eXistenZ, consciousness slowly replaces with another identity, your role in the game, which is a subconscious reflection of the real life of each individual. As you gain control of your hyperreal life step by step, the aura of your real life disappears. For Baudrillard, "simulations or simulacra have become hyperreal, more than real." Our hyper-reality, like Cronenberg's world of computational simulation, "now looks, and for all intents and purposes, is more real than we call the real world." (Baudrillard) The goal of the game that basically can be called "experience" is quite metaphorical. Because you do not even know what experience is unless you experience it. As existentialists say that life without an exact explanation is absurd, the eXistenZ game is also absurd. Cronenberg, ironically, reflects the absurdity of our lives. For example, in the game, the other roles are stopped unless you ask a preprogrammed question. And when you put your state of seeming funny and meaningless in the representation of our lives, the absurdity of it really shocks. <br /> <br /> The theme of the game is to understand what is it for? This hidden metaphorical issue creates anguish over the people who play eXistenZ. They have no doubts about their existence; however, they do not know the underlying reason for their existence. The essence. Existentialists hold that human beings do not have a fixed nature, or essence, as other animals and plants do; each human being makes choices that create their own nature. In the formulation of the French philosopher of the twentieth century Jean Paul Sartre, existence precedes the essence. Choice is therefore fundamental to human existence and is inevitable; even denial of choice is a choice. Freedom of choice implies commitment and responsibility. Because individuals are free to choose their own path, the existentialists have argued, they must accept the risk and responsibility to follow their commitment wherever it leads. Perhaps I should mention that "eXistenZ" also deals with the concept of freedom of choice. You reach your final role in the game by making the right decisions. If you do not, the game will become irrelevant and boring. Then you begin to question the game, its existence and not its essence. Suddenly you become schisopfrenically alianated from the game and realize your position out of the game. As well as a last word, eXistenZ is a well-designed reverse simulation of life, thus existentialism. <br /> <br />
