I found this show by accident and was surprised to discover that no one I know has ever heard of it. This was by far one of the best shows I've seen in months, if not years and I can not wait for more episodes to come out. Sleeper Cell portrays a psychological struggle of a secret agent within a terrorist cell that has to constantly make difficult decisions to maintain its coverage while remaining true to its real cause. This is an extremely well done show. It keeps you intrigued from the first episode to the end, and although it progresses slowly, it's fast enough for you to feel on edge. Very realistic and human, it addresses important topics and each episode presents an interesting question to reflect on. This show is not 24 or any of the police programs on TV and is not trying to be anything either. It is genuine and unique. It's a show about a human being, his difficult choices and his fighting life, where a simple mistake can cost him everything. <br /> <br /> I gave this show a 10 for great plot, good progression, excellent cinematography, great music and realistic characters, each with a story to tell.
