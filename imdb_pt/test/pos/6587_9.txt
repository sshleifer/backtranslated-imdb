Before seeing this movie, I heard lots of compliments and many exclamations about how "horrible" it was. Not to take any credit from this movie, I think it was not so horrible or even shocking. It's just a movie about people living on the darker side of the city. And a good one at picturing the spot. <br /> <br /> There are great performances here and a well thought out manuscript. Paavo Westerberg is a renowned writer on the Finnish film scene and is the best at describing contemporary Finnish culture (although he is not the only writer of this film, but I dare say he is the main writer anyway. . <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent except for Jasper Pääkkönen (the pseudo-main character, which in my opinion should have stayed on the scene of the soap opera), and the scenery, cuts and sounds are fine also made and give a great atmosphere to this film. This film is a story about sad intertwined destinations that, according to a very famous song of the famous Finnish band ("Tuhansien" of Eppu Normaali). Murheellisten Laulujen Maa ", which very roughly translated into" Paha Maa ") throughout the Finnish society leads to a sad, dark end, accompanied by drink, loneliness and bad choices. And it is the Finnish daily life side on which 80 % of p opulation is unaware unless such films are made.
