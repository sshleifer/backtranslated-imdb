Crazy Scottish warrior race, stranded in outer space, with little food and free budget, started ten down now to three, which will help these men uproot, with visual effects that semi suck, but I kind of liked being queer, if I found one so I would be running away, but not if I had Scottish mates, we could not swear and avoid that fate, so in the end it was not spoiled, it was a DVD that I'm glad I watched but if they do a sequel, some actors are not all the same, some are good, some are brave, some are wooden, and maybe they should fix it, but the action kept me watching everything, the shots, the screams, Do not stop, I'll tell my friends to do not be afraid, and watch again in another year.
