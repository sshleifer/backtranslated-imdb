That's as good as it was with the wind gone. I love this movie that I could watch over and over again. Carlett always gets what she wants, no matter what the cost. She tries very hard to forget Rhett, but she just does not can do She loves him very much. This is a true true love story. It started with the wind and ended up in this movie. The only real way to end this movie for true true love. It was to have Scarlett and Rhett together at the end. And that's the way he ended them back together with his daughter. What more could you ask for. There is no better end to this great love story than that. What else can I say about this great movie?
