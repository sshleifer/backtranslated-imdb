A few years ago I saw this remake of the classic Sixties with the Mini Coopers for the first time and I remember loving it a lot. Now, about two years later, it was shown on television and I just wanted to know if I still wanted it as much as when I saw it at the movies. Well, the answer is yes. <br /> <br /> The film is about a team of thieves who will do a final job in Venice, Italy. The plan is flawless and the execution perfect. They escape and will not have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is one problem that they have not taken into account: someone within their own ranks does not like to split the serve but wants to keep everything to himself even when it means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. . But all but one survive and are seeking revenge. A year later, in Los Angeles, the surviving team members create a clever and dishonest plan to steal gold and take revenge on the traitor ... The story about himself is clear is not very original , since this is a remake of the original film of 1969, but has many things to offer so that you forget it. This is a typical movie of assault / action, but it certainly is one of the best of the genre. The action is very good, the landscapes and Venice are really beautiful, the story is good and the special effects are impressive. Even acting is very good, something you will not see often in an action movie. I must admit that I really enjoyed what I saw and I give this film a well deserved 7.5 / 10.
