As I said before in previous reviews, some programs are there to be "light entertainment". So I get a bit frustrated when commentators seem to be expecting a program that reveals the meaning of life, you will not get it from Cleopatra 2525 and you do not intend to offer it. What you get is a girl who has been frozen and is brought back to life about 500 years later and her adaptation to this new life is realistic. She does not calm down in 10 minutes like what happens with other time travel adventures and neither is she the female equivalent of James Bond ready to face every nook and cranny.Cleopatra is intimidated by her new surroundings and scared by some of the weapons on display as most of us would be. However, it is light entertainment, the stories have a medium beginning and an end in quick time and are some surprisingly good acting moments. The episode in which there is a double of Cleopatra is particularly moving and Jennifer Sky, I think it gives one of the best performances of someone who has been dying for a long time, and being a fan of cinema and television, I know what I'm talking about. Finally, to prove my sincerity, I bought everyone but four of the episodes, and I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The only reason I do not have the complete set is because I bought the other episodes before realizing there was a full box. Victoria Pratt and Gina Torres complete the trio with credibility and for light entertainment, Cleopatra 2525 certainly amused me.
