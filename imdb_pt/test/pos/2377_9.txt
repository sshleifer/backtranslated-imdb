OK, this does not compare to the explosive rhythm of the opening sequence of the first part; nor to its value of visual shock; nor, indeed, to the melancholic suspense of the second installment. No, it's surprisingly and pleasantly different (besides, of course, the two main actors). The ironic futuristic scenario takes the characters to each other through genres and languages ​​with an almost gravitational force. The moment of completion of the impact is your choice of: a) Shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon fantasy; b) sublimation of violence in homo-erotics; c) humorous detonation of an impossible accumulation. Everything until then is even less unequivocal. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended to indiscriminate movie buffs who do not mind following foie gras with a hot dog; care for those with more refined palates.
