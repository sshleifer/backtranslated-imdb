I really enjoyed the two times I watched. And both times, I came out thinking about it and about the "moral of the story" a lot. I agree with another reviewer that the film is not centered around the science fiction aspects you might expect from an alien movie on Earth, but rather about the human condition. The psychiatric hospital characters provide a great insight into this and how they range from despair to hope. This movie has touches of sadness for humor to sympathy for the ending "is it or is not it". This final question was well addressed and even though some might argue that you do not know what happens at the end and the question is not answered, I feel it is done in much more detail than something like the movie Ronin (with Robert De Niro) where you never find out what's in the box and you feel very frustrated about it. I recommend K-PAX. 8/10
