"Throw Momma From the Train" is a simple dark comedy with lots of laughs. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal plays a frustrated writer on the brink of collapse; Danny DeVito plays a man in one of Crystal's writing classes. Crystal's ex-wife is a * hag * to say well, and Crystal hates her. DeVito, realizing this, offers a deal to Crystal one night: DeVito will kill Crystal's wife if Cristal kills DeVito for his mother. Crystal, of course, refuses, but then, corruption deep in the heart makes him say yes. And as soon as things happen, we see what happens when you try to play someone's mother from a moving train. <br /> <br /> This story is an interesting study of character; a history of evil, greed, revenge, ego, trust, doing what is right, but above all corruption. We see Crystal's white-collar writer getting more and more stressed out with events bumping around him, and because of DeVito's constant annoyance, he says "yes." But we know deep down in his subconscious he wanted to say "yes," and is pleased to have said that to DeVito. This movie is a bit obscure in Hitchcock's immortal movie "Strangers on a Train," and pays homage to the film at the beginning when there is a theater playing "Strangers on a Train." We see DeVito watching the movie, and a lamp in his head pops up. He has an idea. Play Mom from the train! <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal presents another compelling and strangely comical performance as a battered writer on the verge of collapse. He has been so dejected by everything around him that his inner emotions come out and he agrees to play DeVito's mother on the train. <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito directed this film in an excellent way. He uses only the right touch of comic darkness to create a world of corruption and disease. Everything is demented, but not to the extreme, as in some other dark comedies. It has only the right touch of the darkness that shone in "The War of the Roses". <br /> <br /> It is not just "Play Momma From the Train" a simple tale of corruption and morality, but it is also an interesting character study. Definitely worth getting on the TV. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
