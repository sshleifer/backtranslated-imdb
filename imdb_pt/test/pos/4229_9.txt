I was hoping this was like the others, it tries to be scary - it ends up looking silly. Somewhere along the line, the writers must have realized this and thus took the film in a totally different direction, basically ignoring the other films. It looks like a different movie than the fourth entry in the Child's Play series. The new idea works by far, making this the best of the series.
