John Ford paid the wagons his tribute to a special painting, "Wagon Master," made after two great Indian cavalry epics ... It is a beautiful poetic film, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneering spirit ... great that preceded it ... <br /> <br /> Photographically, it is extremely simple ... The camera moves only once or twice throughout the film, and never when a director would have done it. Move to underline a shot ... Ford even resists the temptation to track down his camera in the breathtaking pictures of tired women marching in the dust behind their wagons ... They come and go while the camera stands still and the audience remains a spectator for the march of history, not a participant of it ... Of course, when Ford wants to engage its audience emotionally or dramatically, as in 'Stagecoach', it knows exactly how to do this ... But "Wagon Master" is a tender, nostalgic look behind ... <br /> <br /> Full of traditional Western songs provided by The Sons of the Pioneers, talks about West's journey to Utah (in 1879) of a Mormon wagon train led by Ward Bond in the role of Elder Wiggs and two young horse dealers (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr.). And in a series of beautiful images, as the wagon struggles with lawlessness, Indians and nature in their struggle to reach the "promised land," the modest "Wagon Master" manages to capture the history and legend of the West ... < Ford himself said that 'Wagon Master' (of which he wrote the original story) was among his three films that 'got closer to being what I wanted to achieve'. <br /> <br /> Ford's career as a director of the West was surprising ... More than anyone else, he was able to use the genre to protect his feelings about American family, society and way of life. Ford saw the frontier as a land to be subdued by a special class of settlers and law-men whose great sacrifices make the land safe from those who come after... These early Westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they earned, and the civilized citizens who followed should always hold them in fear and respect ... Ford's Westerners often use flashbacks that emphasize history All the authenticity of their approach ... In 'Wagon Master' for example, folk songs on the soundtrack tell us about the difficulties of the pioneers of a century ago, and Ford shows them to us almost documentary ... In a sequence the train is camped in a circle and the settlers decide to perform a the square dance ... To form a dance floor they have to put plaques on the sand of the desert, and with this ritual celebration Ford shows the defeat of the desert through the metaphor of boarding the earth ... <br /> < It's an adorable movie, full of a joyful and wonderful optimism, and it's easy to understand why Ford found it so satisfying ?? Never break the faith with the mood and style defined in the first few sequences ?? But wondering if the ultra-romantic fits the theme better? <br /> <br /> The experience of the bullet train must have been one of the most demanding and physically stressful trials that man (with his wife). ) have settled? Must have been full of doubts? Was I wrong to sell everything and come? How can we expect to survive? How are we going to deal with the other side - almost every other step of the way? <br /> <br /> However, none of these feelings actually appear in "Wagon Master". The journey such is the general boiling does not attack one as particularly dangerous? Could it be, of course, that Mormons were so "high" in the religious spirit that it tended to act like an anesthetic? In other words, his reactions were not normal human weakness ... If so, was Ford right and those who doubted were wrong ?? <br /> <br /> What is beyond doubt is the right and proper boiling, especially at the first meeting, of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. This is the essence of joyful adventurous youth, particularly of the western youth of those extraordinary times ?? Is it a remarkable relationship and stays in the mind?
