My taste in movies continues to amaze me and probably infuriate readers of my comments, but for each of them and I have a weakness for crazy horror, horror movies and See No Evil happens just that and more! I think the biggest mistake made by the filmmakers and producers of this movie is that they exalt it as a WWE movie and "starring" KANE. WWE may have a large following but it is a very specific group that follows the type of "sport" trailer park and those who do not love it HAATTTE IT !! It would make them stay away from a bloody horror movie so people would go out in droves to see. See No Evil does not break ANY new horror field, it's exactly a typical horror game, with some gruesome bloody scenes that honestly make your screen crawl. They actually drive home and go to the just cause free violence. There is no psychological aspect exactly, although being chased by this monster has some elements of fear for it. <br /> <br /> KANE (the fighter) also known as Glen Jacobs plays the man religiously and physically tortured Jacob Goodnight. He is the final cross between Leatherface and Jason Voorhees. He is not an original killer and even his kills do not go to the original or original, with the great exception of choking a girl to death, forcing her to swallow her cell phone ... yeeeeah !! He does a good job and the man is legitimately huge !! It's 7 meters high and no special effects is monstrous !! Tiffany Lamb, Penny McNamee, Samantha Noble, Michael J. Pagan, Luke Pegler, Christina Vidal, Rachael Taylor, are all part of the typical group of "invincible thinkers" who will inadvertently fall victim to the serial killer. The story is that in exchange for a month off from the detention sentence for small offenses ranging from robbery to drug possession, they are sent to an old hotel to do "community service" by fixing it. It turns out that a serial killer lives upstairs and is removing the eyes of his victims to cleanse them of their sins. Luke Pegler stands out as a scum who in the end becomes a hero, even saving his ex-girlfriend, which he used to beat. All others interpret their roles well in perspective, but it is not a great acting skill. <br /> <br /> Sad porn director ... yes PORN ... Gregory Dark, does a good job together the modern slasher movie. It even goes into a bit of history with the killer and although his back story is not unique, it's actually a bit stale yet it's interesting enough. And in the few scenes where the film buff is actually seeing through the killer's eyes, it's interesting to hear the voices and see things distorted as he does. He plays the mandatory nude soft core shot, and grotesque scenes, drenched in blood and turns everything into a notch. It fits in very well and for a horror fan like me it's fun. Kane's serial killer is horrifying and he pursues them all with brutal intelligence and a silent horror. The movie is being panned and crapped and I do not blame anyone because it's too bad, but is not that the point? It's a horror movie and I thought it was exactly what it should be. It made me jump, it made me shudder, even made me turn around ... impressive by any standard. It's fun, with a decent story, and very configured to serialize See No Evil until the 15th installment if you wanted and I say bring it !! It is true that the film is full of holes, ridiculous details, but the most lethal blood and horror take you all. Does it all come down to you love horror movies? Really love them? If so then you will think that this is a great slasher ... if not ... you will hate it ... simple and simple. 8.5 / 10
