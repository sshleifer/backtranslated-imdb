For years I had a distant memory of watching this movie, I looked on the net to find it somewhere and could not find it anywhere, so I thought it must have disappeared. <br /> <br /> UNTIL ... my gran showed me a set of boxes that she sent out in the Daily Mail and I though nah there will be nothing decent there, but to my big surprise there among other gems was The Water Babies! I was not so excited for a long time! It's a great lightweight movie, the songs are not memorable, probably if I were a kid by the time I left I would have stayed in my mind more. Unfortunately, it was just a movie that I watched my fans 10 years ago when I was a little spud. And watching back now the animation is terrible! and the recounted voices they make to get a wealth of sound in the movies are totally out! But who cares when you are a child, you never think of these things, even if they take a boy about 10 years old and sound like a boy in the middle of puberty. <br /> <br /> Great classic children's movie!
