I loved this movie that was a great portrait of a family that had a share of ups and downs, but in the end they knew the special love they had for each other. I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god was one of her best, although it was released 12 years ago. This movie contained a cast of stars, and what I loved the most was to open my eyes to see other actors that I have not seen before. This movie was kind of long, but I enjoyed every minute of it. It is a movie that you can sit with your family and watch, although we have to cover children's eyes a few times due to the discretionary love scenes. Overall, I rate this movie as 10 on a scale of 1-10. The life time is not enough, so if anyone knows what the store sells, let me know, because this is imperative.
