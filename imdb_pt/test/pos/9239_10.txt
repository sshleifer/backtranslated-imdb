After seeing The Texas Tale of Treason, Cox's squandered correspondence efforts could not even pay for the huge collusion that Stu drove without a budget. Tells a story about dedication, sweat, whiz, fire and punk rock. I love it! My favorite parts are the interviews with Marci (she's a very hot cat and she likes me, but she does not know it yet). The Japanese clerk stifling his speech, it broke me. The sex scene was really cool. I'll see if Stu will come in at some point and make the light wave when I'm doing this to my wife. The introduction and of course my 5 seconds during the final credits. I know this is going to give me some girls. I hope to see more of Antstuie because I know I can expect the unexpected.
