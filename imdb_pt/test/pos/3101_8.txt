The Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost continue from where The Egg and I stop. For the first Kettles solo adventure, a new team of screenwriters and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was the producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses, MacDonalds' focus on Kettles works great. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for the first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and Me. The cash prize of the quilt contest was to be used to send Tom Kettle to college. In this movie, Tom is coming home as a college graduate. <br /> <br /> There are two tangles entwined in this movie. One is the comedy of the simple family of mountains that transforms into a modern house of last generation. The other is a light morality game about how the environment affects children as they grow. <br /> <br /> Pa Kettle (Percy Kilbride) wanted a free tobacco purse to enter a contest and eventually won a house. His disappointment at not getting the free tobacco bag is thrown to laugh a little. When Pa plays with dynamite, he is totally oblivious to the explosion. Kilbride never shrank into the scene as the wreckage of the explosion fell around him. He played the role to perfection. In his autobiography, Jack Benny mentioned how impressed he was with the unexpressive delivery of Percy Kilbride. Kilbride took this comic device to a high level of perfection. <br /> <br /> Ma (Marjorie Main) and Pa enter the new house with modern conveniences that confuse mom and dad almost as much as they help them. Ma fits much faster than Pa. Included with modern conveniences is a television, a very new home item in 1949. Movable walls, concealed beds and plumbing accessories are used as comedic props, but attention is in Ma Pa, Tom Kettle (Richard Long) never meets Kim Parker (Meg Randall), a magazine writer who thinks hygiene and the environment are essential for children to succeed as adults. Tom is a brilliant, self-taught man who contradicts the theory that success can only come from an untouched environment. This subject is briefly discussed in some scenes, but left to diminish. It was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise extravagant movie. Watching the kettles get out of their old house to move to a new home would be almost a disaster if it were not for the characters to remain true to themselves. Ma was the practice, just as he had been in The Egg and I. Pa was the fish out of water that made the best comedy. He never felt at home in the new house, but the actual location of a comfortable bed would never be of concern to him.
