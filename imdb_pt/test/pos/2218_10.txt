I had the pleasure of seeing a new independent film called "Half Empty". I usually go out to the local theater with my husband and feel like we're stuck with the latest Sequel, or Prequel, that Hollywood plays in us. Was that different and surprising? MUCH more fun than anything Hollywood spends millions on in advertising. When my husband and I are going to the movies, are we going to have fun? and "Half Empty" did just that and the film did it in a clever way that made me feel like my trip to the movies was worth it. It's a funny, human, and surprising story, sometimes musical, that cleverly entertains in its simplicity. I especially enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom. It's almost like an operetta. This particular scene reminded me of a scene in "Phantom of the Opera," when four of the artists not only, that is, they sang against each other in a friendly replica. I'm not a movie expert, but this movie was more fun than any other great studio movie I've seen lately. It's silly, funny, fun and fun. Completely enjoyable ?? which is what I expect from the movies, but they rarely offer it as "half empty".
