Danny Boyle was not the first person to realize that zombies can run like clatters. This honor belongs to Lifeforce, who is, of course, Halley's biggest comedic nude space vampire zombie, who goes mad in the London-made end of the world film. Tobe Hooper may have done a lot of crap, but for this epic and demented horror frenzy of science fiction he deserves a place among the immortals. In addition, it offers the space vampire Mathilda May, the best thing that came out of France since Simone Simon, passing the entire movie naked. Which she does very, very well. Just keep in mind that while it is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence that anyone on Earth has ever encountered, it is also "totally alien to this planet and to our way of life and totally dangerous." It is a field meeting that I would love to have participated in: British space program astronauts find three alien life forms naked humanoid inside a giant 140-mile-long artichoke / umbrella spacecraft hidden in the tail of Halley's Comet, full of giant dried bats and bring them back to Earth with almost apocalyptic results as they drain the population of London from their vital force amidst much nudity, swirling thunder and spitting their coffee throughout the room ("I've been in space for six months, "and she seems perfect to me." "Suppose we know nothing, which is underestimating the subject." "Do not worry, a naked woman will not leave this complex.") Oh, and we'll get the writers of Alien and Blue Thunder write it with re-writes not credited by the writer of Mark of the Devil, The Sex Thief and Eskimo Nell and the director of The Jonestown Monster. It sounds like a winner, here it is $ 22m? d <br /> <br /> True, there is plenty of promise in the raw material to have done something genuinely scary and thought-provoking (at a time when AIDS hysteria was approaching its height, a sexually transmitted disease) . plague 'offers ample opportunity for allegory), but in the hands of the Go-Go boys in Cannon, what could have been another Quatermass and the Pit quickly turns into Plan10 From Outer Space. It is full of delirium, whether it be the hilarious death scene of Frank Finlay ("Here I am!"), The grand entrance of Peter Firth ("I am Colonel Caine. "This is a D-Notice situation," he responds to the surprisingly kind aides, the securities offering the nude space vampire of Mathilda May a good cookie to stop her to escape, reanimated bodies exploding in dust all over the world, the sweaty prime minister sucking the life of his secretary and London filling up with zombie nuns, brokers and runners as the city gets fuller on the garbage screen since Mrs. Gorgo lost the first one at the Battersea Funfair and went into fury.And this is not to mention the scene or the great stereo echo effect in the male vampire line "It will be much less terrifying ante if you come to me, "while Peter Firth adopts his best Action Man voice to answer" I'll just do it! "In one scene you only have a possessed Patrick Stewart incarnating the female in the mind of our deeply confused astronaut Steve "I-can-never-play-Charlie-Manson" Railsback and his incredible full-on dancing eyebrows "Helta- Skelta! trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, the inimitable Aubrey Morris (the only man who makes Freddie Jones look restrained) by playing Home Secretary Sir Percy Heseltine as a kind of demented Brian Rix, Peter Firth (one of those actors who always seems like if he should have been a Doctor Who at the time, no one else was watching it) by detonating the male blas√© of the public school in the hope that no one would ever see him and the incomparable reactions of John Hallam as the nurse who continues to open the door from the middle of the psychic tornado to bring more drugs. As if they needed more in this movie. It's a shame that Frank Finlay's brown-haired scientist, who is not qualified to certify death in alien life forms (a role originally intended for Klaus Kinski), has lost the action. <br /> <br /> No No matter how crazy you think the movie is, it gets even angrier, whether it's a zombie pathologist ("He also needs to feed himself") blowing all over the secretary's attire, blood and bowels of Patrick Stewart forming a nude Mathilda May or Space Vampires transforming St Paul's Cathedral into the world's largest laser show to transport human souls from the London subway to the geostationary mother ship. I loved every gloriously insane moment. In its own truly unique form, this may be the greatest movie of all time. <br /> <br /> The DVD offers the original 116-minute version that was opened in the UK instead of the much-edited 101 minute version of the USA. not only offers much more hilarity to your dollar, but also completely restores Henry Mancini's score to its original glory (the US version has covered many of the gaps with additional suggestions from Michael Kamen and James Guthrie). Although it was an astonishing choice at first glance, Mancini experienced many of the classic horror horrors of Universal's 50's and his score is superb with an excellent driving title that offers a rare reminder of how interesting he could be away from Blake Edwards. Unfortunately there is no more than a trailer through extras, although it would be good to wait a day for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from the 128-minute cut originally planned by Hooper: from what's on display here, they can offer even more Golden comedy!
