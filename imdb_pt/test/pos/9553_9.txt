He rented the video for a slow Saturday night. First showing I thought it was funny. It took a while to get used to the American cartoons (here we are more in tune with British grotesques), but very nice. <br /> <br /> I watched it again the next night and really got warm. The characters seemed more human-kind even. A movie could watch several times and get more out of it every time. However, my wife * hated * it. No accounting for mood tastes, I suppose.
