This movie caught me by surprise. I saw her for the first time more than 10 years ago and still remains with me. It has only annoying points, and I personally would have ended differently - it did not discourage me from watching it several times and recommending it to other people. The acting is fantastic. The cast and director do an incredible job with the script, and anyone who likes "different" movies, who has the patience to sit down and say, "What the hell is this?", And if you get involved you should give this movie a chance. Whether you just want Alan Rickman to be silly or things to explode, this is not the movie for you.
