What cast of actors and actresses in this episode of Columbus, next to Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan and Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fianc√©e, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman in the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and reprimands the sloppy and often typical behavior of Columbus with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this. Each accusing the other of murdering his uncle for money. Well, you just have to watch and see the result, but I can guarantee it's always worth watching this for the cast and crew.
