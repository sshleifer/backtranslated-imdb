There is hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima (Meiko Kaji), Female Scorpio, and a dangerous group of thugs (including his sadistic-headed pimp and his equally repulsive lady), operating a prostitution ring with an iron fist , does just that. Hell has no fury like Scorpio, and a determined detective, Gondo (Mikio Narita), seeking revenge for beheading her arm after handcuffing her, will do whatever it takes (and this includes intimidating anyone who knows her whereabouts) to pick up Nami. Nami finds an ally in prostitute Yuki (Yayoi Watanabe), who provides her with a temporary shelter. Yuki has a retarded brother who has suffered a brain injury during a job, and must take care of him (.. in a disturbing revelation, in relation to incest, she also provides her sexual needs!) .. she actually keeps him locked in a room while working on the streets! Meanwhile, Nami is targeted by a vile neighbor when she finds a place of her own (she works like a sewer), and he threatens to turn her into authorities (Nami was a convicted fugitive, who fled a police subway) if she not provide him with sexual favors. His wife dumps a kettle of boiling water all over her face and body, resulting in death, and the clan of prostitution seeks Nami to pay the debt of losing a very important member of her organization. It is when Katsu (Reisen Lee), the pimp's lover and confidant, realizes that the one responsible for the loss of his loyal member is a former prisoner of her, the Scorpion. Subduing her with a liquid injected drug, placing her in a bird cage (!), Katsu embellishes in his imprisonment. What ultimately fuels Nami's anger is watching a prostitute die outside her cell, the victim of a forced abortion late in the school year, left to bleed to death. Finding a scalpel in her hand (.. from the operating room), Nami will free herself from the cage and attack each member of the clan responsible for the death of the prostitute. The series of scalpel murders gives Gondo the chance to catch Nami, and he will lock her in the underground sewers beneath the city, but can he take her or kill her? Especially if Yuki comes to your rescue? Trust me when I say that there was no shackle in director Shunya Ito or his film production team because FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: BEAST STABLE is more of a perverse, disturbed and ultra-violent entry in the very entertaining series. Equipped with good production values ​​and a visually stylistic talent to capture all the madness in imaginative ways, I pull him to the right (or he did to me) in the distorted drama that always exists when Nami Matsushima is on the screen. When you have a protracted stream of credits where your anti-heroine is fleeing the streets of the city crowded with the severed arm of a man handcuffed to her, the viewer has to know what he's looking for! The incestuous sub-plot is simply bizarre (..and is filmed in a gentle way with the retarded brother fucking his dumb and cold sister with dead eyes looking forward!), And the whole sequence of abortion is quite difficult to to sit. But the angle of abortion, however disturbing, provides motivation for Nami's revenge. Despite Nami's imperfect moods, and her criminal nature, you'd rather see her taking those cretins out of that vice versa. An interesting angle with Detective Gondo too. Gondo is willing to break the rules, and he becomes a force of nature for anyone who is on his way to capture his mortal enemy. Her fate in the end, visiting another enemy of Nami, in an isolated cell while she looks, perfectly encapsulates what makes these films so ridiculous but so fun. The scalpel murders are a set of slippery, multi-place scrapes, the blades protruding from flesh, with Nami leaving the crime scenes too impelled to clear the entire clan in memory of a fallen victim of unhappy circumstances. While the film is essentially a comic book adventure, there is a sadness that permeates and few characters leave without flaws. I imagine that many will depart from this ridicule of how unrealistic FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: BEAST STABLE is (.. specifically as Nami is able to escape capturing again and again, fulfilling her revenge goals, paying back all those who but I looked at it as a violent action cartoon, much like the 1980s movies, and I liked what it was. As always, this movie features some beautiful Asian actresses and some heavy colored ones. Meiko Kaji, almost always reserved / quiet, but cold looking at her enemies with violent intent, is in good shape (... in more ways) and Reisen Lee, as her disgusting and disgusting opponent, runs away with the image. as a despicable and perfectly abusive enemy worthy of psychological torment (... when both are in prison, Nami's ways of torturing her are sweet). My favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot, but it is so wonderfully wrong, it features a dog uncovering Gondo's rotting cut arm, walking down a street, eventually finding a resting place to chew on!
