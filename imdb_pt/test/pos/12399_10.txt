As a camera operator, I could not help but admire the great looks that this image has achieved. The performances were great as was the story. Just when I thought this movie was about to slow down, that did not happen. Breath-taking tension, great rhythm of editing, and a score that knows when to stand still, all together here under competent and capable leadership. The camera was always in the right place. Love it.
