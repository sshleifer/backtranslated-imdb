"Edge of the City" is another film that owes much credit to "On the Waterfront." From your location in New York, to your score, to the belief that any problems you may have, you can somehow correct your mistakes. <br /> <br /> "Edge" also deals with ideas such as loyalty and racism. In my opinion, that's where the movie does not succeed as "Waterfront". At 85 minutes the movie runs through the establishment of relationships, and connects everything so quickly that much of it seems forced and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Possible Spoilers **** The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could have been more developed in the beginning. I do not believe these two characters, from two very different places, would have built such a strong relationship so quickly. <br /> <br /> I think all the sub-plot of love with Cassavettes could have been eliminated. He is so clumsy with a woman that it is painful to watch. The only reason she's in the movie is so she can motivate him to do the right thing in the end. There are other ways they could have shown this. I would also like to see some Axel scenes in the army to illustrate why he is as he is. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. Poitier is fantastic in a role that is beautifully written. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957) a man who is confident, respected and intelligent. Cassavettes, like Axel North, though very good, does not look too sure for the role. Warden is fantastic as the boss who knows Axel's secret (although his fight scene with Cassavettes in the end is staged horribly. I thought Ruby Dee was wonderful as the wife of Poitier. Overall, "Edge of the City" is a clever film with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style imagine without taking the time to let the drama build. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
