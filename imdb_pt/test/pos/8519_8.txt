"Never Say Never Again" by director Irvin Kershner, a remake of the 1965 film "Thunderball," does not surpass the original Terence Young, but this film is not from Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli. it's worth watching if you call yourself an amateur from 007. However, despite the scarcity of smart gadgets and the lack of a vibrant soundtrack, "Never Say Never Again" is an above average end of the world thriller with performances top-ranked an experienced cast including Sean Connery, Kim Basinger and Klaus. Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Barbara Carrera, Edward Fox, Bernie Casey, Alec McCowen and Rowan Atkinson. The film is filled with surprises in abundance, from the invigorating sequence of title credits throughout its thrilling but time-consuming 134 minutes. Unlike the James Bond franchise sagas with their breathtaking spectacle moments, "Never Say Never Again" provides some of these scenes because of its prohibitive budget. In fact, the film features only three devices: an explosive ballpoint pen, a laser wristwatch and a poisoned motorcycle. In addition to the flavorful opening theme song from Lani Hall, the orchestral soundtrack of songwriter Michel Legrand's "Ice Station Zebra" leaves much to be desired. Legrand does not play any of those jazz sounds that made John Barry's song for the Bond franchise so memorable. All in all, "Never Say Never Again" seems to fit most in the first two James Bond films "Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love" and "On Secret Majesty Secret Service" in terms of its lowest ground approach to the subject. <br /> <br /> "Never Say Never Again" presents Sean Connery's James Bond as an older 007 who saw his day and was taken out of active duty to teach. Ironically, Roger Moore was a year older than the films of Connery and Moore, treating 007 as an active young man. Sean Connery seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent and several changes occur in the screenplay of Lorenzo Semple that emphasize Bond's age. Initially, Connery had pressed to play Bond without a wig, but mercifully wiser minds prevailed and Connery wore a wig. He looks tanned and fit and appears in better shape than he did twelve years earlier when he was rushed into "Diamonds Are Forever" at the last moment to replace John Gavin. Connery was working on another film and gained weight for the role he was unable to remove in time from "Diamonds Are Forever." At age 52, Connery still has a youthful vibe here, despite the script's fabricated demands. <br /> <br /> The action unfolds with 007 alone trying to rescue a woman kidnapped on a remote desert island. He dispatches several guards armed with machine guns and frees the woman, only to have her stabbing him with a knife in the side when he is not looking. It seems that this whole sequence was an exercise designed by M (Edward Fox of "Day of the Jackal") to test the ability of Bond. The new M does not share the use of field agents from its predecessor. M decides that Bond needs to clear his system of all "free radicals" and sends 007 to the Shrubs. While at the country clinic, Bond notices suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and is noted to observe them. The nurse is none other than the assassin of SPECTRE Fatima Blush and she is responsible for making sure no one sees USAF officer Jack Petachi (Gavan O'Herlihy of "Superman 3" ). Petachi is part of a plot of Specter by the billionaire businessman Maximilian Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer from "Out of Africa") to blacken the world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads. The villains deploy an eye on Captain Petachi, who has access to highly sophisticated computers and can order weaponry. After he steals the weapons for the Specter, Fatima Blush ejects him from the road by throwing his pet snake into his lap and then attaches an explosive to his wrecked car and explodes. In fact, the first part of "Never Say Never Again", in addition to the SPECTER planning conference, belongs to Fatima as she oversees Petachi's stay in the clinic and then tries several times to kill Bond, one at sea with sharks and later at a motel. Eventually, Bond meets beautiful blonde Domino (Kim Basinger from "Mother Lode") and runs off to Largo's charity fundraiser at a Monte Carlo casino, where the two face each other in an elaborate video game called 'Domination' to see who will rule the world. Bond defeated him and Largo hates him doubly now because 007 is his only rival for Domino and a thorn in his side that even Fatima does not seem able to remove. Bond and Fatima leave after a motorcycle chase when he returns the favor and explodes. Her previous encounter in the Bahamas, when she attached a device to lure a shark behind him, is very bad. As in the original "Thunderball", the villains recover the nuclear warheads hijacked at sea, but only the warheads themselves. Bond flies to the Bahamas, where he finds his diplomatic liaison, Nigel Small-Fawcett (no less than Rowan Atkinson, of "Mr. Bean" who is worried that Bond might kill someone and ruin The CIA sends Felix Leiter (Bernie Casey of "Guns of the Magnificent Seven") to support Bond. This is the first time an African-American performs Leiter "Never Say Never Again" is a richly respected James Bond thriller with many touches, but never creates the air of danger that the In fact, "Never Say Never Again" looks like a theater worthy of Masterpiece in 007.
