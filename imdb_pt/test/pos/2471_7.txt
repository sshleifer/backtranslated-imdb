The film's strengths were clear to the beginning and middle of the film. It showed how a very violent and reactive authority could react to resistance. Shot in the form of a documentary, the director captures what would have happened if the United States had enacted martial law. Volunteering for the "punishment park," a police training camp where you are bullied and harassed, would offer you a terrible scenario. He switches from court trials to those facing charges, those in the park escaping police attention, training police officers to deal with these prisoners, judges in their leisure time, among many other things. It was a very strong and deeply moving film. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I had with this was its realism. Policemen are often seen holding their pistols as if they were seven years old with a plastic toy (for example, an elbow bent at 90 degrees when pointing a gun at someone's face or as a policeman makes it seem like it's hard to kick someone when re down, etc, etc ...). It begins as an honest and interesting attempt to capture a very critical state of political affairs. At the end of the film, the viewer is slowly reminded again and again of the director's and producers' prejudices. The antagonistic characters in the story begin as real real humans, and then slowly progress into stereotyped and objectifiable "forces of evil" to the end. The mistakes they make are stupid, the strength they demonstrate is unreal, and unlike the police, judges during this hearing are shown to make stupid and unreal mistakes, among many other things. <br /> <br /> The realism of the movie began to fall apart when it became apparent that this was just another blank check attempt to make the government look bad. And this comes from an anarchist. The scenes at the end began to be obscene, unreal and a thousand times more dramatic. Still, for the first part, promises a very touching storyline.
