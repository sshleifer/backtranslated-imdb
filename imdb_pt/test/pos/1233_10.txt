Hello all fans of Denver! <br /> <br /> I could not agree more with you! This show was so cool and beautiful, I watched it as a child in the late 80's. Among Denver are other favorites too, such as Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. I'm 24 now, but it's still one of my favorite shows and my favorite cartoon from the 80's. That brings back all the memories. The theme song was great too, I get creepy whenever I hear. It's sad that it lasted such a short time, but it remains a favorite. It's great that I'm not alone and that there are people out there who liked it too. This is one of the cartoons that I will keep for future generations. <br /> <br /> Viva Denver! :)
