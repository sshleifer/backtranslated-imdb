This, unfortunately, is a little-known movie ..... I say "unfortunately" because it's up there with the "classics" of the silent American screen! <br /> <br /> It's about a legend of a "ghost carriage" that travels all over the world, collecting the souls of those who died. Legend has it that the last person to die on New Year's Eve is doomed to drive the carriage for the next year. <br /> <br /> She brings to mind the sequel to "Phantom of the Future Still Coming" in Dicken's famous "Christmas Song." <br /> <br /> The double exposure effects of ghosts (especially when they interact with people "live") are EXCELLENT! <br /> <br /> If you love silent movies, you MUST see it; it will "wipe you out"!
