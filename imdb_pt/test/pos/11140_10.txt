I'm impressed by actress Bobbie Phillips and her excellent ability as an action star! This movie is driven by its wonderful acting and great ability to action. I'm a fan of science fiction, but I must say that this film exceeds most science fiction films in its cinematography and mainly is the use of an actress whose presence replaces the plot which is good but nothing new. Even though it seems that this movie was made for television, in my opinion it is better than most movies of the genre.
