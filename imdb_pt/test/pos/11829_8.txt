Interesting story and comprehensive treatment of racial discrimination, Son of the Gods is a bit too long and contains some Hammy acting, but overall remains a fascinating film. <br /> <br /> History of a Chinese pass as white (Rchard Barthelmess begins when Barthelmess leaves college after being insulted by a trio of brainless classmates. He embarks on a world tour to discover himself and ends up as secretary of a British playwright (Claude King) in Monte Carlo he meets the beautiful Alanna Wagner (Constance Bennett) and they fall in love.But when she discovers that he is Chinese, she gets furious at a memorable scene. Alanna enters a mental spiral and makes a few attempts to get in touch with Barthelmess.After her father dies, he takes over the business (banking?) And wears Chinese costumes as a symbol of his hatred of the race After a San Francisco detective tells him the truth about his birth, Barthelmess makes the decision to pay tribute to his Chinese father and mother. And I agree that a critic here has never seen this movie, wing nna declares her love for Sam before he tells her about his recent discovery. And that makes all the difference in this movie. <br/> <br/> Barthelmess and Bennett, each have some scenes in which they chew the scene, but overall this is a solid and interesting drama. Frank Albertson is good as the nice college classmate, Claude King is solid as the playwright Bathurst, Bess Flowers has a scene like an Indian Oklahoma, and E. Alyn Warren is the Chinese father, Dorothy Mathews is an unpleasant Alice. Not so good are Anders Randolf as Bennett's father and Mildred Van Dorn as Eileen. Note also the beautiful blonde to the right of Barthelmess at the roulette table. What a stupor who she was!
