The story was well written and interesting by itself. However, it is difficult for me to write the review of this movie without harming it. To avoid this, I will not tell the story here. <br /> <br /> I consider this film a good adaptation of Sarah Water's book, compared to the previous "Tipping the velvet". I read the book first and then watched the DVD later. The film retained most of the spirits of the main characters in the book. Of course, due to time constraints, the film in the last 30 minutes seemed to be in a hurry to cover part III of the book. So it was not possible to illustrate well the scene where everyone found themselves in the kitchen of Mr. Ibbs's house and after that (even the book seemed like a rush in that kitchen scene). Despite this, the film really did a good job representing the story. Really worth watching. It is not yet clear when BBC-America can broadcast this film. This is pity. <br /> <br /> PS: Noted that the ages of Maud and Sue were set at 20-21 instead of 17-18 in the book; the second is more reasonable, while the first is closer to the ages of the actresses.
