Not having seen the movie on its commercial debut, we just caught up with it via DVD. Hoping for the worst, "Hitch" proved to be a pleasant experience because of the three principles. Thanks to the direction of Andy Tenant, the film has an easy rhythm and, although predictable, the comedy has some moments of success. <br /> <br /> Hitch is a sort of "matchmaker" for losers like Albert, which is not exactly what one would consider a piece of. However, Albert is a genuine guy who, without some professional help, would go unnoticed by the same women he would like to take. Enter Hitch, to prepare him to overcome the obstacles he can not overcome, and though Albert is overweight and never able to master social graces, he conquers us because he is a real, in sharp contrast to all the phonemes that do the rounds in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> The basic mistake that most production designers make when preparing locations for Hollywood movies is how out of tune they are with reality. The apartments in which these characters are situated are so rare to discover that only by the magic of the films can these people live in places like these. Of course, most people in the film are dealing with fantasy, since most of the city's inhabitants would kill for spaces as fabulous as the ones they show in the movies, let alone those same people represented in the movie could not afford them. <br /> <br /> Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a disarming way of enchanting without doing much. The surprise of the film, however, is Kevin James, who like Albert being overweight, not only conquer us, but he proves he can keep up with his scenes with Mr. Smith. Eva Mendez is well as the main interest of Hitch. In smaller roles, we see Adam Arkin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappaport and Phillip Bosco, among others. <br /> <br /> "Hitch" is a fun movie to watch, thanks to the inspired direction of Andy Tenant.
