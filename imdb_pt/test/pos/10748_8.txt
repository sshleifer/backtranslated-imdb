I honestly do not know why so many people hate this movie, I always thought it was one of my absolute favorites. fighting with the tiger and his men swayed, fighting with pirates with axes swayed, any sketch with everyone trying to avoid each other in the house is pure genious ... ok then he did not have the final confrontation needed the manchus were very good. I give it 8/10.
