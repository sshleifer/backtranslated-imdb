I know what most people will think about this movie, even without seeing it ... 'The typical movie of a famous singer ... It will be a pink movie, a teen movie, it will be stupid ...' and other things like that ... And yes, it's ... I mean, it's a pink movie ... But, you know what? ... I LOVED IT. Seriously ... It's a very romantic movie ... I think all the girls in this world dreamed of something similar to the 'Popstar' plot ... You met your favorite singer, you met him as a person ... and you even have one romance with him ... right? ^^ I really enjoyed watching it ... Also, it's very funny ... I think the actors did a great job ... There are lots of love characters ... E, Aaron Carter (JD) is no exception ... To be honest, in the first five minutes of seeing him take action, I thought 'this is going to be awful' ... But then he surprised me very pleasantly ... < > <br /> Also, I must say that the musical performances in the film are GREAT! I especially loved the part where JD (Aaron) sings without music, (only with a guitar) a very beautiful song ... This guy is really talented ... Time will tell ... <br /> <br /> advice for you? ... Watch! Do not make a prejudice ;-)
