Thank you for making such a wonderful escape. This is what I love about movies. I am so impressed with the air, the way they were filmed and the time was so dynamically perfect with the music. I myself being a dancer, and having been part of many dance choreography films is usually chopped, sliced ​​and sometimes even to the beat ..... "Showgirls" the movie. The relationship between women has always been present in the movement. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the last one when it's standing still. I saw the movie before, a different version, and I did not like the husband more than the last time. I felt a little more sorry for him this time. This changes the way I feel about the female love birds. It's all so magical.
