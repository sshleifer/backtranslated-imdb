Shirley Knight plays Sara Ravenna, a Long Island housewife who runs away from marriage when she discovers she is pregnant. She plans to enter the heart of America and start over. Along the way, she picks up a friendly hitchhiker (James Caan) who calls herself 'Killer'. Soon she discovers that the good-natured 'Assassin' is indeed with brain problems and, in taking it, without knowing it, has assumed a great responsibility. The two heads to Nebraska, where Sara gets a job for Killer on a reptile farm. This is where Sara meets Gordon, a local cop, and soon things go terribly wrong for everyone. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful drama about people disconnected from society, alienated by the choices they make or the limits. imposed on them by others. Even with such a low budget and a very free attitude, the film is capable of capturing everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters. Shirley Knight has a complex and divergent role and there are moments of inspiring acting for her. One of my favorites is when she's on the phone, calling her home for her worried husband for the first time. It is a scene so tense at both ends, and in every little gesture and inflection of a word, so much about it is spoken with so little. Then comes the 'Killer' character played by James Caan. This character is unlike any I have ever seen, and he plays wonderfully. It is one of his best performances, since he is very restrained and moving. <br /> <br /> The way Coppola develops the characters using short flashbacks and dreamers is very clever, adding a fragmented kind of insight into all of this. Fast flashbacks, which are both graphic and contained, contrast well with the longer takes in some crucial scenes. In addition, as this film was filmed throughout the eastern United States, it offers an interesting and authentic view of America in the late 1960's. I have not seen many other films starring Knight, I I'm just familiar with her latest work on television, usually playing a law-abusing mother or a crazy old lady. It was great to see her so young, beautiful and so wonderfully subtle in this movie. It's also a shame that James Caan has been labeled as the 'tough guy' for the rest of his career because this film has evidenced that he is capable of much more than that.
