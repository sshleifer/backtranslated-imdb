I think Never Been Kissed was a totally awesome movie. The cast was very good and they acted very well. I really like Drew Barrymore and of course that was excellent for me. I was scared at first because it said it was not coming out on video. I'm glad it's because it's a really cool movie. Go see if you do not already have it!
