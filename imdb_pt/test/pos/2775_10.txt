Susie Q is an original and not like the other bad movies from Disney, *** a boy named Zach moves to a new town and has problems at school, he is a good basketball player. a girl in the 1950s died with her boyfriend when her car fell off a bridge. Susie (Amy Jo Johnson) of the power rangers - pink guard - is helping Zach as a ghost to get a necklace on the way he must explain to his sister about his ghost, and finally get that necklace, Susie returns to the bridge that she died and then she gets into her boyfriend's ghost car and they float up. Later, when he misses her, he meets a girl who looks like her. (Do you believe in reincarnation?) Susie Q is a good movie to see from time to time, but they barely give because Disney needs to fill everything with stupid movies and shows. <br /> <br /> 7/10
