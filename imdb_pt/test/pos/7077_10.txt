I saw this movie in September with my mother. I was expecting a good movie and saw a great movie. This is now my most treasured movie. He did not leave me after I left the theater. The situations in this movie reminded me of my late grandmother. Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger were equally incredible. This film made me realize how important the family relationship is. For rent. I can not recommend it enough.
