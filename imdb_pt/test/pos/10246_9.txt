A jewel of Japan, where so many of the best movies in the world are being made today. Stylistically, this is nothing special. It's just a simple drama (with some comic tones) about recognizable people about their lives. Yuko Tanaka, best known for playing the character Lady Eboshi on Princess Mononoke, plays a 50-year old spinster. She prides herself on her health by spending every morning in a vigorous workout while delivering milk up and down the steep hills of Nagasaki. After she finished with this part-time job, she regularly works as a clerk at a grocery store (called S-Mart, who made the Dark Army fan laugh). Along the milk route lives a 50-year-old man whose wife is dying. It turns out that the milk woman and the man, a child service worker, dated in high school, and each one apparently still has a crush on another. The film does have some important narrative problems. When the writer really wants the two unrequited lovers to unite, he uses an unbelievable technique of deus ex machina. The climatic sequence is also really forced. But most of the film is beautifully small and attentive to the two main characters, as well as many minor characters. The movie also has several subplots that seem to end up weighing the movie, but they never end up doing it. I think the best thing in the movie is Tanaka's touching performance as the lonely milk woman, who resigned herself to being alone for the rest of her life. Whatever the problems, the film transcends them mainly.
