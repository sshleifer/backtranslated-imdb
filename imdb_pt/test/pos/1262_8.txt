This was a great movie because it was only 67 minutes long. There was a film-noir aspect contained in this film and I'm glad Nolan has chosen to film it in black and white. The plot is simple yet fun that keeps you engaged. Even the dialogue was good along with acting. It reminded me of what was to come in Memento because it was not in chronological order. I liked how the lead character tried to use what Cobb taught him, for example, by saying "everyone has a box" in which he put his personal stuff. In addition, at the door of the writer was the batman logo that looked ironic because Christopher Nolan later directed Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, two other great films. There's a big twist in the end that I will not ruin for anyone I have not seen, even though I kind of figured out what would happen when Cobb gave the young Lloyds credit card. I also liked how the writer had a copy of The Republic of Plato, one of my favorite philosophical books. This is definitely a movie that you need to watch more than once to get the full look of it, in addition to being only an hour long. There is also a circular aspect, ending where it began, which I found very bright.
