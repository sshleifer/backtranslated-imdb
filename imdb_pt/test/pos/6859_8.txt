I was going to use 'The German Scream' as a summary, but this was already taken lol. Resume anatomy well. As long as you're not oblivious to caption reading, Anatomy fits comfortably into the Scream / Urban Legend package. It is a teen terror set in a medical school where students are missing, then appear as experimental subjects in the dissection laboratory. A brave student investigating himself and discovering a giant conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Since you're watching the original German movie (I can not comment on the dub, having not seen the English edition). written and intelligently planned so that the tension will never disappear. In comparison to their American counterparts, the mystery is discovered much faster, which means that instead of being a slasher until the final revelation, Anatomy evolves during the running time of a slasher-come-body horror movie into a thriller intelligent and exciting. It's an exciting ride from start to finish. <br /> <br /> We took the hat to the actors involved too. Franka Potente proves once again that she is an intelligent and intelligent actress who can make any role come to life. Its central performance as Paula is a great base for the film to be built. The scary lecturers and their teachers are equally good, a truly sinister presence at all times. <br /> <br /> It's also surprising that the movie does not get in the way too much. The pace is fast and strong, much like the previous Urban Legend, which means there is always something going on to keep your attention high. If there is a downside, some will find Anatomy too horrible for them, but if you persevere through the admittedly graphic dissection sequences of the first half, the last half with your exciting thrones will reward you. I recommend Anatomy to anyone who likes good teenage terror, but is a bit tired with American opinion on the subject.
