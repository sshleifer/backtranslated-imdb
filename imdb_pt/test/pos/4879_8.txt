For those who have problems with naughty, crazy or troublesome children, this is an essential program to watch. It's just the best documentary program of behavior, not just for tips, but for transformations. The very attractive Jo Frost is Supernanny, with fifteen years of experience as a nanny, she now has a program where she shows a family where children are behaving very, very badly. Frost is the nanny who will not let the kids win. Each episode they have children who are crazy and very, very disobedient, for example throwing things, constantly cursing, beating relatives and parents and many other horrible experiences. But each episode at the end of the program children are transformed by parents (with the help of Frost) from small monsters into kind children. It's wonderful when the transformations are successful, Jo Frost is an excellent Supernanny. It was named the National Television Award by the Most Popular Program of Factual (twice). It was number 15 in The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. Very good!
