This movie is a hidden gem. I can not understand why this movie has no more airtime. Errol and Eleanor Parker make a really attractive and dashing couple. And their chemistry is impeccable. I really enjoyed the touch of his daughters referring to him as being his Robin Hood. I recommend this to anyone who likes Errol Flynn. It's nice to see Errol playing a father too. By all accounts of his own children, he was a very considerate and loving father in real life. Also, the support cast is wonderful as well. You can not go wrong with supporting players like Hattie McDaniel and Lucile Watson. Hattie McDaniel makes a much better film from the beginning. This movie has become a holiday tradition in my house. Appreciate!!!
