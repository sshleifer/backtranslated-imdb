Homegrown is one of those movies that kind of fell into the cracks, but deserves better. When I first saw it, I had a lukewarm reaction. But over time, it really grew in me - no pun intended ;-). The more I see, the more I appreciate it. Writing is high-level, just like acting. Play some surprising appearances and good direction, and you end up with a great movie. <br /> <br /> It's also good to finally see Hank Azaria get the chance to shine in a starring role. And Thornton offers its usual quality performance. Even newcomer Ryan Phillippe, playing an innocent friend with wit and subtlety. <br /> <br /> On a side note, Homegrown is simply a "must see" if you are a fan of Billy Bob Thornton. It seems that Stephen Gyllenhaal was influenced by earlier Thornton projects like One False Move and Sling Blade (though Homegrown is certainly far more ironic than either). And the role of Thornton as a character who is sophisticated and down to earth is a perfect match for the actor.
