What can I say?? This movie has everything ... Romance, break-ups, rich kids, punks and preps. This is my favorite movie of all time that I can recite line by line .... I remember when it came out, I was 14 years old and could not get in ... so I finally got to see it on the cable. I was trapped! I wanted to move to California and be a Valley girl .. (Hey, I even remember Moon Zappa's song, did not I?) In vain tried for years to get the never-produced soundtrack ... now you can find it, in rhinoceros discs ....
