"Nuovomondo" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories largely through dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually oriented. For all he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand up for themselves. Thus, he understands cinema as a medium that mainly tells his stories about the images on the screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young American American directors are heavily influenced by this). The contrary attitude of Crialese was really the point, which made this film special to me. He also has a very interesting topic that is wrapped in a rather unusual story and told with humor. Vincenzo Amato is notable as the head of the Salvatore family, as well as the incredible Charlotte Gainsbourg, whom I like to watch in each of his films. There are many great sequences in this movie. Just to choose one: when the ship leaves Italy and people just stare quietly. This scene is great, especially if you consider the accompanying pop cultural references (Titanic!).
