This has to be the funniest movie I've seen forever. Chritopher Guest is truly talented. He has a gift for humor. I almost burst out laughing. In fact, when I saw this in theaters, I considered leaving because the movie was so stupid. But it's dumb in a good way. It's funny-ass. And this is a very good combination. You'll be laughing from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> This mockumentary style movie follows a series of characters competing in the Kennel Club Dog Show. The cast includes Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Michael Michael Higgens, Michael McKean, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and more. <br /> <br /> This is a really funny movie that will make everyone laugh. Someone born without personality would laugh at this movie. It is presented in widescreen to give the picture that you are viewing a real documentary and that is probably what contributes to the joy. BEST IN SHOW: 5/5.
