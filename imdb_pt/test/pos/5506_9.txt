many people said that this movie was not a good movie, from a horror perspective I agree, it was not too scary, it had some terrible forms of torture yes (hooks going where they should not) but not scary. but it was a good movie from a comic point of view, I thought it was hilarious, so bad acting as a snider with his stupid theological questioning and every second word he said came out as "what is ____, define______," then the angry mob in his house with one of them holding a sign saying "we're not going to accept" (which is a song from his twisted sister band.but I think the part that made me laugh more was the wife of a guy who was dead and snider dee I was holding it and making it dance when I saw I burst into tears ... so I would not recommend this to avid lovers of terror, but for those who love horror for their comedy I recommend this movie 100%
