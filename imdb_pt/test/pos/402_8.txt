Better than the average World War II "who-dun-it" with Warner Baxter as an ex-gangster who suffered amnesia and was reborn as a psychiatrist now known as Robert Ordway, who helps both police and criminals who want to go straight. Crime Doctor's Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who may have some mental problems. The link to "courage" is not particularly clear. This entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter Gordon Carson, whose two previous wives have in mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions resembling suicide, but Dr. Ordway labels the murder. Hillary Brooke plays the widow Kathleen Carson, who is involved with Anthony Caruso - a mysterious Spanish dancer whose act includes her sister, who disappears onstage. As a mystery novelist, Jerome Cowan is a good supporting actor, as is Lloyd Corrigan as an amateur in crime. <br /> <br /> Scary houses with creaking doors, coffins in the basement and suspects that are never seen in daylight for the air of suspense. The scene of the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music is very good. Direction, production design and photography stand out. The outer plans and costumes suggest more affluence than usually found in the "B" detective thriller. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
