I really wanted to be able to give this movie a 10. I thought it was my favorite of the four modern live action movies from Batman to this day (and maybe it's still - I still have to watch the Schumacher movies). again). I'm also starting to worry if I'm somehow unconsciously being contrary. You see, I've always liked the Schumacher movies. As far as I remember, they were either 9s or 10s to me. But the conventional wisdom is that the two films directed by Tim Burton are far superior. I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time - I ended up giving a 7 - and I apologize as I could, I could not help but feel that Batman Returns has many minor problems of direction, plot and script scattered throughout to justify a 10. But Burton _almost_ overcomes the problems with sheer style strength, and although there are a lot of minor flaws, Batman Returns is still a great movie, especially if you're a fan of Burton, as Batman Returns has as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as with anything else in the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> The movie starts off strongly, with the Cobblepots having a baby. We see her dismay - people come out of the delivery room with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. Later, they have the baby in a small cage. Finally they take him for a night stroll and play him on the Gotham City River. The baby eventually becomes Batman's villain, The Penguin (Danny DeVito). Meanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the "evil capitalist" of the film, comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He is planning to cheat Gotham City in many ways, and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary, the timid Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but she is rescued by cats, becoming Catwoman. <br /> <br /> While all this is happening, The Penguin which has been around for a long time. There are rumors that it exists and whoever is considered dangerous, begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good boy, despite having motives less than benevolent, before returning to watch the Batman films of Burton. this time, I do not remember how little the films about Batman (Michael Keaton) are. It's almost as if Burton did not feel that the character was interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on the villains, especially the penguin. Batman does not appear very often, especially at the beginning of the movie, and surprisingly, we see him watching The Penguin. <br /> <br /> While some viewers necessarily consider the above problem as a flaw, I can say yes, even though I'd like to know more about Batman and follow his story further. The villain stories are also interesting, and as a "source story" for two great Batman villains, Batman Returns is already more than complex in terms of plot. <br /> <br /> However, there are some character problems that I reckon as a failure. Penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do what he says, but even though they're always on the screen, we can never learn anything about them. Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as Tod Browning's Freaks (1932), with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he simply does not have room to use them. <br /> <br /> matter, he hardly has room to explore Catwoman. The film plays as if the Catwoman had been so developed and appeared in as many scenes as The Penguin, but this cut of the film would have lasted 4 hours. So most of Catwoman's scenes had to be excised. Of course, all this hardly leaves room for Batman. Burton makes Batman very obscure in the eyes of the public in this film and, unusually, he never bothered to solve it. As far as we know, in the end, Gothamites still think Batman is a lunatic killer. This is an interesting development, but unfortunately ended up being discarded between this movie and the next. As for the script, although there are minor problems, including some non-sequences and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic, made by characters, it is clear that Burton and the writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story.Many of the dialogue is punctually oriented, but often this is quite subtle and / or complex (of course, sometimes it's very clear or transparent as well.) This helps look at Batman Returns as a more " poetic, "as I believe it was. This also translates into more general decisions about plot and direction - many strange actions, including minor characters, are made in the service of a general mood or style, and this style works a lot well. <br /> <br /> "Dark" is the easiest way to sum up Batman Returns in one word, and whether that is positive or negative depends on your disposition. <br /> <br /> Who knows me knows that I love the dark <br /> <br /> So, for me, Burton's style transcends in large part the shortcomings in the plot and the script. In many ways, Batman Returns is like an insane and extravagant horror movie with a wonderfully scary production design. Like Batman, Burton is still making many references to other films, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (well, there is still a slight reference to Star Wars), he invokes films like Nosferatu (1922) Max Schreck "was the name of the actor who played the character Dracula there), Motel Hell (1980), the previously mentioned Freaks, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal and somber edge) and zombie movies - more explicit in the final scene of The Penguin. In terms of visuals and general atmosphere - and this includes the general "feeling" of the story, the characters, and so on - could not be stronger.
