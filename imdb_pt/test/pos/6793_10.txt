This is the best movie if you want inspiration to follow your heart and never give up on your dream. Elizabeth Taylor is Velvet and at its peak (from her childhood at least), Mickey Rooney is a cynical friend who ends up becoming his coach and they depart for the Grand National National Stadium with their beloved horse "the Pi" - an abbreviation for " Pirate "- only for Velvet to become the jockey and have a chance to win. For those of you who have not yet seen, I will not give the ending, but you must see it, and when you do, you will love it. Notice a young Angela Lansbury as Velvet's older sister.
