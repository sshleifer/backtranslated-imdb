I think those who have been in a one-sided relationship of some sort before may be able to identify with the main character Minako (Yuko Tanaka), a 50-year-old woman who is still pink in good health as demonstrated by her diary. Shaking the waking routine extremely early in the morning to prepare for the milk delivery job, where she has to drag bottles of Megmilk in a bag on a route around her town like a clock, swap empty bottles for full bottles and collect payment and issue a receipt. And there's always that delivery stop at the top, needing to climb a long flight of stairs to achieve customer satisfaction. <br /> <br /> And peculiar enough, this stop was a parade to deliver a man with whom she has been in love with almost all her teens to adulthood, and not have the product appreciated, but poured into the sink . Having gone to the same school, we see that they are not talking to each other and, in their daily lives, seem to be so close physically but still so far apart. There is no visual contact, except for brief glances by chance and little recognition of each other's existence. We learn that they share a past that probably destroyed all notions of being together, where the clear attraction between the two was prevented from developing even further by the previous generation. While I thought Minako was an interesting woman in herself, someone who had kept her feelings suppressed for so long, one can only imagine what kind of harm it would cause. If I read that the original title in Japanese means "sometime in the days when you read books" and it takes, I felt that the film had a wonderful ending with the picture of the well-stocked bookcase, probably alluding to the fact that it did not she was alone afterwards and probably had relapsed on her crutch to deal with the pain of being alone, and back to a lifestyle she had been accustomed to 50 years ago. In addition to immersing herself in two jobs, she has those books that serve as a form of escapism, and occasionally channels sweet little details to radio music dedication shows. <br /> <br /> Yuko Tanaka did a commendable job as the emotionally. Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe) was a more interesting character who has more facets. Staying true to the marriage vows, he spends a significant amount of time on the screen taking care of his sick and bedridden wife (played by Akiko Nishina) while juggling his social work at the Department of Child Affairs at City Hall. I felt that as a childless couple, work gave him a means of caring, not for his own, but for the children of other people, the problematic ones who are neglected and left alone to defend themselves. In a rare moment of fury, we see how he angrily rebukes parents so disoriented that they do not appreciate and waste the lives of their children. The story of Kenji Aoki provides small quirks for his characters to be attractive and has successfully tried to provide much more glimpses and dimension in them too, such as Takanashi is a hopeless Haiku poet despite being a member of the Haiku club, and support such characters as the elderly couple from Minagawa, where Masao (Koichi Ueda) lent some comical moments though sad as he slowly became senile while wife Toshiko (Misako Watanabe) narrates and brings us through this love story of a single woman at age 50. Even Akiko Nishina's performance as the bedridden wife was nothing short of sweeping. enlightened state of knowing her husband's past and making altruistic and painful decisions in her unhealthy state. <br /> <br /> It's what you might expect from a typical Japanese, childless, nubile romantic movie with star-cross sed lovers, but with all the other elements in place, such as romantic montages, love songs and those exquisite but affectionate behavior par excellence. I thought the story was in danger of collapsing when unrequited love was consummated, but director Akira Ogata managed to avoid the usual melodramatic moments in such stories, although the story called for an obvious development of the plot in the final act. that you can predict, especially if you've already gone over your Romance Movie 101. Not being your mediocre story, I thought The Milkwoman told a strong story with an unrequited love as the central theme. and, frankly, a recommended romance movie (though counted at a measured pace), if you're in the mood for some bittersweet love, reminiscence and seeking to live without regrets.
