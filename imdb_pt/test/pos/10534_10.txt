Centurions are one of the best cartoons of all time and need to be put on TV and on the DVD so people can have younger generations enjoying such a good show that is way better than the crap they have done in the last 14 years . I have an online petition that is at the address of the website http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html I was originally trying to get this show on five days a week but now is trying to get this show on DVD since the TV station in which it has concentrated has bad public relations. We all need to convince people who own this show to put it on DVD so that it can be seen by future generations. Also since Hasbro Toys owns the toy line of this show, we can try to convince them to make a live action movie, as they did with Transformers and sometime this year G.I.Joe. We need good cartoons like this to come back and be appreciated by the younger generations. Please sign this petition so we can one day have DVDs of the guys who are famous for shouting "Power Extreme!"
