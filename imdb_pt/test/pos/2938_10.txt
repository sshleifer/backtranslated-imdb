As if reality shows like "American Idol" were not enough, in which judges like Simon Cowell throw sharp barbs at competitors trying to make their mark on the world of music - barbs that often reduced even incredible singers to tears after what was considered a "poor performance," now "America's Next Top Model" has over the last three years invaded the boob tube with its own version of "looking for the next big thing" in a business that values ​​superficiality, beauty concepts, and bodily dysmorphism. <br /> <br /> A concept created by Tyra Banks, who is also sworn in on the show, brings together about fifteen contestants from all walks of life and submits them to countless "tasks" that must prove their "talent" in front of camera and subject not only to the late Janice Dickinson (self-proclaimed "American's First Supermodel") but also to the naïve Jay Manuel and Nore Marin who can focus on one point a girl is not doing well and happily laughs her to pieces as if it was bad breakfast. Like many other reality-based shows, every week a contestant is eliminated and must pack up and leave immediately (one thing they are reminded of by Tyra each turn). Of course, there is the relentless tension between a number of Type A women, female bonds, tears, dramatic music waves at key moments, and some truly breathtaking photos that turn ordinary girls into unattainable goddesses. <br /> <br /> I'll have to admit, the show is a guilty pleasure. Maybe it's the state of mind I'm in, but I was wondering where the vomitorium was in cases where the already skinny girls would need to flip to make the cut and look at the way judges and photographers and many fickle designers would feel correct. for the moment. Even so, it drew me despite my previous paragraph, possibly because I've always had an interest in the fashion world and always loved seeing gorgeous women becoming even more disinterested in makeup and perfect lighting. But I wonder where they are going with these increasingly difficult photo shoots. It's like they're competing with "Fear Factor". Photos that look like scenes of fighting scenes in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, photographs where the models have to position themselves underwater or in almost impossible situations, What comes later: posing while stuck on train tracks when an Amtrak approaches . one hour? Or a filming in which they are underwater, chained, trying to break free in record time, and at the same time seeming to clash in chiffon, and never, ever forgetting to smile their white teeth on that camera? How about a "Pit and the Pendulum" version of a photo shoot? <br /> <br /> In one thing, the show has to be praised, and is somewhat similar to "American Idol." With that, I'll probably justify the roughness of both shows, and their abrasive judges - and essentially go against my opening paragraph. "America's Next Top Model" is a show that is an extensive audition, such as "American Idol," and in it girls will receive the kind of test treatment they will receive in the real world, where prospective designers and photographers, as monstrously fickle as they may be, will smash them to pieces in the fall of a hat, if they can not sell themselves the way they are expected, and where one is asked to leave, another will replace it with the necessary requirements. Which makes it a wonder any girl wants to get into such difficult media, but that's what dreams are made of. <br /> <br /> Going into its fifth season, has been a big disappointment with the departure of Janice Dickinson. ; during its execution, it was a rather difficult barometer on how girls should walk, talk, move, express themselves, and finally present themselves as a living and walking product that is sold. With Twiggy's cold addition, I wonder where he's going from here - Twiggy simply can not replace Dickinson's over-tempered temper. So with Janice's absence, the show has lost some of its edge and may even have signaled its slow death, but meanwhile it's still a contagious pleasure to watch, mindless entertainment at night during the week if it's by the visual gorgeous. If that's the case, it's the show that laid Adrienne Curry in the spotlight. Curry gained fame due to facts that have less to do with modeling than with his theatrical love affair with actor Christopher Knight of an era in his own reality novel.
