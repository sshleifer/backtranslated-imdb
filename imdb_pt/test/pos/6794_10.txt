This movie has no age and would probably please kids today, even if there is not a Jedi in the whole thing. Of course, Elizabeth Taylor was the most beautiful child in the world and her acting is also great. Even Mickey Rooney is good; so are Anne Revere and Angela Lansbury. The world was a different place when this movie was released, and it certainly is a great place to visit.
