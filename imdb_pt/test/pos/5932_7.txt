This Royal Rumble basically had the message of wrestling these days. Gimmick and image are more popular than wrestling ability. <br /> <br /> HBK vs. Edge. Very good game. Too much heat for Edge that was just starting as a jump again and what better way to get into a match with HBK. It's kind of a bit slower at the end than usual. Overall, this game gets a 6/10. Undertaker vs Hedinreich. It's not a good game. Undertaker had to take Hedinreich through this game that seemed to be really lost and spoiled his moves. It was interesting to see Raws Gene Snitsky and a little later Kane enters this match. Overall, fans seemed more interested when this game ended. 2/10 Kurt Angle vs. JBL vs. Big Show. This game was slow at first, but was very good at the end, when Angle was able to accelerate the game. Kurt Angle has done some good wrestling moves and proves that he is the best wrestler out of the game. JBL and Big Show make a slow game. The end of this game was bad. Throughout this game it was a 5/10 mainlly because of Kurt Angle. Randy Orton vs. HHH. Good game, amazing heat for Randy Orton, who was the guy in this match. Randy has proven that he can go to the limit with any top star. This game also marked the first game that HHH fought where someone did not run and saved him from a loss. About this game was about 6/10. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble match was OK. A few surprises. Some not so good surprises. I was a bit annoyed that Kurt Angle did not have enough time in this game. But all along this game had a guy that I never thought would be pushed so early. I will not tell you who wins. I give this match an 8/10
