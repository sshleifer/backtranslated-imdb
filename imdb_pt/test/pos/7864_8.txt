Combining the conventions of Western and Gothic horror, and often directed as if it were an art film, this is one of the best collaborations of Siegel and Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Eastwood plays a Yankee soldier who, after being injured during the Civil War, takes refuge in a secluded southern seminary for young women. Away from the world, women project their romantic fantasies to him, and he responds with an insensitive male manipulation. But jealousy and resentment raise their heads, and he finds himself in a world of brutal revenge. And the boy is brutal revenge. Beautifully filmed by Bruce Surtees, and carefully paced, "The Beguiled" is an astounding and elegant work that seems to have influenced the problematic sexuality of Eastwood's own "Play Misty." I "and" tightrope. "<br /> <br /> The film is an exhilarating representation of a fierce battle of the sexes and exudes a dreamlike mix of horror and sexuality.All characters are ambiguous, exhibiting traces of good and evil , leaving us the choice of whom we should twist. <br /> <br /> Don Siegel left a legacy of thin films backwards, all from "body thieves invading" to "Dirty Harry." But despite his first photos in black and white have aged well, most of their colored films seem grainy, dated, and poorly filmed. Their brave "realism" must have looked new and kinetic for 40 years, but when seen today, I do not think they have withstood the test of the time. <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled," however, is in a different league. Mature, ambiguous, and hard-fought, it's a pity that it's no longer widely known. have rendered obsolete the majority of male action shooters in Siegel's Asclepius, "The Beguiled" still draws the public today because of the surreal atmosphere and the unique subject. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10 - Better than the same theme "Black Narcissus", this is, in my opinion, the best Siegel film. "The Beguiled" is a surprisingly artistic film (especially when one considers that Siegel saw his films as being, cite, "nonsensical"). Much of the art of the film is due to Clint Eastwood, who, from there, will make an effort to choose a mature material.
