I have this movie in a collection of cheap B movies. Not restored, in fact, the audio was difficult to discern during the first few minutes. At first, it looked like a typical haunted house movie, and it looks a lot like Clue's forerunner, Murder. Death, House on Haunted Hill, etc. <br /> <br /> About half an hour after the movie, the plot gives a very interesting touch - and goes from a clich√© melodrama to something completely different, and so far more fun than I had initially thought. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it's a lot of fun, even if the longer clips and wider shots (and close to the lack of score) make it feel a bit chiary by today's standards.
