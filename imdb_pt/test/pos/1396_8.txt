When a group of fugitive convicts flee to a remote island, they soon discover that their new home is inhabited by a strangely threatening physician (Richard Johnson, famous for "Zombie 2"), a mad scientist (Joseph Cotten), his beautiful daughter . (Barbara Bach) and a horde of superstitious natives. Members of the tribe say that the doctor created grotesque semi-human creatures, half-fish for evil and secret purposes. And while prisoners do not believe it at first, as they disappear, on the one hand, they begin to change their minds. "Screamers" is a very entertaining mix of "Mysterious Island" and "Humanoids from the Deep". There's a lot of horrible stuff with really nice decapitation scenes and tearing throat to increase. more or less, but the film is fast and fun. Give it a look. 8 out of 10.
