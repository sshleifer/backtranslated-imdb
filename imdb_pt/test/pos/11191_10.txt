The first time I saw this was at a friends house. He ended up in the hands of his parents by chance; any videostore / bike repair store !! failed and deals like this was in dispute. We've seen it twice in a row and almost wet are the pants with which we laugh. <br /> <br /> I've seen historical documents like Ninja Mission and Plan 9 from the Outer Space, and they're still good runners in comparison to this. <br /> <br /> Almost 15 years after the first contact, it is considered the best cult film of all time (in my circles); I have shown this to all my friends ... Now we have a tradition of looking for movies in the same category: the non-ratifiable. <br /> <br /> Can not be explained or revised in any category. normal, because every scene, every shot, every move, contains at least one mistake about editing, dialing, directing etc. For any cult movie fan this is the ultimate prize, the gem of all Raiting Gems: As for craftsmanship, it can not be rated because it would even be an insult to the home videos of birthdays and weddings. <br /> <br /> As for the fun, it's the funniest movie I've ever seen; more funny than any comedy ever before or present. Anything less than a 10/10 should be considered an insult to hum's good sense.
