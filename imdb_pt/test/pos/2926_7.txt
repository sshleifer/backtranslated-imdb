Although this episode was offensive to the Tourette Syndrome Association, others found it funny, while others thought it was a bad way to start the new season. <br /> <br /> This episode was funny and shocking. South Park made history as being its first episode with the most bad words, unless you count the movie as an episode. <br /> <br /> I liked how they mocked Chris Hansen and his television show, for Catch the Predator. I did not like the idea of ​​how they thought Chris Hansen would do a show in tourettes and let a kid talk and criticize the Jews. <br /> <br /> One thing I did not like was how South Park thought that people with tourettes syndrome would just let out a bad language like that. I've seen people on television with Tourettes syndrome and they do not just let swearing. Unless I'm wrong.
