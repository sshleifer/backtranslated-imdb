I remember seeing this movie in the mid-80's, which was a well-paced and well-represented piece. I now work quite often in Berkeley Square and had to pick up a copy of the DVD to remind myself how the area has changed little, even though my office is new just 30 seconds away from the "bench." Even the car dealer Jack Barclays is still there selling Bentleys and Rolls Royces. <br /> <br /> It looks like the DVD is about to be released soon in Region 2. The copy of Region 1 is of very poor quality. Let's hope they have cleaned. <br /> <br /> Only the somewhat suspicious escape sequence on the block spoils what would be a great movie, but I think it's in line with the movie tag.
