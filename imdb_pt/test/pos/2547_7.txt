Some critics have compared the Chop Shop to the theatrical releases of City of God and Pixote. I have seen both as well as Chop Shop and as in many cases I do not feel the comparison is justified. Cidade de Deus and Pixote certainly had a much bigger budget. Chop Shop is an independent low-budget film about survival and hope, disappointment and carry on with life. One of the scenes is supposedly filmed during the US Open and the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the US open footage was added. I say this because I live in the area where this movie was filmed and the safety is insane while the tennis matches are underway. It is also noteworthy that the real names of the actors were the names of their characters in the film. Back to the movie. It's a nice story about survival. However, he ended up getting a 7 because ... sometimes the actors acted very well. At other times, they seemed to be just reciting their lines. If the actors were less competent (as in the low budget "The Big Dis", for example), it would have been more forgiving. But in several scenes each and every one of these actors gave exemplary performances. At other times, they seemed bored. The director may be missing here. I also had problems with the ending. This is one of those movies that "ends". Maybe there's a part 2? Definitely worth getting on DVD. I will not bother to summarize the story because this information is already available on IMDb.
