I found it lovely! No one but Kiarostami can do so little and yet achieve so much. You may think I'm weird, but I was so delighted I could not speak during the movie. While during other films I comment a lot. The short film he made for Lumiere et Companie, the one with the eggs, that's unbeatable in my heart, but that's wonderful too. I liked it more than ten. Kiarostami is perhaps the best director in my opinion because he can see things! He does not have to use many "brought from home" things to illustrate his images, he simply picks up a camera. Not many can do this .. Maybe I do not know much about movies, but I do not care about complicated things, all one has to do is touch my soul. Kiarostami does.
