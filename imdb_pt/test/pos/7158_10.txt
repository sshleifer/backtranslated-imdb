I saw forgiving the Franklins at a Paramount screening and I loved it I have to be honest I really did not want to go and I became pretty tired with the movies being made today I have to tell you Forgive The Franklins were fresh and beautifully put together I laughs, it was a great story saying that I could not believe two guys shot it and put it all together. I thought if these guys could make a movie like that with this budget, imagine what they could do with a lot of money behind them. And then I thought I was the tired guy the studios would probably do anyway. Having said that, thanks to you I got lost and in your movie and that's why I go to the movies to forget the world for a few hours.
