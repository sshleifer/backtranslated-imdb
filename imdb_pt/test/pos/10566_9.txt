BBC 3-hour adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel ... "Fingersmith". Life is hard without money, especially in London Dickensian. The dark acts lead to contemptible dilemmas. Is love really just a luxury for the rich and free? Elaine Cassidy as "Maud Lilly" and Sally Hawkins as "Sue Trinder" both give fantastic performances as the top ladies asking this question ... FROM YOUR ... while Rupert Evans shines like the delightfully "Gentleman" .. with great support from "Mrs. Sucksby" by Imelda Staunton, "Mr Ibbs" by David Troughton and "Uncle" by Charles Dance. The twist and twists and I was not sure if I could be made to care about characters capable of hurting and using each other that way ... but somehow ... I care ... and this because of the quality of the performances ... love looks like love ... hate like hate ... betrayal .. confusion .. well hope you have the idea and hope you get the DVD and enjoy yourself. (Elaine Cassidy is great at it .. beautiful actually .... I have to declare that I'm in her fan club ... Hi Elaine :)
