Not surprisingly, Larisa Shepitko was married to Elem Klimov, who later directed the most distressing war film of all time, 'Come and See (1985)'. 'The Ascent (1977)'? The last Shepikto movie before an untimely death? is built in much the same mold. Defined during World War II, the film follows a pair of Soviet partisans who try to secure food for their hungry army, while avoiding the occupying German forces. The first forty minutes are agonizingly tense as the two men crawl through the rugged, snow-covered landscape, the world around them utterly drained of life, warmth, and color (in fact, monotonously monotonous it is the setting that literally took me a long time to realize that the film was filmed in black and white). After the capture of the partisans by the German soldiers, the film becomes a cold meditation on loyalty and morality. While Sotnikov (Boris Plotnikov) refuses to betray his army, even under extreme pressure, the less resolute Ryback (Vladimir Gostyukhin) tries to save himself. Is he wrong to do that? Ryback's betrayal is discouraging, but the film does not immediately condemn his actions are treacherous; instead, the viewer is forced to consider what his response would be in such a situation. Shepitko pities Ryback as the Bible pities Judas. Both men betrayed their allies to the enemy and were forced to see them executed. However, while Judas committed suicide by hanging (at least according to Matthew's Gospel), does Ryback even find that option closed to him? in a painfully tense climax, the belt around his neck loosens. <br /> <br /> "Ascent" takes its emotional power from Shepitko's astonishing quest for realism. I have no doubt that the two main actors spent days on end climbing the snow-covered land, and in fact, so convincing is their misery that I actually developed a chill while watching the movie (seriously, I did). Curiously, the film intrudes on this reality on several occasions, while Ryback imagines himself making an attempt at freedom, and then being shot down by his German captors. This device, though unusual, works well with its biblical allegory; Ryback is facing a test of his dignity and, faced with a new dilemma at every step, he consistently chooses the selfish alternative, his own life, the only decisive criterion. At the end of the film, he is still alive, but the nightmare of war and guilt persists.
