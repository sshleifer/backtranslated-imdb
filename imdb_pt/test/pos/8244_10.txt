I have to say that I know the documentaries of Mister Ã–rnek and then I knew that I would get a documentary very well done. I was not dissapointed. As a history nerd - I've seen hundreds of documentaries and enjoyed the different approach of this work. <br /> <br /> The director and his 17 consultants (historians, veteran families) tried to access the reality of the gallipoli through the letters of welds on both sides. Thus the story is followed by British, Australian and Turkish soldiers. Narrated is this document by Jeremy Irons and Sam Neill - both increase the intensity and the emotionality of this documentary by its great voices. <BR> I saw this movie in a theater in Italy in Dolby Surround. I bought the DVD last year and will wait again 3-7 years for the next work of this talented director and his very good documentaries. <br /> <br /> Summary: Well done. Intense. Story with emotions - wrapped in a war documentary with great storytellers
