very good, do not expect anything of high culture ....... the acting is bad, the plot fails, but it's still a pretty good movie to watch. because? because it's dark, a bit stupid, as unpredictable and just fun and fun to watch. Do not expect anything, like I said, just see for yourself and you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> It's a movie, without plot or memorable acting, but there are enough scenes that will make you laugh, cry or at least make you feel obligated to watch it to the end ... <br /> <br /> That's all I wanted to say .... <br /> <br /> 7/10
