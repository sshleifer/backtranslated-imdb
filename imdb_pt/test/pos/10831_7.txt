It's war drama - WWII, with French and Jews and Germans, but this is somehow fun, honestly. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau co-wrote the screenplay for his well-received film "Bon Voyage" (2003). Unlike "Safe Conduct" ("Laissez-passer") by director Bertrand Tavernier (2002), "Gloomy Sunday" by Rolf Schubel (1999), or "Lucie Aubrac" by Claude Berri (1997), "Bon Voyage" as clever as the title sounds - c'est la vie (whatever) - and we have the beautiful talented Isabelle Adjani to thank. It's his delightful performance everywhere as the center of attraction (and attention), the cause and effect of it all, which made the film as enjoyable as it is. Hell, which is another derailment of his plan and expectations - will worry about that at another time. The backbone of the story revolves around two young enthusiasts: Grégori Derangère as Frédéric and Virginie Ledoyen (from "8 Women" by Francois Ozon) as Camille. The incomparable Gérard Depardieu, the spirited Yvan Attal (from "My Wife is an Actress") and the versatile Peter Coyote (Juggling with French, English and German here) are some of the stellar cast involved. <br /> <br /> There are many characters coming and going in this movie plot, and as everything is juggling is a skillful talent that does not require analysis - Rappeneau is simply a genius. The story builds on itself, one episode after another, or even with overlapping but never confusing events - that's the pleasure of it all, somehow, all the details appear on the screen and we just lick everything up like a French presentation . dessert, literally like that. There are emotions, trills, moments of hesitation and sinister fugues, all in front of our eyes. <br /> <br /> From the reading of the Director's Note on the official Bon Voyage website of Sony Pictures Classics, Rappeneau pointed out that this is his most personal and successful work ever. Portraying Bordeaux 1940 from memories of his childhood years is very close to his heart and he "worked and reformulated the script for almost 3 years." This film is a work of love, the cast and crew complement the director's passion and a formidable screenplay of collaborative writers, along with the director and his son Julien - adaptation efforts of Gilles Marchand, Patrick Modiano and Jérôme Tonnerre. <Br> Gabriel Yared's music (varied in tone from his earlier film scores such as "The English Patient" or "Talented Mr. Ripley"), which provided an appropriate theme that kept pace and rhythm of the plot - almost like a train going on and on, reflecting the lively energy of Viviane de Adjani (even when she is tired), keeping her moving when she finds what is coming, walking with her head upright and elegant without looking back, much less time for regrets. <br /> <br /> Oh, I can not forget the beautifully translated and skilled subtitles of Ian Burley, who also made captions for Italian films: "Bread and Tulips" (2000), also known as "Pane and tulipani" "The Last Kiss". "(2001) also known as L'ultimo bacio, and" Heaven "by Tom Tykwer (2002). If you find this very light a relationship drama of war, try" Aimée and Jaguar " of Mäx Fäberböck (1999, in German, based on a true story) with brilliant performances by Juliane Köhler as Aimée and Maria Schrader as Jaguar.
