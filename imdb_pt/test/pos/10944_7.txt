Well, do not expect anything deep and meaningful. Most of the fighting scenes are pretty decent. The two main ladies are quite captivating, but the lack of HK action fund shows at times. The ending may be missing something, but I liked it a lot less. The extravagant humor will probably not please anyone who has not watched a lot of HK movies, but if you have that kind of thing and you have a few hours to fill in something meaningless, you can do a lot worse than that. (OK then you could do better, but .......) Certainly on an equal footing with most of Hollywood's blockbuster action dribble. <br /> <br /> 7/10
