The best part about this movie is that you can watch it over and over again and still not be happy to watch it. I've watched this movie at least 10 times in the last 12 years and it still makes me laugh like I'm watching it for the first time. I really like good comics like Orgazmo, Cheech n Chong, Monty Python and many others, but this one in Hindi is one of my favorite movies. Some of them recently in Hindi are the Golmaal, Munnabhai and Herapheri series. So all I can say is that the Hind comedy is finally evolving. But Andaaz Apna Apna is quite different from the movies I said above. It's what I call Hindi comedy and very little of the type found around 1994 in Hindi cinema. For Rajkumar Santoshi, the brilliant film.
