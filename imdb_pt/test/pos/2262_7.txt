Everything Is Illuminated A young Jewish American looks for the woman who helped her grandfather escape the Nazi persecution while embarking on an inter-European tour with some unlikely associates. <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber makes his directorial debut with a playful anguish usually associated with his acting ethos. When successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair, we usually get a biographical glimpse of souls under the acting mask. We usually get a mix of genres - check. But what we usually do not get is an insightful original film that is believable, intelligent and moving. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, an inquisitive kid who collects bits of life as he goes. He is on a mission to find a woman in a photograph. The sepia photo brings his grandfather (a strange resemblance to him) and the woman. To aid in his journey, he relies on the help of travel guides who are part of an amateur dancer, Alex (Eugene Hutz), his apathetic, perennial grandfather (Boris Leskin) and his dog - Sammy Davis Junior Jr! What follows is essentially a comedy. There is an introduction without simple parenting with voice-overs. Alex is especially funny when he educates his younger brother in the year 1969, proving how popular he is with the girls and the dance break, which puts him as the antithesis of Jonathan. <br/> <br/> Schreiber begins to break the characters as they progress and the comedy acts as an intentional veil for what is a story about three people connected to the holocaust who are not really known. All three hold the film with tenderness and authenticity, something that Schreiber probably does not miss and is as charming and fantastic as the movie, the horrors that are allowed, ie the past are presented in an almost palatable tone (incidental music, cinematography ). ) that make them even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> As the unlikely group finally finds the city they are looking for, they discover the real atrocities that have occurred and discover a lot about who they really are. <br /> <br /> Elijah's wood is as authentic as usual, bringing his innocence and strength to the screen. Formally a good resident in The Lord of the Rings and an evil resident in Sin City, he plays Jonathan with ease as he is bombarded by cultural clashes and a quest for truth. Boris Leskin as the grandfather also delivers his anguish and frustration to young people with great humor and conviction as his own past is unraveled. However, it's Eugene Hutz as Alex who does the show. The director used this old trade of translation misunderstandings to create and maintain a humor that is really funny and not enigmatic. <br/> <br/> Schreiber made a charming debut that has both heart and soul. Continuous punctuation and beautiful photography create a fairytale haze around a story about identity, truth, and family. If there was a complaint, it would be the speed at which the film changes direction; although this may have been intentional, may not work well for everyone. However, this is an excellent effort that offers great comedy and connection between an unlikely group while dissecting another aspect of the horrors of World War II in a whole new way. <br /> <br /> -Chi e Ojo
