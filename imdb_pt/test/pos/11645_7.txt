Before watching this movie, I suggest that the viewer eliminate any expectation that the victims of the crimes represented will receive equal treatment and consideration from the perpetrator. There have been many films about crime victims. This is about the killer. <br /> <br /> "Dead Man Walking" finds realism in the simplicity of the story: there are no crack lawyers coming to save William Poncelet and no dramatic turnaround. The film does not try to put it in a good light; he is guilty, disgusting, racist and responsible for heinous murders. Given all this, we are asked to do something very difficult: look at him as a human being, despite his crimes. In this way, the film defies the notion that the death penalty provides "justice." Whether you are for or against the death penalty, the film raises questions about whether the culprits can find redemption, inequality in the justice system and the adequacy of the death penalty. <br /> <br /> Great performances by Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. In particular, the last moments of the film show the true depth of Penn's skill.
