If you are a child of the 80's and did not see this movie, you could not be a true son of the 80's. How can you not love those big squirrels (do not forget the chippettes), lines and songs. Years later I can still sing every word for every song. The plot is great and way better than the movies for kids today. It's pure fun and worth the rent, even if you're grown up.
