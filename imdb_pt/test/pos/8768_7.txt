Hitchcock's excellent thriller with Robert Cummings, proving once again that he could really make a storm. This time he is a worker at a defense factory, caught in a horrible plot when his best friend is killed in the factory. <br /> <br /> Priscilla Lane is the girl who suddenly cares about Cummings as the plot thickens and he is hunted from California to New York <br /> <br /> There is a diabolical plot of a group of the 5th. columnists to destroy from within. Hitchcock was known for representing the top echelons of society involved in the chaos in his long career as a director. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the movie implodes in the end. While we see what happens to the guy who killed Cummings' friend, we do not see what happens to the rest of the class again, many of whom represent the upper strata of society.
