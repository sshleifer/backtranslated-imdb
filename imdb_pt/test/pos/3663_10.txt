I loved this movie, which I just saw at the Philadelphia Film Festival. In March of 2005 I went to India with two friends, and this movie was very real. I connected with everything and relished every moment. The characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the screening. This film shows very well the blend, but not the complete blend of two worlds (East and West). The support cast was wonderful, portraying the life a tourist finds in India in a very realistic way. The humor is subtle and sometimes dry, which makes it even more realistic, as it is present in the daily adventures of the characters. It is so easy to identify with each of the situations portrayed.
