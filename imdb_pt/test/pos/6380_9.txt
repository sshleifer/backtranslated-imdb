For all intents and purposes, 'Devian Teen' may seem like just another lightweight Bollywood musical. To some extent, this may even be true, especially as producers had to be sure that the film would succeed with the masses. But somewhere behind the scenes, Sadashiv Brahmam (who had the "idea" for this story) or Amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that there would be a reversal in the usual formula and perhaps even surpassed his own expectations. It's not just a handsome man flirting with three women, indecisive about whom to choose as a partner in his life. Dev Anand's character was really in love with each of the three women at various times, and they were with him, even though they were aware of the other two. Dev Anand's relationship with Simi and Kalpana is particularly interesting - in which each of the women depends heavily on him. There are many teasers suggestive in the body language of stars that lend themselves to the imagination depending on the maturity of the viewer. The theme is surprisingly adult, and after all, it was as if the ending was tame, obviously designed to please the masses and divert criticism.
