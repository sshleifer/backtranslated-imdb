This movie has it all: fully-developed characters, a realistic portrait of Washington's hot-bathed and humorous work that is exclusively Albert Brooks. The dumbing down of network news is even more of a problem now than it was in 1987. Remember, this was pre-cable! So satisfying to worry about complex people trying to achieve complex goals - and everything moves along with the speed of light. A representation so true to the life of friendships that swing toward romance. See if you can identify John Cusack as the angry messenger! And do you recognize Peter Hackes from real-life Broadcast News? Finally, if you are from DC, see if you agree with Holly Hunter's instructions for taxi drivers!
