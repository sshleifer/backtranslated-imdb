It seems everyone did not like Steven Seagal: Just take a look at his list of nominations, there are only indications to the razzie prize (with a win) for him, but I think he did not win anything. I've seen good movies with Steven Seagal, I've seen bad movies with Steven Seagal. AND THE PATRIOT (1998) is one of his best films, almost as good as UNDER SIEGE (1992) or HARD TO KILL (1990). PATRIOT shows your activities to protect nature. Of course, this movie is not great, and I must say there is more violence than I like, and why should Seagal's best friend, L. Q. Jones, die of the victim? Dr. McClaren's role is one of Seagal's best performances. He has, as always, a very good charisma. And, in summary, THE PATRIOT is a good entertainment - and with an average rating of only 4 points, the most underrated film of all time. <br /> <br /> Regards, Hans-Dieter
