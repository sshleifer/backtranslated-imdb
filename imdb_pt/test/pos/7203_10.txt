I loved this movie, the audience I was part of loved this movie, and the 7 year old girl who was with me loved this movie. We all laughed at the puns, the visual humor and the good feeling that you left the movie when it was over. I could easily see why it was a huge blockbuster in France. I'm thinking of buying the DVD so I can watch it again and laugh at all the things I missed when I was laughing so much the first time.
