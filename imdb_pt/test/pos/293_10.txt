I would like to present the following disdain. <br /> <br /> During the bridge scene, soldiers are seen struggling in the river, begging to be taken and trying to escape. Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and try to board the suitcases. Soldiers are not issued or carry suitcases in a combat zone. They have backpacks, backpacks and trunks, but no suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of order. Also, if you look closely, you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water. This is probably a very good indication that it is empty, otherwise it would sink.
