Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible Scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Villains chilling, villainous villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie may be the best 30 minutes ever recorded, especially in the scene where decent, hard-working citizens chafe the chains across the street, knocking down the evil motorcyclists and shooting them just to join them. the children of the neighborhood (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the old woman with the broom? She's sweeping the scum! And if that is not enough, let's not forget how quickly punks quit after Fraker is killed. I'm laughing just thinking about it. <br /> <br /> I also love the death scene of Kersey's girlfriend. He just walks away after seeing her explode. It's little things like this that make Death Wish 3 such a bad movie. And I'm not even mentioning the bizarre soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because of Martin Balsam, who I seriously think is one of the best actors of all time (and who is himself "being beaten by the scum" scene is hilarious "and I <br /> <br /> A few other things I forgot to mention: 1.

"And Mandy has a phone line running in an abandoned building. 4. At the end of the movie, after Kersey explodes Fraker: It's just me, or it looks like the street gang is about to get into a choreography when they Are they giving up? Just notice how they are synchronized after the female punk gives the "stop" sign. /> <br /> I love this movie. Nothing cheers me up like Death Wish 3!
