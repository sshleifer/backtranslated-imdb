This film was made just 48 years after the end of the Civil War - probably in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. In the movie there are recreations of battles and people of the era that look quite impressive and realistic. It also provides a different and more balanced view than just his contemporary, BIRTH OF A NATION - a patently absurd and racist film. Because of this, this short film would be great to use in class to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man who flees to enlist as a drummer. The boy is good and a hero, although the film ends a bit melodramatically - a definite convention of the day. It's not a great movie, but a decent storyline, decent acting and little exaggerated acting that you used to see in other movies of the day. <br /> <br /> One annoying aspect of this film was the frequent use of title cards to describe or prepare the ground for things that were really obvious. It got boring from time to time.
