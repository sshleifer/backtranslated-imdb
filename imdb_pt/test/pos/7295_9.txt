One of the Message Boards topics on IMDb had two women talking about Colin Firth, how they watched the movie just because of him. Obviously, these were two young women; but what impressed me is how little this movie was appreciated by the general public. The brilliant brilliant interpretations of Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange were hardly noticed, not only by the public, but by the Academy and most critics. <br /> <br /> I think I know why. First, the plot - or, in fact, only the montage - is a sort of bastardization of Shakespeare's King Lear with the dying patriarch and the three intriguing daughters who will inherit. Their names begin with the same letters, Regan, Goneril and Cordelia - Rose, Ginny and Caroline. And I think "Larry" (Jason Robards) works for "Lear". The apparent idea envisioned by Jane Smiley in her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was to tell a story similar to Lear from the daughters' point of view, and tell a sort of realistic twentieth-century medium not considered by the bard. The problem is that in the story of Smiley and Moorhouse, the two oldest daughters are very human, with strengths and weaknesses, while the father is a very despicable character, without much ability to redeem qualities. His only strength was his ability to gain financial success on the farm; however, we may even disregard this since his father and grandfather before him built the farm and he inherited it. <br /> <br /> The second problem - and this is one that I can not personally vouch for, have not read Smiley's novel. - is that the film is only a limited and partial interpretation of this novel. Still, it is almost always the case of an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious, with many psychological nuances, which can not be faithfully transferred to the canvas. The film's vision and audio requirements stifle the subtleties of a narration, while time constraints do not allow for the full development of character and motivation achieved by the novelist. Given five or six hours, maybe Moorhouse could have made one more film according to Smiley's novel. <br /> <br /> A third problem is one that may only be of Moorhouse. She began her directing career with the very well-made film Aussie Proof (1991), starring Russell Crowe. She follows up with How to Make an American Quilt (1995), which celebrated women, especially women of a certain age. However, it was a bit heavy and clearly and decidedly a girl's movie. In a way, A Thousand Hesus leaves, showing us not just the point of view of women, but does so in a way that may seem politically motivated to some. Larry Cook is clearly a bad and bad parent. He beat his daughters and he had carnal knowledge of them. He ran the house with an iron fist. Jess (character of Colin Firth) seduces the inexperienced Gina and breaks her heart for nothing more than a little fun. And then he goes to Rose who will clearly be the power behind the new property, and connects with her while incidentally inducing her husband to end his life in a drunken accident. The rest of the men are one-dimensional characters, without nuances, as they often appear in novels. I think most of the hearings have been delayed by the heavy incest, adultery and sexual betrayal that has been woven into history. <br /> <br /> That said, I think the critics and the public are wrong. I think the direction was biased against men, but in that story it had to be. I think Moorhouse did a great job of making an emotional and engaging movie about family dynamics that was not at all pretty. And the performance of Pfeiffer and Lange was nothing short of sensational. They seemed to feed each other in a way that I found to be absolutely authentic and profoundly moving. In particular, Pfeiffer was fascinating in projecting his rage and contorted hatred. The way Moorhouse allowed her character to reveal us gradually is a tribute to her ability as a director as well as to Pfeiffer's outstanding performance. And the ability with which Moorhouse guided the change in Ginny's character when she came out of a "fool," as she was called, to someone with self-awareness and some understandable bitterness, was also excellent. The fact that she had left her husband was as shameful as anything else. He needed to go get her and forgive her and bring her back. And Robards in their intensity and madness was also very good. <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie, which bombarded theaters, will be better appreciated in the coming years as people see it on DVD. My question is: what happened to Moorhouse? Her talent is obvious, but she has not yet directed her fourth feature film. When she does, I hope she remembers to go with what she believes, but also to be fair. I think, in fact, she was fair to the two protagonists of this movie, but did not pay enough attention to others. In addition to the naked father, Jennifer Jason Leigh's Caroline was unfinished, leaving us to think about why she did some of the things she did. And husbands needed to be more than dummies. They needed to be involved and involved.
