The funniest performance was made by Shalom Harlow, as Matt Dillon's supermodel girlfriend. She was more interesting to me than all the main actors. This movie got it all wrong; even the most reliable actress of the century, Joan Cusask, was not able to stand on the ridicule of the plot. I enjoyed listening to "Village Man" from Village People on the final credits. The rest of the film could have been tolerable if it had reached that level of energy.
