I admit that this movie was horrible, extravagant, sexist, poorly dubbed and poorly edited, but I loved it anyway. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 14, and it has stayed with me ever since. FYI, this is very close to hard-core porn, as I recall. Certainly my fluids began to flow. This film gives a new meaning to Swedish eroticism. It is a humorous view of human sexuality seen by extravagant and extraterrestrial females who, in my opinion, are just looking for some sperm for their dying race.
