I can not believe I liked it as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than even, but the binding story and its surprise ending deceived me. A lot of familiar faces will keep you wondering "where have I seen before?" Forget the runtime listed on New Line tape, this is not 103 minutes, according to my VCR and IMDB timer. The Space Mage clears the bonfire in its own special way and raises it to an 8.
