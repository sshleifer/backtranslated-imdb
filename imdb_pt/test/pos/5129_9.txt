I thought this was a really great movie, especially because it was the best for me. I was bored, I picked up the library and I really had fun! I watched it twice in the two days and the more I watch, the more I like it. I thought the plot would be really tacky, but in the end it really could be said that it would be true. I liked the main characters and thought they were well cast and you could see true friendship. I thought they all did a great job. The end was good. And you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good guys. What is the purpose of a movie.
