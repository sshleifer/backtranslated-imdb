"Zen and the Art of Lanscaping," written and directed by David Kartch, is a short film about a young man named David (his friends call him Zen) and what happens on a strange day of his life. Zen works as a lanscaper for a upper middle-class family. The housekeeper tries to get Zen to help her betray her husband. Unfortunately, her son passes them instead of her husband. From this point, the film begins to accelerate many revelations between the characters, along with the eventual involvement of the man of the house. "Zen and the art of landscaping" is witty, intelligent and overall very well written. The comic timing of the actors is also very strong. It's a light and fun movie that I highly recommend.
