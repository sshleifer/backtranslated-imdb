Harvey Keitel performs typically in one of his earliest roles as young, daring, ambitious and uncompromising staff member Coleman Buckmaster, a gifted talented "gold ear" and the son of a famous jazz pianist. to boot. Coleman is eager to cut some tracks with the group's R & B group (none other than Earth, Wind & Fire in his vigorous funky prime), but his rigidly commercial A-Chord Records label runs through Jerry (a Edison appropriately unprepared) wants him to record a hit single for the poppy trio of Pages, a supposedly sarcastic group that includes pedophile Franklin (a villain perfectly Bert Parks), neurotic and malevolent daughter Velor (a beautiful and lively bitch from brunette Cynthia Bostwick) and the hooked hedonist Gary (formerly a 50s youth participant Jimmy Boyd). The extremely naive and idealistic Coleman must quickly learn how the music business really works and play the dirty game in the best possible way, or else it will lose the Group and its credibility. Adopting an acrid, incisive, corrosively harsh and insensitive script by columnist and journalist Robert Lipsyte, director Sig Shore (who is most famous for producing "Superfly") shows a decidedly cynical and unflattering depiction of the various bribes, rewards, unfulfilled promises, backfolds, duplicities and double dealings that are an unpleasant, yet intrinsic, part of the largely corrupt rock music business, with thematic particularities particularly troubling with Art Vs. Trade, struggling to retain artistic integrity and the then recent drive to homogenize rock. in mainstream respectability soft, useless, creatively stagnant. In addition, this rude and noisy gem offers a rare and fascinating, meticulously detailed and totally convincing glimpse of the recording process while recording island cowboy Coleman struggles in his own words to "make chicken salad out of chicken". Appearing in cool chunks are the disc jockey and the legendary "fifth Beatle" Murray the K as the big and lascivious DJ Big John Little (Velour bites his hand after Big John strokes his thigh during a live interview!), DJ soul NBC's Friday Night Videos host Frankie Crocker as his own R & B singer and songwriter Doris Troy (she wrote the adorable "Just One Look") as a church pianist, and 70-year-old Charles Favorite MacGregor as a priest at a wedding. The rather poor sound and sloppy cinematography of Allan Metzger inadvertently add to the overall authenticity of the rough, rough documentary style around the film. Although technically a little flawed, this film is still considered one of the big, bitterly pessimistic and unfamiliar backstage films of the 1970s.
