*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** It's easy to see why the screenplay for this movie won an Oscar. At least during the first semester. My head was spinning from all the restless lines passing by. Noel Coward plays a New York-based publisher ("Why do not you publish books you like?"), Which enchants and manipulates your many parasites. Then he dies in a plane crash, and the story turns into a bizarre takeoff of a Flying Dutchman, in which Coward must find someone who truly cries before his soul can rest in peace. Very nice until it gets bizarre. Seen at the Cinefest in Syracuse in March 2003.
