I got out of "Dark Blue World" feeling (sigh) "so sad", but it was definitely a film that needed to be done, and it's really well done in the Czech Republic. It's fun, despite the "sad" premise. It is full of feelings, the connection and undeniably true friendship between the two main characters - a mature pilot lieutenant (Ondrej Vetchý as Franta) and the young and ever so anxious novice pilot (Krystof Hádek as Karel), the inevitable love triangle. and the now and then reminders of the sad prison situations in Czechoslovakia in the 50's. It's all in a film together, by father screenwriter and son director team Zdenek and Jan Sverák (previous conquest being the lovely "Kolya"). <br /> <br /> It is not as long as "East-West" (French "Est-Ouest") 1999, which was a painful and multifaceted story about a returning Russian doctor and the problems of the French wife after the Second World War in Russia. The plot of "Tmavomodrý svet" (title in Czech) is quite simple and has a slight touch of humor. Music, World War II songs in England sung in Czech, modest special effects of pilots and air crafts in the sky - not elaborate like Hollywood - there is no need to be bing, bang, boom all the time when showing scenes of aerial battles. The sadness was explained at the front at the beginning (two paragraphs in English) and ended with the following paragraphs. The film is not totally subtitled, only when translating the Czech conversations - the rest is in English, either in English or in Czech touches. (So ​​it's a foreign film with the English language and includes British actors.) <br /> <br /> The three main performances, especially of the two Czech pilots, have been beautifully delivered. There are nuances between the two, although it is the constant maturing against anxious young people. I always appreciate Tara Fitzgerald: yes, there is "Brassed Off" in 1996, opposite Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite; he remembered it from "Hear My Song" 1991, opposite Adrian Dunbar and Ned Beatty; opposite Hugh Grant in "Sirens" 1994 and "The Englishman who went up a hill and descended a mountain" in 1995, in addition to his appearances in the miniseries PBS Masterpiece Theater. <br /> <br /> "So sad" - the fact that the heroes who defend their own country can be so abused and treated for so long (40 years). Thank goodness for worthwhile memories and impressions of unforgettable friendship. Hence the pause for a ray of sunshine through a stained glass window (ironic or coincident that is from a church where hard work took place) - symbolic of hope, never give up ?? <br /> <br /> Other recent films that have stories need to be told: "Kandahar" (with Nelofer Pazira as Nafas, the Canadian from Afghanistan traveling to Kandahar with a personal "mission" in mind) rather than look behind a burqa by Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. "Everything Put Together" (with Radha Mitchell as a new mother facing SID - sudden infant death) insightful film by Swiss director Marc Forster, and his much talked about controversial movie "Monster's Ball" (I have not yet gotten it) with Halle Berry, Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle. Watch the movies without previous expectations or comparisons with previous films. Just look at this.
