I watched the movie yesterday and for me it was an impressive combination of films like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The best of the best. It was never annoying and always moving, every hour there is another character bothering (trying to kill him). You never know what's coming. In one word TERRIFIC !!!
