You have to see it to believe it. Filmed in Hollywood in the middle of the despicable, anything goes beyond the '70s, this cheap movie really did fill the city theaters during the day. Then again, I bet I had a one-week run. Actually, it's pretty hilarious. The acting is terrible, the direction nonexistent, but the hair, the clothes, the rotten music before the album and the overall lack of prestige of the story are staggering. Sleazy, it's very contemptible. Highly recommended (if you can find it)
