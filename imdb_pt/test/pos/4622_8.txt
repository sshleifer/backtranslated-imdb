Many other viewers are saying that this is not a good movie to watch, since they think it is not "realistic." How can it not be considered realistic? They find that the part of incest is not easy to relate to, which is not common. I can assure you that you met more people than you think have had an act of incest. Many of them will not go out and say that, and most of them are victims. Moreover, many people are gay, and they are still the closest, because no matter how much they would like them to be, they know they will be ridiculed and possibly even abandoned. And tell me, how many kids did you go to high school with who ended up being pregnant or had an eating disorder? I bet a lot, and although the pregnancy is not from incest most of the time, it is easy to relate to it. Who can not relate to being a pariah or being bullied? This happens all the time. and many viewers are probably concerned about education, like Marcus. Being a stoner seems to be fairly common these days. so there are many things to relate to. More than the rest, no matter how popular you may be, sometimes you feel invisible or alone, not noticed, or forgotten as the suicide victim, how can you not feel like you could relate to the movie? I think the movie may have seemed useless to others, but I would like to think of it as important. It's an interesting way to show that suicide happens and be aware. comes from people who do not show their unhappy thoughts, it is very surprising. People who show problems there commit suicide at times, but when you hear about suicide talk, you would have guessed it is usually running in the minds of most people. <br /> <br /> The end surprised me, I was not expecting this to be the girl who by the end, was mostly an extra in the scenes, not even introduced. the story, even in its description, says its 6 teenage lives, when in fact it was 7 years. My only real disappointment was that it was not one of the characters we have to learn, it just seems at first that the movie was useless to see if the actual victim is just a random girl. until I thought more. it made perfect sense to be a big surprise, for that is what suicides are. more, who would choose whom any of the other students had more reason than the other. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has a few bad points, most movies have a few, but I would recommend this movie, as long as you can handle the tragic moments of watching the suicide, and the violence and profanity shown in this movie.
