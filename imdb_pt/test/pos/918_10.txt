Valentine "Dogkiller" Dussaut and Joe "The Judge" Kern join forces to clear the streets of Geneva! Get excited when facing international heroin smugglers, Polish fugitives, snoopers, dating girlfriends, renegade dogs and litterbugs who are too lazy to pick up their recyclables. Do not be fooled by Miramax's misleading ad campaign that paints it as a pretentious art film. This movie is 100% action!
