Human Traffic is undoubtedly the most original and compelling film I have seen in a long time. He documents 2 days in the life of a group of young people, bored with their everyday lives and dead-end jobs and raving about raves over the weekend. It's hilariously funny and extremely moving and sometimes very sad. In the same genre of 'Trainspotting', it has a great soundtrack and features young British stars on the rise. The film was made on a tiny budget and I look forward to future offers from writer / director Justin Kerrigan when his talent is discovered by the top filmmakers.
