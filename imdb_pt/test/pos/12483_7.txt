This movie is so lovingly done that you want to be part of it forever. The flics are straight but not without malice, the products are transparent and the evildoers are hardly there. Even the "cabarets" are so naive that they make you daydream awake with nostalgia compared to anything available on TV. Blier is fine, if it's a bit one-sided. Louis Jouvet is perfect, you simply can not have better copper. He has the best phrase: "My dad has cleaned up other people's dirt and I do the same." Susy Delair is unbearable, but I think in part are the songs, wardrobe and hairstyle. Simone Renant, on the contrary, makes a great femme fatale, although a little silent. I did not realize that she may be a lesbian like dbdumonteil, IMDb user, and others suggest.
