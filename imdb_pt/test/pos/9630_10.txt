I really liked the Patriot. This movie had less violence and was based on a real threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization. One line in Wesley McLaren's film (seagal) stood out in my mind to be very true in our society, "Western medicine is in the practice of prolonging the disease and I am in the business of curing it." <br />
