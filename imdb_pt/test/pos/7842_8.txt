Here you see Mr. Eastwood in all his glory (that is, at the top of his form as an actor and at the height of his physical appeal), but the "ladies" pictured are hardly typical of the South, then or now. The boarding school girls are incredibly naive, some showing signs of becoming really depraved women, and Geraldine Page, in her corruption, is hardly average when it comes to heads of girls' chores, then or now. . (That's not to say there is not an occasional rotten apple in any barrel.) Mr. Eastwood said this is one of his two favorite movies. <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled" has an original plot, lots of cute characters and lots of surprises in store for the viewer. It's completely catchy and fun, but it's not really realistic. (I know, having grown up in the South and attending a school and a college for girls.) Also, I have met countless girls who did the same, not to mention their laid-back teachers, or you might even say "repressed teachers." away from the director portrayed here.) She is absolutely comical in her portrayal of a gentle southern woman who is not quite what she seems. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit scandalous when first. is, I think, but you will not regret spending time watching.
