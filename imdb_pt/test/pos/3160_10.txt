The whole shorthand for supposedly being more conscious at this strange time is that you are "blue." The mentality of the blue state. That should get us off the hook for what is happening in recent years in our country. He does not leave anyone out but makes us feel better, as if we were not benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good things a US citizen gets just for being an American citizen. <br /> <br /> But I'm so tired of complaining about it. It's no use. I have not taken much action lately and wonder how many people have. Maybe I'm just down because my job was "outsourced" last month and now I'm looking for work in the area of ​​ever smaller technical support where most jobs are going fast to India and other places abroad. I'm thinking that soon it will not be worth it to be a citizen here with the spoiled infrastructure and shrinking labor market and obsession with war. Nowadays, it seems that anyone who speaks has fun and questions about "patriotism". Anyway, back to this comment: USA The film is an obscure DVD that makes me realize that some people have taken action, be it through politics, protests, arts or media. The filmmaker is obviously passionate, knowledgeable, willing to leave the norm, frustrated, unique, cunning etc. <br /> <br /> I looked through the entire site that is connected to the DVD and got lost in all the articles, essays etc. that are there. The DVD does this too, it has references to different moments, points of view and historical points. Sometimes someone does something out there.
