Dear Reader, 2001: A Space Odyssey is Kubrick at his best ... although I really can not say that, because Space Odyssey is his only movie I've ever seen. But still, it's a good movie. Strange, but good. <br /> <br /> The film is in three acts, much like the novel ... which is not surprising since the author wrote the script. Anyway, we started with the simple yet spectacular opening, with Also Sparach Zarathustra playing loudspeakers. Then comes the boring sequence beyond the belief 'Dawn of Man'. Then there is the strange sequence "Finding the Monolith" on the Moon, played on Strauss's Blue Danube. Eventually things get good with the spaceship footage and HAL getting furious and killing people. After that, things die and we have the sequence 'Entering the Monolith', which was very long and the ultra-strange ending. Even so, 2001: Space Odyssey is a good movie. It's not Star Wars, Stargate, Terminator or The Abyss, but it's awesome. My compliments to the chef, Mr. Kubrick. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
