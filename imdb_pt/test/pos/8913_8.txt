There's more to this film than it looks. Whether you're looking for innovative originality or easy comedy, you'll be disappointed. But for a fun 90 minutes, fine. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is careful and precise. The sex scenes, which a comment denounces as gratuitous, are anything but - every gesture contributes to the development of the characters. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of the main characters are not exactly kind human beings. But the film makes an honest effort to show its interactions in an honest, non-sensational way (at least not to the urban patterns of the early 21st century). And there are lots of fun times.
