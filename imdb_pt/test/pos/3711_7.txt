This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to the small town of Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one 18 and one eight, are looking for bird eggs huge collectors item for boys in the south around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decide to enlist. He hands his prize egg to his younger brother, Willie, and leaves to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte. Well, Willie is not having any of this, if Pete can be a soldier, so can he. He heads to Memphis, showing his stubbornness and determination as he outgrows several adults along the way. After finding the enlistment center in Memphis, he asks to see his brother, pulling a knife at a lieutenant and wounding him in the process. We are shown the devotion and love of a little brother (Jonathan Furr). He delivers impeccable performance as a stubborn boy of will power in the most delicate times of the past. The film tries and mainly shows how brothers can show devotion and the importance of family ties in youth. As the two brothers get together soon, the film makes a cathartic cry when fraternal love surrounds us all. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a bottle of iced water. Maybe Dasani or Aquafina, good clear water with a tasty mineral package, but not pure natural water like Evian. Yet it quenches your thirst and you do not doubt its effects of purity and suppression. It runs more of the mill and less expensive than some, but it does the job, leaving one renewed and detoxed later. 7/10
