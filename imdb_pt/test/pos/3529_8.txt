One of the many horror sertanejos that came out in the early eighties and fortunately this is one of the best. Yes, it has a boring plot, but I was pleasantly surprised by this movie because I thought it was very good and very entertaining, although the killer could have been a bit more scary, he just looked like a fat and fat. <br /> <First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to these mountains because they are too dangerous. But when teenagers arrive, it does not look too dangerous, according to me anyway. Too bad we do not have movies like this anymore, and if we do, it's usually a boring and terrible movie. <br /> <br /> This movie depends more on the tension and the scary feeling than on blood, because The factor is really low in this movie that I was not satisfied, but otherwise it is still a great movie. <br /> <br /> All in all you will have to look hard and hard to find this movie and if you find it, you will like it and also watch out for the final girl and the killer, it is not what you expect.
