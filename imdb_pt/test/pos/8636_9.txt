There are a lot of movies that we say should be seen twice. In most cases, this is mostly a recommendation: you understand the movie anyway after the first viewing, and watching it a second time helps you understand the twists that you just did not notice. However, for Dr. Mulholland this is different. The sequence that worked for me was: seeing for the first time - spending a day on the Internet trying to figure out what this was all about - and then seeing the second time. Otherwise, the more likely it is that you will not be able to enjoy this movie to its fullest. So you begin to understand that this piece is ingenious, the camera work is impressive, and the taste follows you for weeks. <br /> <br /> 9/10
