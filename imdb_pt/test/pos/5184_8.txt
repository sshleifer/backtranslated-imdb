The three main characters are all hopeless, and yet you only feel sorry for one of them: Ernesto, hopelessly devoted to Mercedes. That was part of the frustration: yelling at Mercedes to get a clue and abandoning Harry, to no avail. <br /> <br /> Then there's the satisfaction: Steve Buscemi has a great role as a transvestite, and Harvey Keitel's poignant story about his unworthiness playing a gorilla for a cheap TV movie is incredible. When you least expect it, Quentin Tarintino is half-monologue, and Anthony Quinn turns Ernesto into a rich man. <br /> <br /> Over and over again, great moments appear in the story, but in the end it's hard to know. what to feel about this movie. It does not have a happy ending, or even a complete one, but in a way it seems right. <br /> <br /> This movie is strange, but so am I; No wonder he liked it.
