Wow. We watched this movie in the hope that it would have at least some decent climbing scenes. We were disappointed, but it was still a great movie! It was sooooo cheesy it was great! I had not laughed so much about a movie in a long time. If you like rock climbing, and fancy fancy movies, then this is absolutely for you!
