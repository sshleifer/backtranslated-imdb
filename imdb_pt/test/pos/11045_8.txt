Viewing these two movies at the same time is not a bad idea to get an idea of ​​the initial production of movies and acting in the camera styles. I give the signal to Garbo (but not much) about his naturalness. Robeson is majestic. But his performance is geared toward a major proscenium theater. Another thing that struck me were the themes of empowering cinema for women and minorities. There were still no movies coming out of Hollywood that allowed the voices of marginal characters like Anna and Brutus to take center stage. These were very progressive films for their time. It is very likely that O'Neill has seen the writing on the wall before everyone does about the future of America.
