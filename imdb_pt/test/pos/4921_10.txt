This is a classic animated film from the cartoon series! Most of the main characters get plenty of screen time, plus extra characters too! The film's focus is on the superstar characters' vacations and each has its very original summer fun! It's very funny from start to finish! It has great color, good music and, believe it or not, I've seen it more than any movie. It's so good and in my opinion it's perfect!
