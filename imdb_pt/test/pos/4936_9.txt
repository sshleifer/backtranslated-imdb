One of my favorite movies of all time, I've seen it three times. He does a great job of summarizing Isrelai's lifestyles, the humor and seriousness of Israel, and many of the problems the Israelis face. Universal theme of wanting to be accepted and accepted by who you are. Good humor subtle, and it is the charisma of the characters, that makes this movie magical, and says a lot about the culture of Isrlaei, and the irony, contradictions and humor, with a great actor, Oshri Cohen. I recommend it to everyone, and it's a perfect movie for just about anyone, family movie, boyfriend / girlfriend movie, and also says that beyond Israeli culture, wanting to be accepted, above all, how important is the family, with all its diversity and imperfections. Great great movie.
