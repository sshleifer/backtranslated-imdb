One of the best teen comedies to be filmed during the '80s, Valley Girl has a young Nicolas Cage in a starring role. Deborah Foreman is fun as the object of Cage's desire (and what happened to her?). Look for the veteran actors Colleen Camp and Frederic Forrest as Julie's hippie parents - they're pretty funny!
