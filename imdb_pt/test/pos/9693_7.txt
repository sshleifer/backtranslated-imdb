This is not the kind of movie that really deserves critical attention. It will not win any Oscars - it's not really a very good movie. Heck, it's not even a movie - just a series of short and disgusting weird pieces brought together in an effort to make entertainment. And as much as every critical bone in my body screams to give this movie a failed score, fuck it, I'm going to give a much better score. The kind of person who will like this movie is not the kind of person who really cares what critics have to say, so I'm not going to make a snobby critique of Jackass's surreal quality of existentialism that pervades and comments on how our society oh oh forget <br /> <br /> What do you say? There is no plot development, no character development - no real beginning - there is a semi-pleasing ending that is not as funny as the sketching that precedes it, and everything between improper bathroom mood smells that high school kids laugh at. It's really very funny. <br /> <br /> Leave at the door all your prejudices of a good movie. Jackass: Number Two is just plain rubbish. That's really all that is. I give the filmmakers this: they create very imaginative things. You will probably shrink several times, either throw up sometimes, move and move uncomfortably while people on the screen do deeds of death and vomit. Vomiting, garbage, urine, semen ... virtually every body fluid can be seen in Jackass: Number Two. There is nudity, sexual humor abounds and so on. <br /> <br /> It's fun. If you're the kind of person who finds this nice thing, you're probably going to love Jackass: Number Two. I laughed several times. As I said, it is a very imaginative thing. I never wanted to vomit - although I have a very strong stomach. Just accept the premise of the movie: a bunch of idiot guys do weird junkies for fun. Once you go through this, accepting it and going with it, you will enjoy it. The only flaw in the movie is the huge excess of all the strange and disgusting things. There are several very imaginative sketches, very disturbing, but it creeps into many places, such as the ones that are less interesting. In the end, things get better, but in the middle of the movie the drag damages the overall quality of the movie. On a half-hour TV show, that's not a problem, but with the film-size celluloid, it's inevitable boredom will happen at some point. After a while, the coarse crap becomes desensitizing. In general, however, Number Two is a fun, imaginative and, above all, disgusting comedy that will leave you with a sense of pain, nausea, and hilarity. Go see if you have to, but hey, if you know you do not like that sort of thing, do not bother. You will only be disappointed.
