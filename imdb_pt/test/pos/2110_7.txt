First I'm a teenager. Okay, and I have to say that this movie was really good. I think any ten year old will like it, but people my age can be a little, um, well, we would describe the movie as LAME! But I liked that. It may be that I still act like a kid, or I visit a cattle ranch every weekend, but this movie was cute. I liked how the actors were like kids, not little blond pies, wearing three layers of clothes, a trendy hat and about a thousand assecories (like most of today's shows, to name a few, Drake & Josh, Lizzie McGuire , well any kid show.) And the scenery was perfect, but there was a flaw. The family was in debt, right? Why in the world did their inner house look like something out of a Western store? That was a flaw. <br /> <br /> The apparitions are great, there are about five hundred of them, and the only explanation is that Julia Roberts is the little girl's main aunt. How in the world did they get everyone else? This movie seemed to be in a kind of tight budget. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, it was fun to watch, and I thought some parts were very unlikely (like a cow selling for $ 750,000? Ha! My butt sells a cow for both!) But otherwise it was good, I liked it, and I could watch it again. But I would never buy it, not even special features on the DVD! What is up with that? But rent it, especially if you have small children running around the house.
