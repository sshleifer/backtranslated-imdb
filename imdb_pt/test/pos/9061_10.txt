Who would have thought that suicide could be treated in a palpable way by all? I saw the movie at SXSW on its debut and it turned out to be the best movie there. Yes, it's distorted and it's bizarre, but it makes sense in the world that the filmmaker (Michael Parness) creates. If you did not laugh (most everyone did) then you are not getting it and this is a shame. Particularly of note, Guillermo Diaz as Hector steals a lot of scenes and the chemistry between Natasha Lyonne and David Krumholtz is intense. The movie recalls Harold and Maude, but not really, it takes one bizarre turn after another, and everyone makes sense in this crazy, confused world we all live in. I stayed (as did most) for Q & A later, and what was great was hearing that the same things I thought in my head as to why things "happened" are the reasons they did. I do not think you can say too bad about the movie unless you do not understand. I think I got it and it looked like most other people did too. The film is dubbed a suicidal comedy, but has a lot of heart, lots of laughs and offers a lot of hope, but also does not escape the horrors of suicide. A small movie that should get attention when it's released, which will probably happen sooner or later.
