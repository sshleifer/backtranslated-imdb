This movie deserved better. The satirical wit of Mike Judge has brought to the fore something that many in this country are trying to deny ... we are getting dumber as a society. <br /> <br /> Could Anna Nicole's 24 hour coverage be? Any more proof? Mike Judge paints a scary future, where donkeys survive and thrive. It makes you stop and think and laugh. Can you look at the world and not ask if we're getting dumber? Are we being overtaken by the human garbage, as well as by our own garbage? (Beware of landslides). <br /> <br /> The movie is very funny. I would tell you more about the plot, but I do not want to spoil it. <br /> <br /> So, why release this film with the ZERO promotion? Is the idiot already assuming?
