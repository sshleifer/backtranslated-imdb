This movie has a lot to recommend it. David Hewlett's paintings, music and butt are beautiful! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching - and it is not predictable, which is saying a lot about a movie these days. But the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing and the script is just weird. It often seemed like it was trying to be a parody, but I never realized what it was trying to be * parody. And if it's not a parody, well, it's still a movie with a great potential that did not live.
