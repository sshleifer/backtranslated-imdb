Plot in a nutshell - Duchess (voice of Eva Gabor) is the well polished single cat of three small kittens. When her owner, the wealthy old woman known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is running out, she decides to write her will, leaving everything she has for her cats, who then go to her butler Edgar when the cats pass. Edgar hears this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would have everything before him and plan to destroy Duchess and her kittens; he leaves sleeping pills for dinner one night and then leaves them trapped inside France. Out of her element, Duchess and her kittens make friends with a street cat known as Thomas O'Malley (voice of Phil Harris who voiced the big bear Balloo in the Jungle Book); after making a pass on the Duchess, unaware that she is a single mother, O'Malley decides to accompany them back home, with Duchess genuinely falling in love with O'Malley as the usual codependent substitute family bond develops; chaos and chaos ensue, culminating in a violent confrontation between O'Malley, his street siblings and Edgar. It also features appearances of British geese, hunting dogs from southern America (what they were doing in France, nobody knows), a mouse that looks a lot like the rabbit from "Alice in Wonderland" (it was actually dubbed by the same guy who dubbed Winnie the Pooh) and a horse. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a slow, but still enjoyable, Disney venture. Features the memorable "Everybody Wants to Be a Cat" musical piece sung by the late Scatman Crothers (best known to fans of the 1980s as the voice of Jazz in Transformers). Of course, if this were being done now, it would probably be a grim social commentary on the division of classes represented by the division between well-fed and well-fed Duchess and O'Malley Street.
