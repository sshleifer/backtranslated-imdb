Conrad Phillips stars the 1950s action adventure series - William Tell. Set in the 14th century during the hostile Austrian occupation of Switzerland, William Tell is a reluctant freedom fighter, fighting heroically against the tyranny and oppression of invading forces. William tell is the Swiss version of Robin Hood. Conrad Phillips plays the protagonist fantastically. It is possible that Pascal Bugnion had been more successful in the role, but he was not available at the time of filming. The classic action show is comprised of a series of 39. The episodes are in black and white, but this does not detract from the entertainment in any way.
