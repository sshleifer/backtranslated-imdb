One of the biggest movies coming out of the '80s, Dirty Dancing was a low-budget movie with high-budget returns. With a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance to a love story that we all wish we could live (at least if you're a woman), this is a movie you will want to watch over and over again. <br /> <br /> Music, which is what drives the film, is optimistic and flows well with the emotions that are drawn from the viewer. From classic 1960s hits such as Otis Redding's "Love Man" and Frankie Valli's "Big Girls Do not Cry" to the 1980s hits like Eric Carmen's "Hungry Eyes" and Frank Zappacosta's "Overload", Dirty Dancing is a mixture of fun and sensual, showing the transformation of a young girl from shy teenager into a blossoming femininity, all against the beautiful setting of a summer romance that we all hope and wish we have transformed into more. <br /> <br /> The dance in "Dirty Dancing" is not to be forgotten. Cynthia Rhodes shines in her role as Penny, a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and agile gymnasts. Patrick Swayze does more than a fantastic job and shows more and more his skills, not just as an actor, but as a dancer and singer as well. And Jennifer Gray shines like Baby, while her transformation into dancing portrays her transformation into status as well. <br /> <br /> All in all, Dirty Dancing is one of the best movies of all time, and it's worth watching at least once. It is doubtful that Ronette's first Be My Baby beats in the opening title does not grab his attention and draw him into a magical world of sensual dancing and musical enchantment.
