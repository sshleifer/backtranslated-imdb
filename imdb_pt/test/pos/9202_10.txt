Frankly, I just like watching James Caan. Wonderful actor. So simply, you know exactly what he's thinking. A real professional. <br /> <br /> I watched the show from the beginning and found it different - this is something that is unique in Hollywood - a new idea - not a version 3 of a current hit show - I also find the show fun and exciting - I like the rhythm - you're never bored - I especially like the mystery in each episode - the way it unfolds. I'm a big fan of mystery and read a lot of the great mysteries, but I find the program's stories well written and the result is rarely obvious. Also extremely interesting to me, probably because I'm not a player, it's the different cons that 'players' invent - I was fascinated by the number of schemes people invented to steal Las Vegas. The song: I like the music at the top of the show. Absolutely perfect for the show ... Sets the tone and atmosphere. Just wonderful. And, of course, there's James Caan.
