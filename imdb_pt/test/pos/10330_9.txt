I just loved this show. I never understood why it was called Bug Juice. I should have been about 13 when I left. I remember what they broadcast during the summer vacation on Channel 4, between Pugwall's summer reruns and Saved by the bell or something. I remember sitting there and wishing to be in summer camp too - ha ha. All the kids seemed to be having a great time, it was all about "figuring out who you are" and "growing up". First kisses and all these things. I remember there was a really cute guy in it, I think he was the main reason I got up in the morning that particular summer. They should have more docu-soaps teenagers so I thought great!
