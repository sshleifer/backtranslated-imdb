Behind nostalgic music, we see a young man coming down from a train. He is coming from Yugoslavia to meet his father, a man he had not seen in a decade. At the train station, we meet the man. He never smiles. <br /> <br /> So, we began our journey in "Four Friends", the powerful and amazing film of Arthur Penn. You may ask why I started my review this way. Well, that's how the video box describes the movie. You may have realized that the movie will be the story of the boy trying to get along with this emotionless man and eventually he will peel his cape and expose the gentleness. <br /> <br /> Well, if you bought this, I have a bridge that I want to sell you. You see, modern Hollywood would make that movie. Penn has always been an outsider and has never resorted to the typical clich√© narrative. He always tells interesting stories about people (his credits include "Bonnie and Clyde", "The Chase", "Alice's Restaurant" and underrated "Mickey One") and "Four Friends" is no exception. <br /> <br /> A typical Hollywood movie would focus on the boy named Danilo. But Steve Tesich's script focuses only on that for about 4 minutes and then abandons it. We meet adult Danilo, played by Craig Wasson (which you can recognize from "Body Double" and "Nightmare on Elm Street 3") and his friends, Tom, David and the passionate Georgia. The movie takes us through the sixties. Now in a smaller movie, the events would get attention. But in "Four Friends," these events happen, but Penn and Tesich are more concerned with the study of the character than with the plot, and I think the film is best that way. We know the events; we do not need to dwell on them again. <br /> <br /> I know I have not described much of the plot, but I do not know if you can describe "Four Friends". It's not one of those "high concept" movies that can be described in a single sentence. It is a film of many ways and textures. It is also a genuinely emotional experience. The last twenty minutes of this movie have brought me to tears. I'm not ashamed to admit it. Rarely does a movie have such power that it can reduce me to tears. The performance is first-rate, especially by Craig Wasson, who appears to be one of the most underutilized actors currently. This is such a difficult performance, emotional and Wasson pulls it. He should have gotten an Oscar for it. Another great performance is Jodi Thelen, who has an even harder role than Wasson. But it deals very well and gives Georgia a certain dignity that most Hollywood actresses would not do (they would be too scared to try; they would be more concerned with the image than with a great performance; this is not what acting is about ). She also deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> "Four Friends" did not receive much pressure in 1981. Maybe people just do not have the emotional ability to deal with it. And the clueless executives could not push him like another "American Graffiti" (he does not have the wallop of "Four Friends"). Then they let them die. Too bad because this is one of the best films of the 1980s, a decade in which more and more trash was created and great art like this was without a home. I urge you to give this movie a try. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
