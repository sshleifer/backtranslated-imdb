It's a simple fact that there are many of us from the 80's generation who grew up loving those crazy John Cusack comedies made by Savage Steve Holland, and while I prefer there another more bizarre movie and out there, Better Off Dead, it's difficult for me I do not like One Crazy Summer, a movie I grew up loving with all my heart as a teenager. OCS was a continuation of Better Off Dead, returning Cusack and Curtis Armstrong from that film. <br /> <br /> Cusack is Hoops, after graduation friend Joel Murray (George) to Nantucket for the summer for every one fun on the beach. Hoops finds himself embroiled in a brawl with a blonde punk named Teddy Beckersted, whose lascivious father has plans to destroy houses in a neighborhood to build a giant condominium. One of the houses, needing his mortgage to be paid, belongs to Demi Moore (Cassandra). There is a sailboat race that may be her only hope of saving Cassandra's grandfather's home (which he had recently spent), but has been defeated by Teddy in recent years, and Hoops is mortally afraid of boats on the water. But with the help and motivation of new friends from Nantucket (such as Bobcat Goldwait and Tom Villard as twin auto-mechanic brothers!), George and Cassandra, maybe the Hoops can accept their fears and win the race to save the neighborhood. Armstrong has a supporting role as the son of a wacky arms dealer, General Raymond (Joe Flaherty of SCTV in an inspirational article), Ack, who uses his father's training to help Hoops and company in their goals. win the race. <br /> <br /> Memorable scenes include Bobcat getting trapped in a Godzilla suit (!) running loose on an entire model of Aguilla Beckersted (Mark Metcalf, barely recognizable as Teddy's pop), Hoops being chased by Scots demented wanting to give first aid, George victim of toxic flatulence, Bruce Wagner's growing insanity Uncle Frank every time he tries to improve his chances of winning $ 1 million from a radio show and the wonderful Billie Bird as grandmother George really bills the group after a meal! Jeremy Piven as (you guessed it) a brutal idiot who associates with Teddy and causes problems for Hoops and his pack, the hot Kimberly Foster as Cookie (Teddy's girl who tries to kiss with Hoops while he attends a lunch with his father), and the one and only William Hickey as Old Beckersted, who will not reward his son and grandson for an inheritance if they miss the sailing boat race. Demi Moore is cute, but this is Cusack's vehicle, although Bobcat and Villard steal most of their scenes. Again, some delightful Dutch animations are scattered throughout the film (Hoops is an artist, appropriately). If you like your movies, I highly recommend highly underrated, as I went into college.
