Some thoughts before reaching the heart of the movie: 1) I've never seen so many breasts naked in a movie before, exhibited in so many non-sexual scenes - it was strange; 2) Joseph Fiennes, where have you been? You enchanted us in * Elizabeth * and * Shakespeare in Love *, and then you left for a while. American mainstream wants more! Ok, I'm a college English teacher, I've read this piece many times, and this is probably the best version of the movie I've seen about it. Although individual aspects of other productions may have stood out, this is the well-organized general package. Pacino is not Olivier, but he does not have to be, so get over it! The film's cinematography is impressive and not just because of bare breasts. Venice is portrayed in an amazing way, and you get the feeling of really being there. The residential island of Portia is unbelievably beautiful, and the lighting is always dyed in the proper manner for the proper mood of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Anti-Semitism in this movie / piece is difficult to watch, especially in the end. Pacino is falling to his knees and holding his religious artifact is perhaps the most powerful moment of his film since * The Godfather Part III * (when Michael's daughter is shot to death on the steps of the opera). Is the piece anti-semeectic? Right. Is * Othello * racist? Right. Understand what it is: a commentary on the Elizabethan era, not a commentary on today. <br /> <br /> Fiennes is underutilized in the film, but it is still a pleasure to watch. The women in the movie are fine; No one really stood out here, but they blend well with the scenery. Jeremy Irons and Pacino are excellent at the two most succulent roles, opponents until the end. I always felt that Irons was underestimated (I still get chills when I hear his voice from * The Lion King *), and Pacino is Pacino.
