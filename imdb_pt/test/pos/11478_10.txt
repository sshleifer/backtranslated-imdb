Despite its ultra-low budget, "Sorte Nula" is the most successful Portuguese film of 2004. And I must say, a well-deserved success. What I like most about "Sorte Nula" is the intricate detail that Fernando Fragata was meant to keep you interested in what is happening and what will happen next. It is very detailed and superbly advanced for a seemingly simple love-story-gone-bad-thriller. What's even nicer and ironic about this is the fact that the characters are in the same situation, none of them know the whole story and are left to their own assumptions by making "Lucky Luck" a cut above the rest. This is definitely not a movie you want to go out for a break from the bathroom, as you will undoubtedly miss something important. I feel that one of the main attributes of the film would have to be the environment that it establishes. It's scary, but hilarious at the same time. I read somewhere someone quoting this movie saying, "... it was like watching Hitchcock ..." and I could not agree more !! I love movies like this where you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING to fully understand what's going on. 9/10
