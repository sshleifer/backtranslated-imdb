I missed the movie and rented it on DVD. If you have the chance I would recommend it as it is better than almost everything I've seen in the movies or on the DVD this year. That's not to say it's one of the best movies of all time, it's just that I've seen a lot of nonsense :) <br /> <br /> I can not really add to what is already said except 8/10
