Where Rivers Flow North is a well-told story about the struggle of two peoples to live their own lives in the face of "progress" and development. In addition to enjoying the film as entertainment, I also learned a little about life in rural New England in the late 1920s. Cinematography captured the raw beauty of northern Vermont and set the stage, while music brought the film to the life. Nicely done for a low budget, locally produced movie. I found the character of Michael J. Fox the weakest in the movie, but Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal became two of the best performances I've seen in a long time. I was sad that she did not get a nod as best actress that year (I suppose the movie was "too small" to be considered).
