Seriously, where's the Al Pacino Oscar nomination for this one? Do we consider you guaranteed at this point in your career? Pacino here is extraordinary .. He gives a complex and moving performance as Shylock, the Jewish money lender .. the film as a whole was very good with beautiful photos of Venice to look at and a perfect tone to hear ... the others actors also do a great job but the real reason to see this is Pacino .. I saw all the performances of the 2004 Oscar, and I must say that Pacino was despised .. blame the anti-Semitism associated with the play, the lack of campaign in the studio, the late release date without a big push, or more likely, all of the above .. In my mind, the best performances of the year belong to Jamie Foxx in Ray, Don Cheadle in Hotel Rwanda, and Al Pacino in The Merchant of Venice.
