This is definitely one of Mel Brooks' best movies, along with Spaceballs (although I openly admit I have not seen many others, at least until now). It's very silly and quite funny, there's little more than a few minutes over the entire two hours of runtime, where you're not entertained. Almost all jokes have a great comic effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie shortly after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly how high quality this movie really is. It's funny from start to finish, none of the comedies are overdone or boring. The music is wonderful, just like the choreography of dancing and fighting. The acting is pretty much what you would normally expect from this kind of movie ... Elwes is a great comedian and makes a good Robin. The plot is typical Robin Hood, more or less all of the legend is to fit in this movie (and falsely majorly). If you like Mel Brooks, or you're just a fan of silly humor, or you're dying to watch a good parody of the legend of Robin Hood, this is definitely the movie for you. The HBO First Look special in the movie also deserves to be watched, and in that, you may want to continue watching the credits as well. I would recommend it to any fan of Mel Brooks movies, and to people who like silly humor. 7/10
