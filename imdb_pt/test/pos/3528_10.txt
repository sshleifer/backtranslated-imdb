This was a great 1981 movie that had a great story about three men and two girls who go on a camping trip together and pass through thick woods and high mountains with a large waterfall. This group of people finds property of George Kennedy, (Roy McLean) who plays the role of ranger and rides a white horse. Roy McLean warns these youngsters that, wherever they are going, there is no camping area and they should turn around. Of course these young people do not pay attention and have a ball swimming naked near the waterfall and playing good music and dancing by the fire and drinking lots of beer and wine. There is an old one-room wooden house that draws the girls and the boys inside and it is from there that the movie starts to get very scary. There is an occasion when a young girl has to climb a tree to escape a human beast that desires her body and begins to knock her down to capture her. Do not miss this movie, there is much of everything.
