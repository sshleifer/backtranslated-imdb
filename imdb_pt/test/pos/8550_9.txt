This is a finely crafted film with moving sequences, humor and, best of all, a love story. Anthony Quinn is beautifully cast and after seeing several of his films, this has to be categorized as one of his best performances in addition to Zorba. The movie makes you really wonder if it's filmed in Romania, which apparently is not the case. It is right to deceive even the native Romanians, with their authentic landscape, customs and ways of life. According to IMDb, he is filmed in France and Yugoslavia, hmmm. The story is compelling, making you want to watch the entire movie, to see if you missed something. This prompted me to research to find out if this is a movie based on the truth, but to my disappointment, it is a movie based on romance, seemingly fiction. It seems a little improbable to have actually happened, but you never know ... The only problem with this movie is that it does not seem to have Romanian actors, and it's a film about a Romanian character. There are probably many Romanian fill-ins at the beginning, but maybe not, it's filmed elsewhere. The author of the book was Romanian, at least everything is very good and elegant - in general, a cinematography masterpiece.
