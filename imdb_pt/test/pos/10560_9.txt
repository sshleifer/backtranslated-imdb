I've never read Sarah Water's book. Although I have not read the book, the 3-hour movie is very interesting. It starts with an interesting storyline with a distorted ending. I have to say these two actresses are amazing. Sally Hawkins is stunningly portrayed successfully by the character in love with her lover and betrayed by her love. Their romance blossoms slowly as they spend more and more time together. The lovemaking scene is very tender and emotional, well represented. The ending is quite intriguing and these two ended up together after everything they've gone through, which is a blessing. Overall, it's a great movie to watch, a very interesting storyline with great performances.
