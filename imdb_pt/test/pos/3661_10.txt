He was very happy to see Hari Om at the Bermuda International Film Festival. It was opening night and it was such a delicious movie. It was filmed beautifully around India and I want to go there now. The lead actor. Vijay was absolutely amazing. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie ... Monsoon Wedding. He was the star of the show. Benoit's character made me laugh ... it was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was also great. They were all great! There were many tremendous scenes like that of the monkeys. And basically I just loved the movie. Everyone coming out was raving about it and was certainly a highlight of the film festival. It was my favorite of the festival. It really beautifully captured the liveliness of India and can not believe how beautiful India is. The feeling on leaving the movie theater ... was very high. It's a delicious and happy movie. I loved!!
