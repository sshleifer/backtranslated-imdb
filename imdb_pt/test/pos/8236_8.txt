Over 21, the film version of Ruth Gordon's play, detailing her experiences trying to keep the marriage together with Garson Kanin after he joined the service, gave Irene Dunne one of her best back roles on the big screen. It also agrees with what was then an optimistic spirit in America about how we would not spoil peace as we did in the First World War and sow the seeds of yet another global conflict. <br /> <br /> The play Ruth Gordon wrote and starred in herself, competed for 221 performances in 1944 on Broadway and simply confined herself to the bungalow that Gordon and Harvey Stephens, who was the male leader, had on a base training. If you look at the list of Broadway credits, she says the production was "staged" by George S. Kaufman instead of being directed by him. I'm not sure of the distinction, but I can imagine that, with intelligence and force as strong as Kaufman's, it must have been an interesting time to mount the production before the opening night. <br /> <br /> When Columbia bought the screen rights, Sidney Buchman had to do a considerable script reconstruction to move the action beyond the bungalow. The film has very little trace of its origins on the stage. <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays the husband and Charles Coburn, the employer of Dunne and Knox, who are writers. Knox graduated not only as an editor, but as a columnist. His words and thoughts help sell the paper and Coburn is in trouble. But Knox feels he needs to enter the war, the seminal event of his time to speak authoritatively about the kind of postwar world he wants. This was not an unusual topic in those years. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne has some good comedic moments, the kind she used to have when she appeared alongside Cary Grant. In fact, Garson Kanin directed the two in My Favorite Wife a few years earlier. Coburn is his usual grumpy old water buffalo of a boss who finally has a good heart. <br /> <br /> More than 21 was an optimistic picture that sad to say was not accurate on what allies and I mean all they could bring to the peace conferences to create a better world. I still hope a new generation will strike.
