After watching this movie, I experienced a new sensation. I watched a movie in which the lead actor had performed a performance that almost rivaled the legend Chevy Chase in 'Fletch'. This is not to say that the performances are comparable, but both give a practically perfect delivery of their lines. This actor is Marc Singer! Singer is Jack Ford, the "Droid Gunner" of the title, crunching life by collecting the reward on androids. There are some mutants, topless pleasure droids (!), A Scandinavian smuggler and possibly an indifferent attempt to make a statement in class or maybe even globalization or ......... well, it does not really matter. What matters about this movie is the dry way in which Singer offers his lines, resulting in a side split mood! What matters about this film is that director Fred Olen Ray seems to realize that science fiction very rarely works, and when your budget is tight, it's best not to take it seriously. Olen Ray said that everyone involved in this movie had a great time and this is transferred to the film. I dare you to criticize a movie that allows you to portray the futuristic Earth as eternally dark and neon-lit and then ending in a "pipes and valves." warehouse. Self parody is a very redemptive quality. To summarize, Fred Olen Ray is an independent film ambassador and Marc Singer is the perfect filmmaker B. If only Olen Ray could write Tim Thomson's equation, we would have a movie in our hands.
