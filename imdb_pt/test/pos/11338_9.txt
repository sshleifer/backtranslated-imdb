as with many Wong movies, many people find them boring and confusing. Well I like them and I like this movie too. I went out and rented on DVD and watched 3 times. It is a very subtle film that provides a heady experience. for those who did not like ... you just wasted 2 hours of your life .... too bad ... muhahahahaha.
