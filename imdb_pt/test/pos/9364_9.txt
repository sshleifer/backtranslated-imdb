Crossfire is one of those 1940's movies that's crying over a remake, if not for some other reason than maybe it's the time that should be done as originally written. The story on which the film is based is about the death of a gay man. But anti-Semitism was certainly a hot topic in post-World War II days with fresh holocaust in everyone's mind. In the biography of Robert Mitchum's Lee Server, director Edward Dmytryk was interviewed and and bluntly said that the film could never have been made about a hate crime against gays at the time with the Code firmly in the place. It could have been, however, because the character of Robert Ryan is a hater of equal opportunities of anything that deviates from his social norms. Mitchum was told in unmistakable terms that he was in the movie strictly for the movie. tour. Robert Young was cast as the homicide captain of the Washington, DC, police who takes the case and while Mitchum was the second he knew from the beginning that the film would belong to Ryan. But he was the new RKO star because of his performances in The Story of GI Joe and Till the End of Time, so he was there for box office insurance. Mitchum's part was as a sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case, George Cooper. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not a whodunit, even if we do not see the crime, it is clear that Montgomery is the only one. who kills Sam Levene, the Jewish salesman par excellence. And it's clear to Young and Mitchum that Ryan is the guilty party almost as fast as the public. It becomes just a matter of getting evidence. <br /> <br /> Ryan won one of several Oscar nominations that the film received, his category for Best Supporting Actor. Although he lost to Edmund Gwenn, the film was Ryan's groundbreaking role. Likewise, Gloria Grahame was nominated for a small part as Best Supporting Actress Party, but lost to Celeste Holm for Gentleman's Agreement. In fact, Crossfire faced Gentleman's Agreement and lost to Best Picture and Best Director of Dmytryk for Elia Kazan. His fifth nomination for Best Screenplay and Crossfire was short again with the winner being Miracle on 34th Street. <br /> <br /> Gloria Grahame also had her own set problems that overflowed from her personal life. She was having major problems with her then husband, Stanley Clements, who was a violent husband. He was walking the set causing many problems for Ed Dmytryk. Luckily Graham's part was small. In fact, the whole movie was shot in typical RKO style economy in 20 days. Robert Young has a particularly good scene with William Phipps, a Tennessee boy in Mitchum and Ryan, whom Ryan constantly disparages. Young is very eloquent in talking about the corrosive nature of hatred and how it has affected his family as Irish Catholics who emerged in the years of potato famine. It was one of Robert Young's best moments on the screen in his long career. No matter how good a movie like Crossfire is, it's time to be remade as a story about a hate crime against gays. Especially with the real murder of Barry Winchell of the last decade and the debate about gays in the military. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that has arrived and is almost gone.
