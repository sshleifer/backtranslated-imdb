There have already been several comments on the site focusing on the film's "prestige" feeling - and there is a lot of heavy talent on display: from Fiennes and Scott-Thomas to magnificently rendered design and punctuation, to masterful direction. No wonder Andrew Lloyd Webber's acceptance speech for "Evita" at that year's Oscars began "Well, thank God," The English Patient "had no music." Writing to the Oscar winners takes me to Juliette Binoche, who, in a stellar cast, makes a beautiful presentation. It is encouraging to see that the dynamics that seem to influence the Best Actor award (often going to pyrotechnic exhibitions) are not working in the female categories. Just as Emma Thompson's well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in "Howard's End" proved that one of the most difficult things an actor can do is portray "goodness," then Binoche's victory proved that it could be that - and seriously sexy. Your performance in this great movie is a beautiful thing.
