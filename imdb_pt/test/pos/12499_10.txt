I was plagued by nightmares involving Sesame Street and the Muppet Show during my childhood. I loved the programs, but when I slept, I dreamed of muppets not very different from those that appear on TV ... but not exactly those on TV. <br /> <br /> They spoke gibberish and laughed and sang while eating each other and killing each other. They would take a bite of their fluffy flesh and tear themselves, followed by arterial bleeding. COOL! But that was the past ... I love this show! I saw Peter Jackson's MEET THE FEEBLES years ago and wondered why there was not a similar job out there. Well, here is how sick, twisted and somehow socially potent the old Hobbit's vision. <br /> <br /> If you like this show, and you have not seen KNOW YOUR HOLIDAYS, get on Amazon or some movie from these sources. You're in for a surprise. <br /> <br /> By the way, Clarence would totally kick Triumph's butt.
