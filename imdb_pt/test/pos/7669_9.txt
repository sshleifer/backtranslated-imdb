I had the great pleasure of seeing recently this wide-screen cinematic adaptation of the 1943 revival of the stage (which, unlike the original 1935 production), included extensive spoken recitatives. That was the fashion of the time, so blame the film for a tradition of 16 years. The film should be seen only for Sammy Davis Jrs as catlike brilliant performance as Sportin 'Life, crawling in and out of the shadows. His seduction from Dorothy Dadridge's book BESS, "There's a boat that's leaving for New York soon," is one of the many highlights. Almost all the main music is intact and beautifully sung. It certainly never bores what recent versions of PBS and MET did. It was a pleasure to see that time has not diminished the film, and hopefully it will be made available in the near future for generations that have not had a chance to try it.
