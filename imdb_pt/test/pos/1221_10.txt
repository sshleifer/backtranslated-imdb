This movie was great! Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job. They both look good together and they both got it. Tasha Smith was as funny as her cousin, and she could not stay out of her business. Essence held it to the girl, when she needed it. Aloma was sweet and played a dear grandmother that she really reminded me of my grandmother. And I can not forget about the stripper, he was so found, and I did not know if I should cover my eyes or smile while I watch him reveal his sensuality in the big screen. he was fine! Tangi looked flawless and sexy, and she rose a little from Felicity. Throughout the entire film had a lot of "A" List Actors and Actress. It was funny, sexy, crazy, touching, affectionate, emotional and wonderful. This movie is a must see! Go to DVD now if you have not!
