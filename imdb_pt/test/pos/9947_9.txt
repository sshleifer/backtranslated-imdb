Okay, I'll admit, I'm 40 and I still shed a tear every time I see Johnny calling his Robot at the end. <br /> <br /> "Robot, now stop! Do not do it, stop the attack ... Robot, what are you doing, Robot ... Robot, where are you going? Robot, please, come back! I need you here? Giant Robot ... Robot! Giant Robot ?? "-Johnny Sokko, The Last One of the Emperor Guillotine <br /> <br /> Of all the Tokusatsu out there, the giant robot has a special place in my heart and will always be there. I credit this in putting myself into everything that is science fiction and anime when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> LIVE IN GR!
