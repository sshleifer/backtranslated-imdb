was very sensitive very deep. It's my favorite all the time that you can not see the movie deeper than this incredible movie. Susan Sarandon played her role as a mature minded actress, and she realized her role. She deserved the prize. She convinced me to be a nun. The music was very impressive and sensitive. I really liked this deep masterpiece.
