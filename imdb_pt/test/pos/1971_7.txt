David Cronenberg's films are easily identifiable, or at least elements within the film stand out as their trademarks. Fetishism, the haze between the throbbing, organic and inorganic things that should not be soft and throbbing. "eXistenZ" is the classic Cronenberg. Briefly, this is a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, the visuals are provided by your mind. The game connects directly to a 'bio port' at the base of your spine and while the game is running, the player can not tell the reality of the game. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the game's developer, guiding a rookie marketer, Jude Law, through the steps of the game. While in the game they discover strange happenings and possible crimes. But are they real, or is it the game? Not even the author of the game knows. <br /> <br /> The movie is a real treat, keeping the viewer involved, but in the dark until the final minutes. Another thing I like about "eXistenZ" is that it does not use a strong reliance on special effects, it's the story itself that drives the movie. Recommended for Saturday night, when science fiction is asked.
