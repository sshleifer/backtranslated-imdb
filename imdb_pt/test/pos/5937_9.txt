I have enjoyed both Van Dykes over the years and been happy to watch them again. So cute and funny and easy to watch and enjoy. Dick was good when he was younger, but I liked him better when he got older. <br /> <br /> Son Berry has been a great to follow in the footsteps of his father. <br /> <br /> Together, they make a great team. and work well together. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed that I did not find another Assassination 101 listed anywhere. <br /> <br /> I've seen the two that have been shown. I'm hoping for more as it's a really nice couple to watch. <br /> <br /> You can tell Berry that you follow in the footsteps of your father, they talk the same way and they have the same mannerisms. <br /> <br /> Enjoy everything you do separately. <br /> <br /> Surely we will see anything that you do alone and together.
