... but I laughed. Very. <br /> <br /> I saw 'Ast√©rix et les Vikings' in a public display during the World Cup. The sound was bad, it was very clear to see the screen properly - but I still amused myself immensely. The names of some of the characters made me roll on the floor: Smsix, Abba, Vikea ... All not very witty, but in good tradition Asterix. Some very good jokes, but also some that not all of them seemed to have. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was the voices of Asterix and Obelix, at least in the German version. The voice actors are very familiar here, and that was the only reason they were actually cast. They do not fit the characters. <br /> <br /> In short, a good way to spend some time (and if it's free, as in my case, so much the better) and have a couple of laughs 8 out of 10.
