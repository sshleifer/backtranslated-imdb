Most of this film is an alternately hilarious and brutal satire on Nazism and fascism, made at the height of the success of these movements. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the final moments of the film, Chaplin abandons the whole pretense of making art (not to mention comedy) and changes completely to propaganda. And it's not anti-Nazi propaganda either, but it's part of the duller, moronic "progressive" propaganda that has ever come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that nothing of what we have seen so far indicates that the barber is even able to give the speech that we see him give (delivered, ironically, with a disturbing bigotry of big eyes); such trivia should not be allowed to interfere with the Message.
