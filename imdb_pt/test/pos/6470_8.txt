Martin Ritt's first film offers an exceptional existentialist response (three years later) to the more conservative "On The Waterfront" by Elia Kazan. While "Waterfront" benefited immensely from an electrifying Marlon Brando, who inadvertently disguised Kazan's offensive theme of trying to justify name names (as Kazan did eagerly before the Anti-American Activities Committee), "Edge of the City" sports young John Cassavetes. and a rookie Sidney Poitier daring to confront issues that "Waterfront" did not recognize, namely, workers' rights and race relations. "Edge of the City" boldly plunges into this (unknown) territory, and although the rather attractive black protagonist (Poitier) may seem a bit simplistic in Hollywood, the courageous fight against veiled fanaticism and violence has hardly aged. One can imagine how shocked the initial spectators of 1957 were at such a bold presentation of the relations between whites and blacks (if some fanatics did not leave the theater early, they should be perplexed, if not offended). <br /> <br /> The latest roll of the film will still amaze the public as it refuses to fall into expected cliches, including those who have contaminated "Waterfront." Only the most tired viewers will not realize what a radical and entertaining movie "Edge of the City" ends up being. <br /> <br /> What is most disturbing about this lost classic: how, unfortunately, it remains unavailable in any format, for reasons that remain quite cloudy. This movie should be seen in school or college history classes across the country, but you can only find it on the obscure television of dawn, if ever.
