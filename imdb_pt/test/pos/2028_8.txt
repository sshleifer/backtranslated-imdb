ATTENTION - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> 'Rock Star' is one of the solid rock movies I've ever seen. The original idea of ​​the script centers on a young singer in the 80's, leading a band honoring one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. He is not only playing his music on the note, but also living the lives of his idols. When his friends of the tribute band expel him, in search of some originality, the fate makes a good move and is hired to replace the lead singer of the idol band. Did a dream come true? Well, almost. As he begins to live the life of the celebrity, including the drug and sex excesses of the 80s rock scene, he will also have to face problems in his relationship with his supportive girlfriend, and eventually need to answer questions about creativity and have a say in music of the band. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, one of the reasons is that it is one of the first times that the life and music of hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic way. Fans of the music genre will be pleased with the soundtrack. The general idea is original, and the questions of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being presented in a sensible and balanced way. Acting is very good, with Mark Wahlberg better than most of the other action flics I've seen lately, and Jennifer Aniston in tune with the role of girl who knows a lot about life. More problematic is the end, which is quite conventional and might disappoint. It seems that the main character after leaving the big and famous band has found its own creative way. However, in an ironic twist, the song he's playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie! <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale. Worth seeing - however, expect exposure to a high dose of metal. If you do not like this type of music, you can choose to avoid this movie.
