Talk Radio sees a man accidentally stumble into life, in fact, in the American Dream, in any normal, everyday job he has in a store; to host a local radio program before going straight to the same job, only later syndicated across the country. It's a role he adopts from his own aggressiveness and natural mannerisms, a maddening approach to freedom of speech by attacking almost everyone and everything else, even those who usually agree with or compliment him. His role as a man who speaks of all things good, bad, right, wrong, political, religious, moral and immoral is something that people seem to understand in a way; 'is it fun and worth tinkering with', but also on a plan of rejection and antagonism? two things were born of the very things seemingly encouraged in professional life in the Western world. That is, in relation to a man, when he reaches the top of his game through the American Dream and deals with free speech while people accept a man but do anything but carry on what he says. <br /> <Talk Radio begins with an assembly of tall, imposing buildings in a commercial area of ​​Dallas, Texas. The skyscrapers are shot from an angle and tower over the observer and everything else in the general vicinity, while that one man's voice renders the images, issuing statements and information about items while these monolithic buildings dominate the screen. They are the very physical representation of capitalism, while the voice of what we learn to be a radio DJ is the oral representation of the free west; personal speeches and opinions about anything and everything. Stone will finish his film in exactly the same way he started, although the film is not a circular journey of any kind as the characters undergo monumental changes in what they witness and in their way of life in general. Instead, the shots of buildings act as an anchor around which the study is observed. The ideologies and ideas of a way of life exist; people subscribe to them, but it does them more harm than good; before the reinstatement that this proud way of life still exists and will continue to exist in the agitation of the kind of people on display in the film until someone or something drastically changes things. <br /> <br /> The DJ is Barry Champlain, a man with a radio show at a local Texan station dealing with just about anything. Champlain's somewhat unconcerned attitude towards explosive content is established when he leaves a connection with an intolerant man who recently visited a Holocaust museum for a young drug addict whose girlfriend allegedly had an overdose and for criticism and mockery of a pizzeria. For us, the content seems quite shocking; To these people, everything seems to be a common business, planting some serious seeds of doubt and horror within our minds, the newcomers to it all. <br /> <br /> About what Barry's show is, no one ever really seems to establish: everything and nothing. In fact, time is taken in the form of jingles or dialogues that the shows immediately before and after the Champlain show are about specific subjects; Gardening, for example, is hosted by gentle, methodical people who, I'm sure, do not fly in a random or extreme fashion to another all the time raising the stakes. One can imagine what Barry's jingle is, the kind that plays at lunchtime during someone else's show: "Later on, Barry Champlain's show! Featuring the village idiot and the psychotic drug addict!" In fact, the introductory piece of his program brings a practical tone, a scream to the audience, while a noisy rock band accompanies it. <br /> <br /> Barry's success comes to the national distribution proposal. It is born of confrontation and a relationship built on the contempt he has for his listeners and what they have for him. The deepening of the material and the raising of bets should cast doubt on the extent to which they think they can accept it, and whether it is worth it if it has progressed on a track because of entertainment. It is when the program reaches this level of broadcast that Barry seems to be letting himself out for the first time in his broadcasting life when a purported serial rapist turns on and leaves virtually everyone slightly stunned. It is at this point that the camera pauses at Barry, and in terms of depth of focus, encompasses the same imposing buildings that the film began, which stand outside the window, directly behind Barry. They remain tall and proud. Specifically, from the ideologies in which they were built and the advancement of freedom of expression in the broadening of Barry's spectacle across the country, as a man climbs the ladder of his profession, he suddenly clashes with the kind of content being offered. Everything comes to a point too far, and that with freedom, at least a sense of clarity must come, rather than a mere revelation. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone made Talk Radio right in the middle of a fascinating and explosive. period of cinematographic production that he had in the late 80's. At this time, he produced a series of films very well received in a short time; Beginning with one of my favorite war movies on Platoon before continuing on to brilliant Wall Street and ending with JFK of 1991. One could even say that this race continued until the mid-1990s with the Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio is like its main character, in the sense that it is loud, thundering, austere and confrontational. It is not anti-capitalism as much as it is focused on drawing a line between what is perceived as entertainment and what is going too far because of popularity and wealth. Talk Radio is certainly a movie that stays in the memory.
