Night Hunter begins in 1968 when a young Jack Cutter (Chris Aguilar) unexpectedly gains the family tradition of becoming a vampire hunter when a vampire hunter Sid O'Mack (Sid Haim) betrays his family and hands them over to Vampire's. , to help Jack in his quest, he gets a book that contains the name of every Vampire alive, or killed the way you look at it ... Go to 'June 1995' and Los Angeles where the now-adult Cutter ( Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, also credited as co-producer, has only four names in the book, including Argento (Vince Murdocco) and Carmella (Sophia Crawford) together, they are the last American vampires. Bruno Fischer (Nicholas Guest) calls the last four vampires from around the world, the Frenchman Tournier (Maria Ford), the Asian Hashimoto (Ron Yuan), the Ulmer ("David" Shark Fralick) and Sangster (Vincent Klyn) to track down Cutter and kill him. Meanwhile, Detective Hooper (Marcus Aurelius) and Browning (Cash Casey) have no idea that a nosy reporter named Raimy Baker (Melanie Smith) gets involved in the battle between Cutter & the Vampire, on which rests the fate of Earth itself! Directed by Rick Jacobson I thought Night Hunter was a fun way to spend an odd 85 minutes. The script by William C. Martell mixes martial arts and horror with a good degree of success, it moves at a good pace and is at least never annoying and fortunately does not seem to take himself too seriously. The names of the characters who make reference to other actors / directors of horror films are a bit cheesy. Some may be amazed at how close Night Hunter resembles Blade (1998) was even made a couple of years before, the lonely long coat wearing vampire hunter who happens to be a martial arts expert, the scene set in a nightclub and the innocent woman attracted to the vampire world. The Night Hunter does not stick to the traditional law of vampire films, for example, sunlight only irritates the eyes, they can only reproduce in a solar eclipse (why?), Stakes in the heart and garlic is not good to kill a Vampire in Night Hunter is breaking his neck. I could have done a little more horror and a little more blood, since I lean more toward the martial arts side. The dialogue is very tacky and the character is almost as kind as his father. Director Jacobson does his best to ruin the film, the action scenes are cool, but lacking a certain aspect and, for some, bizarre whenever an action sequence occurs, he constantly shakes the camera , it is as if the camera were put into a complete cycle of washing machine! Hey Rick, buddy, is not smart or stylish, it's annoying and annoying. The bleeding is disappointing with some bloody gunshot wounds and a few blood splatters, breaking the vampire's necks do not involve much blood, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> With a budget that probably does not equate to much Night Hunter is done with competence everywhere. The acting was bad most of the time and what about the 'Dragon' thing in the name of Don 'The Dragon' Wilson? Has he legally changed his name? Does he sign checks 'The Dragon' Wilson? Does he receive correspondence addressed to him in that name? I think I could do something like this, from now on I want to be known as Paul 'The Killer Klown' Andrews ... <br /> <br /> Night Hunter is one of those bad movies that transcend their limitations and horror. become pure golden entertainment. If you like fun movies, then Night Hunter might be for you, if you're looking for big budget thrills in a similar vein (! Vampire, veins and blood understand?), Then Blade & amp; their sequences would probably be a better choice. What the hell, I like it, then sue me.
