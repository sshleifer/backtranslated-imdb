This commentary discusses "North and South Book I", dealing with 1842-1861 period. The 19th century history of the USA is mainly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion, because it was the Civil War that put the Union under rigorous testing; this was the Civil War that made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, this was the period that finally brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. <br /> <br /> From the birth of the movies, there were people who adapted this time on the screen. D.W. Griffith, in the early 1900s, made his unforgettable BIRTH OF A NATION. However, the most famous film about the North-South confrontation is still, I suppose, GONE WITH THE WIND (1938). Unfortunately, few people know about the magnificent TV series based on John Jakes's novel, "North and South." It is the best TV series ever made and the time spent watching it is really precious. I recorded in my Polish TV video many years ago and have returned to it with great pleasure many times since. Because? <br /> <br /> First, the whole story is deeply rooted in historical reality. The two families, Maines, South Carolina, and the Hazards, Pennsylvania, represent two entirely different ways of life. Nevertheless, friendship unites them. However, what they experience is the struggle that all people make: friendship attacked by the "truth" of the "politically correct", love attacked by the hatred of "legal spouses", kindness by the force of "social heroes." Orry Maine (Patrick Swayze) is my beloved character - someone who finds love and is quickly deprived of it; Someone who takes care of friends, but political fanatics mess up and spoil a lot. Finally, he is someone who can see the tragic future for his land, but there is nothing he can do about the inescapable fate of the south. His friend, George Hazard, is similar in most respects, but sometimes he seems to have a stronger character. It is he who shows Orry that, although there are tragedies, he must rise from despair and live, since life is the most precious thing we have. Although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendship occurs to be stronger than any bias, politics, or conflict. <br /> <br /> Other characters are also particularly well developed. There are villains like Justin LaMotte or Salem Jones who are really bad but most people are ambiguous as has always been the nature of mankind. Charles Maine is, at first, full of rebellion, prone to quarrel, but later learns to be a true gentleman from the south, for whom the pride of the south is not brave words but above all brave deeds. Virgilia Hazard represents the most fanatical side of the abolitionist movement striving to condemn slavery and punish the owners of "black farms." His marriage to Grady seems to be a symbol of equality, but also a symbol of saying "NO" to southern politics. Two interesting characters are Orry's sisters, Brett and Ashton - sisters in whose veins blood flows entirely opposite. Brett, in his gentleness but also ingenuity, believes in absolute fidelity. She marries Billy, although he is a northerner, because she really loves him. Brett is the representation of all that is precious in any young woman. Ashton, however, is a vampire, a tigress, a woman who does not hesitate to do the most evil things. The clear image of his worldview is his chat about men and family ... unforgettable moment and as universal! Most of the characters follow their values ​​... still, the war begins and they will have to put aside ... <br /> <br /> Second, the performances ... someone said that not all people they act naturally. I would not say that. I'd rather say that the whole cast does very good work in its parts, from the main characters being portrayed by the younger team up to the guests consisting of famous stars including Liz Taylor, Robert Mitchum and others. Patrick Swayze as Orry does a great job. I consider this role one of his best. Lesley Anne Down as Madeleine is also very memorable. Her part, perhaps, involves a lot of suffering, but she can express all kinds of feelings very well. Kirstie Alley is very attractive and truly memorable as the abolitionist Virgilia Hazard. Phillip Casnoff is worth considering as Elkanah Bent horribly ambitious as well as David Carradine as a monster husband, disgusting Justin LaMotte. And in contrast to it, a mention must be made of Jean Simmons, who is truly excellent as the mother of Orry, whose heart beats for the glory of family life and concord of union. <br /> <br /> Third, memorable moments of the "North and South" leave an unchanging trait in mind. Who can forget the first meeting of Orry and Madeleine - what a charm, what kindness there is in this scene! Or is it possible to skip the moment that Madeleine's father dies? I found it very powerful, there is a real drama at this point, a drama of a woman being left by someone who really loved her. I also liked the sequence of Churubusco and George Hazard so worried about the life of their dearest friend, Orry. So your meetings with Constance are great. Virgilia's speech in Philadelphia is a performance masterpiece. And the final moment of the first part: although the North and the South can separate, their friendship will never die. Orry and George symbolically join the movement of the train. There are simply so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it is impossible to mention even half of them here. And those beautiful songs from Bill Conti and filmed in brilliant landscapes. The music in "North and South" is very touching and memorable. <br /> <br /> What to say in the end? "North and South" is a true must have on DVD, simply an incredible TV series about the victory of everything that is precious in us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truthfulness, absolute fidelity. 9/10
