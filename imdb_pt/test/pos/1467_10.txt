This movie is a very beautiful and slow movie. There's nothing Hollywood about it. It's very Danish and the characters are very real. It is the first Danish film to tackle this transsexual theme. It's really about love that has no gender. I would not say it's about lesbian love, although the two main characters (the veronika transsexual and Charlotte) attract each other. It's a story about love and life. <br /> <br /> The story practically happens in both apartments. There is almost no background music, which makes it seem more real and intense. The two actors who play the main characters are great. They really make them look real. They are not archetypes, but real people you could find on the street. I think it's the first time I've seen a transsexual portraying this well. Well done.
