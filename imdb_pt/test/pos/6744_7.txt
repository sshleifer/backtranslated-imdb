In this crackerjack noir thriller from Columbia, which is a combination of Panic In The Streets and The Naked City, Evelyn Keyes is, without knowing, The Killer That Stalked New York. Evelyn, who smuggled some stolen jewels into Cuba, smuggled smallpox. He is misdiagnosed by doctor William Bishop and when they find out what the hunt he is doing. <br /> <br /> For most of the film, the Treasury Department is also hunting Keyes, but for the contraband jewels. It is not until near the end of the film that the health department and the police realize they are looking for the same woman. <br /> <br /> Evelyn is also on a mission. Her husband, Charles Korvin, left her apartment, the most impolite of all that he was playing with his sister while she was in Cuba collecting precious stones and contracting smallpox. When Lola Albright as her sister commits suicide throughout the case, Evelyn is on a mission, get Korvin or die trying. And this is not an idle threat given the situation. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed mainly in New York as The Naked City and its cast is generously sprinkled with many names and familiar faces. Keep an eye on the good performances of Connie Gilchrist as Evelyn's disgruntled owner, Jim Backus as a club owner, and Art Smith as about Korvin. <br /> <br /> A real sleep in the noir category, do not miss if transmitted.
