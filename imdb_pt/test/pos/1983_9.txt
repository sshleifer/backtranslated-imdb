eXistenZ combines the traditional love of director David Cronenberg with blood and blood and heads exploding with the more confusing aspects of a reality that distorts David Lynch's film. And this really works effectively. I will not bother trying to give the bones of a plot synopsis here, because this will only cause more confusion. All you need to know is that the movie is about such an incredibly realistic virtual reality computer game that it becomes difficult to distinguish between reality and virtual reality. The film almost seems to leave its point of technological fear at the end, but then launches the latest turn in the last line of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> There are also some very rough sexual images based around the 'bio -ports' on the backs of the protagonists, as well as some very crude performances by Jude Law. He can seem naive, stupid and boring and any other annoying habit that you might care to think about. Jason Jennifer Leigh does much better, and everyone can be called supporting character, including Willem Dafoe in a functional, yet not spectacular, role as a money-mad mechanic. Overall, eXistenZ is a very effective science fiction film about the possibilities that technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive.
