Many horror fans complain that horror has barely progressed in the last twenty years. I was inclined to agree to this until the influx of Asian horror films, a trend that admittedly became monotonous. However, it produced some real classics, and A Tale Of Two Sisters, at least for me, stands out as an exceptional piece of cinema, and perhaps the best horror film in a long time. <br /> <br /> Vaguely based on a popular Korean tale, tells the sad story of two mentally disturbed sisters residing with their father and stepmother. After experiencing some problems on their first night back home, they decide to join and deny their stepmother access to their upcoming relationship. The tension increases and there is the inevitable snap. But what happens after that requires more than a pair of eyes, as the story takes several twists, and the scares become more emotional and real. In the end, you may need a few moments to absorb everything and put it all together in your own mind, but it is exactly this pair of horror and mystery that takes you beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic. One to watch again and again, just to sort it all out.
