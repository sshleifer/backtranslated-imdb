When I first saw Stella in the central comedy I thought "God, this is awful!" But I loved Wet Hot American Summer. So I knew something did not make sense. There was nothing left to do but look for Stella's shorts, which I heard she contained more consolation than any other comedy troupe out there. When I met them, not only did my expectations of solace meet, but I probably found the biggest comedy scenes I've seen in years. The set of twenty foreign short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs. Not only did I laugh at my ass the first time I watched them, but I kept laughing more when I watched them over and over again. It's really a shame that Comedy Central has the restrictions on cable television for the Stella series. That would have been much better on HBO or Showtime. His mark of humor can not be restricted by censors or popular culture. Given even though it was on HBO, I'm sure the "masses" would have voted canceled in a season or less, but it would still have been fantastic. Needless to say, I am now in love with Stella and all her individual members. Any fan of Stella should check out David Wain's website with all his short films. They are as nice as Stella herself. So my hat goes to Michael Showalter, Michael Ian Black and David Wain for the unbelievable comedy they did with Stella. I hope to see a lot more of the troupe in the future.
