I did not see this movie until it appeared on television because I doubted comic movies. Since the series "Batman," "Spawn," "Judge Dredd," and many other pious bombs, I have shirked everything at all costs. I would question in my mind: "Why can not someone make a movie that is rated R and stay true to the story, how hard is that?" And finally my prayers were answered with Blade. This movie appears straight from the pages to the screen with pure violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, good versus evil, etc. Yes, of course many action movies contain all these things, and most of them bombed. But not Blade, the film was filmed the right way, not exaggerating, delivering a good time and never a moment of boredom. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Blade is actually one of the best comic movies I've seen in a long time.
