I do not know why there are no articles or posters or anything about this movie because I just saw it and thought it was AMAZING. I think it's not for everyone because it's basically "The Trial" by Kafka and "Beevis and Butt-Head", which is a pretty difficult combination to swallow. Still, I thought it was great. If you're going to see why you want a sequel to Office Space, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you want to see one of the most brutal, tongue-in-cheek and hilarious and honest looks from where our society is going, you're ready for a treat. I just watched the opening night of 8pm in Los Angeles and there were only 12 people in the movie, which means the movie will probably be gone by a week. This is really a shame because, in its way, Idiocracy is one of the best satires that have come up for a long time. But again, it's basically making fun of the people who make up about 99% of the movie audience, so I guess it's no wonder the studio panicked and tried to dump it.
