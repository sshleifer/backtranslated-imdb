Tiny Tweet and Sly, the sneak are locked in cages for a train ride to who knows where. Swinging Tweety starts singing an unbearable song as soon as the train leaves the station, then leaves the hope that Puddy Tad will pick it up this time. Sly experiences a couple of funny hand tricks, but spoils the sports master and puts the bird in a safer place among the luggage. The cat's next attempt leads him to end up in the coal-fired oven of the steam engine. And the chase is happening. Of course there's a bulldog too, and Sly the fool can not keep his mouth shut. <br /> <br /> Then the persistent pussy tries the old stacking of the bags (twice) producing a reward Tex Avery would be proud of. Unfortunately for Sylvester, that bulldog seems to be everywhere. He even displays a talent for shaping and producing huge clubs from the back pocket. Not even the Sylvesters' ability to overtake a high-speed train can save him when he is expelled, the Silver Streak style, several times in a row. Arriving at the new location of the grandmother, (Gower Gulch, population 86) the cat's final attempt involves transvestite. But you know what happens to men in dresses, they always get more attention than they expected. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
