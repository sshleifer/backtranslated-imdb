Roopa (Kamalinee Mukherjee) loses his parents and other family members in a horrible car crash. She begins to live alone as an independent woman without the help of her relatives. She has a boyfriend named Rahul (Anuj) and is about to marry him, but she recoils because of the behavior of her future mother-in-law and because of the lack of confidence shown by her boyfriend. Anand (Raja) joins his neighborhood. And he begins to make Roopa feel comfortable and secure. The rest of the story is about why Anand - MD of the richest corporate house in the PA - has chosen to reside as Roopa's neighbor and what will come next. <br /> <br /> This movie has a freshness that you rarely see in Indian films for that. Although the story is slow, you have a sense of familiarity with it. Many compliments to director Shekhar Kamule for such an incredible direction! Bright music and background score composed by K.M. Radhakrishnan increases quality. Kamalini mukherjee as Rupa gave a wonderful performance. I think she was the best choice for this role because of her non glamorous and amazing histrionic appearance. Anand as Raja did well as well. I watched this movie three times and enjoyed it all the time. It's a lesson beyond the daily dose of action movies we have here. Highly recommended!!
