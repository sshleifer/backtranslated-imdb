I myself am a physics student, and I must say I think this is one of the best "popular" presentations of string theory out there. The Smart Universe manages to make the whole topic of string theory (although actually M) accessible to a wider audience. Some popular science programs think the best approach is just to throw the audience in the bottom of the pit, throwing technical jargon at them without any explanation, and presenting the theory in a boring, obsolete style. This program goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics, and explains the issues that need to be resolved between the two, so we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe on a large and small scale. <br /> <br /> I suppose some might say that it is slow and takes a long time to get to interesting things like extra dimensions and wormholes, but the question is: this is against the point. Explaining string theory from the outset is almost impossible without at least mentioning physics at its base, and the way it is explained in The Elegant Universe is clear and fun. <br /> <br /> Whether you're going to like this program really depends on whether you're willing to maybe initially baffled by some of the ideas that Greene presents: extra dimensions and space-time distortion are not exactly prevalent in everyday life , are? But if you persevere with some of the more exotic concepts of this program, you will see that it will give you insight into the research that drives the world of physics today. And if you're studying physics as well, it's great entertainment as well as you'll probably be able to follow this and enjoy it even more!
