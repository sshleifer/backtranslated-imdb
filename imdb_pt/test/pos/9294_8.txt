The hilarious team that brought you 'CNNNN' and 'The Chaser Decides' returned to ABC with their new series, 'The Chaser War On Everything'. Filmed in front of a live audience, the Chaser team once again does what it does best - satirizing key political figures, international celebrities and media personalities. <br /> <br /> Satire is simply invaluable, and nothing is sacred. In recent weeks, the team of hunters chased alongside the queen (during her visit to Australia) to try to have John Howard fired and had Kim Beazley (Aust. Opposition leader) threaten to kneecap them. A particularly funny segment is "Mr. Ten Questions," featuring an overly enthusiastic reporter approaching celebrities (recently Charlize Theron and The Backstreet Boys) and asks them ten questions such as "what is the ideal size of the rice grain? " Just for the record, Theron ignored him and left, and one of the Backstreet Boys was annoyed and "refused to dignify with an answer." <br /> <br /> One segment that recently left me in points was when one of the team decided to become a 'statue busker' to earn some extra money. When he realized how desperate he was, he placed a royal statue in its place. THE PERFECT SCAM! He earned thirty dollars in twenty minutes! <br /> <br /> A brilliant satire of everything in Australian society. Two thumbs up! <br /> <br /> (By the way, the show will not be showing for the three weeks after Easter, because "although the team are all atheists, they too are hypocrites.")
