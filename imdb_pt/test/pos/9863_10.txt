I must warn you, there are some spoilers in it. But to begin with, I have "Spanish Judges" in February, I think. It was mentioned that it was the last copy, but as I see it was not asked back. But anyway, I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor, Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised anyone in the comments mentioned the scar), although it's a bit low budget, getting enough money to make this movie worth spending. Dude, what a good actor. <br /> <br /> The story is about a cheater known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who "claims" to have goods called The Spanish Judges. If you do not know what the Spanish judges are or have not seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read, I will not even tell what they are. I think it would be a great turnaround for anyone to know what it was. He needs protection, so he hires a couple who are also cheaters, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino), as well as a thug who goes by the name of Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a girlfriend who will not even tell anyone her name because she's from Mars, as she said. So they (mostly Jack) call her "Mars Girl". It all starts well, but then it turns into a great game. A game that involves some lust, lies and betrayal. <br /> <br /> There were some performances (Matt and Valeria, as well as Tamara, were not one of them). There were some scenes that could have done better and the punctuation could have been a bit better as well. Some of the scores were really good. The theme they used for the beginning and end (before the credits) was a good choice of songs, that's my opinion. The fight scene at the end could have been a little longer and a bit more violent, but what can you do? One more comment about Matt: Damn, he plays a smooth, smooth con man. <br /> <br /> I know this is a review, but I need to make a correction in relation to NeCRo, one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer. According to this site, she has acted since 1983. For me, and hopefully for others, she is well-known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love interest in both "Hot Shots!" movies. But good review. <br /> <br /> Although I think it's one of the rare movies I've seen and it's really good (and that's why I gave it 10 stars above), I'll give the note of what I thought when I saw it first time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
