The idea is not original ... If you've seen this kind of story before, you would know what the end would be after watching for the first 20 minutes ... the script, the positioning of the actors and the display is also obvious ... If you have not seen this story before, it is definitely a good experience, you will appreciate the turnaround in the end ... be sure to see it again after knowing the "truth", you will even more enjoy the plots ... Even though I had a right guess at the beginning, I still could not help but stay in my place until the end ... Conclusion: A must see! ! This Korea is better than any recent movie of the genre of Japan ... forget Hollywood! <br /> <br /> Do not miss out !!
