Anyone who correctly identifies opening images as God killing himself without reading the final credits certainly deserves a free ticket to a nursing home in Transylvania. I imagine this as being a favorite movie in "Twin Peaks" dark lodge on movie night if the weather existed there. I would have thought a better title might have been: "How much fun can you have with someone who is almost dead in the woods with only Neolithic technology?" The answer, it seems, is a little. So, despite the silly "God killing himself," the uber-pretentiousness (an appropriate phrase taken from an earlier letter), more clearly "Alistair Crowley - Hi, I am the Beast, deal with it!" than Christian cosmology (I can not believe that another spectator had a hard head to see the Judeo-Christian Bible in this) ... despite all this ... this is a bold and important work that most people should not to see. I am impressed and frightened by the fact that it was done.
