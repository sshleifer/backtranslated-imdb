His fantasy adventures John Dark-Kevin Connor were one of the pillars of summer vacation movies in the days before Star Wars: they were not masterpieces, they did not have the latest special effects, but they were exactly what an audience of children they wanted a movie in the mid-'70s. At the Earth's Core picks the right tone for Burroughs' aptly-named adventure about Victorian inventor Peter Cushing and the inevitable Doug McClure ending up in the underworld of Pelucidar and fighting against their evil telepathic dinosaurs. This time the puppets are gone in favor of men in monster costumes, which is a lot more fun if you're willing to suspend their disbelief, and if you're not, there's always the neckline of Caroline Munro to look at. In addition to what may be Peter Cushing's worst performance, an annoying but more docile reissue of his film Dr Who ("You Can not Hypnotise Me, I'm British!"), It's Easily the Best of John Dark-Kevin Connor- Doug McClure fantasy adventures, surprisingly well run and sporting an atmospheric use of colors. Never especially good in outdoor scenes, Alan Hume's photography gains immensely from the control that a studio gives him (the film was filmed entirely in studio) to paint a vivid and sinister world, worthy of a novel cover. Art not loud, but definitely great Saturday matinee fun.
