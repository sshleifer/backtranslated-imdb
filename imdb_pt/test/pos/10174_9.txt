Lots of funny scenes about the people you normally do not pay attention to in a movie and what they need to do to get a job and what happens when they do it. Lou Myers was very funny as Half-Step Wilson. Any guy who has a small group of friends can relate to many non-movie scenes scattered throughout the film.
