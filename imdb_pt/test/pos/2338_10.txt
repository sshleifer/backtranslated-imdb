I just watched the DVD of this award-winning movie. One Life Stand is an austere drama that, through its rhythm, black and white images and ambient music, presents a very convincing and honest image. It's a story about the dilemma of life around power, sex and control highlighted by some sad and lonely lives. The mother (very well represented by Maureen Carr) is tense and attracted by herself. The father appears only on the sidelines, yet it is a powerful and fundamental part of the drama. The money is hidden in boxes and shoes. <br /> <br /> The writing was superb, and I liked the sensual close-ups of details like nails, red lips, a candle, mirrors, etc. used made it very intimate. It's a harrowing tale, with sexual tones, while Glasgow's drizzle in the dark streets heightens the despair of the sad characters. <br /> <br /> There are some highly memorable shots simply transmitted by a sidewalk, or a fallen shoulder. - like Trise moving away under the bridge. And the look stunned and hurt on Trise's face in the call center, which hopes to help people use tarot cards while she hears a conversation of her own abuse. At first, we see John Paul, wide-eyed and innocent, took pictures while he tried to model. Trise, her mother, is deluded and making bad choices for him, somehow pushing him away while she tries to keep him. John Paul's modeling becomes a companion job and the Trise boss offers his money and eventually they go on a date. There are also moments of humor and subtle irony. An excellent scene is when they are having a fairly normal meal, and they begin to open up a little, when the father appears with his dark presence and clouds everything. But this and other things offer moments of hope. <br /> <br /> I felt at times that the pace of the film was a little too intense, but that's a little detail in another challenging and memorable film, and something a little different. It is in initial contrast to most American films, which are either total fantasy, or the real "world" seen through contaminated glasses. This film portrays life with all its edges and displays unforgettable images. <br /> <br /> This is not 'light entertainment' but a thought-provoking and real drama. <br /> <br /> One Life Stand is a truly engaging and emotionally honest film.
