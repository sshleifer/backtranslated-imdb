Some might think Imaginary Heroes is a movie just like "Igby Goes Down," but it's not. In Imaginary Heroes, the director lets us feel for the Travis family and the people around them. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is great, and the acting is extremely well done. The acting of Weaver and Hirsch is believable and helps make the movie what it is. The actors, director / writer, Dan Harris, made a movie that many people should see. Do not think that this is just another teen movie, it's a movie about a family and their problems. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 10/10 because I believe it is not the best movie, that no movie can be, but it is as close as it can get perfect.
