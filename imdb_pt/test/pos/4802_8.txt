you know I've seen a lot of bad hong kong films in terms of production and they were good. But running out of time was great. <br /> <br /> I think what made it so good was that Andy Lau and Ching Wang had such good chemistry. The movie at the beginning is very fast, but slows down enough to note that it's also good, we do not want to have a heart attack, lol. In terms of plot, it is enough of other things to keep you interested. Lau has some good moments while wearing makeup to represent people from the underworld. Also the film has the best cast of oriental support since "House of Flying Daggers". <br /> <br /> The movie is great because it is so unpredictable and leaves you thinking about every corner. Definitely a good rental with tons of comedy, action and thrills pact on one, 8 of 10
