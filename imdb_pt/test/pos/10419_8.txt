I put this movie in line on a whim after a recent trip to NYC, and I could not believe I'd never heard of it anywhere! It has all the ingredients of a cult classic, starting with the characters. They are archetypical roles that we recognize in every aspect of everyday life, but were so nuanced and fully realized by the actors who played them (Peter Stormare and Bai Ling's performances were particularly strong). Their interactions are poignant and ingrained and at the same time overflow with a subtle and peculiar humor that is (unfortunately) very rare in American films today. Screenwriter and director Ramin Niami does a beautiful job of weaving these scenes into a funny and moving picture of a city of the past. Highly recommended!
