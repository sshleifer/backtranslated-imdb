I did not read the book. do not even care. the movie was a beautiful novel, and I think women will like it. No, it was not a "10" movie, but it was fun. women, if your man is bored like mine was, then observe yourself. to hurt is wonderful as the philosophical doctor who does a thoughtful monologue on "love" and "love." <br /> <br /> Also, if you like nick cage, it was great and funny. I enjoyed watching the developing novel. <br /> <br /> Also, if you like Christian bales - see it in balance. this is a science fiction movie "10". <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. ignore the previous user's comments. <br /> <br /> One - especially women !! Also visit my website on my behalf as a word and a "dot" with.
