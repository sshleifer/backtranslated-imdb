How can anyone say DARE to say something bad about this movie? Forgive Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier every time you watch. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this, I cried with so much laughter. Everything about it is funny. Although "Robin Hood: Men In Tights" is not my favorite comedy (that place is taken by "Real Genius"), it's in my book. Then go and see! If you do not spend all your time laughing, at least you'll spend all your time drooling over Cary Elwes.
