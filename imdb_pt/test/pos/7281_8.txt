This is a very dark film, a little better than the average movie Asylum. It was a lot better than I thought it would be, it's a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The voice on the phone is really creepy - this faceless voice, this unfamiliar, threatening voice works very well in the movie, since we never see the face of the killer being left to the viewer's imagination. the suspense never decompose and, after the first half of the film, becomes dizzying; There is not much blood in this film, just enough to serve the story and also the director does a good job at holding their attention. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie an 8/10 because some clich√©s.
