One of the great successes of The Decline of Western Civilization, the indie discovery of filmmaker Penelope Spheeris, is that it may attract non-punk and hardcore fans. Most importantly, it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely "market-worthy" when bands played (or at least tried to play in some cases) in dirty and dirty clubs to an audience that had both self- respect as they had respect for bands. For the fan, like me, there are precious interviews with some of Los Angeles' punk legends, some dead, some still alive and still working on the scene. Presentations and interviews include The Circle Jerks, X, Black Flag (in pre-Henry Rollins days), Catholic Discipline, Fear, Alice Bag Band and most memorable (in my opinion) being the germs . While I knew some of the bands and artists in the film (The Jerks and Black Flag mostly), I had only heard rumors about the singer (the late) Darby Crash, and from the filming in the movie he seems to be one of, if not the epitomes of the punk movement. He does not take himself too seriously, he loves to drink, sometimes when he talks it's full jargon, and the attitude he brings onstage is both fun and amusing. A performer like this would probably scare Steve Miller and Jackson Browne of their skins. <br /> <br /> Decline of the Western Civilization may not connect all non-punk fans looking for this movie (hard to find on video), but it also should not necessarily turn them off. As a type of anthropologist who entered the party, Spheeris shows the behavior of these people, their motives, their likes and dislikes, and the power that was in their people on and off-screen. Some of them almost come out normally, others do not, but they are offensive only to those who are not very open to things. Also, the film is a must-see for the types of kids who think they're punk fans just because they hear Good Charlotte and Blink-182: If you want to get an idea of ​​the movement and rock genre you profess to love, pioneers.
