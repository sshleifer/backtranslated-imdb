When the noble Hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping clan Samanosuke, faithful Kogenta (Jun Fujimaki) escapes with his eight-year-old son Tadafumi and his daughter, Kozasa. They are housed by the Shinobu priestess (Otome Tsukimiya), who serves the god of the Hanabusa clan, Majin, a vengeful spirit imprisoned in the giant stature carved into the slope of a local mountain. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) seek revenge against Lord Samanosuke (Yutaro Gomi), but are caught in the attempt and sentenced to die. Priestess Shinobu, desperately trying to save her master, threatens Samanosuke with the displeasure of the god, only to be cut to the death by his efforts. Samanosuke, a vain, cruel and narrow man, orders that the statue of Majin be destroyed in order to crush any last vestige of hope among the remnants loyal to Hanabusa. But the god Majin, who has hitherto been relentlessly silent, has other ideas ... <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a fascinating, timeless and deeply moving fairy tale. Richly produced in a respectable budget, it is a film about values: the values ​​of nobility, justice, decency, loyalty, self-sacrifice and love. It is about hierarchy and rule and the consequences of not fulfilling the responsibility that the rule implies. These are things about which we are not much talked about in our demodocus times except scribbling frogs like William Bennet, but they are relevant, and Daimajin shows us why. <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a perfect example of why Japanese cinema is so glorious. The values ​​listed above have palpable relevance to those involved in this film, as they do for many Japanese filmmakers. There is no service of mouth, no condescension, no irony here. Instead, there is an authentic effort to conjure up a world where those values ​​can once again have life and show what happens when they become suspended. Just compare Daimajin, or the Lone Wolf and Cub series, or any Kurosawa movie to Tarantino's nihilistic Kill Bill b * llshit, to see what I mean. In a film whose contributing talent is so uniformly excellent, I would just like to emphasize the majestic brand of master Akira Ifikuba, the talent and beauty of the actors Jun Fujimaki, Yoshihiko Aoyama and Miwi Takada; and the stunning portrait of Otome Tsukimiya. His death scene is one of the most moving and significant that I have ever witnessed.
