I really enjoyed this movie about the love between two adults in postwar Britain. The high standards of BBC TV are evident in production, and the excellent leading actors (Claire Bloom and Joss Ackland) make this experience edifying. Bloom and Ackland have worked together in the theater, and their chemistry and interaction are splendid. I recommend this version of Shadowlands over the 1993 film version.
