I think the basic idea of ​​any movie is to entertain or inform. If you want information, you are watching real life movies and historical movies. Sometimes these are one of the same. The other side of the coin is to entertain. Hitch entertained me? Yes, it happened. Ok, the formula is standard. Boy knows girl or in this case boys meet girls. They come together, have a fight, then come back together. However, the way it happened in this movie was refreshing. I particularly enjoyed the bar scene with Hitch and Sara. Allegra Albert's novel was a delight to watch unfold, most REAL men are timid when it comes to wooing the woman of their dreams and if I had Hitch's advice, I would probably have placed my wife at the altar in half the time . first comment about this movie that seemed to suggest that this movie was played safely and good had some more laughs. I tend to disagree with so many laughs that you can put on a romantic comedy without turning it into a scam. Beyond relationships, there are serious moments. In spite of everything, I found Hitch a lot of fun, the actors did a good job (I'll be looking for them in other movies) and Hitch is a movie that I'm very happy to have in my DVD collection.
