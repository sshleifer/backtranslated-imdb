.. is the princess bride attends ... well Trainspotting. But wait, really, it's a good combination! This was definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time ... there's the kind of spirited dialogue I associate with the Promised Princess or Cemetery man along with the disgusting scenes of violence from a horror movie ... the heroic feel of the Promised Princess combined with the (that's weird) lack of any really good guy Trainspotting had. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it was as GOOD as the Promised Princess, but it was in the arena, and rocked. Some of the dialogues transcend from pleasing to brilliant, the plot is interesting, the characters - though slightly anachronistic - are anachronistic, not because of their intrinsic nature (there were blithely gaudy people in the eighteenth century, contrary to the observations of a previous critic), but only in a little of the language they used. Anachronisms have made this fun, but NOT cheesy and easily discarded. <br /> <br /> If you've ever read some Simon R. Green or Gleen Cook's Garrett series, you know EXACTLY what the movie is about. Check out. It's great.
