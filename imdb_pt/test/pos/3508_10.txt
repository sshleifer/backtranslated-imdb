I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut out way. I screened him on video a few years ago and saw him again. The film, though slow and slightly odd (the mountain men seem very strange), the atmosphere was strangely effective. It's one of my favorite horror movies and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except in the US where it was accidentally placed in a horror compilation!). Too bad you can not get this movie the way it should be seen. A wrong turn (the recent film produced by Stan Winston) owes much to Just Before Dawn. One of the best horror films of the 80's and deserves to be seen by a wider audience.
