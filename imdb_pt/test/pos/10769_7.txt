Interestingly, the Independent Film Channel showed this movie a week after it showed KARATE BEAR FIGHTER - even though the bear movie was the second in the trilogy and this movie was the first !!! What were they thinking ?! While all three of these movies are supposedly based on the life of this great karate master Kyokushin, you can not help but think that they must have embellished the story a bit - especially in this first movie. Of course, the guy evidently fought and killed a bull and then a bear (actually he fought and killed MANY bulls during his career), but in this movie in the early 50's at the end of the movie, the hero actually fights about 60 faces and kills many of them brutally. I just can not imagine that this actually occurred. So I did some checks and found out that although many of the details are correct, part of that movie is pure bunk! Yes, he killed a man in self-defense and yes, he followed the widow and his son and spent a year working for them - trying to get them to forgive him. But the end of the movie is great to watch, but bullshit. Seeing one of your opponents have a team shoved in your head and all the other bloody details could not have happened or else the Japanese government would have locked Oyama to protect society! The movie is fun and the fight is great. There are no complaints about the action or action. The only minor complaint is the camera work - which is a bit sloppy during some of the fight scenes. Despite this little complaint, this is a very nice film. In many ways, the master theme of karate is very similar to the Zatoichi movies - which are also very fun to watch, but many of the exploits are really impossible. <br /> <br /> FYI - There is an Englished nicknamed version of this movie titled "Death Champion" and I also saw that too. It's not a bad dubbing and it was letter box (a big plus), but I still prefer the subtitled version.
