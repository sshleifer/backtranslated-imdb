A sentimental and thrilling family film set in England in the 1920s. A young Elizabeth Taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter it at the Grand National; Fortunately, former jockey Mickey Rooney is close by to help Liz. Director Clarence Brown exhibits remarkable control over material that might have been excessively mushy in someone else's hands. He and the writers Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves take great care in establishing genuine characterizations and developing the story naturally. It's true that there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced, but overall it's quite stunning and beautifully filmed in Technicolor. The race itself is quite exciting, and like so many great classics, there is a wonderful fade-out of three hankie in the end. Liz proves that she was a real troop from the start, and Rooney - which I find annoying - is surprisingly subdued and really very good. Donald Crisp is terrible as the rough father of Liz and Angela Lansbury is a delight as his big sister, boy-crazy. Most of the praise, however, belongs to Anne Revere, who won a richly supporting supporting actress Oscar, playing Liz's wise and caring mother.
