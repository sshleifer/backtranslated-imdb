A film about the relationship between a man and a leopard reminiscent of "The English Patient," even in a scene similar to when the Ralph Fiennes character carries his lover's body across a desert-rock cliff. In "The Passion in the Desert", the main character carries the body of the leopard through a rocky cliff, but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short story of Balzac, the film is not perfect but a pleasure no less. The final shot will haunt me for weeks. (8 out of 10)
