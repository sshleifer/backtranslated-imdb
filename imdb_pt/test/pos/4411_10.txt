"Flesh" is difficult to describe with a solid resume because, well, basically there is a plot. The film pretty much shows the day in the life of a drug dealer named Joe (Joe Dallesandro, who is in the underrated photo of Louis Malle "Black Moon") while doing his rounds, sleeping and modeling himself to make money to pay. Not much, movie is quite long, you would think "Flesh" would be a slow and boring hour and a half. You think wrong. The film is composed of improvisation, there is no screenplay and the angles of the film are very much in place, but there is some kind of truth in each frame that gives the film a fun entertainment vibe. It all makes sense and serves purpose in what happens to Joe on this day. He meets an ordinary friend who is obviously lying when he says he wants to see Joe again, a photographer who talks so much that he bores Joe to tears, two drag queens reading tabloid magazines when Joe gets the head of a rat-like addict who then talks about how she wants to be breastfed, an old friend of Joe who reads male rape stories about him, and then a final scene with his wife and his lover that echoes the scene at the beginning of the movie (one of the best openings for a movie that I have seen in some time)? and talks completely about what the film is philosophically about. It's amazing how the movie's messages and styles seem almost timeless, despite being set in New York City in the 1960s in real time, in real place, and filmed as an independent independent film of that era. It certainly is not a movie that could be made today, which adds to its delicious mystique. <br /> <br /> Fed by unexpected cuts; and missing a score to advance your images? "Flesh" is as raw, brave as a movie about male prostitution in the 60s can get.
