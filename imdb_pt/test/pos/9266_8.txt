This movie is so unlike anything you would have seen before. It is an honest and chilling account of the battle of the whole family with a terminal illness. <br /> <br /> "The Closer She Gets" is filmed in a unique style. Craig Oulette films in a very different way ... using different angles and points of view, which I think is a very attractive way (perhaps because of his experience with photographic work). His style gives a clear picture not only of what the patient is facing, but also of what people close to him also need to deal with. <br /> <br /> A very sad but extremely interesting and unique film. One that I definitely would suggest watching.
