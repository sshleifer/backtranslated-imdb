(r # 88) Brilliant show, great fun, with spectacular effects. Any fan of these prehistoric reptiles has to see this. CGI fits in well with the environment and it's just fun to watch these giants walk about their daily business as casually as Discovery Channel. This show was a stroke of genius and blows its followers "Walking with beasts" and "The future is wild" out of the water. <br /> <br /> The biggest episode was definitely the last, where we have to watch the final days of Tyrannosaurus Rex and the onslaught of meteors that have become his doom. This material is almost too incredible for television. How about a theatrical release? I would pay anything to see these dinosaurs in the movies. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a show that can be spectacular, engaging and educational at the same time, this is for you. Dinosaurs have never been so cool.
