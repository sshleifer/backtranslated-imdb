How these guys keep going? They are about 50 each, and act as if they were only 30 years old. They play 3 hours of music at all shows, and barely give a beating. This DVD is their first show in Rio, Brazil. Although people do not speak English, they try to memorize words from Rush's most famous songs, and try to sing a foreign language at the show with their best friends. <br /> <br /> From Tom Sawyer to The Spirit of Radio, this concert DVD will keep you in the chair, not wanting to pause or get away from the classics you heard when you were young. This is their 30th reunion tour (started in 1974). I went to the Scranton PA show, and it was so good, although in PA they did not play on Freewill, so I was upset. <br /> <br /> They have Freewill, they have The Trees, they have YYZ, The Pass, Driven, Dreamline, Red Sector A, Limelight, Roll the Bones, 2112, and more. 10 out of 10, because nothing else compares. If you've never been to a Rush show, buy at least that DVD.
