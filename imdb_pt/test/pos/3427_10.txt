Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is rarely one of my favorites, said that everyone should see this film as something that can help heal the world .... <br /> <br /> It's one of the most moving movies I have seen and complies with Tutu's comments .... I've read many reviews and as long as they range from good to medium to comments on the choice of actors ... The fact is that it handles one of the most extraordinary events in our world. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission ... for the first time, a country has chosen to spread its horrible story, find a way forward and create a way to heal people ... <br /> <br /> The movie begins with White cop being offered a chance to acquit himself for brutal crimes and the Black guy is trying to ensure that he does not get away with it, he plunges into the humanity of the people and the huge need for healing that we all needs .... < <br /> Definitely a thumbs up ..... To all involved .... Once again, I am proud to be South African ..... <br /> <br /> One interesting comment can be found here: http://www.biz-community.com/Article/196/97/5223.html
