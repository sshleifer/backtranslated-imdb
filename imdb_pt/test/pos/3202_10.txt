This movie surprised me. I thought I knew a little about the turmoil in the Attica jail. After seeing this, I see that I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the lawyer and the black prisoner. Both the personal history of these two men and the unfolding of the courtroom drama were fascinating. The flashback sequences in prison were incredible. It's hard to believe that it was not documentary footage, it was so real. It was not just a big drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper. I give you two thumbs up.
