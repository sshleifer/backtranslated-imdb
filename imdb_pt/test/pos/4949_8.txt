Iron Eagle may not be the most compelling movie, but the characters are well written and very well represented. If you can not believe the characters, the movie is a failure. <br /> <br /> I believe that photography, especially aerial photography, is superb. I believe it is far superior to the Top Gun to which it is infinitely compared. It's one of the best aerial photos I've ever seen. The soundtrack of Basil Paledouros (forgive the spelling) is great, and juxtaposes well with the rock songs. I wish this portion of the soundtrack were available. <br /> <br /> Jason Gedrick does well as the teenager who suddenly has to grow up in a hurry and with the realities of life, death and responsibilities. Lou Gossett are fabulous as Chappy, both tough and still human when remembering the deaths of pilots. <br /> <br /> There are many movies out there that you watch once and you do not mind watching again. Then there are those movies that give you one look or another and you can watch it again and again! Iron Eagle is that kind of movie!
