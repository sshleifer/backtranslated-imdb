THE KITE RUNNER is one of those modern epics with which someone is occasionally graced. Spanning two continents, several family generations and many decades, this film tackles a multitude of items including friendship, love, loss and ultimately redemption. <br /> <br /> The main engine is young Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi), a native Afghan boy who often plays with hired help; especially the young Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), a Hazara boy whose family is supposed to be inferior to the dominant Afghans. But the two form a bond of friendship based on education (Amir teaches Hassan to read), the closeness in the house of Amir and, of course, the kite flying. <br /> <br /> But the bad times are on the way to town. of Kabul. The Communists are invading and Amir and Hassan have separated because of a brutal act of prejudice from an Afghan boy against Hassan. The two of you may never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Amir's father runs to get him and his son out of Afghanistan, eventually finding their way to America. Here the two set up a gas station and live hand in hand selling in niche markets. And as Amir's father gradually becomes ill, a new revelation will strike the heart of Amir; one he can not ignore and requires his return to his beloved Kabul. <br /> <br /> A study of friendship, war and reconciliation, The Kite Runner is truly a fantastic piece of cinema. History is never improperly spoken in English whenever we are in a foreign country and we only break English whenever we are in America. This was refreshing and lent itself to a sense of realism. <br /> <br /> The performance was according to the best you'll see too. Special note should be made of Homayoun Ershadi, who plays Baba, Amir's sick father and strong patriarch. Also leading Khalid Abdalla as the elder Amir is played well, especially when returning to Kabul to find him in ruin; the contrast of when he left. <br /> <br /> Afghanistan's cinematography during Amir's escape and final return is nothing short of impressive, with snow-covered peaks that will make your mouth loosen. I do not know exactly what mountain range they used in the movie, but wherever I am, I want to go there and film it!) But it's not the cinematography or acting of one or two people who make this film a success. It's a simple story that says very well that it makes any movie observer worthwhile. Highly recommended.
