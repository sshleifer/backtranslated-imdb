I usually love SRK as a villain (how can you not?) And I believe SRK and Juhi are a perfect match on the screen, as both are actually cooler than cute. <br /> <br /> This movie is great note, although it has some important flaws: 1) the good guy (Sunny) - not only is he much less attractive than Shahrukh (which , in my opinion, is soooo important in Bollyfilms), but its role has no character - it would be much better if there was a conflict between two strong personalities, instead we have a conflict between a personality and a medium soldier <br /> < 2) Kiran and Sunil's reactions to Rahul's actions are incredibly silly and naÃ¯ve even for a Bollywood production. But all this is not as important compared to the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere, great (really great) and (let's say again) Shahrukh as a villain, I just love him when he's so heathen <br /> <br /> Must Do (along with Anjaam, Baazigar and Duplicate)
