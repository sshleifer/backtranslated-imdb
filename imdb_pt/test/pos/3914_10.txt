People are stupid. You should not cheer when Paris is killed in the head with a pipe! It's quite rude! What did Paris do to you? What if it were you? You would not want people to applaud your death! Anyway, it was really bloody, which I liked and it was cool when Elisha's finger was cut. It was strange with this turnaround that they did not have 2 kids, they had tree and everything. That makes way for a House of Wax 2: Ressurction or something. Paris was great at the chase scene. The chemistry of Elisha and Chad is great, they deserve an Oscar. My friends and I were cracking when that guy said it's hot when Paris and Cousin Skeeter's face kissing.
