This film reaches the heart with a reality like no other I have seen. It shows what we in a democratic society take for granted, and only what we are fortunate not to be experiencing. The acting in the film is superb, sometimes you have to remember that the film is a drama, not real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all roles), making the interrogator totally dimensional and human. The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of being in the "round" theater, which does not add or take away the thrill of action. This film seeks to open the eyes of the viewer, and I would say that they have succeeded with this goal. .
