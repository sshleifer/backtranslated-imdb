Lifeforce (1985) was a Cannon-sponsored film directed by Tobe Hooper. It's a very interesting movie that deals with a pair of space vampires that are accidentally brought back to Earth during the most recent shuttle mission. Steve Railsback stars as the sole survivor of the tragedy. But really personal the movie is a mere showcase for the natural beauty of Mathilda May. She is a hot smoking number. The director was a big fan of the Female Vampire (aka Erotikill). Miss May recreates the title role of Lina Romay The film is beautifully photographed and directed. There are many bloody effects to keep fans of genres happy. <br /> <br /> I have to give this movie a very high rating. Tobe Hooper was the man. He made three interesting films for Cannon during that period (the Texas Chainsaw Massacre II and Invaders from Mars as well). If you like science fiction / horror movies, Tobe Hooper or Mathilda May movies, this movie is just your alley. <br /> <br /> The highest recommendation! <br /> <br /> Did I mention that Mathilda May is smoking?
