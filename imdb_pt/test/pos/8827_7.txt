My main criticism is simply that it is not long enough or detailed enough. I would have loved to see more of everything: shipbuilding, engineering, training, the first orbiting, preparations for departure, the orbital injection of Venus, everything. I would have liked to see more of the first step, Venus to Earth, instead of zipning there as a corporate bus no.10. In fact, I would have liked to see a series on the Earth Story scale made with this, with an hour whole planet dedicated to each planet and perhaps another to the loop around the Sun. As it was, I was hungry. On the other hand, I understand the budgets and attention of the viewers. <br /> <br /> Re the science: Let's be fair about the time lapse of the speed of light: they mentioned in the beginning that there was a delay in the conversations, but they let it evaporate when they reached the outer planets. Some kind of conversation had to be presented to the viewers, and we have to assume that the delay was eliminated for the sake of palatability; so I have no complaints. But zero for noisy spaceships. The only movie in which spacecraft made no noise was Kubrick's in 2001, and yet he escaped using the noise of the crew breathing in their helmets - which * was * quite effective. I wish the creators of Space Odyssey had realized just how strange the sight of big exploding rocket engines in absolute silence could be but unfortunately, Pegasus looses the same roar from all the other cardboard ships in all the other SciFi films of cardboard. But the rest of science was excellent. There are no complaints there, actually compliments to bring the radiation problems as well as they did. I just hope that having done this movie does not discourage the BBC from making a really detailed version, but I suppose not for next week or next year too ...
