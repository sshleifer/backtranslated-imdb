Finding the intriguing premise, and reading the reviews, and being a fan of Angel, I watched this movie. It's sexy and original, and a lot of fun. David Boreanaz is Keith. He is a handsome married man, stays at home, father, and he feels a little inadequate in his marriage. He makes the mistake of penetrating an intimate circle of teenage girls who are fascinated by the idea of ​​doing this with an older man. They will do anything to get into your bed, including begging, lying and blackmailing, but most of the time they try to squeeze their buttons. The folly that follows leads Keith to stagger and pushes friendships to the limit. David Boreanaz shows a bit of skin on this one - and he's looking hot. Yes, it does a sleazy trick - but it shows a lot of vulnerability and tenderness towards the silly teens that you end up cheering for in the end. One more thing, when someone moans "oh yeah, oh..oh..YEAH !!", it's hard to see them as rape victims.
