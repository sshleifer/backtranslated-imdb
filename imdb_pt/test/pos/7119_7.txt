I'm so impressed, really. I expected tacky gamer humor and nothing else. <br /> <br /> OK, there's a ton of geeky humor. But the film is so well done. The acting is very good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue, as a gamer player sometimes, I think to meet the gamer crowd, is not bad at all. Sometimes it's even, dare I say, great. <br /> <br /> When the female gamer, who built this type of non-traditional fighter instead of the usual type (min / max) gets all those extra attacks (feels right), I did not check the rules,) was cool. <br /> <br /> The sets are amazing for what must be a relatively low production film. <br /> <br /> The story goes on. Transitions from the game world to the real world are well done. A man who plays a female character was sometimes touched by a woman and sometimes alone. Very clever, I thought. The guy who decided to play a female, but kept forgetting that he was female, was good for many laughs. He even said tag at one point, and the female walked to play the role (sorry, I did not look her name, she did very well.) The guy always trying to "get a little" got a little boring, but I guess who was more humor gamer. <br /> <br /> There was so much to like about the movie. Carefree. Fun! Very well done and I'm saying that as a movie fan, not a player (and I'm not a D & D player). Like I said, I expected much less. <br /> <br /> Movies usually attention, I end up listening to them while working on my computer. This caught my attention. I can not praise the movie much.
