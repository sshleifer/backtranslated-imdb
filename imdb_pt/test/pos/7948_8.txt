SPOILER ALERT - AND I REALLY MEI! DO NOT READ MORE UNLESS YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO HAVE A REVEALED MAIN PLANT ELEMENT! <br /> <br /> Ok, first I have to say that I have a relatively high tolerance for depressing movies. I will watch and enjoy movies about the horrors of real life (such as war and holocaust) or where death and sadness are important to the plot, but I hate movies like STEAL MAGNOLIAS and TERMS OF EXCLUSION where the film is built around of a manipulative death of a main character. So, no matter how well done this movie is, it has a BIGGEST attack because one of the main characters dies of an illness in the end (though they never say what he had in the English-language version). <BR> Then you might ask yourself, "So, if this braggart hates this kind of movie, then why did he watch it in the first place?" You would have a great point to ask this, although I hope I am not really a hard blow! Well, when I found it in our local library I had no idea what that was !!! The film was not made specifically for export, since the captions were in Korean, English and Japanese and the box was printed in Korean. Well, being a fan of trying movies from any nation (I've seen movies from probably at least 30-40 different countries), I've tried it. <br /> <br /> Well, beyond compulsory death, I loved the movie and then I hated the way it ended. While I usually hate Hollywood-esque miraculous endings, I wanted to see the guy saved through some new drug or experimental surgery. I was really upset that he had to die - particularly since he seemed like one of the coolest people I've seen in movies in a long time. His smile was contagious and I really wanted him to catch the girl in the end. Oh well, at least I can appreciate the message from the movie that you need to seize the moment. Great acting, music, etc., but not the most satisfying end for me. This movie was good enough to encourage me to try some more Korean cinema.
