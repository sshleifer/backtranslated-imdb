This movie was originally released as a soft "X", apparently with explicit sex excluded. Later, the producers "gave in" (they smelled of money) and relaunched it with the extirpated scenes restored (apparently only about 3 minutes). I think since Kristine was of age, this was against her and her promising career came to a halt. I think it's all in time (witnesses the career of Pam Anderson) - but Ronald Reagan was in charge during Kristine's disaster (we had not heard of Nancy Reagan's affairs), Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski were in full swing during the appearance of Pam Sex is just cherry on top of the cake, both versions please. This naughty musical is well above the others that were released at the same time.
