I thought it would be a bad movie, honestly, I mean, Rupert Grint, RON, playing in a different Harry Potter film, it was really hard to imagine that. But as the movie began, it showed that this guy has talent, I mean, he's the best actor in the HP trio, for reference, did you see Emma Watson trying to act? Or how about Daniel acting? They both have no experience, though they have acted in a million Harry Potter films. Ben, your character is a very shy boy, unable to show his true feelings about everything, his contempt for his domineering mother and the resentful anger toward the father who is unable to impose himself and confront his unfaithful wife. Julie Walters was absolutely brilliant! Her interpretation of an old retired actress trying to live with the shadow of her past as she tries to remember Shakespeare's sonnets is absolutely marvelous! Moreover, it seems that many young people are wasted in meaningless religious acts.
