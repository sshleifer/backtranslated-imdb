I love this movie (I do not know why it's called Pot Luck in England - that name is dirty and totally irrelevant!), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, ​​not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners. same. It brings back so many memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries and the city itself. I really want to see the following 'Les Poupees Russes' (the Russian dolls), I do not think it will be released here? My brother saw it in France and said def was not so good, but it had a lot of the same cast (Wendy's brother apparently marries). Does anyone know anything about this movie? and if it can be released?
