If I sort the movie maybe a little loud, you can blame the feeling. This is one of the first movies I remember seeing and loving totally. I saw this in the drive-ins here in California in the late 70's. I was already a big fan of "The Muppet Show" on TV so I was prepared for the movie, and the movie did not disappoint. Basically, it takes all the absurdity of the Muppets show and transports it from vaudeville to a road movie. Caco, Sapo is in search of becoming famous; not because he wants to take baths of champagne and ride in a private jet, but because he wants to "make millions happy". Clear. <br /> <br /> Along the way, he picks up all his beloved muppet friends, most affectionately Fonzie Bear that he finds in a decadent bar doing stand-up. They sing "Movin 'Right Along," a song that has always enchanted me with their optimistic melody and their theme of friendship and shared discovery. He also finds plenty of Hollywood movie stars to fill a Stanley Kramer movie, including comedy comedians such as Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle and Mel Brooks. Brooks in particular is a bit monotonous, and you get the feeling that Henson could have cut some of those movies if he was not afraid of offending the stars. Anyway, as befits a travel film like this, the first person he knows is Dom DeLuise. <br /> <br /> The ending is one of the strangest examples of literally breaking the 4th wall that you'll find in any "children's" movie. The Hollywood dream seems to be crumbling over them, when a true rainbow crosses the Hollywood scene with its authentic joy and mystery. I'm sure this should relate to some of Jim Henson's personal or spiritual experiences. <br /> <br /> This is by far the best movie with Muppets. If you or anyone else was wondering why the Muppets were so popular in the '70s, considering how poor the films were in the last few decades, I think that this movie at least aged enough to provide a clue.
