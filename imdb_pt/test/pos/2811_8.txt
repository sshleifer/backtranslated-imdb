Hmm, is it okay to compare the post by Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar with the movie Saved By The Bell? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And you're right to give this movie a rating of "10"? Hahahahahaha ... this is funny. This movie was not so horrible, however; better than I expected it to be. Movies made for television are often so similar. Many of them have the same feel for them. This one had the same feeling, but it worked, although it was more a tortured woman who has to achieve the maximum in the final story. Before I started, I had imagined Mrs. Thiessen as a 90210 seductress, but here she was as innocent as Kelly Kapowski, which was refreshing. Eric Close surprised me doing his part very well. With a decent writing, the director achieved a very good and convincing performance without being at all tacky. All in all it was a bit interesting, definitely better than most TV movies. My Note: B-
