Mon Oncle Antoine watches the rugged face of a home community from various angles, slowly taking his time at the beginning, as he should, until we come out of destroyed (but banal) hopes and expectations, in whirling ecstasies of dreams and a heart-stopping revelation about the terrible enigma of mortality. <br /> <br /> Wandering tracks and zooms in the snowy mountains comfort the mind and mesmerize the viewer. This tireless camera job is embodied in a peripheral character who is also the homeless, dropping his job at the coal mine and leaving his family to chop wood, then giving up again and returning to the inhuman humanity of his dead boy. <br /> <br /> An old woman betrays her husband and a boy dies. Old things become new and new things die. Everywhere there is snowy whiteness, as haunted as the history of cinema.
