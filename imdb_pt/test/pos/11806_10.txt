Although flawed in the view of homosexuals, this film will shed light on the viewer about the myths and inaccuracies about AIDS. Despite the depressing subject, this movie portrays a warm friendship between two boys, and will make you laugh and cry. Very well represented by all, especially Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro. The language is a bit strong, though appropriate, and is a fun and clever film for the whole family. But remember to have Kleenex ready!
