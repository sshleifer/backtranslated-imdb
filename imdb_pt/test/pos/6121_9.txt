More fun than all gay "300" orgies combined. More desolate than a tragedy of Shakespeare. More poetic than the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah. And above all this, the biggest garbage ever produced. A black comedy that tests the limits of human senses, John Waters' cult film "Pink Flamingos" is a story about the conflict between two families that ends in humiliation, death and, of course, consumption of dog feces (yes, by the way, that's not really the humiliating part). No, no, this is not about impossible love, there is no Romeus or Juliets in those 90 minutes or so. This movie is about the battle for prestige if you could call it that. The title battle - The dirtiest person alive. <br /> <br /> On one side, we have Divine (played by the regular Waters cross-dressing ... umm ... Divine) a careful daughter, good mother, cannibal, killer, pervert and current owner of said title. She loves her son Crackers a little too much. The crackers themselves have a sexual attraction to both chickens and youngsters, sometimes mixing them into trios. Family friend and loyal accomplice Cotton feels satisfaction while watching Crackers during some of his ... acts involving the objects of attraction mentioned earlier. Last but not least, Divine's mother and grandmother for Crackers, Edie. A 400-pound woman, sleeping, eating and basically living in a baby crib. She is addicted to eggs and loves the egg man (the man who brings the eggs ... rs). <br /> <br /> The four live peacefully in a caravan out of town until they become a target for the marbles. Exhibitionists, manipulators, crooks, really bad people. Their main source of income comes from the kidnapping and impregnation of young women. For the impregnation part, they use their reliable and faithful butler to provide the semen. After that, they sell the born child to the highest bidder. <br /> <br /> It was the envy of the Marbles towards the Divine and its title that will lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families. An epic battle of filth, perversion and violence. <br /> <br /> "Pink Flamingos" is an unsurpassed masterpiece in the trash film genre. Loaded with oddities and strange acts, John Waters' film is detested and hated by traditionalists, critics, and the average movie audience. But for the few who remain risk-free from these generalizations, the Flamingos are an unforgettable experience. Funny and sick, violent and poetic. It is really a bad exercise
