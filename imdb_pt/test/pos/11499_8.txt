Some people go through life, moving from one thing or person to another without blinking; others cling to a cause, to the other person, or to a principle and remain inflexible, committed to whatever - and figuratively or literally, they give their word and defend it. But we are all different, "made of different clay," as one of the characters in this film puts it, which is what makes life so interesting. Some people are just crazy, and maybe that's how you should live among the masses. Who knows? Who knows what it takes to make things - life - work? Writer / director Lisa Krueger takes a look at this, using a light-hearted approach to examining that tenuous line between being committed - and how one "committed" - and obsession with "Committed," starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is inflexible, committed, obsessive and maybe a little crazy too. Her name is Joline, and this is her story. <br /> <br /> Of course, Joline has always been a committed person; at work, relationships, in life in general. She's a woman of the word who stays around, no matter what. And when she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it's forever. The only problem is that someone forgot to tell Carl - and 597 days after the wedding, he was gone; to "find" yourself and find out everything. When Joline realizes that he will not return, she refuses to give up on him or the marriage. Maybe it's because of that clay she's made. Regardless, she leaves her home in New York and leaves to find him, what she does - in El Paso, Texas, everywhere. But once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him her 'space' and not even letting him know she's there. She considers Carl to be in a "spiritual coma," and it is her job to keep a "spiritual watch" on him until he regains judgment. And while she watches and waits, her life is anything but monotonous when she meets a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velazquez), a waitress at one of the local restaurants; Carmen "Grampy" (Alfonso Arau), who is a kind of mystic; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has problems with Carl; and Neil (Goran Visnjic), an artist who makes pinatas and carries a costume for her. For Joline, it's a journey of discovery, during which she learns a great deal about Carl, but even more about herself. <br /> <br /> There is a touch of humor, a touch of romance and some insight into human nature. this quirky movie that is more about characterization and character than plot. And Krueger presents everything very well, delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining. His characters are very real people, with all the desires, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic group through which she tells her story. We see this from Joline's point of view, for Krueger leaves us abreast of Joline's thoughts and therefore of his motives, which puts a decided perspective on events as they unfold. This, along with the deliberate rhythm it sets that allows you to absorb the atmosphere and the environment it creates, contributes to a very effective narrative. There is a seriousness underlying this, but Krueger chooses to avoid anything too heavy or too deep and focuses on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations Joline encounters. And the result is a well textured, affectionate and optimistic look at that thing we call life. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham takes on that role from the very first frame of the film to make Joline a totally unique character. creation. She dives into the play and makes a performance that is compelling and compelling, adding the little personal traits and nuances that make all the difference between a portrait that is a mere representation of a person and one that is real. And for this movie to work, it was imperative that Joline was viable and believable - and Graham succeeds on all fronts. Her presence on the screen has never been so seductive, and her vibrant personality, or even the way she uses her eyes, is enough to entice him completely. it's all part of the character she creates; There is an appeal to Joline emanating from her whole face, who she is inside and out. She is a nice and nice person, and because you shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is. It's a good job all around, starting with the way the character was written, to the way Graham brings it so vibrantly to life. <br /> <br /> Like Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is totally engaging too. Her performance is very natural and direct, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character. She has a charismatic presence, but it is less than extravagant, and gives her a look that is both attractive and practical. It is pleasantly open and advanced; you have the impression that Carmen is not someone who hides anything, but is totally honest on all fronts, and that is also part of her appeal. And, as with Joline, this character is well written, and Velazquez brings it convincingly to life. Overall, there are a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including those of Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (as brother of Joline, Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo, who, with very little screen time, manages to create a memorable character. The supporting cast includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (car thief of New York), Dylan Baker (Carl's publisher) and Mary Kay Place (psychiatrist). A movie that says something about the value of retreating to consider The Great Picture - reflecting on who we are, where we are going and what we really need - "Committed" is a pleasant experience; A tour definitely worth it. 8/10
