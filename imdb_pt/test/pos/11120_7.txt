The film follows a group of students at the School of Performing Arts in New York. There is Coco (Irene Cara), a black singer who will reach the top after all. She is helped by Bruno (Lee Curren), a white musician. Then there's Doris (Maureen Teefy) who wants to be an actress - but she's shy and scared. She becomes friends with Motgomery (Paul McCrane) - supposedly the only gay student in school and is romanticized by Raul (Barry Miller). Then there's Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray - who unfortunately died in 2003) who is homeless and a great dancer - but can not read. Then there are several teachers (Albert Hague, Anne Meara stand out) trying to teach children. <br /> <br /> The songs are great (the title song and "Out Here On My Own" were nominated for Best Song - "Fame" won), the dances are energetic and the young cast shows a lot of ambition and talent. But this movie loses the boat in the theater department. Many plot lines are brought in and completely left open until the end of the movie. Why did Coco do a porn? Doris and Raul stayed together later? Or did you? How about Montgomery - what happened to him? And Leroy graduated - and how? There are many long speeches (Raul has two) and moments that only lead to nothing. I'm assuming there have been cuts in the script - I can not believe the movie left it all open. <br /> <br /> Still, it's worth seeing for acting and, again, for music. Basically there is not a bad song and the dances follow with full force (and at one point stop the traffic - literally!). My favorites are "Fame," "Out Here ..." and "I Sing the Electric Body," which is a great closing song. So I recommend, but I can only give a 7 - the script really needed to tie loose ends - and this did not happen. <br /> <br /> Curiosities: They wanted to film this movie in real school. for Performing Arts, but was not allowed. The principal of the school read the script and said there was a lot of swear words in the film. That's true - there's a lot of foul language, but that's what high school kids talk about. Avoid the TV version, which abysmally overdubs.
