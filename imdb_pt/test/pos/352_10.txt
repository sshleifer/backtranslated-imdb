As some other people wrote, I'm a mario fan and I love this game. <br /> <br /> This game starts a bit boring, but believe me, it's worth it. As soon as you start, your addict! The levels are fun and exciting. They will hold you until your mind becomes porridge. I'm not kidding. This game is also orchestrated and well done. <br /> <br /> To keep this spoiler free, I have to keep my mouth shut about details. But please, try this game! It will be worth it! <br /> <br /> History: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (It's so good!) Hardness: 10 Attention, Rule: 10 Average: 10
