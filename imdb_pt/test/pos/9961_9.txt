The Merchant of Venice is a fantastic film. It is very true for Shakespeare's original game. If you saw Jeremy Irons in Casanova and enjoyed their performance, this is a movie for you! If you saw Joseph Fiennes in Shakespeare in Love and liked his performance, this is a movie for you! If you saw Al Pacino in Donnie Brasco and liked his performance, this is a movie for you! It's a very nice film and if you're studying Shakespeare like me, this is a great movie to watch !! The only problem with this movie is that you can not let the little ones see it, because it has a bit of nudity in it. But besides that, it's a very good movie !!
