Ok, so this movie may not have won any Oscar, but it's not a bad movie. The original "D.O.A." is certainly a better movie, but that does not mean that this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his first roles, when he was becoming really famous after "The Right Stuff." made him a star, and a very beautiful looking Meg Ryan, when she was still quite famous. <br /> <br /> This is another "update" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters are also different. The plot is pretty much the same. One man (this time an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin) is poisoned and he only has 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan plays a young college student trying to help him. Jane Kaczmarek plays Quaid's wife, in a low key, but an intense performance; she steals every scene she's in. Daniel Stern (also on a previous role, before "Home Alone" made him famous) plays Quaid's colleague. Charlotte Rampling is also well in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is top notch; The film is stylish, with a fast pace that prevents you from guessing until the end. <br /> <br /> I think this is a movie that is certainly worth watching as a thriller, and as a modern version of a classic movie.
