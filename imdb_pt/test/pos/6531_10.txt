I'm probably a little too old for this movie, age 16, and being a guy, the story is kind of funny, but I really thought it was a cool movie overall. All the girls in this movie are very hot and great actresses, from Alana, to Adrianne, Deena, Kimberly, to the beautiful girl who plays Alana's little sister, Rachel. I'm not a big pop-star fan with the songs in love, but I thought Aaron Carter did a great job at it, and it looks like he really liked this movie, and made it look real. My mom liked all the older farts she grew up with, so that's cool too. I thought I liked a lot of people and wondered if I would see them again? A sequel would be cool. I rented this, but I could also buy this, since I have a ton of DVDs, and would like to come back to see something I missed. I could not buy it at Blockbuster, so I do not know where I could buy it now, but I'll take a look at it. Anyway, I'm a 16 year old guy, I already said that, I know, but I'd like to set a date to see this. It's really good for all ages. I think even my six-year-old little sister can see that. That's what's so cool about it, which is something that all ages can see. I'm sure it was done on purpose, but it really works. Girls can dream about being with Aaron Carter, and guys like me can dream about all the hotties in this movie. There is something for everyone.
