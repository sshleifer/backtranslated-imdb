I just came back from Santa Fe NM I visited Loretto Chapel. As I looked around this building, which was acquired by a private owner, I relived the cinematic version of the staircase. It's an overwhelming mystique that occupies this building. It's about what can happen if you really have faith. The bookstore has a narrative on the subject, which is the story of the staircase. I read the narrative in its entirety. I was absorbed by the environment around the people in it. It was as if we were totally enclosed in an interval of time, all with the same thoughts and reverence. When we left, the silence was overwhelming. Everyone should visit the Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe NM
