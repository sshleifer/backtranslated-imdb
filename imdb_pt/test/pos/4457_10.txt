The name "Lucio Fulci" brings together images of death and graphic mutilation in the minds of May fans. Thanks to films like "Zombie 2", "City of the Living Dead", "The Beyond" and "The New York Ripper", Fulci has a reputation for being one of the craziest directors in history. And though many of his later films certainly justified his reputation until the release of "Zombie 2" in 1979, Fulci's films contained nothing close to the amount of blood and courage he knew, in fact they were mostly free of blood. counting on more traditional shocks and disturbing images for work. "Do not torture a duckling" hardly contains blood, but is the best. <br /> <br /> "Do not torture a duckling" is set in a small Sicilian town where superstition rules rather than logic. The residents of the city are very suspicious of strangers as well as any different person, often avoiding them. After a series of murders of children, many people arrive in the city, including Andrea Martelli (Thomas Milan), who tries to uncover the truth about the murders as they continue to happen. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable movie. It is very well done with an excellent cast full of many favorites of the Italian exploration cinema. It also contains a solid score as well as many courtesy of creative camera movement or Lucius Fulci. But the real attraction of "Do not Torture a Duckling" is the disturbing nature of the film. Young children, about twelve years of age, are shown mocking lazy people, visiting prostitutes and having purposive sex by an older woman. It also contains some very biting comments about the middle class and the Catholic Church. It's for reasons like this that "Do not torture a duckling" was blacklisted across Europe when it was first released and never shown in the United States. Still, "Do not torture a duckling" is a monumental achievement in giallo cinema, as well as the best work of Lucius Fulci. I really can not recommend this enough, check it out.
