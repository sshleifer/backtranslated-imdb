I will always think of Mr. Firth as Dorian Gray if I live to the age of 100. <br /> <br /> Perfectly acted and directed, bringing the acumen, humor and humor of Oscar Wilde alive with absolute and utter uncommon perfection in television. <br /> <br /> More proof that the BBC more than invests in talent what it does not always have in cash. <br /> <br /> A must for all Wilde fans - and indeed for everyone else. Inspired and perfected, each of the actors seemed exactly right for the role and each shot was well done. <br /> <br /> By the end of the day I discovered that I loved each character in a way that no other movie of the type had ever inspired. Watch and try to watch another version. Not the same, is it?
