I first saw an afternoon in the 80's on the T.V network. I think I was 9 years old. (Watching a violent horror movie nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and that's how I remembered it, it's very good, scary movie. I think the reason it can go unnoticed is because it was not followed by a load of sequels, ie Friday 13. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and improves. Even though he is a killer in the forest movie as on Friday, he has more in common with the original Saw Massacre. This is because the film establishes a certain atmosphere and feeling of fear, even in broad daylight. And the killers feel more menacing than on Friday. There is also a good amount of suspense. I recommend seeing now that it's being released on DVD at the end of July.
