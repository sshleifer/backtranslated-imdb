Charles "Chic" Sales is absolutely fantastic as the only member of the Leeds family willing to testify against a gangster who saw murder a cop and an informant. He fought Bull Run in the Civil War and his patriotism is high even after his son-in-law is beaten and one of his grandchildren is kidnapped by the gang, intimidating all other members. Fear of his grandson's death is no excuse, he says. He would not want his grandson to live in a country ruled by thugs anyway. The conflict between civic duty and personal safety is brought home sharply in this Oscar-nominated story. Walter Huston is also a prominent prosecutor who threatens the family with perjury if he does not support his identification of the murderer in court. The rest of the cast, including the sleazy killer, Ralph Ince, are all excellent, and the film is directed by William A. Wellman. There is also a good suspense as the sales disappear as soon as the trial is about to begin.
