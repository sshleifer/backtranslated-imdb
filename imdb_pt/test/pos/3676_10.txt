I also joined IMDB for the sole purpose of commenting on this movie, but so I can sing your praises. I've never heard of this movie (it's so horribly packed that it's easy to see why this can be ignored), but a good friend suggested it to me and I'm so glad she did it. It's a movie gem. The actors are great (Kathy Bates and Meredith Eaton in particular) and they seem to be really enjoying themselves. Of course sometimes it was a little overdone, but I do not remember the last time I laughed so much or so many times over two hours. If you like to laugh then you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
