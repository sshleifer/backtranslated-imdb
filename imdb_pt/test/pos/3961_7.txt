This is a teen movie and as you watch, expect some nonsensical things to be added here and there, but overall the movie is effective, ask questions and leave you thinking that the story is kind of unlikely but that is compelling and makes you feel good in sequences, is not like the usual done and experienced way. the characters are well defined and convincing. Justin has long stood out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end, he will convince anyone with this speech that he is simply brilliant in this speech. he needs to take on more serious roles, he's worth more than just teen films. record this movie and break free
