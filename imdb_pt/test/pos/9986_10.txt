I'm not a fan of golf by any means. On May 26, around 10.30 pm, the film began with a scene at the end of the 19th century. Old movies that I like, but not golf, however, in the first scene, a young boy (Harry Vardon) is awakened by the voices of the men. He goes out to ask what they are doing and it is said that they are going to build something golf ... So I turned the television off but something moved me and I was back. The film is excellent. Then we see this boy now a man; professional golfer who is haunted with visions of his childhood. Then we find the true focus of the film Francis and the decisions he makes for golf. You know your mother and father who want to protect you from the class thing that is so obvious during the period. Then there's little Eddie Lowery, his caddy, with encouraging words and little jerks that are central to Francis's victory. I do not want to give too much. I was up 2 AM That's super, please watch the movie.
