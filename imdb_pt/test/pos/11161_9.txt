In total contrast to the previous correspondent here, I thought Shoppen Munich (as was said when screened with English subtitles here in London at the German Film Festival in November 2007) was very funny, very well played and excellently scripted. > <br /> It is very audacious to design a 100-minute film that consists exclusively, and relentlessly, of talking heads. But I think Ralf Westhoff succeeded with wit and élan. No standard filmic device to, say, follow the soul pronouncement of a character with some minor seventh-chord meditative music and cuts of a long nature. But when someone said something that revealed their souls - well, we were pushed by the man with the timer for yet another superficial introduction. Which is, of course, the point: the superficiality of the tickbox of thirty urban, where everything boils down to a quick question and answer. Perhaps most of the films are so clichéd and stupid that we Englishmen are ready to laugh at any vaguely intelligent and disinterested cinema, but I can promise you that in the screening session tonight (Curzon Cinema, Sunday , November 25, 2007) the whole audience shouted laughing most of the way. So I was not the only laugh! <br /> <br /> My girlfriend (who speaks German and lived in Munich) thought it was hilarious. Me (I do not speak German and I have not been to Munich, I think) I find it hilarious. I would recommend Shoppen (Munich) to anyone (especially couples ...) looking for a clever, witty, original and wise film about the shallowness of modern relationships and the perplexity of the generation that feels they have lost pleasure Always after the first time . <br /> <br /> NB In the English subtitled presentation in London, the subtitles (which were very good) were shown completely underneath the slightly reduced image, not inside it. I thought that was a good thing.
