From the first to the last scene, this film is done in a very realistic way, even realistically that sometimes we can not see details in night scenes (it's dark like the real night), in the desert (the sun is as strong as in the real desert). <br /> <br /> The script and actor part is also very realistic. Shots and episodes are edited to not show things and events "effectively", "explain them" or, like many Hollywood movies, "entertain" viewers. The issue here is to represent the events as if they really happened in Afghanistan. The camera is far from dying of welds, until the moment the main character Major Bandura is shot and killed. <br /> <br /> Such a method reminds me of masterpieces of Italian neo-realism. And the construction of the story here is based on the same principles of "Paisa", or "The Bicycle Thief" - chronological series of episodes of "true to life" and some pathetic moments, which at first seem sudden and illogical. , but I have internal reasons. <br /> <br /> I think the deeper reason for Major Bandura's suicide death is religious emotion - Repentance for the death of innocent people (not only the accidental murder of family members in the village, but also the death of solders under He is not described as an anxious believer, on the contrary, he is portrayed as a tactful and responsible officer. This is precisely why his last decisions (to return to the destroyed village and turn his back on an armed boy whose family he killed) looks like an act of repentance. <br /> <br /> The Russian Orthodox choir, which sounds at the end ("Evening Sacrifice"), is another context in which the entire film can be seen from this point of view.
