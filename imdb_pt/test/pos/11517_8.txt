Lights of New York was the first feature film. There was, of course, The Jazz Singer, released in October 1927 as the first full-length feature to incorporate synchronized dialogues. However, this movie released in July 1928 is barely remembered for its place in film history. It began as a short, but gradually was added up to 58 minutes - accidentally became the first feature. He opened up to a grinding house and to the surprise of Warner Bros., made more than a million dollars. That was good money in 1928. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. Two country barbers naively shop at a Broadway barbershop, which acts as an easy talker for "The Hawk," a gangster. When they find out the truth, they can not leave, because the youngest barber, Eddie, has all his mother's money tied up in place. Kitty is the youngest barber's girlfriend, and gangster Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) has an eye on turning his older girlfriend (Gladys Brockwell) into a younger model - the girl from the choir Kitty (Helene Costello). A policeman is killed while trying to stop Hawk's men from unloading a load of illegal alcoholic beverages, and Hawk sees it as an opportunity to frame Eddie, and thus takes Kitty to himself. <br /> <br /> Fun for the enthusiasts of these pioneering works. Of course, the plot is elementary and the dialogue is blistered, but there's something you do not see much in the early talkies - background music score. Vitaphone had originally been used for this purpose, and here they are still using for musical accompaniment along with dialogue. And there are singing and dancing numbers! The scenes at Hawk's nightclub are used as an opportunity to show what the movies could never do before - musical numbers. There's even an eye-popping emcee with some heavy makeup left over from the age of silence which is a joke to watch. <br /> <br /> Vitaphone could not go outdoors at this time because of the static camera booths, so the scene in the park between the two lovers Eddie and Kitty is simulated - and cheaper. The vegetation looks like something out of an Ed Wood movie or maybe a production of "Our Town." <br /> <br /> Gladys Brockwell, as the Falcon's girlfriend, delivers his speech with a punch. She is a real cop considering what lines she has to deliver. To the hawk - "So you think you can have any chicken you want and throw me back in the pack!" There is? mixed metaphors anyone? And then there are his final lines: "I lived and loved and lost!" Has anyone been paid to write this dialogue? Brockwell was making a good hit in his talkie career after having achieved some triumphs in silent films (the evil sister in "Seventh Heaven"), when a fatal car accident interrupted his career. <br /> <br /> So there's Eugene Palette - the eldest of the two barbers in our history. His froggy voice, the natural delivery of lines and the fluffy appearance gave him a long career as a character actor, usually appearing as a businessman / businessman with a rough exterior and heart of gold. In fact, Mr. Palette is the only member of this cast that still has a remarkable career in movies just three years after this movie is released. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the question of "where is the hidden microphone?" Microphones were still standing at this time, and it's fun to find out where they hid it. There is a famous scene, however, where everyone can understand. Hawk is in his office talking to his two henchmen - who seem to understand as slowly as they speak - about "getting Eddie on a ride." If you watch this scene, you would swear that the phone at the table is a character in this movie. It is the front and center throughout the conversation. It is likely that the microphone has been placed in the phone. <br /> <br /> There is something heroic about these pioneers flying blind to the new technology of sound. You have silent actors who are accustomed to using pantomime for expression, vaudevillians who know how to play to a live audience but do not know how to make the same impression in a Vitaphone camera booth, and you have dialogue writers trying to write a conversation. as tightly as they did title cards or filling movies with endless gossip. <br /> <br /> Check this one out. It's not boring, it moves fast and it's a lot of fun if you know what to look for. And no, I do not expect that this has already been released on Blu-Ray, but I hope the Warner Brothers folks will add it to Warner Archive soon so everyone can see it.
