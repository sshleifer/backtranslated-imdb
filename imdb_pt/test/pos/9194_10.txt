As in "Les amants du Pont-Neuf", two foreigners live a love story without compromise. The film consists of lots of interesting talk and lots of sweet moments. The best comes in a listening booth. They listen to a record together and from time to time they look at each other. They talk, they like each other. She suggests a change in their lives, but he is hopeless. Realistic styles are realistic (but) emotive dialogues. A really mathematical screenwriting job for this movie. Spanish novel director Jesus Ponce creates one of the most perfect galleries of the last year of Spanish cinema.
