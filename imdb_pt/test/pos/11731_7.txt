Sharky's Machine finds Burt Reynolds as a narcotics policeman who, after a failed buy-and-sell attempt that was not his fault, but who killed some people, found himself downgraded to the deputy squad in Atlanta. <br /> <br /> Prestige is not as good as narcotics, but it has its added benefits. One night, after a group of working girls where one of their books falls into their hands, the guys ask for vigilance at Rachel Ward's house. She is an expensive item, serving both the notorious maverick Vittorio Gassman and the candidate for governor of law and order, Earl Holliman. <br /> <br /> Their vigilance records a murder and the rest of the film is Sharky and her new addiction colleagues trying to solve this prestigious affair. Although it's a Burt Reynolds movie and those usually have some humor for them, the comedy is kept in check as the film becomes as deadly serious as Dirty Harry. It was reported in fact that Clint Eastwood was offered this movie. Look for some good performances by Deputy Police Officers Bernie Casey and Brian Keith and Henry Silva, Gassman's brother who does the organization's dirty work and loves his job. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, a mix of Dirty Harry and Laura. Why Laura? You will have to see the Sharky Machine for that answer.
