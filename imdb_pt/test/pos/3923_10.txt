I recently saw House of Wax and I must say I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> It has been one of the best Horror / Suspense movies in recent years, if not one of the best and most fun. /> <br /> I've heard a lot of people criticizing the so-called slow start and character development that occupies the movies that are opening 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> But if the film plunged right into the killings, audiences and critics would have criticized the film for not having decent characters that they could not care less about. <br /> <br /> As well as character development, I think it worked incredibly well. <br /> <Given my own response and others (from reading posts off the message board), many people ended up wanting the characters to live, one of which I noticed many people mentioning being Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton). taking Warner into account. Bros. has disclosed his death, it is a surprise that many audiences ended up cheering for his survival. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the chase / death scenes, they were some of the most inventive and suspenseful. I witnessed it in a while, and I really enjoyed each one of them. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film was absolutely good, I could not blame any of them, especially Paris Hilton, I thought she was very decent and I was hoping she would have more than just 25 minutes of screen time on a 120-minute film, but her chase scene made up for it, and believe me when I say that Paris can act scared (Watch the scene where she's hiding a car from Vincent and he walks past her ... the look of terror on your face appears VERY real). <br /> <br /> Generally speaking I give top stars to House of Wax for the value of entertainment and suspense and even gore ...... only criticism is that I would like it during the marketing of the movie, they had not revealed the death list and who dies and who survives, as it would have been ten times better without knowing if the persecuted character would live or die and a horrible death. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the DVD, but go see in the Cinema while you can, it will not be the same in your own front room, but if you wait for the DVD, watch the movie in the dark without interruptions, believe me in me you will not be disappointed.
