The year 2004 was the year of the biopic with no less than four photos addressing real events, real people, with varying degrees of critical praise. Of the four photos to reach the Oscar race in early 2005 (RAY, KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RAY), RAY became the big winner of the night as the acting award went to Jamie Foxx for his R & B genius Ray Charles. <br /> <br /> And it was well deserved, even though Leonardo di Caprio approached and Liam Neeson was not even named. What made Foxx the winner was that the other two were playing relatively obscure eccentrics, Ray Charles was still making music until his death in 2004 and until then there was not a soul that did not know at least one song that Charles' had written. It helped Jamie Foxx to rise well above the film - itself, as a whole, somewhat weak and often looking like it would not be out of place like a biographical TV movie - and his portrait is detailed as it is fierce. He has the delicate attribution that is to incorporate a person into nuances, and once the crisis of Ray's addiction to heroin hits the head, Foxx takes away all the stops and it's not hard to imagine the real Ray really going through such a painful ordeal. <br /> <br /> The low point of the film is how it spends a little too much time detailing Ray's relationship with women. Like the AVIATOR, Taylor Hackford wishes to establish that Ray had this turbulent life, a product of his own demons and his entry into success in a time when being black and successful brought a huge amount of luggage. Of the women, the only one to succeed bringing real life is Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. Her role is difficult, since she is alone on the screen with the children's actor playing the young Ray, but her facial and body language is distressing, especially at the moment when she must leave her maternity to get Ray to find his way around the house. That intensity of emotion, to stand there and watch your blind child crawl through a room and have to force you to have that rude awakening to independence. A beautiful performance, and one that should have been recognized. <br /> <br /> A fantastic counterpoint to RAY is the music featured. Anyone who knows R & B will appreciate the early recordings of Ray's radio hits as much as his later ones, which would bring him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Foxx virtually steals the show while playing the songs as Ray. will only survive even when the film itself is little more than a hard biographical film. I would have, however, loved it if they had used their last Adult Contemporary hit of 1993, "Sing My Song for You" in the final credits. After all, it's Ray Charles, an artist who had a fierce dedication to his art.
