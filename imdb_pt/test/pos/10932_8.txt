"Eagle's Wing" is a pleasant surprise for a movie and keeps the viewer interested. I did not know anything about it being done by the British until I read the other viewer's comments. I can understand why it won a prize for cinematography as it was brilliantly presented and must have looked magnificent on a large movie screen. It seemed to be far more realistic than most Westerns in portraying how the West was most truly conquered. As well as the complexities of the characters it presents. The Indian character-Sam Waterson is particularly intriguing. He appears to be brutal in the wild environment to which he is conditioned, but shows remarkable respect for the weaknesses he witnesses in the white men and women he meets. He is not friendly or sensitive to these intruders in his lands, but he has a limit to his sense of revenge, even a compassion when he is in a position of power and watching the withered white man inclined to revenge, as well as the girl he kidnaps after capturing a stagecoach. As such, his character seems complex, but congruent with the hard lands on which he lived and who were threatened by these intruders, he is not heartless in his dealings with. <br /> <br /> The magnificent horse he rides is a critical link and It is interesting to note how this Indian deals with him, compared to the character of Martin Sheen who possesses him in his possession and power for some time. "Eagle's Wing" is an unusual Western, a genre that I'm not attracted to, but I really enjoyed this great deal, which I would rank second only to "A Man Called Horse".
