I was watching Perfect Storm and I thought of another Wolfgang Peterson movie that is much better - the one here. While it is certainly not based on a true story, In the Line of Fire is how a movie should be made. It has a fantastic story with a great cast. Malkovich earned a well-deserved Oscar for his performance as the scary killer with a grudge against the government he served very well. Eastwood is good as the tortured Secret and Russian Service is easy on the eyes. If you have not seen it yet, definitely rent it or buy it as I did. Definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the last decade. 9/10
