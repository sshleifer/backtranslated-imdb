I saw this movie for the first time when I was in elementary school in the 60's. I was fascinated by the character played by Ingrid Bergman and it was my introduction to the French Quarter of New Orleans. The first part of the film is the best, because she comes back to take revenge on the wife and daughter of his father (his mother was expelled). During this time she meets the wonderful Clint Maroon, played by Gary Cooper. The chemistry between the two is great. The second half of the movie takes place in Saratoga, NY (the title Saratoga) and I've never really enjoyed the New Orleans scene, but it's still very good. I give this movie ten - partly because of nostalgia, but mostly because it's just a good movie and the characters other than those of Bergman and Cooper are just as wonderful (Flora Robson comes close to stealing from Bergman's scenes). It used to be displayed on TV periodically, but it is rarely shown, if there ever was one - it would be good for one of the classic movie stations to pick up and put in their programming cycles.
