This is a really incredible story and the most amazing part of it all is that it really happened! In case you have not noticed: it is based on a true story. <br /> <br /> Imagine the shock and horror of discovering that your own father was once an official SS in World War II. <br /> <br /> It's a very intriguing story and I'm really surprised that the movie is rated as a lousy 5.3 here on imdb.com. <br /> <br /> My rate: 7
