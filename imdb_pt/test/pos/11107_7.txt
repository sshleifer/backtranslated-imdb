When it comes to these weird little detective films, guys who revolve around characters on the brink of scum and live in equally scandalous environments, and still carry that somber dark feeling through a very ordinary cinematography and a very black comedy ; Dead Bodies is the kind of movie that Paul McGuigan wants to be able to do. Unfortunately, the maddening and sporadic Gangster # 1, as well as the equally all-around, but interesting exercise in surrealism mixed with realism, the effort titled The Acid House is the only one of it that we have to move on till now. Dead Bodies is Robert Quinn's play based on a screenplay by Derek Landy, a film that crosses the line between psychological horror and neo-noir; mixing elements of crime and terror with themes linked to morality and obsessive and unnatural disorders. <br /> <br /> McGuigan's British crime efforts carry that distorted and distorted feel, like witnessing someone's nightmare and having front row seats in the process. His films are able to dislike in some areas and amuse in others what with his extravagant and all-over-the-place approach. Do they carry a very dreamlike sensitivity, even though they are anchored in a very realistic, depressed, and dirty world? the real world with so much emphasis on the horror and terror of the situations that its characters generate than anything else. Dead Bodies is a film that deals with both distressing situations of characters and a brief inclusion of a study of a delicate psychological mentality, but here the film balances the eccentricity of its characters; the terror of the scenarios in which they find themselves and the questions of morality that come much better. <br /> <br /> Dead Bodies is effective and rather simplistic without ever feeling manipulative. His suggestive and well-known tendency to want to hammer at home exactly what people are thinking and feeling does not detract from the experience. Early on, we meet Tommy McGann (Scott), a young boy whose girlfriend Jean (Davis) dominates him, his life and the screen every time she is in the short time she is. The point as to the fact of your situation of living in a house less than desirable; with a job stacking shelves and a partner with whom he does not get along, is put differently. How is the way the public gets distinct permission to dislike Jean, what happens to the rude, spoiled, expectant attitudes she so clearly possesses. Later, the film will obviously remain on the face of a police officer as suspicions and tensions arise in what is clearly an inexpensive and easy way to tell the public that our hero is still not far from trouble. <br /> <br /> But compare this to Gangster No. 1, in which this is the episodic and misguided approach McGuigan applies to the material; that a vital and vital plot point arises when a character is seen leaving a building by another person in a 'random walk' in a scene defined several months after the previous one. The feeling is not so well founded or satisfactory. The organization of the Dead Bodies is dominated by Kay de Kay Davis; a would-be femme fatale just eager to pick a fight of some sort, but simply not actually being able to find one. She took Tommy by jumping through rings; going there, doing this and that without Tommy actually reacting the way he could, mainly because he is controlled by his promises of sex. The beginning builds up a certain amount of tension because of Tommy's underestimated reaction to what's happening and culminates in a distinct release when the initial incident happens, and Jean dies. <br /> <br /> If the setting is simple enough, then that is one thing, but the pinch of the project is the way in which Tommy decides to free Jean from his hands by burying her without informing anyone about her death a best friend. Things tighten when you see that there was a second dead body in the same place where Tommy buried Jean, with suspicions, denials and problems in general, all the ingredients of the day. It is at this point that the film blurs the lines between noir and horror; in fact, Tommy lives instead - a large, sinister, scary and even gothic house that he shares with an elderly relative who inhabits the upper areas of that house. This evokes memories of Hitchcock's 1960 movie, Psycho and Bates, which he rode with his mother and where she positioned herself. Moreover, it is no coincidence that this place of horror is the scene of Jean's unfortunate death. <br /> <br /> Placing a corpse in the hands of the unhappy male leader for him to act. as the initial incident is a classic created for any noir; from the 1945 Ulmer film, Detour, to a more recent and more contemporary film compared to Dead Bodies, 2006, titled "Big Nothing." What this film unfolds is a distortion; rather unpredictable and rather frightening story of hybridity and gendered mind games told under a palette of distinctly drained visuals. The excesses of voice and the snippets in the thin line that leadership does for most of the movie between right and wrong help push it into a realm of the neo-noir; if we consider the fact that lead is essentially innocent and his murder accusations are unfair, then that is one thing, but his attitudes towards Jean initially saw him act without thinking and his cover of his death is the antithesis to abandon murder charges. Dead Bodies is taught; fun to watch without ever feeling explorer and provides a consistent tone to the rather unpleasant physical and psychological content being explored.
