The entire film, an ingenious adaptation of one of Joyce's "Dubliners" stories, takes place on the night of January 6 (Epifania), 1906. Most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters (two sisters and their niece ). ), where a group of Dubliners of high class meets for a night of music, recitation and dinner. Although there is very little plot by itself, the interaction and conversation between the group reveal a lot about Dublin in the early 20th century when independence movements were just beginning. The cast, all talented Irish stage actors, with the exception of Anjelica Huston, are universally wonderful, and one of them really feels that they are invited to the meeting. The touching final scene between Huston and Donald McCann reveals a lot about the characters' marriage. There is poignancy mixed with humor and insight, and for those who like quiet and thoughtful movies, "The Dead" is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin, we do a ritual of watching this wonderful film every January 6th. After many visions, he never ceases to move me, and every time I gather something I've missed before.
