When this show first appeared on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another "fat face, thin woman" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just "ok" in early previews and I did not watch it again; however, once it was distributed, I picked up several episodes (simply because it was twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all the great supporting characters are connected, this program makes you laugh out loud. Each new episode I watch is more creative than the previous one - people who just watch this sometimes do not realize it. The writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than they seem at first glance (this is far from "According to Jim"). First of all, Kevin James is hysterical, incredibly charming and a talented comedic actor, as well as the supporting cast. Leah Remini has excellent timing, and Spence by Patton Oswalt is one of the funniest characters in the show. And of course, Jerry Stiller is brilliant as Arthur. I was shocked to read comments that it was the worst part of the show - it's a gigantic part of why this show is so great - delivering these ridiculous schemes (completing the crazy dad's character) are beyond hilarious. And the scream - the best episode is when they show you as a child shouting "Lemon Icee !!". That episode, during which Carrie takes him to a therapist hoping to get him medicated (to make Doug less stressed), guest star William Hurt decides that Arthur screams because he has never been validated. The last part of the episode in which Doug beats his childhood in a therapy session is beyond funny, it's one of the most creative scenes I've ever seen on a sitcom. I feel the strange need to defend this show because it's severely underrated - while "Friends" is sometimes fun, and "Raymond" has great episodes and characters, both of which lack the creative twist King of Queens has. In a time when most sitcoms have canned jokes and are generally mediocre, "King of Queens" continues to push the envelope of comedy and show a true comic genius. Critics of this show obviously do not understand - or have not watched the show enough to give it a go, because anyone with comic sense and creative sensitivity has to laugh out loud while watching. It's certainly on par with my other two favorites, "Seinfeld" and "The Office" in their ridiculous tone. It is the TV Arthurs, Kramers and Michael Scotts who keep us watching and laughing loudly.
