This is a must for everyone, but especially African Americans. It is time for a film to express and show the ongoing concerns in African-American relationships. It also allows other cultures to view in a fictitious humorous way how African American relationships are positive and their results, rather than the undesirable stereotype that afflicts the African-American community. I love this movie a must see !!
