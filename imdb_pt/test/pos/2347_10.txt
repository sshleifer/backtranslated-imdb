I'm a big fan of Naruto even though I have not watched all the episodes or read all the manga. I really liked the first Naruto movie, and to tell the truth I was a little nervous that this would not be as good (or full of action) as the first one (mainly because this one in Australia only had a PG instead of an M, which is a PG-13 US or UK 12). But I was wrong (thankfully)! The animation was more improved (although some character designs seemed rushed) and was very good especially in the fight scenes. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, let's talk about the fight scenes! The animation and action in the fight scenes was spectacular and so much fun! I especially enjoyed the battle of genjutsu with the kankuro and the fight with Gaara fighting female warriors! All the characters you want are here! Naruto, Sakura, Gaara, Kankuro and Shikamaru! If only Temari were in the movie, Shikamaru could save her from the warriors dramatically! And maybe they could have a PISSED KISS! In my resume at the top, I say that this qualifies more as a piece of Cinema than just an extended episode. And this happens! The action is very cinematic and the quality of the animation looks very chic, especially during the fighting! Overall, this is a great anime movie that is a must see for any Naruto fan! 5/5! 10/10! 50/50! 100/100! All right, I'll stop!
