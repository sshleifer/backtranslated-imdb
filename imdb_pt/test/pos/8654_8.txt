The Scandinavians are very good at making me laugh at the monotonous nothingness of my soulless life, huh. <br /> <br /> The cinema here was incredibly meticulous, every piece of framing, every expressionless look, every element of color. palette, every fragment of muzak or whooosh of those street cleaners was there to hammer the peaceful emptiness of this world. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think I might have found the general sense of arrogant emptiness if your absurdity had not been genuinely funny and relatable. Like when Andreas is telling his boss that he misses children and looks up and the guy is smiling and half out the door, it's kind of a sad but true reflection of working with people, spending 7/8 hours a day with they see more of them than the people you love, but in the end, knowing that deep down they do not care at all about your problems and you. <br /> <br /> This could have been a movie the Coen had made if they had been born in Oslo and not in Minnesota. I think their moods are more aggressive and more wrapped up in the cinema's past, but they have the same mastery of technique and their films have the same underlying feeling that life is very inconsequential. <br /> <br /> I'll stop before you convince me to catch a bus into the winter wilderness.
