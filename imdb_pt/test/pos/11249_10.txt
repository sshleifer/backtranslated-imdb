the keys to VIP are BS. <br /> <br /> Rob Cavaliere vs. Justin in Season Two. <br /> <br /> I went to school with Rob Cavaliere and Adriana Doria. You can remember her as the last girl he was "picking up." was when the "angry girlfriend" appeared, they left and "left the club together". They were good friends at bressani chs father in woodbridge. <br /> <br /> Whether or not they rob you planned or they asked him to do it, men should know that what they are seeing is not real and the guys here are idiots. especially that episode. <br /> <br /> Another line to fill the space.
