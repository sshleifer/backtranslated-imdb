All in all, Big Bad John was a hilarious and touching movie. If you want romance, tragedy and humor, this movie has already made it. If you are a fan of music (as I am), you know full well how it ends. But if you do not, or want and want to watch anyway, I highly recommend this movie. Jack Elam and Jimmy Dean are a hilarious couple with great chemistry. However, I would not recommend this movie for strict urban people. You have to understand where these people should be coming from, and only a handful of us are left. But even some urban people can understand it and appreciate it for what it is: a good home movie that will make you laugh, cry and be inspired.
