This movie was incredible. I was crying until the end of the movie. Okay, I know that acting sucks, but that's not important. The message came loud and clear about God's love for us and the sacrifice of Jesus. The film was realistic and showed real human feelings, whether Pete's anger at the scorn of the blonde or the guy asking questions. But it also showed the joy that comes from a true relationship with Christ. The cars were amazing and the actors were very hot and it caught my eye. But what I liked the most about this film was the clear message of the Gospel. His mother and pastor supported Ben in his new walk with Christ and tried to be a godly example to others. Nicky D showed that it does not matter if you have everything the world has to offer, without Christ, it does not matter. Nina showed how a wrong person, but good, can easily miss the target. I loved this movie and I think it will bring a lot of teenagers to Christ.
