Like a winding country road, "Tough Luck" takes the viewer for a ride. There's nothing wrong with plot lines as long as credibility does not come out the window. Unfortunately, in the end, the film challenges the tolerance of public beliefs. However, it is easy to forgive this flaw due to superior acting, character development and wonderful carnival atmosphere. Do not expect to like any of the characters. Armand Asante, Norman Redus and Dagmara Dominczyk interpret obscure cheaters, not exactly the kind of person easily admired. The double crosses come swift and furious, and the final cross is a bit exaggerated. Recommended. - MERK
