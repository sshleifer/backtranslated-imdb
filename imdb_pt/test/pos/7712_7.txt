This is one of the stories of the periphery told by the Animatrix that is not directly relevant to war. A glorifying plot of the films, but Trinity, expressed by Carrie, appears in it. He owns a private detective who is hired for a lot of money to look for a hacker named Trinity. we see his research, which features other PIs, only one he knows, who seemingly went crazy from his own experience trying to track down Trinity. eventually he makes contact with Trinity, who he assumes to be a man, of course - told in the narrative and something that puts us firmly in his own perspective, despite what we already know - in a chat room and solves a riddle that the force in haste to catch a train. he forgets his hat, but his faithful cat throws him in a moment of ridicule, so absurd that it is hilarious. He finds it on the train, but the stratagem is thus revealed when the agents attack; the agents were using it to get to Trinity and Trinity was trying to release the PIs sent after her, which he does not know, of course, and which is not explicitly stated in the animation itself, something common to film noir titles, which often suggest many interesting stories, subplots, developments, etc. but show no more than the main story and a limited point of view to create an extra air of mystery and intrigue. <br /> <br /> Nearly everything in this short is in black and white, the music is reminiscent of film noir and the eccentric, old-fashioned still dedicated detective is the perfect protagonist for a noir movie title. The Curiosities section of the entry of this title in IMDb also presents some references that this title makes to the hardboiled literature, something that also is based, a genre of mysteries for detectives, gangsters etc. who engage in challenging conflicts with ease and frequency. Properly animated by Studio 4 Â° C and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, it is a nice variant on the usual matrix story.
