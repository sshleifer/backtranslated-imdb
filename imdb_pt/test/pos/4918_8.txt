I gave this show a chance because of Jaleel White, not because of his Urkel character, but mostly because of Sonic the Hedgehog XD's voice So, like I said, I gave it a try, and I really liked it. I never cared about Urkel's character, so I was glad to see Mr. White in a different role from the always-so-annoying nerd. And his Calvin J. Fraiser (first called Calvin, but comes the second episode, everyone started calling him "J") was very entertaining and interesting. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite episode was when J was dating the ex-Cowboys cheerleader with the snobbish boy. ("Do not talk like that about my mother!" "This is an adult conversation, you're down there!") The only thing I have is that the show should have 3 main characters, but Mr. White's character has always seemed to have more attention and the other two (who are married) have always had the stories behind ... It's not exactly a good thing when a story about the two possibly being pregnant lags behind for J. having babysit his girlfriend's puppy ..... <br /> <br /> Other than that, I really wish this show could have lasted a little longer. Unfortunately, it seems people were not interested in Jaleel White as anything other than the boring and horrible nerd of God known as Urkel ... <br /> <br /> I hope they have at least put it as a DVD box. set.
