The Thing has to be one of the best films of all time. Of course it was innovative special effects at the time of its release, which impressed me so much, in 1982, I just did not see any of it! However, although the effects themselves have made the film more horrifying, it was the story itself, the soundtrack, the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic, as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the condemned research station that makes it a classic. <br /> <br /> Movies are no better than this! In the opening scene, with the helicopter chasing this husky, you assume that some scientists were bored of some station leaving some steam. However, when you see them continue their pursuit at the US base, you think that Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme fever from cabin fever. However, this is offset by the ominous opening song that sets the pace! You just know something is not right! At that point, it is a mystery until "the thing" is revealed. <br /> <br /> However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of sci-fi style of Agatha Christie's "who dunnit" (that is, ten small Indians), since members do not know which of their team is really an alien. Suspicion continues to go back and forth between them all, one by one, they are eventually knocked over or revealed as aliens. The mistrust between the station staff is absorbing as the film progresses to the final showdown. <br /> <br /> After 20 years of advancement in computer graphics and film production, the special effects in "The Thing" do not carry the same weight as in 1982, but in addition, it stays very well at all levels , with some great performances by the cast.
