I loved this movie Not because of the romantic stories among women, but because of the visualization of human strength, despair and liberation. This movie is a must see. Funny! Emotional! Captivating! All the characters are very well written and portrayed by some very talented actors. This story is a story of self-discovery and sexual awakening. A journey of mind, body and soul. You identify with the characters and at some points, even the plot. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I recommend watching the movie first, then reading the book. If you read the book first, you'll be a bit disappointed. The adaptation of the script cut a lot and some things have changed. Some for the better and some for the worst.
