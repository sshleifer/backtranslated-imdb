Although many pass this as a B movie, it is, in fact, a first-class comedy that is well written and acted. Red Skelton is great as Wally Benton, better known by radio fans as The Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wally's fianc√©e Carol Lambert. Conrad Veidt leads a pack of criminals very well. I read an account of this movie that states that Vincente Minelli directed this movie, not unless he changed his name to S. Sylvan Simon who directed all three of Fox's films. This is a very entertaining film made when the imagination was encouraged . So, overcome your black and white prejudice if you have one, sit back and enjoy a really great comedy. This was also Red's first leading role. Take note during the climax of the reference to Orson Welles's War of the Worlds broadcast.
