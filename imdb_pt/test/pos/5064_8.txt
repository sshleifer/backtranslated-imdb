Is torture right? No The answer is simple and absolute, with no qualifications possible. The reason this film has shown is the effect that torture has on society. The values ​​that have been fought hard in Western society through centuries of revolution and struggle are so that ALL men and women can live in a free and open society. One where individuals are treated equally and with respect to their essential rights as human beings. To protect this society, institutions have been developed to deal with irregularities openly, fairly and honestly. These institutions have been adapted and improved through generations of hard work. It could be argued that these are the true foundations of democracy, because they belong to all of us, allow us to all be heard. If we allow antidemocratic and inhuman acts to be committed on our behalf, if we divide our society between those who have rights and those who do not have rights, then we undo the work of our ancestors. Besides, we are all accomplices and all guilty and contaminated. If those we accuse are guilty or not, it does not matter. We are defined by our attitudes and our responses.
