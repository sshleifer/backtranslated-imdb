I saw the second part of this beautiful period on a ship sometime in the nineteenth century. Golding's book should be responsible for some of the excellent dialogues, but everything else was good too! I particularly liked the way they created the period and the feeling of being on the ship so well. For me, this had a sense of perfection on the subject, which I know I will not be able to convey in words ... Perhaps it was the way they mingled in technical and historical details about sailing in the eighteen hundred of history without spoiling all. above. Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent as was the rest of the cast. Not often a mini-series sends me to the "zone", but this did.
