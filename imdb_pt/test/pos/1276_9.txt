Chris Nolan's labyrinth as noir about voyeurism and identity is incredible from start to finish. A first movie is as complex as "Memento" or "The Prestige", though perhaps a little more difficult to understand. Yet it smells of originality and creativity, and has a "twist" as intellectually challenging as a realistic pulp. Few filmmakers have made the best use of their editors and attention to the narrative that Nolan has. The story is about a bored writer who likes to randomly follow strangers down the street until he follows someone, who has noticed him following others, and follows him, from there complexity increases and identities begin to reorganize. More naturalistic and realistic than Nolan's later work, but equally pointed.
