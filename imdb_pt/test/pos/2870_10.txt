Kane is a murderer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this old hotel set afire, where eight convicted teenagers are going to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for three of them. In my case, it was not the best writing or the best of all. I still thought the murder scenes were very well done. Like when the girl is going to be devoured by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he pushed the phone through Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a great horror movie actor, he had this serious look at the entire movie and it would never change. That was your only look at the entire movie. Great action and killing scenes, I do not think I could give a total of 10 out of 10 but 6 looks good.
