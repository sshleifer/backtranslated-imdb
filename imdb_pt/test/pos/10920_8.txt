In & Out is a comedy with a simple premise. She admirably succeeds in the mission of being funny and funny. The comedy in this movie ranges from ridicule to sublime, physical comedy exists alongside dry humor with a good veteran by Bob Newhart. Kevin Kline is predictably in excellent shape in this film, alongside Tom Selleck who does not play with his long-awaited "square-jawed man." Mr. Selleck plays his humor well and displays a good sense of comic timing. The cast makes this movie successful. <br /> <br /> Not all gay-themed films are meant to promote some sort of Hollywood's sinister and hidden liberal agenda. In fact, this movie was meant to entertain, and if any, some of those movies make the viewer think, so it was a byproduct of the successful work of a great cast of professionals. Often ironic, I found myself laughing at the right moments. A solid "B."
