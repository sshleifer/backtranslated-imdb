I remember not liking this movie the first time I saw it, but it grew in me. I love the costumes and poses the actors do, the humor, the cinematography, the soundtrack. The scenes are very rich and move very quickly. Every time I watch, there is something new that catches my eye. Aaliyah as Akasha is probably the only thing that spoils him, but not enough. <br /> <br /> In addition, Lestat in this film is different, not the same character. You can see that the character Armand received qualities similar to Lestat because I'm guessing Anne wanted him. But there's no reason to destroy this movie just because it's not like books, it's fascinating by itself.
