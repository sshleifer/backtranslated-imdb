I agree with Vince, this movie paved the way for the Goodfellas. The scene in which Pesci was throwing peanuts at the pianist reminded me of "How am I funny?" routine at Goodfellas. This is a highly underrated film and deserves some attention. As with many other Mafia movies, the theme of The Death Collector is true: always respect the Don.
