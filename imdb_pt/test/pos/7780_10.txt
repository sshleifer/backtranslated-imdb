Love Jones cleverly portrays young African American men and women in a clear, positive and realistic sense. I feel that all the actors and actresses were magnificent and really did a great job at capturing the mood. Nia Long and Larenz Tate worked well together and hope to see more work from both. In fact, all the actors did such a good job that it would be great to see another romantic comedy of theirs. This movie can be compared to any well-written romantic comedy. If you have not yet seen this movie, I highly recommend you do so, it can definitely give you another perspective on life and love.
