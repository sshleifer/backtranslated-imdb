Edward Dmytryk directed this grim movie about a murder investigation involving demobilized military personnel. Robert Young begins to teach us about hate, Robert Mitchum goes through most of this photo, and Gloria Grahame revisits the mood she exhibited in "It's a Wonderful Life." It is Robert Ryan who is at the center of the subject: anti-Semitism. He goes as deep in his role as Monty Montgomery (Imagine's parents call Lawrence calling his son Larry!), That the drama is on his shoulders, and he's more than ready for the challenge. Without it, the movie would be ordinary. Ryan played a number of memorable villains in his day ("Bad Day in Black Rock", "Billy Budd"), but this performance put him on the map. With Sam Levene as the murder victim.
