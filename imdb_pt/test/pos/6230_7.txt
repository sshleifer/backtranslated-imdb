"Tourist Trap" is among my favorite horror films of the 70s and early 80s. A group of young people are going somewhere, a couple in the car ahead, and this car has an apartment, and our movie starts with the young man, Woody, pushing the tire toward a service station. He finds a seemingly abandoned place, and still hears voices and investigates, and ends up with a piece of tube in his stomach for his efforts. Along comes the rest of the young people (in a VW Thing) and they get Woody's girlfriend, and find this same place, Slausen's Oasis, or something ... and then Mr. Slausen happens together while the girls are enjoying a plunge into the stream. Of course, the VW Thing mysteriously died at this point, so strange Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) offers his help. Mr. Slausen has a museum, with many wax figures, and he lives in the museum, but behind is a large house, where he says Davey lives. And who is Davey? Why, Davey Crockett, he says ... but if it was Davey Crockett, everyone would probably be safer. The girls are left alone while Slausen will help fix the car, but of course curiosity gets the better of one and she will investigate, and finds the house full of scary mannequins and a very lively call ... Davey. What follows is a scary night of terror as one by one, they are taken prisoner by Davey, who claims to be Slausen's brother. A girl (abducted earlier) is treated with a plaster facial, resulting in her death when she covers her air supply. Anyway, there is a bit of a twist to this and kind (but strange) Mr. Slausen is not exactly what he seems to be. A good and scary horror movie from the late 70's, and many mannequins create a very creepy atmosphere. 7 out of 10.
