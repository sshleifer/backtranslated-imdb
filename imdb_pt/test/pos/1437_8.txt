The Golden Arm Man was one of the first films to have as its main theme (and, in some ways, the message) the tragedy of heroin addiction. It's not even close to a big movie, but its importance lies in Otto Preminger's dedication to making it look real and on the verge of melodrama and naturalism. What I liked is that it's not so much an exhibit of junkies (if you want the best exposure than reading Naked Lunch, if you can go through it anyway, in addition to the point), but the nature of the urban environment Frankie Machine lives . He hopes that after getting out of jail by dealing with straight and narrow things, become a drummer for a band and make him legitimate as a musician. But he has his wife "crippled" Zosch, who can not work and needs money and often complains, and then there is the old neighborhood - he can not escape seeing Louie (Darren McGavin) who is still playing card games at racks and, yes, pushing drugs. Like Mean Streets, it's hard to escape the minutia unless you walk away. <br /> <br /> But again, it's hard for Frankie Machine not to try to operate naturally in this urban neighborhood. It's just that he can not escape the temptation of garbage (when he is registered on a charge of false theft with his friend, he sees a panicked addict, and this puts back the fear of returning to his self-cleansing). And impersonating Frankie is Sinatra, and I can not see anyone else who could have played him, until Brando's original choice. It fits into the neighborhood and seems to be the kind of guy who should be one step ahead of the game. But there is also a vulnerability to Sinatra that he pulls wonderfully, and by the time we see him going 'cold' in Molly's apartment, it's believable even if it's not the kind of thing my 'generation' would think of heroin (or Trainspotting and certainly Requiem for a Dream). If for nothing else, you want to watch the movie to see what happens to Sinatra like this character. <br /> <br /> The flaws, however, come in some of the other presentations, though it's a bit tricky. Eleanor Parker seems to be exaggerating for much of the film, fooling Frankie that she is really crippled when in fact she can walk and is cheating him for one reason or another. But then it gets clearer as it goes - it's supposed to be crazy and crazy with jealousy, and at that level it starts to get better. Meanwhile, Kim Novak is good, though not worthy of Vertigo, as the possible girl on the side, but more like the voice of reason in history. Then there is a detective Bendar, who may be one of the characters / performances over a note of all time. And Sparrow, Frankie's nerdy friend, and the characters of Louie and Schiefka, and they're all played as one might expect (actually McGavin is better than OK). As for casting another talent around Sinatra, Preminger does not do very well. And frankly, some scenes suddenly fall. <br /> <br /> But there is much fascination in Man with the Golden Arm, and not only as something of sociological interest. It works as a convincing drama, and as a message conveyed without being biased or exaggerated. It is a genuine article, not exceptional.
