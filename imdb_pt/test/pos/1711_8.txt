If (as I pointed out in THE GOAT) Keaton is following the tradition of comics lying in disagreement with the law, this Langdon short (the last released before him TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) was based on another comic trick - being married to a smart spouse and try to flee for some secret dating. Laurel and Hardy did this in several films, as did Fields and Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with that - why do these characters always marry such nasty women? And there is an interesting sociological question - why do not you find female comics married to male mates for these megeras? I do not remember any except in a satire by Carol Burnett, where the two most unpleasant members of two couples find that they prefer someone to give them back the best they can (a kind of mutual sadomasochism, but also the certainty that they do not is married to a namby-pamby type). As for comics marrying shrews, I suppose you can imagine they get what they deserve. Or them? Ollie really deserves a wife who throws pans and dishes for him? Yes, he went to that convention in SONS OF THE DESERT that ruined his plans, but he wanted to spend some time in private - there is nothing to suggest that he and Stan have betrayed their wives. In fact, he is cursed by Mae Busch because he lied to her while Stan collapsed and told the truth to his wife. <br /> <br /> Here Harry's wife (Alice Ward) is shown at first by talking to her mother about how she keeps him under strict control. We see Harry at work (it's Saturday morning, and work ends at noon for the rest of the weekend - this was before the idea of ​​a five-day work a week, 40 hours a week in the industry). He works in a foundry where he hits a hot red metal in shape (a joke about Langdon - he's a small, lightweight man, not the muscular type to swing a sledgehammer). He just misses the tram trying to give birth to a man. He calls the house to explain things and receives a rebuke from the lady for being two minutes late. <br /> <br /> On the way home, Harry meets his friend Steve (Vernon Dent) who met two beautiful girls who would love to have a date. Harry is hesitant, but agrees to this after talking to the girl (he agrees to pay for the hot dogs for the four of them - he has a 1926 silver dollar in his pocket). But his plans seem derailed when his wife discovers his "hiding" of coins. He keeps it hidden under the living room rug and finds him walking along the edge of the rug. But his wife spies on him and confiscates all this. Later she hears him talking to himself and rebuking her. Scorned, she returns a penny and says she can treat her with a soda. <br /> <br /> But Harry has a second deposit of coins and dresses for the date - and leaves. He and Dent are apparently late, and Dent blames Harry, but Harry tries to compensate: he produces two prostitutes. They get into a fight when Dent (wisely) says they are not the kind of girls he would call "cool". Eventually the girls appear and the date begins. But soon Harry is hiding in the crash as his wife passes by on his roadster, and the girl friends appear - furious with their two rivals. <br /> <br /> The short one works well and is fun, and gives a better idea of ​​the persona that Harry Langdon developed in his brief stardom as a comic master. He is constantly placed by others. He misses the tram because a stranger keeps asking for smoke and light and, in the end, the stranger is alone. The cool girl who is Harry's girlfriend has a little dog that chases him. He rests between two cars that start to move away and he ends up curled up on a pole. It certainly demonstrates that Langdon had his personality on the screen when he made his features. If only he could have kept the entire complex beyond those first three features.
