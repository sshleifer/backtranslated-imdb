I had never read any of Sarah Waters' novels, nor watched Tipping the Velvet. I only heard of Fingersmith when I was flipping through "The L Word" sites. The plot of Fingersmith interested me, but I went through it, thinking "Lesbians in the Victorian period, it never ends well, I have enough of these lesbo series and films that do not go where" during Christmas my local DVD store gave a discount to Fingersmith, I brought the DVD, and my life was never more colorful <br /> <br /> This mini series deserves to be appreciated and praised. The acting is so great that I call it rare. Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy, Rupert Evans, Imelda Staunton and many others who I can not name all brought light and darkness to their characters. Just by a small gesture, a small look, a little touch, they made their characters real and as a spectator, I could not help but took them home, keep them close. <br /> <br /> Fingersmith, set in the Victorian area, is a story of Sue, a thief who loves and lives with her "family" pick-pockets. Little did she know that her fate is tied to Maud Lily - a timid and shy little girl grows up in a mansion miles away. Maud's mother left a fortune, but Maud herself can not touch it unless she marries. Worst of all, Maud's uncle ensures that she will never keep her trapped in the house. <br /> <br /> Enter Lord Gentlement, a charming and handsome thief with a heart as bad as any. He wants Maud's fortune for himself and for this he puts Sue as Maud Lily's maid, asking Sue to persuade Maud to run away with him. as time passed, things would be simple if Sue did not fall in love with Maud. <br /> <br /> And things would be simple if the story was what I just told. I do not want to ruin it, so I'd like to stop there. But I can assure you that everything is distorted and turned over before you can realize what has happened. Once that happens, you wonder what would happen next. In addition, the story is full of passion unlike any other. There is no self-questioning, questioning sexuality, "Oh my god I like girls" moments, because Fingersmith girls are buried so deep in their own darkness that they can barely care. the story with such a sinuous plot moves as smoothly as the water, running passionately but strangely calm. Weeks have passed since I watched "Fingersmith," but Maud's eyes still haunt me, and Sue's words still warm my heart "You pearl, your pearl, your pearl," she said. . And such a pearl is.
