All right, I'll grant you that part of the science in "Doppelganger" (or "Journey to the Far Side of the Sun") is a kind of dope. The idea of ​​an entire planet being undetected (because we can not see it from the other side of our sun) does not hold - any student of Astronomy 101 knows that another planet the size of Earth would cause gravitational perturbations in the movements of other planets. This is how astronomers deduced the existence of Pluto, after all, and this is how they find comets, asteroids, and moons on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> And the idea that a mirror image of the Earth has evolved somehow almost parallel to our Earth, to scientists who speak English and human counterparts to every human born on our Earth ... that takes the things from "hard science" fiction to the "Twilight Zone" territory. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it requires a major suspension of critical thinking to accept and enjoy. <br /> <br /> But man, this movie made me serious when I was a teenager. I was still used to gay and upbeat science fiction films when the hero would win in the end - even "2001" could be interpreted as having an "optimistic" ending. <br /> <br /> But in this case: Thinnes tried to dock with his orbiting mother ship so he could return to his own Earth, only to be taken out of his anchorage (something about "the polarities not being reversed because his 'Doppelganger' was not doing the same thing. Apparently, Thinnes' doppelganger had decided he was happy in his new home.) Thinnes's ship started the descent back to the CounterEarth launch site, and I was right that he would have the damaged ship safely land and try again, armed with new information that would allow him and his supporters to succeed.He was the hero after all, and the hero always wins in the end. Instead, Thinnes failed to maintain control of the crippled aircraft, and the subsequent drop of the ship at the launch site was so horrible and devastating that it killed everyone (except the project leader) and destroyed all records the project and of Thinnes' existence. Thinnes never got home, and he perished uselessly, his secrets never revealed. Except for the Planet Of The Apes series, I had never seen such a sad and pessimistic ending, and it always stayed in my head - especially the fierce devastation of the crash scene near the start of the movement. (you knew the spacecraft would NEVER fly again!) and the one at the end. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this movie again and see how well it has stayed through the years.
