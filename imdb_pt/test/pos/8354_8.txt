Another good Disney animation. The sequences are not always optimal and tend to follow the same plot as the original. However, Tramp's son tries to savor the world outside the home and family he knows and learns where he really belongs. Being a scrap metal dog is not for everyone, er dog that is, but Scamp overcomes adversities. The voices of the various characters were superb and provided by various actors known as Scott Wolf, Alyssa Milano and Mickey Rooney. Fun and a well done family movie.
