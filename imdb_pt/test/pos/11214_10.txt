Uzak (2002), a Turkish film screened in the US as "Distant", was directed, produced, written and filmed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. This film is a dark and sombre version of the clash between a "city mouse", Mahmut, played by Muzaffer Özdemir, and a "mouse", Yusuf, played by Emin Toprak. <br /> <br /> Both men are excellent actors, and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting ability. (Tragically, Emin Toprak died in an automobile accident shortly after the film was completed.) In most tales of cousins ​​and cities, the contrast between rural and urban lifestyles is depicted humorously . In this movie, there is little humor or even heat. Both men have lost touch with human society. Mahmut's job as a commercial photographer for a tile company does not give him satisfaction. He divorced a woman he clearly still loves, and does not have satisfying human relationships. <br /> Mahmut lost his job because of a factory in his small town, and he did not have the skills or the energy to find work in the city. Their human interactions are basically confined to silent observations of other people who cross their path. He is clearly a warm and caring person, but can not express these qualities in an urban environment. <br /> <br /> Cousins ​​do not relate well to the world and do not relate well to each other. Neither strives to act in a way that provides an opportunity for unity or closeness. <br /> <br /> In a sense, this movie portrays a wasted opportunity. Conceivably, each cousin could have provided at least part of what was missing in the other's life. Instead, they run parallel and unhappy courses. The two men are distant, which is a situation suggested by the title of the film. <br /> <br /> One of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which Ceylan builds details and details. Ultimately, these details tell us more about the characters than we could have learned from simple exposure. <br /> <br /> Uzak was shown as part of the Rochester Labor Film series. It is not a "working film" in the traditional sense of this genre. It is a working film because it demonstrates the harmful effects of unsatisfactory work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf). <br /> <br /> This is a dark, absorbing and somber film. Although not a good idea, I left the theater realizing that I had seen a really creative and important film. This movie is worth finding and see!
