This has to be one of the most wonderfully morbid movies I've ever seen. Merhige created a living painting that unfolds with horrible violence, sex and a minimalist recapitulation of the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and thick grain layer makes you wonder about what you actually see sometimes, but the use of texture combined with extreme contrast creates an incredible viewing experience. This movie is not for everyone. I think you have to keep an open mind and do not be so quick to condemn this movie for its content, which, if it is extremely difficult, but makes a fairly important statement about creation, god and humanity. Whether this film is a work of art or rubbish worth shocking is open to discussion.
