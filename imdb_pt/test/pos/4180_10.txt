Try to look for another movie that is a journey without having a story or plot and you will be pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentation. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not just a one-time time capsule but also an experimental feature that defies time, space, and conventions in a way that only the 1960s underground films could. reflection of these films. No matter how you feel about the Monkees, this is a film that every filmmaker must see because it opens the infinite possibilities of the film as a medium of art. If it were not for the unorthodox publicity campaign of the film (and the fact that by the time it left, the Monkees saturated the media in such a way that the public got tired of them and that every critic was ready to attack them) had a much greater impact. Studying how the film was edited is so much more important and exciting than what's actually in the movie - and there are still some great things about it (great music, great cinematography, etc.). It should be seen after midnight for maximum effect because of your overall dreamy feeling. 1968 was a time of social unrest and a request for change (thus the working title of the film "Changes") and HEAD perfectly mirrors that time.
