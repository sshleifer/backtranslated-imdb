'Ray' lives in Ray Dir, Taylor Hackford Cast Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Regina King, Clifton Powell, Curtis Armstrong and Sharon Warren. Written by Taylor Hackford and James L. White. *** *** "Hit the road Jack, and do not come back? Who would have thought that this immortal line that almost became a corrective mantra for broken relationships in popular culture was conceived about a lovers fight! and if there was one thing he knew, breathed and lived, it was music, so in all his life he understood acute poverty, a desperate struggle with darkness, guilt, drugs and painful problems; in which inspiration struck him out of nowhere and words and notes took their own shape to form a classic eternal snapshot! <br /> <br /> There are some lives that deserve to be transformed into the silver screen. was one of them.It's almost a shock to know that this project did not have studio support until it was completed !. And this support probably came after the early shows where Jamie Foxx's performance was praised and predicted as an Oscar winner with cert eza in a low voice.Jackie Foxx as Ray almost convinces us that it is indeed Ray Charles performing on the screen and not an actor getting past! From the crooked omniscient smile to the crooked walk of not so much a handicapped man, but of a man dancing through his demons, Foxx captures all the essences of the true Ray Charles. Ray was a complicated man. He never demanded sympathy and very rarely showed it alone. An astute businessman, he guaranteed his success at any cost, sometimes at the price of losing his loved ones. He never apologized for his manly ways and always maintained that he loved his family, which we are convinced he did. He liked sex; It was that simple! But, below all, there was also a thunderbolt that was afraid of the darkness. Imagine the horrors of a blind man afraid of the darkness! His fear was because of his guilt. Ray was convinced that he was the reason for his brother's death, and his whole life was spent trying to redeem himself. Ray was a dissident who merged gospel with jazz, a blasphemous practice unheard of in the 1950s. But his intentions were not instigated. He was simply practicing the only way he knew to approach God! <br /> <br /> It's hard to capture a life as full of events as Ray's, and it is perhaps there that the film fails. We are never really allowed to get close to Ray as a person. We know it only as much as we see it. Their relationships, especially with Margie Hendricks (Regina King), are not explored in detail. And the script barely passes by Della Bea (Kerry Washington), Ray's wife, who everyone knows was a rock by her side. And the biggest mistake of all is the hurried and almost abrupt climax. It's as if the director suddenly realized that he was out of stock and ordered a package! However, 'Ray' is definitely recommended for an impeccable performance of Jamie Foxx and a stellar ensemble. The songs and the age create a sense of nostalgia, and we have the genuine feeling that the film is done with sincerity. <br /> <br /> Note - 'Ray' is nominated for six categories at this year's Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (Jamie Foxx). Rating- *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent *** February 2005
