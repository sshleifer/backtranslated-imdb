The CGI feature film has just been released this year, but while it will provide a lot of fun for kids, for stubborn Alvin fanatics and followers who grew up with the 60's and 80's versions of cartoons, The Chipmunk Adventure is probably the best animated film based on Alvin and the Chipmunks of all time. For starters, the animation is always fantastic, the character designs are as they should be in cartoons - unlike the movie itself, it's simply fun to watch. there are no celebrity voices, no CGI effects, only 2-D quality, hand-drawn animation and fantastic colors - bright, bold and beautiful. Jokes and humor are typical patterns of squirrels and the narrative is perfect. In fact, The Chipmunk Adventure is all that the live action movie should have been, but it's not. Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete with the Chipettes, Elenor, Jeanette and Britney in a hot air balloon contest, and along the way, children find all sorts of problems and dilemmas they need to solve in their own way. And no squirrel movie is complete without the bizarre interpretations of the classic rock and pop anthems. <br /> <br /> The Squirrel's Adventure is for kids and adults - which is another advantage over the CGI movie - while version will win some new admirers, the 1987 movie will appeal to young and old Chipmunk fans . Bagdarasian and Karman provide the helium voices of the movie trio. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a must for fans of the cartoon itself - you will not be disappointed. If you have seen the live version then you will feel that this film is a much better effort in contrast. If you have not, then you should go and see him still, or still forget the movie Jason Lee and alternatively, stick with this
