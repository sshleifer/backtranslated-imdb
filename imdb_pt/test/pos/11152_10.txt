This has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns I have ever seen. Having a soft spot for the genre (westerns are or were, since they are no longer made many times - pieces of morality that have often been denigrated by critics with intellectual pretensions), I bought the DVD, invisible vision, because I had read enough about the work of William S. Hart (much of what he wrote and directed) to arouse my interest and thought I should have at least one of his films in my collection of videos. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I approached the real vision with some trepidation. My previous experiences with silent movie "classics" have left me feeling discouraged. Chaney's Phantom of the Opera, Griffith's Birth of a Nation, and Fairbanks's Fox Mark were all right, but not as good as their reputations would have led them to expect. They were either very long, or very theatrical, or both. <br /> <br /> The Toll Gate, however, came as a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> It's a story told in a simple and straightforward way. Black Deering (played by Hart), leader of a notoriously successful criminal gang, thinks the time has come for the group to disperse before the fate is over. However, he is thwarted by his main lieutenant, Jordan, who urges them all to one last assault, promising great wealth, but leads them into a trap in which he is complicit. Everyone is dead except for Deering, who is taken prisoner. When his captors recognize him as the man who once saved a number of soldiers and settlers, alerting an outpost of an imminent Indian attack, they let him escape. Free, he tries to find honest work, but is despised and ridiculed and finally must steal again to survive. Soon, he is pursued not only by the sheriff's squad, but also by Jordan (now thriving with the reward money he collected) and his henchmen. His flight takes him to a remote hut inhabited by a single mother and her little son. After some initial seizures, they take him to their hearts. Deering sees the chance for a new life, but with the platoon and Jordan approaching, realizes that this may not be possible. <br /> <br /> Hart was the first major Western star and the first to inject realism into the genre. As one of the movie pioneers, he has created many of the characters and situations that have become clichés in the westerns for more than ninety years. What keeps his films interesting, however, was his ability to go beyond the cliché (maybe his imitators have not gone far enough) to make the material look fresh and innovative even now. Three of these examples in The Toll Gate illustrate this: 1) In one scene, your character shoots a mob in an attempt to kill Jordan, and kills a viewer instead. A subsequent close-up shows that he is clearly frustrated. The frustration, however, does not come from the fact that he shot down a man who hitherto did him no harm, but that he lost his target. <br /> <br /> 2) In another, when he flees the platoon, his "borrowed" horse goes into a hole and breaks his leg. Hart pulls the gun out of misery, but before he pulls the trigger, he pats a sad, loving pat on the head as if to say goodbye to an old friend. <br /> <br /> 3) And finally, after he strangled Jordan and threw his body on a cliff, he returns to retrieve his weapons and sees his opponent's pistol on the next floor. He takes a step forward and gives a quick kick before riding his horse. It is a simple gesture, but it emphasizes the deep aversion that he feels for the man who betrayed him and his comrades. <br /> <br /> And I love the title, The Toll Gate. It is allegorical in its implication that a man can not begin a new life until he has paid for the sins of his former. Deering's payment comes in the form of sacrifice. Today's most sophisticated audiences may not fully believe this sentiment, but they can still work on you if you let them. <br /> <br /> Viewers who enjoy their videos in perfect condition will undoubtedly oppose the DVD's image quality, especially the videos. end coil badly damaged. I do not care at all. That a copy of this 1920 film does not even exist is a miracle, since the impressions of so many other silent films have been lost. If you keep this in mind and look at the film as a piece of history, your visual flaws are not so difficult to accept. William S. Hart was born in New York in 1870 but grew up in Minnesota and Wisconsin where he learned to speak Sioux and Indian sign language. He told Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson among his friends and collected paintings of Remington, so his knowledge of the West was firsthand. If his view seems overly romanticized by today's standards, it is, however, much closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the 1960s and 1970s and the revisionist works that followed. Both the star and his films are late for reevaluation.
