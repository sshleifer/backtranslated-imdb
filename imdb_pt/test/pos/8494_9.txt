Taylor Hackford wanted to make this film for 15 years and finally found Jamie Foxx to play the lead role. Foxx is amazing in his rendition of Ray Charles. From an interview I saw with Foxx, he met Charles several times and the two also played the piano together (Foxx took piano lessons as a child and played piano in all his scenes). I have not seen Charles live until his later years, so it was great to have a perspective on how his career developed. I hope Foxx is nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor, because he certainly deserves it. The music is also incredible - it really shows the breadth of Charles's music, country music to the blues, and everything. The film also gives an unblemished view of the life of Ray Charles, the many women with whom he relates to the drug habit and the consequences of it.
