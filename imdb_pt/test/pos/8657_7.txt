Bothersome Man is a clever and surreal movie that makes you reevaluate what you're doing with your life and what makes you vibrate. When you see these people in zombies as transes making everyday events and realize that it is what we do and what we want in real life, it really comes close to home. This is a surprisingly effective movie that in the end leaves you asking questions about your direction and not so much about the movie. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the main character whose life we ​​have a third-person view of as he tries to adapt to a new life after being relocated. At first, he seems to be the most popular guy in town, since everyone at work meets him and he is invited to dinners, etc. A good example of this is in the scene with his new boss, who offers him an envelope of an unspecified amount. Money saying "here's a little bit to get you started." Andreas even gets a 20 minute girlfriend in the movie, with which he eventually moves. This seems to be an ideal living situation, since his girlfriend is an established, attractive interior designer, and never bothered with anything he does. But Andreas is not satisfied with their relationship as with the rest of the world. He then begins an affair with a co-worker named Ingeborg, who he finally leaves Anne and states that he is in love with. After telling Ingeborg how he feels, she tells him that she is also seeing other co-workers and says that all relationships are "cool". Soon after we see Andreas in a train station where he tries to end his misery and to the disappointment of the public does not happen. Still searching for salvation, Andreas meets Hugo, who has found a hole from where music can be heard. So they embark on a mission to get to the other side, will it be better or worse? "The Bothersome Man" shows society's obsession with appearances and its materialistic mentality. It does a great job making fun of us by filling homes with IKEA products that the characters spend each lunch choosing. I think he's mostly mocking Scandinavian society and its high suicide rates. For example, there is a scene in the film in which Andreas encounters a man who jumped from a building to a fortified fence. Andreas, fed up with this world, cuts off his finger and then jumps in front of a train; This is one of the strangest and outrageous scenes I've ever seen. This world created by Lien is equivalent to purgatory, where there is no punishment or reward. In this world, drink after drink, Andreas never got drunk, the sex was not satisfactory and, try as he might, could not kill himself. This movie reminded me of "Fight Club" and how both main characters were half out of sync with the world around them. In "Fight Club", Tyler Durden creates a second person who does everything he would not do and in this movie the awakened Andreas is the equivalent of Tyler Durden. After a while, he wakes up and tries to escape the bland life that is now far away, escaping through a hole in the wall. <br /> <br /> Lien does a great job with continuity in the movie, which means that when a character has a half-full glass in his hand and they cut back, they have the glass in the same hand and it is not full. empty showing that the shot was made the other day. Nowadays directors are more concerned about the sound effects and ignore the little things, as is the character who wears the bracelet in the same hand of yesterday's filming? Since taking over TV for three years at school, it's hard for me not to look for continuity or voice overs to drive me crazy. Lien does the little things well, he has great lighting in every scene, never leaves you wondering why something is in a shot and brings up an interesting topic. This movie really worked for me because it not only ridicules the Scandinavians, but Western society and what's wrong with that. The only real problem I had was with the man who commits suicide by jumping on a spiked fence. Because you finally find out that this world has no death, but he laid motionless, forcing you to assume that he was dead and this is never answered in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the only main character that others come and go and never do more than support him. His first girlfriend, Anne Britt, is an interior designer who seems to be perfect for him, but turns out to be dull. This brings him to Ingeborg with whom he begins a case and falls in love. He soon discovers that she was with a handful of other men and that what he felt was not real. Andreas ends up finding Hugo in the bathroom of a bar complaining about how nothing is hotter and how he can not get drunk any more. He follows Hugo home to find the hole in the wall with what is filled with the laughter of the children and the birds singing. <br /> <br /> Lien does not have much on the resume, but "The Bothersome Man" is more than a leap for a great career, but a preview of a future director. If this is an indication of his talent and potential as a storyteller, Lien has a bright future and we can only hope that his future films will not take so long to make it abroad for our viewing pleasure. So sit back and enjoy the ride while director Jens Lien takes you from the comfort of your home to the dream world that is "The Bothersome Man."
