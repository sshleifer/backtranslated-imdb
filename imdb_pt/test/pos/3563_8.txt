A gang of thugs led by the cunning, sturdy and relentless Monetero (a perfectly imposing performance of Gilbert Roland) steals $ 300,000 in gold coins during a daring train robbery. But the untrustworthy member Bahunda (a playful play by Jose Torres) runs away with the coins and hides them. Unfortunately, Bahunda is dead before he can tell Monetero where he hid the booty. So Monetero has to join forces with the cunning, enigmatic, enigmatic bounty hunter Stranger (gently played by the handsome George Hilton) and corrupt banker Clayton (a delightfully charming portrait of the 1950s teen idol "Kookie" Burns) to find the coins. . Skillfully directed by Enzo G. Castellari, with a clever, complex and twist-loaded script by Castellari, Tito Carpi and Giovanni Simonelli, a playfully amoral and nihilistic tone (everyone keeps double and triple crossing each other with greedy abandonment greedy) , a vibrant and sensational soundtrack by Alessandro Alessandroni and Francesco De Masi, with many exciting shootings and a series of aggressive sounds, a malicious sense of mocking humor, a steady pace and a real surprise of surprise. ending, this dizzying and often hilarious feature makes for an inspired rendition of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" by Sergio Leone. Appearing in cool secondary parts are the hot Stefanie Careddu as Marisol, the fierce friend of Monetero Marisol, Ivano Staccioli as an uncompromising army captain, and Gerard Herter as the flinty Lawman Lawman Blackman. A joke immensely fun and enjoyable.
