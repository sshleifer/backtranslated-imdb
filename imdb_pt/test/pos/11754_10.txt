Two great stars and a legendary director have created a magnificent love story that is memorable and moves on many levels. Henry King directed Jennifer Jones on his first hit, Song of Bernadette, and he again directs Jennifer Jones in this film and Miss Jones are perfect in this role and give a beautiful performance that captures the conflict in the character and Bill Holden who came home running back home in the 1950s with a string of hit films beginning with Sunset Blvd, Stalag 17, Born Yesterday, Country Girl, Picnic, and of course, River Kwai is excellent at this role. Hard to imagine anyone but Holden in this movie I loved the ending and I cry every time I see it. For those who have loved and lost, you will understand. For those who do not, you will not.
