I loved this movie ... So much emotion in such a short time. I loved the beginning and how it gets you completely off guard. I love story and deer being brought. I know when I think of deer I think of innocence and prosperity. Moreover, in Psalm 42: 2, in the Bible, it says, "As the deer takes care of the streams of water, so my soul cares for me, O God." Which could even connect the last moment the woman says that everything will be all right. Like she knows she's going with God. Maybe I'm thinking about it a lot. But sometimes it's interesting to see what happens in people's minds. Thank you for sharing this masterpiece with viewers everywhere. I live in Texas and had to play the cable ... I immediately logged on to the computer to find out more about this movie and this incredible director! I really liked the music that was used in the background. Music can sometimes make or break a movie. It definitely set the mood perfectly. Very good choice! <br /> <br /> Thank you again. <br /> <br /> Laetitia
