I was recently at a sleepover birthday party with five other girls my age (eleven). All of us, thinking it would be a harmless little movie like Jaws decided to rent it along with the Rat Race. (We watched Rat Race after a strange flame as to alleviate our fear.) We put the movie at 11:00 p.m. and lay together in our sleeping bags hidden behind covers for most of it. I screamed five times, which is unusual for me while I get scared in movies but never scared enough to actually scream. <br /> <br /> We were all terrified of leaving the room, since we were all positive in the Stalker (Jenkins as we call him for some reason) would get us. I played an evil trick; everyone was dozing off as soon as Rat Race was over I hid under my sleeping bag and said softly and humbly "DID YOU CHECK THE CHILD?" They all screamed like nuts and were so scared. All in all, I would rate this movie as 9. The only thing I did not like was that 1. There were lots of false alarms when Jill thinks the Stalker is there and 2. The kids never woke up during the whole thing until Jenkins kidnapped them and hid them in the closet, when all they did was cry like babies. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes thriller. But one thing: I AM NOT BABYSITTING PAST 9:00 PM EVER AGAIN1!
