Alexander Lou, star of classics like 'The Super Ninja' and 'Mafia vs. Ninja' headlines here at this fun martial arts festival. <br /> <br /> The plot involves the evil Abbott White (who boasts of some monstrous and downright scary white eyebrows) resort to the help of a ninja clan in order to overthrow the Shaolin Temple. <br /> <br /> This goal he achieves and further erases most of its members, though needless to say, one or two to survive and predictably continue to exact revenge on the abbot. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the plot is not exactly pushing the limit in terms of creativity, but is anyone watching a movie? movie with a title like 'Wu Tang vs. Ninja' aka 'The Ninja Hunter' really matters a lot for such an inconsequential factor as a plot? Of course not! - It's the fights that matter in these films and the chewing gum - you make your money here! There are some superbly choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute seems to go away without a fight going off for some reason. <br /> <br /> If its at all in martial arts movies, then this is a must see!
