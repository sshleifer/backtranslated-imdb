Let me start by saying that Leo has earned a lot of respect from me after seeing his directorial debut "Everything Is Illuminated." Anyone who has read the book knows how saturated the story is with Alex's absurd and hilarious vocabulary along with countless flashback scenes and crazy sequences of dreams. Leo took it all and made it work. The film itself is great - the soundtrack, the performances, the cinematography - everything works. There is a lot of history missing about the city and its inhabitants, but there is so much you can do with an indie, so this part did not bother me much. It is disappointing that many people do not see this film or even know it exists because of the lack of promotion that accompanies it. I did not even know I was in theaters. I did not know when the DVD came out. You would think that since Frodo Baggins was one of the main characters, SOMEONE would have at least launched a commercial for him. I had to watch the trailer for my DVD "Paradise Now" (released on DVD in spring 2006) to know it had a theatrical release date of "Autumn 2005". Haha - sad indeed. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you come across this criticism in any way because one of your friends has read the book and loved it or seen the movie and is recommending you to see it - take my advice and watch this. It is a very good experience. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
