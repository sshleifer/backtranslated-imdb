This movie gets a bit slow, but gets into comedy equipment quickly. Each of the three "teens" offers their own credible, distinct, assertive, and entertaining personalities. I particularly enjoyed the dialogue and interaction between Keith and Lisa. If one looked beyond the superficial "action" that was taking place, Keith's character treated Lisa's "defloration" with tenderness and consideration. The comic development that followed was also drawn in my opinion. David Boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the grown man who clearly gets into more trouble than he can bear. The dialogue was sharp, fast and flowed well. The director and screenwriter of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters managed to claim high morale after all the antics they did. Although the film appears light on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas of becoming adult, human emotions and desire.
