This is probably the best 2002 film about Romanian cinema. I recommend it to be an intense drama, without lack of action and emotion. The film focuses on teenage life in the suburbs of Bucharest through the main character, not concentrating so much on the form or definition of the character, but more on the anger he and other characters feel. The title "Fury" means anger rather than anger, but could be considered in the film in both senses of the behavior of the actors. The rather strange love story (not a typical romantic, but rather a modern suburban design) is well-shaped in the end. It's a captivating image, and cinematography is very good at capturing the suburban nightlife, making it a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> You will not be bored for a minute, I promise!
