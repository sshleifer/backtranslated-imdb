This is a clever and entertaining movie about the backstage battalion that chose a successor to Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show. However, the film's final thesis that David Letterman's top comedic talents have been neglected because of their controversial nature, and the show diminished by the enthronement of a lower Jay Leno in the main television sitcom is simply false, as anyone who watched both Leno and Letterman can see for themselves. The hard and simple truth is exactly how an NBC executive stated in the movie "Jay Leno is America's Funniest Man." And David Letterman is not. Once you realize this, many of the film's machinations become irrelevant. Ultimately, the whole movie is little more than sour grapes by Letterman fans, who simply can not accept that the best comic was chosen by people whose business it is to know that sort of thing. The final proof is that, despite Letterman's early lead, possibly because of the hype that emerged from the battle for the Tonight Show succession, Leno's show has consistently proven to be the most popular, so in my view, refuting Letterman's claims of being unjustly. robbed of its legitimate heritage.
