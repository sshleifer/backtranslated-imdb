A question arises immediately in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy ones? <br /> <br /> The answer gets less clear as the movie continues. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and while her voice is still loud, she is incredibly effective as the shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective that she almost wanted to make her a little crazy because her created reality was so believable. <br /> <br /> This is the first time Zellweger is invited to take a movie and she is more than equal to the task. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock ?? though as mouth-dirty as usual? is quite subjugated like Wesley. He is able to sublimate his manic energy and only occasionally appears and always when it is most needed. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting allusions: the first time you see Betty is she dressed almost exactly like Dorothy Gale of the Wizard of Oz? then in the movie she is compared to Dorothy when she says she has never been out of Kansas before. At one point the song that Doris Day was best known, "Que Sera Sera" is on the soundtrack and then Charlie (Morgan Freeman) describes it as having a whole Doris Day thing going on. <br /> <br /> This is an extremely quirky movie with good performances from everyone, including the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> It has a surprising ending that, no matter how much the opposite, is actually quite predictable. <br /> <br /> If for no other reason, watch this movie just to hear the owner of the human voice: Morgan Freeman.
