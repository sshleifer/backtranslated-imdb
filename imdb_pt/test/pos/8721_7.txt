In addition to the disco scenes that epitomize the '60s (especially with everyone dancing with instrumental versions of the Monkees' hits), I'm amazed at how well this light farce holds up 37 years later but in fact it happens thanks to the breeze run of his disappointment. based on the plot and the clear interaction of the three leads. Directed by the fearsome Screen Sucker Gene Saks, this 1969 comedy is about Julian Winston, a confirmed and successful single dentist from Manhattan who pretends to be married to avoid a long-term commitment to his one-year-old girlfriend, Toni. In response to Toni's suicide attempt, Julian agrees to marry her, but Toni first insists on finding his wife to relieve her conscience. Enter Julian's dedicated nurse, Stephanie, to play his wife, and the inevitable complications result in white lies that turn into big lies that lead to presumptive couplings and disassociations. <br /> <br /> Like Julian, a laid back Walter Matthau skillfully plays. dentist in his typically sardonic manner, but he lets his two co-stars walk with the photo. Goldie Hawn, 24, still retains her laughing personality but offers an unexpected depth and experience as Toni. She and Matthau have great non-forced chemistry in their scenes together. Screen legend Ingrid Bergman, still serenely real at 54, is obviously having a ball playing Stephanie, initially starched and insightful, but blossoming into a freed spirit as the story evolves. I particularly like how casual she appears after her playtime at night. There is good support work from Rick Lenz as Toni's bohemian neighbor, Igor and Jack Weston, as Julian's friend, Harvey. Billy Wilder's longtime collaborator, I.A.L. Diamond, provides the twinkling script and opens the story beyond its origins chained to Saks, who is not the most cinematic of the directors. In addition to a couple of trailers, there are no significant extras with the DVD.
