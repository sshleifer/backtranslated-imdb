I first heard about the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya from a reviewer on Youtube. He literally slapped the show with a big bad speech, condemning it as trash and confusing. Curious, I decided to attend the show (once I got the order of the episodes, thanks to those who made the lists), and found it absolutely brilliant and enjoyable to watch. Great memorable characters who are full of life and are absolutely amiable and hilarious; a unique and breathless plot that makes sense now that I've watched the show; and two of the best anime moments in history, in my opinion. In addition, the opening and finishing themes are great. <br /> <br /> The anime, based on a successful manga collection, follows a simple storyline once you understand it. While the show is focused on the main character, Haruhi Suzumiya, the point of view is from his friend Kyon. Kyon is a regular high school student who does not believe in supernatural things (eg Santa Claus, aliens, time travelers, ghosts, wives) but ends up talking to Haruhi, who is the strangest girl in school. I'd rather date an alien, considering all worthless men. She even joined all the clubs in the school to find something interesting, but gave up as quickly as she joined. After Kyon's "advice", Haruhi decides to form her own club with Kyon's club. Settling into the literary club room, Haruhi forms the SOS Brigade - his mission to investigate supernatural affairs (think Scooby-Doo minus the dog, the masked man, and the Mysterious Machine). <br /> <br /> Haruhi "recruits" three extra members. The first one is Yuki Nagato, a type of baby who talks very little and spends most of his time reading and sitting. The second is Mikuru Asahina, a shy girl who is forced into the club by Haruhi, who thinks they need a fluffy mascot to do some things. She is often forced to fantasize about Haruhi to promote her cuteness. The third is Itsuki Koizumi, a friendly and sociable student who is always smiling. While Haruhi thinks her group is full of normal people, she could not be more wrong. While Kyon is as normal as you can get, the other three on the other hand are unique - Yuki is an alien, Mikuru is a time traveler of the future, and Itsuki is a esper (a person who has ESP). All three have come to watch over Haruhi, who may have the powers of a god, and if she gets bored she will be able to discover her powers and create a new world, and Kyon is involved in some way. <br /> The show is worth watching with great characters, songs and some hilarious and wonderful moments. However, for parents, there are some sexual references, including the cleavage of Mikuru being exposed or played over and over, and several profanities used as well. Also, the show is one of the great.
