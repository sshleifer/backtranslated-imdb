I saw this movie in a branch of Duane Reed's pharmacy in New York on vacation, and it seemed like a bit of silly fun. And sure enough, the whole premise is ridiculous beyond words - but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable action movie for children, and their parents as well. Ricky Bernard, 10, (Jordan Garrett) has his head in the clouds most of the time, much to the dismay of his father (Larry Miller). As a member of his school orchestra, Ricky and his classmates fly into a concert performance ... and once again Ricky's mind "takes off" and suspects that some criminal plot is taking place. <br /> <br /> Reluctantly helped by best friend Sashi who is a fan of spicy sauce (what a strange plot it was) and others try to solve the mystery. Oh yeah, and Ricky's skills in 1,000 hours of flight simulator experience prove to be helpful when he's called to save the day on the thrilling climax of the movie! It was good to see Eric Roberts and Mark Dacoscos take part in a family movie. And watching the interviews on DVD, everyone seems to have a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I totally liked the Junior Pilot; charming and humorous performances, funny and real plot; a sense of pleasure and sheer nonsense. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a fun family movie, you can do a lot worse than buying this movie.
