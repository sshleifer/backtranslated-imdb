This was Bollywood's response to the Fatal attraction and this is a classic movie by itself. Juhi Chawla was good and so was Sunny Deol, but it was Shah Rukh Khan who gained fame as the stalker. Since then he has become a favorite of the Chopra (Dilwale Dulhaniya le Jayenge, Mohhabatein, Dil for hai pagal, Veer Zaara and Chak De India). Shah Rukh at first seems to be a villain, but in the end you start to sympathize with him. The script was superb and the songs were dealers. My favorites are Too mere samne and Jaadu teri nazar. <br /> <br /> After the failure of the underestimated Lamhe Yash Chopra retaliated with Darr. The dialogues were memorable, the dialogue k..k..Kiran is often repeated. Since Darr Yash Chopra has fallen little. Dil to hai pagal was bad, but he redeemed himself slightly with Veer Zaara, which was much better. This was the last masterpiece of Yash Chopra.
