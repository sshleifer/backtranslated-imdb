I have not seen this movie since it came out in a theater unit, and I've been looking for it ever since. At the time I was 12 years old and the story encouraged me; and NOW, the end eludes me. It was the young love that concerned me most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and it still hangs in my head after 35 years - it feels so good. Get into teenage age and let your fantasies run. If this movie did not arouse your curiosity, you were very old. I look forward to seeing you again (even at my age)! If nostalgia is on your spot, I'm sure this is an interesting movie to watch. It's innocence is simply amazing and it's simplicity is so easy and enjoyable.
