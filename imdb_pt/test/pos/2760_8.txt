Graphically, it's the same game as the first, only different levels and some new features added for fun. <br /> <br /> The PS1 version still has a problem giving skaters enough air for a few tricks. The version of Dreamcast, which is rarely seen, was the best version of the four versions (the Xbox eventually came out with a 5th with 2x), had a clearer resolution and the skaters looked better and more detailed than the PS1 and N64 could support. <br /> <br /> The levels are really amazing, from beginning to end, as in the first, school was my favorite, I liked this level so much, not only the golf cart that sometimes hit you. but by length. That's what I liked in the first two games, they did not make those games improved graphically, they just focused on the length of the levels, which is cool. <br /> <br /> Overall, as good as the first, and worth playing.
