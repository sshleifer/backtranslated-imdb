If you've ever taken over a house you did not know, or if you saw the original and liked it, then this will be a good choice. Ignoring the comments and what was posted here, I went ahead and rented this movie because of the memories of how the original scared me as a teenager. This movie has (of course) changed part of the original story to relate to today's teenagers as the nanny is having trouble going over her cell phone minutes and has to take on a nanny job to pay her bill. However, it sticks to the original plot very well. If you can relate to the nanny, do not know the house and it is usual appears and streak is quite suspense. When the killer is shown, he is very scary and you find yourself yelling at the girl to "LEAVE THE HOUSE". If you have never taken care of a nanny or been in a situation like this, then you probably will not be able to relate and you will not like it. It's all about understanding your fear.
