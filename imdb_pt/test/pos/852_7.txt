I can not criticize this movie. It's literally the first movie I've ever remembered seeing and that leads to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals. Luckily, seeing it again years later, it got reasonably good. Rod Cameron plays a great hunter whose last safari was exterminated by mammoths. Nobody believes him, including his best friend, played by Cesar Romero, whose brother was among the dead. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was filmed in India and has a good scenario. The acting is at a high level. I do not think Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero and Marie Winsor had a bad performance. Mammoths, when they finally arrive, are quite effective. The ending also has an unusual twist, particularly for a 1950s science fiction movie. It's definitely worth seeing.
