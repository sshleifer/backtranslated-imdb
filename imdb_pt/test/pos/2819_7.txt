------ Spoilers ----- Spoilers ----- Spoilers -------- Just a few small ones. I saw this on Satilite channel, missed the first 30 min of movie, will keep this review short and informative. <br /> <br /> The film is basically about 5 characters, the acting is very bad for some characters. A girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people but it goes wrong and the 3 kidnaps the 2. This is one of those types of movies where the writers try to be instigating or philosophical, mysterious and ... you get the point; but do it on your own, guys, you're missing the thought that they're terribly short. As one of the captives who supposedly is some kind of nerd psychologist - it seems the part, but his language can not speak. Writers think that if the nerd uses many eight-letter words in an amateurish way - unknowingly, I believe - the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe. I would like to give an example, but I can not remember any of them - exactly as they were said. The ending was bad too. But a captive woman acted like an old and relatively wise lady, though she, like the rest, had many cliches. <br /> <br /> So, why would I give this movie 7 stars? if I thought of all this? Simple, I give the whole seven stars to LISA KELLER - a sexy a $$ momma. She's fine lol. I am a lover of beauty, and she is just that. But do not confuse me because I'm not a pervert and this movie is not a porn movie at all. Yours is something about her that I can not explain, but I like it. I remember the scene where a prisoner broke free, and when he searches for a way out, he finds Keller. She tries to get it, but she has no chance. He throws her down, kneeling on the stairs and he pulls the pants down without panties;). Now, though she has an incredible ass - and that shot leaves little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds, I guess - it was her facial expression that got me. she wanted to, and that look made me think I was behind it. I would have ripped this serve! After that expression, I could no longer look at her objectively, I was in love. I laughed a lot. I'm glad I saw this movie, but if Lisa Keller was not in the lead role, I would have changed the channel .. well ... after I saw the scene I mentioned above. I'm a fan of LISA KELLER, but it looks like she's not a consistent actor, since this 2003 film is her latest. But I'm looking at another movie with her.
