... but you probably already saw or would not be here. It's so obscure that you probably stumbled over it, as I did, because this little-known jewelry does not get word-of-mouth advertising. From the outset, you know how the plot will unfold, but as our innocent Redhead Nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together it is high quality entertainment. Most horror movies bombard viewers with graphic demonstrations of torture, but Do not Look in the Basement is subtle, which adds to a higher suspense. Note to horror filmmakers: some of us like subtlety! The lovely, homely nurse Charlotte takes a job at a sanitarium, but gets discouraged when she discovers that the chief medical doctor who hired her has had a horrific accident and now she is the subordinate of a mysterious doctor, who we all know is not a doctor . . Suspense is built through the outcome of Charlotte events with the help of many patients, but in which patients can Charlotte trust? This is a gem and is my absolute favorite movie of true horror. I love Re-Animator and Evil Dead, but they play more to the HORROR-COMEDY audience. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (Very docile to the horror standards, but there is a decent pinch of blood throughout the film. The opening scene is classic, no other horror film starts better, and the end has its fair share of blood as well.) Nude: $$$$ (Eager to fall in love Allyson (Betty) Chandler) spends a good deal of time bare, trying to seduce half the men in the sanatorium Betty Chandler is a knockout and I'm shocked that this is his only film credit. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ $$ (The story is well treated, despite the premise of getting a lot of mileage in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The script has a way to build suspense and never fails to put Charlotte in a precarious situation) . <br /> <br /> (Betty Chandler does the best job here as Allyson, capturing dementia with ingenuity in an ethereal way. <br /> <br /> The Judge was splendid too, weighing facts before reaching a verdict while Rosie H Olotik as Charlotte gives a genuine performance as you will feel for your character.
