"Pixote" is the most powerful, shocking and moving film in Brazil. It is about the lives of street children on the streets of SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and revolves around a ten-year-old boy. The camera follows them in a quasi-documentary style: from the juvenile detention center (where most of the staff is as corrupt as the police) and back on the streets, and never turns away from the horrors of the city. Prostitution, drug use / trafficking, corruption and murder are all witnessed by these young people; it is still something that they are painfully accustomed to. Director Hector Babenco used real street kids as actors, adding to the films a brutal reality. Although not for everyone, a movie I recommend. An emotionally devastating film. <br /> <br />
