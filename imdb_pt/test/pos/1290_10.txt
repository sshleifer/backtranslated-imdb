Christopher Nolan's first feature impressed the critics who saw him when it first came out. Filmed on a micro budget of $ 6,000 this is a real class student film. The film is shot in black and white and features people you suppose to be friends of Nolan who appear in the film. This is not to say that they are bad actors, because they are very good. You can see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing on other projects, but unfortunately they have not since they were made 6 years ago. <br /> <br /> Nolan's thriller, as well as Memento, does not play chronologically, changes the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction. The writing is fantastic. It's a great twisting thriller, but as the temporal order of the movie is altered, it becomes even more interesting. I thought the last ten minutes in particular, when it all began to be clear, were excellent. <br /> <br /> For a movie with such a small budget and no recognizable names, this is very good. It is superior to most Hollywood and Nolan studios, after three films (this, the top Memento and not-so-good but still excellent Insomnia) has consolidated as the most exciting new talent of recent times. I can not wait for Batman. <br /> <br /> This movie is short and sweet and certainly a great watch. It's very professional and the twists and turns are fantastic and completely amazing. I also thought that David Julyan's score was also excellent, very atmospheric and had a cool quality to him. He went on to compose other Nolan films. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would recommend this, I plan to get all of Nolan's movies. This is a low budget gem. ***** <br /> <br />
