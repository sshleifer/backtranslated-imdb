A long time ago, they knew how to make a musical and "Cover Girl" is no exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> A story of a dancer in a club that becomes a cover girl and famous. The old saying applies here - that happiness and fame always do not mix. <br /> <br /> The dance routines are wonderfully choreographed. What a dance and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. Otto Kruger is the older gentleman who discovers Hayworth when he sees her photo that shows a strong resemblance to the woman who left him in the hallway. grandmother Maribel. <br /> <br /> A jealous reaction from Kelly takes Rusty (Hayworth) into the arms of Broadway producer Lee Bowman. <br /> <br /> The photo is basically the story repeating itself in the end. To heighten the glory of this film, there is the always wise Eve Arden and the hilarious Phil Silvers, aptly named Genius in the film.
