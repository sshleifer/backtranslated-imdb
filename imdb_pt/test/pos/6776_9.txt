This is by far the best movie I have seen in a long time. It's a totally original and beautiful storyline. It's not boring or dramatic. The characters are tangible and realistic, but do not stray from the plot. Not being in English is probably the finishing touch. The ending leaves you satisfied in a way that I have never experienced in a movie before. <br /> <br /> I wish I had found this movie sooner. <br /> <br /> More lines. <br /> <br /> More lines. <br /> <br /> More lines to many more lines let's go, I'm done
