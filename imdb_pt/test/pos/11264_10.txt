Wow, I do not watch it thinking it's going to be a relaxing circus night! It will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way. Circus has never been more colorful, more exciting and more dazzling! The whole concept is truly incredible. You are taken to the world of Cirque Du Soleil and get a thousand thoughts when you leave. There is only one thing to do: get the CD and / or DVD and live again and again and again. Be addicted! Worth it! Must be next to the most beautiful thing in the world and one of the best Cirque du Soleil shows.
