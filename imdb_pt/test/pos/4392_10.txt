I thought this movie was great! I saw it when it came out in theaters, so I do not remember all the details. I remember being based on Homer's tale about Odysseus. Places and names events are changed, but you can still see the resemblance to the tale. <br /> <br /> I found it funny how they got into trouble and how they could get rid of it. I really enjoyed this version of old fashioned short stories much better than Romeo and Juliet with Clair Danes. <br /> <br /> I agree that in some parts of the tale it gets a bit silly at times, but all in all it's a great adventure with some big name actors.
