"Pearl Harbor, my friend." This movie is brilliant! Of course it does not flow exactly like a multi-million dollar comedy, but the jokes that are constantly thrown are unbelievable. I'm one that goes to the nonsense, much like "Dumb and Dumber", "Airplane" and "Wet Hot American Summer" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies are no longer written with this kind of sporadic comedy. Many jokes are such a great surprise to the viewer that it is truly amazing that most do not know and praise this comedy masterpiece! By watching this, you'll easily find more than 20 quotations that you'll find yourself quoting post-wards ... and after seeing it again, you'll find even more!
