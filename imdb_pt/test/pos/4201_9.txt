Who plays J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently did not receive any credits. Too bad. <br /> <br /> All Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 issue. It's strange to see them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents (I think it should be Bowery). They even show some swimming skills. <br /> <br /> I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer in this boxing / love / crime story. My favorite is now in the fight scene near the end of the movie. Busby Berkeley shows his experience in dance films when John Garfield changes position and, as we observe this movement, the camera moves to his face. I will not reveal why or when, but the look on his face at that point probably led the 1939 audience to stand in theaters. <br /> <br /> Some will think that John Garfield looks a lot like Frank Sinatra in many scenes. Just his face. In fact, Frank was still not making movies, so Frank might look like John. The boxer named Smith in the movie looks like a clone of Ed Begley, Jr. <br /> <br /> Now I must tell you something that is not a spoiler, but if you watch the movie, watch Grandma's hands. May Robson does her part well. She seems to have wandering hands a little. In a scene where she and a crowd enter the boxer's dressing room (John Garfield), notice where she plays the reclining John Garfield while he is wearing only his swim trunks. <br /> <br /> A great ending. Many wonderful characters. The best line may be at the gas station, "... eight gallons, that's a twenty-eight dollar ..." Tom Willett
