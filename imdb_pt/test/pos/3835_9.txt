When the Romulans come, they will not be giving gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As anyone familiar with this episode knows, it's a redux of the war movie "The Enemy Below" of the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a warship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer and a German submarine) involved in lethal war games, they are two spaceships in outer space. In the history of Trek, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, the Earth fought against the Romulan wars. After about five years of conflict, an impasse brought a treaty and the establishment of the Neutral Zone, a boundary between us and the Romulan Empire. Now, in this stardate, the treaty seems to be broken, as our outposts are being attacked and destroyed by some weapon of immense power. Yes, the Romulans are back, testing their new war toy, and Kirk must now earn his salary: he must make decisions that would affect this sector of the galaxy, how to figure out how to avoid one ... oh, I do not know - a war interstellar, maybe? <br /> <br /> I think what makes this episode so effective is that it does not shy away from the dark aspects of war, as you would expect from a mere 60's TV episode - especially an episode of a science show fiction. It's all very tense and exciting, like the best war films, like when Kirk sits with his key officers for what amounts to a war council. Writers and actors are not kidding around here: all this is preparation for a horrible conflict, potentially the beginning of another battlefield for years. Ultimately, Kirk's goal is to keep this battlefield just for the two ships - but it's still an effort full of dangers and likely casualties. In fact, I believe this episode holds the record of ship casualties to the end. At the very beginning of the episode, we see the devastation that this battle can produce, at that supposedly well protected outpost. So start the war games between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship - it's as exciting as any conflict we've seen on the big screen. Of course, if you're not in war movies, you'd have to look for other things to admire in this episode. <br /> <br /> What further elevates this episode is the revelation of exactly what and who Romulans are - is a type of electric shock. Now we have even more conflicts between crew on the Enterprise bridge - war tends to bring the worst on some people. Due to still unpleasant attitudes about race in this future, the tension is heightened further - Kirk has his hands full on this. I suppose the only weakness in history is the convenience of the reluctance of the question of fanaticism to conclusion. On the Romulan side, the actor Lenard makes his first appearance in the Trek universe as the Romulan commander; he's fantastic on paper, the other side of Captain Kirk or Captain Pike, make your choice, made to look like Spock more than a little. Surprisingly, your character is not hungry for war as you would expect, another eye-opener for this episode. The actor would return to this universe as Sarek, Spock's father, so he is nothing but versatile. He is also counting on how the first appearance of characters like the Romulans is usually their best chance, as it is here. They appeared in "The Enterprise Incident" next.
