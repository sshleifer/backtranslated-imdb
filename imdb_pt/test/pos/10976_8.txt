Manna From Heaven is a lightweight comedy that uses the exaggeration of human weaknesses to entertain audiences. Throughout the film, there is the expectation that kindness will arise in every situation. The result is that the moviegoer sits with that silly grin on his face, the peace in his heart and the high expectations for the human species. Watching this movie was a very enjoyable experience. (I would venture to say uplifting experience, but some would say it sounds tacky !!)
