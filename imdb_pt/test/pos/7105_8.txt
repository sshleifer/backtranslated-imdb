The last of the sequences, not to mention Abbott and Costello, finds Frankenstein, who was more or less a fake. At that point, Dracula (John Carridine) is the center of attention, seeking a cure for his vampirism from a gentle doctor (Onslow Stevens). Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr) also appears seeking a cure. The good doctor manages to cure Larry's werewolf, but Dracula deceives the doctor and ends up contaminating his blood and makes the good doctor a mad lunatic. And all this time great Franky (strange Glenn) lies at a table waiting for his correction of electricity so that it can cause some damage. This was a kind of short film, about 70 minutes and some changes, but the action is there, and the great actors are there too.Lionel When he appears as police inspector, here are some curiosities, Lionel will appear in Frankenstein, Frankenstein, Frankenstein, the werewolf and Frankenstein's house. and then this one. If there was another in the series, they may have added the creature from the black pond to the line up, I'm giving Dracula's house 8 out of 10.
