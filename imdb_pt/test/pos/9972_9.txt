The problem inherent in any staging of The Merchant of Venice was never pseudo-controversial anti-Semitism, but the fact that there are two totally different story lines in tone and content; a sparkling romantic comedy and a devastating tragedy. Although the blend of genres was all the rage in the sixteenth century (and ridiculed by Shakespeare in Hamlet), it rarely fails to irritate modern audiences. As a result, most directors are forced to place an emphasis on one plot rather than the other, and it is not surprising that the decision falls to Shylock's favor. <br /> <br /> Like many of Shakespeare's, great tragic heroes, Shylock continues to fascinate after 400 years because he is such a difficult and complex character. Lamentable, proud, angry, vengeful, weak, arrogant; its behavior simply challenges the analysis and continues to be discussed. He has no faults because he is Jewish, but because he is human. Rarely do modern writers imbue their creations with richly textured contradictions, and it is to the benefit of all that we have Shakespeare to inspire. <br /> <br /> Shakespearean language is wild and unmeasured, saturated in multiple meanings, word. play and metaphor. To be understood, it must be discussed and mastered by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do so. When an actor fails, the words flow in a flood of incomprehensible words, but when he does, the English comes alive with a speed and vitality that takes his breath away. Al Pacino is one of these actors, and here he displays an incredible level of clarity and control that if there were any justice, would sweep away all the prizes of the offer. He faces the challenge of presenting Shylock from the front and offers an extraordinarily subtle and differentiated performance. It would be a crime if we never had the opportunity to see what he does with King Lear. <br /> <br /> The support cast is noteworthy. Jeremy Irons gives an original insight into the familiar Antonio, featuring an older, quieter figure that exhibits the unpleasant contradictions between medieval chivalry and the ugly prejudice of the day. Joseph Fiennes is a revelation when he matures beyond the shallow eye to actually inhabit a character for once. Lynn Collins is the only disappointment. Many of Shakespeare's women are subscribed and demand that an actor really work hard to bring them to life, and Collins's imitation Gwyneth Paltrow seems a little flat and inadequate to the darkest tone Radford wants. <br /> <br /> The design team must be recognized for creating a unique and totally credible view of the late Renaissance Venice. The city has not looked so sinister since 'Do not Look Now'. Making the most of existing venues and natural light, the film has a look of authenticity that is greatly enhanced by the dark and worn out wardrobe design. Everyone, again, deserves award recognition. <br /> <br /> Film lenders like this should be commended. With a budget of $ 30 million, they must enter into such a venture with full and certain knowledge that they will never make a profit, and still invest anyway. We can all be grateful for this, as the result is a remarkable adaptation that will certainly be a benchmark for many years.
