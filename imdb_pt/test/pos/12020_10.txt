I think it just sums up this movie. Watch and you'll find out why. The acting of the main character John Keem is very, very bad and he does not have any charisma on the screen. It's very funny because of that thought, as well as the ending in which Keem beheaded the bad guy despite the fact that he was disarmed and surrendered. Bright!
