This is my all time favorite drawing of Looney Tunes. It's a common thread: Daffy Duck tries to convince Elmer Fudd that it's really a rabbit season and shoot Bugs. But you can never be smarter than this rabbit! In addition to the usual cartoon comedy, this cartoon is backed up by an excellent word game that will keep you rolling on the floor.
