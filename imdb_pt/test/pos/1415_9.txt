Stephen Hawking has one of the greatest minds, or if this is too simplistic to coin him one of the most curious and daring, he also happens to be trapped in a body crippled by a disease that leaves him in a wheelchair and a computer to communicate . Maybe I did not know enough about Hawking (I always knew him as 'that guy talking like a computer who knows a lot about the universe and stuff like that, you know') that he's British, that he was a bit of a normal boy, perhaps the most remarkable, illness that could have left him dead at age 21 put him in the position of putting his life in focus. <br /> <br /> According to the equally curious and coldly, visually of Errol Morris. A dazzling portrait in A Brief History of Time, Hawking was already brilliant in outbreaks (when other Oxford students were faced with challenging algebraic misunderstandings, he responded more than three times the amount in an hour), but when confronted with challenges, other theories of other scientists, he has recovered with his own. Below some of the complex scientific conversations - and if you have less than an astronomy, like me, you need to keep your ears especially enthusiastic in explaining the possible infinity of time or the peculiarities of the black hole - there is a human who just wants to enjoy his goose on his birthday. <br /> <br /> Morris captures Hawking exactly for those who do not tire of their theories about how particles can get in and out of a black hole, or whether there is even a creator or not, depending on how much is taken into account Einstein and time. But he also captures the man's story and his condition, which creates it as something far more interesting than if Morris had done one or the other. A lot of talk about the cosmos would make your head ache, and a lot about your personal life and one may wonder what all the fuss is about that guy who's the title book of the movie was on bestseller lists for more than five years . Almost despite its appearance, Hawking defines what it is to be a conscious entity in a universe which, he notes, it will not be separate from if and when the universe extends for another 10 billion years to from now on. Through all of this, in A Brief History of Time, we have a glimpse of a genius and his humility (not to mention the ten cents of his colleagues and family here and there) through a mathematical and hypothetical thought process of the universe.
