First, I rated this movie 10/10. For me, it's simply one of the best I've seen since I was born (I'm 23, but I've seen countless movies). The story is cruel, but reality is not? It went deep inside me and it moved my guts. I've seen him about 5 or 6 years ago and he still shakes me - and I still remember that! <br /> <br /> Second, there is no 'national preference' for this film. I mean, it's not because it's a French movie that I put so loud: it really caught me when I saw it. Also, I do not know Marcel Carne's filmography, so I do not know if it's his best movie or not, but I know he's not his most famous: Hotel du Nord, Quai des Brumes and Les Enfants du Paradis are the most famous . <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film is in B & W, but deals with intertemporal problems of youth (not acne) like love, friends and studies in a modern way. It could even be remade frame by frame with real young actors, a Dolby sound (tm) and special effects (a car accident), would still be a great movie! <br /> <br /> Problem: Maybe it's a movie to be seen by young adults (16 to 25 years) - and above, of course - so that your message is well understood ... I said it was a great movie?
