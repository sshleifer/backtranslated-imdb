Yes, 1939 version / Robert Donat-Greer Garson was the best ... Perfection.Donat won the Oscar in a very difficult year .. Gable in GWTW & James Stewart as Mr. Smith. were 2 of its competitors. .which was a difficult year. Most critics in NY hated this version. so.didnt see in the theater! I finally saw this AM on TCM & enjoyed it.Peter O'Toole was excellent and delighted to have been nominated for an Oscar for it, and esp pleased Oscar finally gave him a special award last year ... Petula Clark was good as Mrs. Chips, but her character, I feel it was poorly written ... Some good songs esp. You and I ... sung by Ms.Clark and later recorded by many others including T.Bennett / S. Bassey & Carmen MacRae .... ob & w version was more authentic .. but this is a beautiful movie beautifully photographed in color & panavision ... nice worth seeing & Bravo, once again, Mr. O'Toole!
