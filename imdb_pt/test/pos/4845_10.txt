Without a doubt, cinema is a powerful medium, even more so than ever, because of the accessibility of the DVD / video, which gives the filmmaker the additional assurance that his story or message will be seen by possibly millions of people. The use of this medium, therefore, attributes an innate responsibility to the artist, insofar as the cinema can be educational as well as entertaining, which determines that certain subjects must be approached accordingly and with a corresponding sensitivity and sensitivity. A film like "The List of Schindler" by Spielberg, for example, is important because it keeps alive the memory of what should not be forgotten and, as history tends to repeat itself, Spielberg's film can be seen as a tool valuable to avoid recurrence of this tragedy. In this sense, this film, Focus, directed by Neal Slavin, is important because it illuminates the problematic reality of anti-Semitism, which for years beyond the number affected millions of people, is still unimaginably prevalent today, and like any manifestation of fanaticism will be perpetuated if it is not checked or ignored. Born of a xenophobic strain, it is a society that infects the disease and which, unshakable, can be terminal; and with its pervasive view of the condition, this film is an effective vaccine that can only, at the very least, help curb the proliferation of it, and hopefully act as a step to completely eradicate it. Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) served his country in the Great War and has since lived a quiet and conventional life in New York. He has had the same job as a staff director for about twenty years and owns the house, located in a middle-class neighborhood in which he lives with his mother (Kay Hawtrey). Lawrence is the kind of guy who gets on very well taking care of his own business and refusing to get involved with matters that are not (he feels) his concern. <br /> <br /> All this is about to change, however. Just as at the advent of World War II, Lawrence, along with the market owner on the corner, Mr. Finkelstein (David Paymer) inexplicably considered himself a target of the neighborhood's xenophobes, who aligned themselves with the "Union Crusaders" . a national organization now in charge of channeling its fears and hatreds against the Jews, or anyone who "looks" a Jew. And suddenly, Lawrence finds that he can no longer stand aside and watch the game being played; because now he's the game, whether he wants to or not. Working on a clever and well-written script by Kendrew Lascelles, which he adapted from Arthur Miller's novel, Slavin presents a chilling scenario that incisively examines the effects of fanaticism on those against which it is leveled; and when one considers the fact that this is not merely a hypothetical situation but a description of reality, it becomes even more disquieting, even unnerving. And what makes the film so effective is Slavin's obvious understanding of his subject, and his studied presentation, which is intriguing in its subtlety. In the opening scene, Slavin establishes Lawrence's "character," and very much then reaffirms it in another scene, which gives the audience the opportunity to observe and assimilate how Lawrence's mind really works; the thought processes that direct your life. With that in place, then, Slavin is able to take his audience along with Lawrence as his problems gradually begin to unfold. In doing so, it effectively illustrates how the problem evolves, rather than simply stating the problem and approaching it head-on, which increases the emotional involvement of viewers and ultimately increases the impact of the film. Slavin makes an important statement with this film, which is not only an accusation of fanaticism but also carries a warning message about apathy. And to his credit, he never beats in his head with it or engages in pointing his finger subjectively to make his case; instead, he proceeds with care, striving to be as objective as possible with all that he is submitting to his consideration. His approach is that of a cinematographer; and is an approach that serves Slavin very well - and his film. <br /> <br /> Like Lawrence, William H. Macy - one of the best character actors in the business - gives an incredible performance, establishes the credibility and credibility of his character with a sensitive, honest and introspective portrait. He never tries to circumvent Lawrence's personal failures of nature, but rather uses them to create a character who is decidedly three-dimensional, which not only makes him convincing, but serves to reassert the portrait's integrity. What makes him so attractive is Macy's ability to convey the process by which he examines his own consciousness, which allows the viewer to successfully share the experience of his personal epiphany. Ultimately, it's the strength of Macy's performance, more than anything else, that makes this film so significantly distinctive. Another strong point of the film is Laura Dern's performance as Gertrude Hart, a portrait that effectively complements Macy's work as well as Slavin's. Dern lends a huge substance to his character, capturing her physically and emotionally, and his colorful zeal creates an impressive contrast to Lawrence's reserve that works great for both his character and the film itself. <br /> <br /> And just as Sean Combs recently (in 'Monster's Ball') made a good argument against belittling the established rock star's acting efforts, Meat Loaf Aday gives a powerful performance here, as Fred , Lawrence's next- door neighbor. It also shows that a true artist will produce regardless of the type of canvas he is given to work with. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Michael Copeman (Carlson), Kenneth Welsh (Father Crighton), Joseph Ziegler (Gargan) and Arlene Meadows (Mrs. Dewitt). The kind of film that makes a filmmaker proud of his craft, "Focus," offers a memorable experience that, I hope, will prove enlightening, too, to those who do not know that such conditions existed, and still do - even in that, the land of the free. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
