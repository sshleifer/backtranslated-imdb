.. especially by Lambert. This is the essential Burrough Tarzan that I grew up reading when I was a child. I read some negative comments about this movie and could not help but wonder what their problem was. They obviously did not see the movie I did or they were expecting something that was more like the Saturday afternoon shows. <br /> <br /> This was Tarzan who was from the novel and filmmakers should be applauded for addressing the source material and taking it seriously. Lambert was excellent. I still think he's one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. This was a movie in which it shines. <br /> <br /> The photograph and the monkeys, made by Rick Baker, were incredible. You definitely felt from the jungle. In the second half, Tarzan's attempt to be civilized actually puts him in the emotional conflict he was forced to solve. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
