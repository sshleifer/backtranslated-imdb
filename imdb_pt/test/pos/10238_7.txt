What's fun about Barker's Nightbreed is that it's the story of a human being in a frenzy, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere. In this, the monsters (the nightly title race) are the "good" guys. He shares his sense of celebrating the different, the distorted and the dark with the first Addams Family film and much of Tim Burton's work. He also has the stiffness expected of a Barker piece. <br /> <br /> Particularly entertaining is Cronenberg's performance as the true human evil physician who is intent on destroying Nightbreed. As in most classic monster movies, villagers surround the monsters' castle with torches and forks. But this time, the modern scenario replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic "weapons" with weapons and bombs. And this time the sympathy you felt when you saw the Frankenstein monster burned in the windmill is the center of the film. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, and even Barker made it more interesting, and certainly more chilling, work. But it's fun, looks great, and stays light without mocking yourself. Worth a look!
