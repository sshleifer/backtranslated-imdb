A man is unjustly accused of killing his friend in a fire of an aircraft, and must travel across the country to avoid the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation in question. A plot that was later used to power the classic North by Northwest of Hitchcock, Saboteur benefits from some very good performances as well as some masterful thriller sequences from Master himself. <br /> <br /> For any Hitchcock fan, the plot is a bit too familiar, but he has always been able to infuse the story with his own memorable characters and charades. Here, charming and charming Robert Cummings is the leader and soon finds himself visiting many strange and quirky characters, nevertheless a troupe of circus performers, a wealthy businessman with hidden motives and a lonely blind who shows him the best way to judge someone. <br /> <br /> In terms of pure originality and quality, this is lacking in some areas, particularly the motive of the antagonists. However, there is good chemistry between Cummings and his protagonist, the much-loved Priscilla Lane, as well as a truly moving performance as the blind of Vaughn Glaser. The best part is the final sequence, which perfectly mirrors what Hitchcock would later use in the North by Northwest, but this time the climax is at the top of a statue in New York. Certainly not your best, but the Master of Suspense gives us some great moments to wait.
