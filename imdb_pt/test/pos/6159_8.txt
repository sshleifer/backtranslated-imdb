Involving the entrance of Europe on the Czech fighter pilots flying to the RAF during WW2. It is always interesting how American see a new point of view on familiar events in history. There is nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style in which it is filmed or the romantic love triangle that anchors the narrative. Still, it's convincing all the time. There is a good balance between drama, romance, humor, action and symbolism that is softened by the director and the cast. This is a breath of fresh air after going through exaggerated and boring Hollywood epics like "Pearl Harbor." Solid production on all sides. This is definitely worth it if you are a fan of foreign cinema.
