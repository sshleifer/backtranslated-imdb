Although not the most technically advanced film I have ever seen, it was a fun and enjoyable couple of hours. The main characters are sweet and you really start to like them, and you feel something when Susie Q. has to go, but feel good again when she returns as Maggie. <br /> <br /> Much action dialogue, and an artificial plot, but above all, a lot of fun.
