Once again, seeing this kind of film turns me increasingly into English humor, not much seen on screen since the times of Monty Python and Man About The House. Too bad. <br /> <br /> Brenda Blethyn (whom I first saw in Saving Grace earlier this year, another must see by the way.) It just stands out, as Alfred Molina does. The rest of the cast, although virtually unknown to me, also do great performances. The movie starts slowly and gradually gains pace and fun - in the middle of the way I had tears in my eyes when I laughed. <br /> <br /> In all, a funny English movie, a thousand times better than the supposedly 'funny' trash. which comes from Hollywood. <br /> <br />
