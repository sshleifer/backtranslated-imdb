This movie is absolutely amazing. From the performances of Huppert, Girardot and Magimel to Haneke's screenplay and direction, there is not a single misstep. The movie may alienate some people with their difficult and slower sexual content, but it's really a masterpiece of art ... so do not let the challenging forms push you away! <br /> <br /> Powerful and deserving of all the prizes won at Cannes!
