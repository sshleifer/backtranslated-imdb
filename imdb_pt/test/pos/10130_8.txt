'Radio' is a beautiful film based on a true story of the mentally challenged James Robert Kennedy, dubbed 'Radio', and T.L. Hanna High School, Harold Jones. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding, Jr. is excellent as Radio! I would never imagine watching him on a serious performance, especially since most of the movies I watch with him are comedies. Ed Harris is great as Harold Jones, but this actor is great, so this is nothing new. <br /> <br /> The young man with mental problems named James Robert Kennedy, always walks around T.L. Hanna High School, without bothering anyone and hardly noticed. One day, when the soccer ball is thrown near him, he decides to stay with the ball, through the impatience of Johnny Cash, one of the best players on the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you have ever known. One day, Cash decides to punish James, mock him with other football players and even get to the point of tying him. <br /> <br /> When Coach Jones discovers that horrible act, he gets angry and punishes the whole team. , deciding on this day to help James, who gets nicknamed 'Radio' because of his passion for radios in general. <br /> <br /> The film shows how Radio becomes an adept assistant, helping the team to train despite the difficulties. of the players, and even receiving the respect of basically all the people living in the small town. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a real and beautiful story. He has a life lesson, especially showing us how a person can make a difference, even if we are not what we call "normal." Radio has a big heart and it is incapable of hating anyone, and that is something that we should all apply in our daily lives.
