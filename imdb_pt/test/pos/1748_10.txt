Usually I'm a typical creepy-crawly-hatin girl, but after watching that movie (on YouTube of course), I'm having different perspectives. And I also did not know that my favorite animation studio - Fleischer made another film about the insect community whose home in the city garden is threatened by humans (cigars and cigarettes lit, steps etc.), and how a young grasshopper named Hoppity saves the day and conquer the heart of Mel the bee; I love the lovely Ms. Mel. You know, after watching the movie, the bugs reminded me of some of the "unstable insects" of Don Bulth's Thumbelina. And outside the songs of the film, I love "We are a couple in the castle"; When I sing this song, it almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> This wonderful film was the second (and last) feature to leave the studio Fleischer. The film would originally be released in November 1941, but since Fleischer's rival Disney launched Dumbo weeks earlier, Paramount changed the date to December of the same year, but Mr. Bug unfortunately went into a trap, so no fulfilled. of terrible timing. Having the misfortune to open two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mr. Bug was a financial disaster and led to the dismissal of Max and Dave Fleischer, from the studio they had established in 1919, and reorganized the company as Famous Studios. Another important factor in his departure was the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer were no longer talking to each other due to disputes (as was sad). Overall I love the two films of the Fleischer brothers. Gulliver and Mr. Bug.
