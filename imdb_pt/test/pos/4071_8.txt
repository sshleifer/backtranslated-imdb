If you saw the trailer for this movie, you know very well what to expect, because what you see here is what you get. And even if you have not seen the previews, it will not be long before you get what you're looking for - specifically, a good time and lots of laughs-- from this clever satire of 'Reality TV' shows and 'Buddy Cop' movies, 'Showtime', directed by Tom Dey, starring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston (De Niro) is a detective with the LAPD, and he is good at what he does; but working a case one night, things suddenly go south when another police officer, Trey Sellars (Murphy) inadvertently intervenes, a television news crew appears and Mitch loses his temper, resulting in a lawsuit by the station television that will cost the department some big bucks. Except that they may be able to get around this, thanks to Chase Renzi (Rene Russo), who works for the station and likes what she sees in Mitch - enough to get her boss idea for a "Reality" would present none other than Mitch Preston, whom Chase sees as a real life "Dirty Harry." <br /> <br /> Her boss likes the idea and gives Chase a green light. Now all she has to do is convince Mitch to participate, which should not be too difficult, as the season has agreed to give up the action if he does the show. But Mitch is a cop, not an actor, and he does not want anything to do with it - until he has a heart to heart with his boss, Captain Winship (Frankie Faison), who puts Mitch's future into succinct. perspective for him. And so the show is on. Oh yes, there is one more thing; for the show, Mitch will need a partner. And who do you think they will invent for it? Let's put it this way: Trey Sellars is more than one of the usual suspects. <br /> <br /> This is Dey's second film as director, his first being 'Shanghai Noon', also a comedy, and he is definitely showing a downfall for the genre. From the opening frames, he sets a rhythm that keeps the story going, and he lets his stars make the most of their personal talents and strengths, including their impeccable timing. With stars like De Niro and Murphy, Dey, of course, had an advantage in this project to begin with, but it is he who keeps the trail, demonstrating that he knows what works, getting the right combination of physical comedy and action, and employing the subtleties dialogue with great effect. <br /> <br /> There is not a more natural actor in the business than De Niro, and he steps into Mitch's skin like he was born for it. And after years of hard-hitting drama (in which he has turned into a remarkable performance after another), with films like "Analyze This," "Meet the Parents" and now this, he has firmly established his proficiency for doing comedy as well . Mitch is not a particularly complex character; it is, in fact, a kind of "common," but therein lies the challenge for the actor - to make it believable, to make him look like the guy who could be his neighbor and just another member of the community. And in every way, De Niro succeeds. He's Mitch, the guy you meet at the grocery store or the bank, or he says "good morning" on the way to work; who likes to watch the game on TV and has a life, just like you and me, who happen to make a living as a cop. It's the character Mitch has to be to make this movie work, because it makes the angle 'common guy in extraordinary circumstances' credible. It is one of those roles - and work - that is often erroneously discarded, because it seems so easy; and of course, that's what makes De Niro so exceptional - it makes it look easy, and it does it with ease. <br /> <br /> Like Trey Sellars, Eddie Murphy transforms into a winning performance, as well, and it's a role that fits him like proverbial glove. Trey is a cop but also an aspiring actor - and a bad one - and gives Murphy the opportunity to play on the more lush side of his personality (he reigned enough in Dey, however, to keep him from climbing - the-top in Jim Carrey territory) that works perfectly for this character and this movie. From his melodramatic interpretation during an audition to the fact that he has thrown off a line - delivered looking directly at the camera (which, as far as he is concerned, is not there) while filming the "reality" show - Murphy it's a riot. And he has a chemistry with De Niro that really clicks (which is not unexpected as this is another of De Niro's many talents; his ability to connect and bring out the best of his co-stars, all of them) support- - are best at their craft after having worked with him, including the likes of Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Ed Harris, just to name a few). More importantly, this is a part that allows Murphy to excel at what he does best, and he certainly makes the most of it. <br /> <br /> Russian makes the best of his role as Chase, too, a character who is not very artistically stretched, but who she presents deliciously, with a strong and convincing performance. And William Shatner (playing himself) absolutely steals some scenes as director of the show. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Drena De Niro (Annie), Pedro Damian (Vargas) and James Roday (Camera Man). ). Well crafted and delivered, 'Showtime' is a comedy that is exactly what it should be: pure entertainment that provides lots of laughs and a couple of enjoyable hours that will make you laugh for some time afterwards. It's the magic of cinema. 8/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
