"The Couch Trip" by Michael Ritchie, is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. It is so subtle and perverse that you begin to realize that it really is a painful satire. It is also the best film of Dan Akyroyd, made in a year of great success (1988) for him. First, "The Great Outdoors" and now this. <br /> <br /> Akyroyd stars as John Burns, a career criminal who pretends insanity to escape from prison. Now, an idiotic comedy would be just about it. But "The Couch Trip" uses it as a stepping stone to everything else. Beverly Hills psychiatrist George Maitlin (Charles Grodin, subtly hilarious here) has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is selected: Lawrence Baird, who is Akyroyd's psychiatrist! You can guess what's going to happen, but the best of "The Couch Trip" is not what happens, but how it's done. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" gives Dan Akyroyd the best role he has ever had. His John Burns is one of the truly original comic creations of cinema history. Evil linens and physical humor are part of that, but what makes it special is that Akyroyd makes Burns a lovely character. We cheered for him and grew to really like him during the 98-minute race. <br /> <br /> But Akyroyd is not alone here. He gets strong support from other great comic actors. Walter Matthau joins hilarity as a minister of the crooked artist who picks up the Burns secret and commits gentle blackmail. Charles Grodin "slow burns" his way to another great comedic role as the burnt psychiatrist. Grodin has been one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. It's criminal they have not used it more often. Richard Romanus interprets Grodin's lawyer perfectly. "The Couch Trip" is one of the many films made by the now-defunct Orion Pictures Corporation that are currently unseen. MGM has spent a fortune buying the Orion library, but has yet to cash in on its acquisition. "The Couch Trip" joins "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out" and countless other people collecting dust in the tank. Shame on the MGM for their inaction. I hope that with the new administration, "The Couch Trip" will find the audience and the respect it deserves. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
