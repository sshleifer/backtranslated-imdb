I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver. The screen had three rows in front of me and about 12 "x 10". So I really was not going to watch. But I like Malcolm in the middle so I thought I'd watch for a few minutes. The next thing I know is that I'm getting sucked in, having a lot of fun, and I was happy with how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by. I agree that acting is very good for this level of entertainment. Being one of the older baby boomers, I was also happy to see Lee Majors with a role in the film, as did some other actors who were famous (Jamiel?) "Yesterday", but are out of the limelight today making fun of <br /> It's your basic "child is harmed, child gets really (and then some), and everyone has fun in the process." No heavy thought, no great analysis needed. Just a good fun way to pass the time. <br /> <br /> 3.5 out of 5.
