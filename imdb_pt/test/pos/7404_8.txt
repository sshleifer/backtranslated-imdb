Sometimes good things happen by accident. <br /> <br /> I've never heard of "Silverwing" by the end of 2005 - I was pitching channels and by chance I saw something in Toon Disney with bats in a sawmill being attacked by owls. I had no idea what it was, but I was motivated to stay connected - it was hard to wait for a commercial so I could figure out what it was called. Part of what intrigued me was the appearance of bats - first, they did not use the popular convention of giving the bats "extra fingers" where their thumb claws should be. On the contrary, they have palms like human hands, but the fingers are longer and have webs of skin between them. <br /> <br /> Also the faces - they look like humans (actually, at one point I wondered if they were humans, but were turned into bats). I usually do not like this in cartoon animals, but it worked here - the story is a human story, even if it's about bats and other animals (not unlike the Lion King). <br /> <br /> What I saw on TV were the last two parts of the "trilogy." I had missed the beginning of the first, "Towers of Fire" (the second overall), but for the most part I saw them all. However, I found myself wanting to understand what was happening, since the first part had not been and I would not have caught it anyway. <br /> <br /> But I saw it was based on a book by Kenneth Oppel. How happy that I paid attention and wrote - I was very disappointed when I knew that the series IS NOT AVAILABLE! That is not why it recently made sense that it was not yet available. <br /> <br /> However, I found not only the Silverwing book but also the two Sunwing and Firewing sequences. When I read the first book, I kept asking myself, "Is that it?" Not only because so much of what is in the series is not in this book, but even though I have not seen the animated version, Silverwing's book (otherwise a good story) does not end as much as it stops. Only one loose end is tied - Shade and Marina find the Silverwing colony in Hibernaculum. <br /> <br /> In fact, Silverwing and Sunwing should have (in my opinion) been published in a single volume because they make for a complete story together but not separately. <br /> <br /> In fact, the animated version takes some elements of Sunwing (eg, Orestes, lifting the ban on seeing the sun) and some were completely original. It's not perfect, but it's definitely very nice. I like the two versions of the Silverwing saga. <br /> <br /> That's why I'm glad it will finally be available in June. Spent a lot of time and it's worth the wait.
