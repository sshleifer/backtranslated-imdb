Why the end of the movie could not have been the men of Sean Connery fighting the French instead of the Germans? Since the French occupied Algeria in 1830, the tribes of Morocco and Algeria were making inroads into the French military and civilian settlements. This film could have been a continuation of this historical aspect in which the French had taken the Rasuadli so that their followers did not invade to Algeria, and then its followers would have attacked the French to free it. <br /> <br /> The film is still stereotyped of shootings between the Germans and the Americans. When Americans shoot at the Germans, their weapons (even the pistols) emit loud noises, they create large wounds of bloody bullets and their enemies are screaming after being shot. When the Germans shoot the Americans, their weapons do not emit great sounds, they do not create bloody wounds and their enemies emit little or no sound after being hit. <br /> <br /> In real life, the American Krag rifle was the worst rifle that America produced until the initial version of the M-16. The Krag was difficult to maintain, unreliable, and the rifle was always stuck. The German Mauser was one of the best rifles in the world. We were so impressed with this during the Spanish-American War that we made a copy of it and called it a Springfield rifle. <br /> <br /> Finally, the people of Morocco must have a word for artillery since the French were using them in their raids against Morocco. I did not like it when they made the Rasuldai feel stupid because there were no words for artillery in the Moorish vocabulary. Instead, Rasuadli stated that the Europeans had guns on the wheels that make the ground tremble.
