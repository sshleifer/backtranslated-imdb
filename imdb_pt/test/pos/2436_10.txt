I almost missed it. When visiting friends in Philadelphia sometime in the early '80s, I was surfing on the canal after everyone else had gone to bed. It was not just Bogart that he was obsessed; but instead the whole era of those old movies I knew so well my age. Add to that a similar plot to The Maltese Falcon - where so many different characters were interacting with Sacchi - and you have a work of art as far as I'm concerned. About ten years later it appeared on TV and I recorded it. >
