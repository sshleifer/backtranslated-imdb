The film is very well done, which is great and with a passionate appearance. You can say that every shot is thought and executed to perfection. For movie lovers this is especially a great watch and they should especially appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into it. <br /> <br /> It's hard to put that movie under one label. It's not really a drama, it's not really a thriller and it's not really a comedy. Instead, it's more of a movie with its own style, which does things its way. It does not necessarily follow the rules of cinema and presents many different elements from many different genres combined. <br /> <br /> But just as the film is the main character, the movie gets kind of slow and boring in some parts. The artistic style of directing tries to hide that the story is actually quite simple and it is more like if the film depended solely on its style and general atmosphere created by the film. It does not make the movie horrible or anything, but just prevents it from being a true absolute must see. In some parts, the film also seems to be trying to be too poetic and tries to let the pictures speak too much for themselves. He seems a little overdone in some parts, although for most of the film he still works beautifully. <br /> <br /> It features great cameras and some unique stories, which makes it an original as well as a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
