(Some spoilers included :) <br /> <br /> Although many commentators have called this movie surreal, the term fits poorly here. To quote the Encyclopaedia Britannica, surreal means: "Fantastic or incongruous images": one need not explain to the unimaginative how many ways a ten-year-old boy usually seeks and his fortune in the bank of driver of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious could read James Kincaid; but if you asked the boy how incongruous he was at the wheel of a sports car, he would certainly protest, "No way!" What fantasies and incongruities the film offers mostly appear within the first fifteen minutes. After that, we have more iterations of the same, in an increasingly crude and squalid progression that, far from being incongruent, soon shows foreseeable. Not that it was, on the other hand, literally believable - but it was unfair to rate Motorama in particular with this flaw, any plausible suspension of disbelief having fallen abruptly on the scale of values ​​of the filmmaker and observer typical since "Raiders." of the Lost Ark "has become a blockbuster." Hallucinatory ": How do we know what a hallucination is if you start off having one is not knowing we're having one? Anyway, some people know they like" hallucinogenic drugs "- but if Motorama typifies the result, then I do not understand so that someone would take them more than once.There is, of course, the occasional bad trip.The movie should be one of those, pun and all. <br /> <br /> "Juxtaposition of words that was amazing": How often can a ten-year-old surprise him, uttering "Oh, my God!" when he likes something, or "Damn!" when he does not? These two interjections are couple of course with this script. surrealism as far as dialogue is concerned could only reveal, in direct proportion, one's naivety to the standards of speech of the rising American generation. "A world completely defined and meticulously represented but that does not make rational sense : "The world of Motorama, in fact, does not make sense, but is as completely defined as a cartoon in a primary school newspaper. The cast's numerous guest stars have special roles even less clever than our little hero who exclaims "Damn!" in the blink of an eye, but it needs several seconds to invent the most lying lie. And even * his * character, despite appearing in almost every scene, has no significant development. Here is a scarce reward for any viewer who sympathizes, as I should, enough to want to know him better and understand "where he comes from." One vaguely perceives a story and a much better protagonist who struggle to leave. <br /> <br /> "Fully recognizable and realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous, paradoxical or shocking structure." No, we see a succession of stereotyped and increasingly dilapidated posters, gas stations, greasy spoons restaurants, cheap hotels and their low-income habitats along the country's highways, exactly where they belong stereotypically. "Primarily responsible for perpetuating ... the traditional emphasis on content." There is little content, moment by moment, in Motorama. <br /> <br /> In short: imagine British millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates on their way to a fancy fancy party, sitting serene and dumb as cautious drivers. They tilt their Rolls-Royces like fragile esquifes through a sea of ​​desperate humanity, Chinese who beg them through the windows and stain the glass with blood. Or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques, limos like those now rusty and white pianos gilded by ghosts. In this detritus an exhausted boy wanders and a sick woman whom he grabs as a maternal figure becoming a girlfriend, who sleeps side by side in the grass. He is awakened - on the Feast of the Transfiguration, the "white and bright" day of 1945 - by a brilliant flash on the horizon which is not the rising sun. Upon discovering that his consort has become a corpse, he first believes he has witnessed his soul going to heaven. Later, he explains only a little less innocent: 'I learned a new word today: atomic bomb. It's like God takes a picture. Now there are only two samples of cinematic surrealism, the surrealism whose ironies propagate enough to invade the very title of the film: Empire of the Sun. If you look surreal, * please * do not miss. Unfortunately, as much as he steps on the accelerator to run in his carriage through and beyond the desert, no scene so strangely strange, rich, subtle or dazzling awaits poor little Gama of Motorama on his mission. <br /> <br /> None of the above necessarily constitutes a thumb down in this movie. Although a bit disappointed, I can not rule it out in view of the respectability of another genre he exemplifies - one influenced, certainly, by surrealism, but also by expressionism, existentialism and pessimism of Franz Kafka amid power structures omnipotent . Let's try the size: Theater of the Absurd. Returning to EB's article on this style, I am struck by how, insofar as Theater of the Absurd is a valid artistic style, objections above Motorama disappear like a cloud of smoke. I am tempted to cite the entire text as support for identification. The theater of absurd attempts to show "that the human situation is essentially absurd, devoid of purpose ... humanity is feeling hopeless, confused and anxious." Having at once achieved its purpose of escape from a depressing domestic life among parents fighting, Gus finds himself without purpose until he passes by a bright billboard that reads "Motorama" and decides to win in the lottery that promises. As others have shown, this ambition proves to be illusory: although the game "never expires," the sponsoring company does not intend for anyone to ever win, and has ways to deceive, confuse and let down any aspiring reward. He, like others, ends up disappointed in his dream. "Absurd playwrights, therefore, have wiped out most of the logical structure of traditional theater. There is little dramatic acting as conventionally understood, yet frantically characters perform, their occupation serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change your existence ... a timeless, circular quality emerges. " "The language in an absurd piece is full of ... repetitions ... repeating the obvious until it sounds silly." Underneath a comic surface sometimes "dazzling," we find "an underlying message of metaphysical anguish." Gus' obsession with a silly game, his futile language, the plot device in which he guesses a dark future and / or returns to an earlier time and takes a different but still bleak course - both fits now. While an admirer of the surreal would do better with some movies, anyway, from Spielberg, Motorama's admirers as it really is should find fellow travelers - not instead but beyond - in the works of Beckett, Ionesco, and Genet. <br /> But you can not stop here. After his disillusionment with the game, Gus returns to "Phil" (ie, Love), the first attendant he met and the only person who treated him decently, though he also rebuked him - at a service station announcing "Be full! "Under the tutelage of Phil, he learns a life of waiting for cars. We could note here that the absurdist playwright Beckett had called his most famous play "Waiting for Godot," and that, for Godot, we should read "God." God is one of Phil's concerns as well. In addition, as an indirect result of his previous encounter with Gus, Phil is very crippled and comes out on a sharp edge with his arms outstretched horizontally. In the last scene, Gus, now protected from Phil, says he wants to listen to music. We do not hear anything, but we see Phil swinging his fingers at the end of the outstretched arm, waving at Gus closer, and Gus responds. The end. <br /> <br /> Finally, for an author I am currently reading, the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow. If this rebel lawyer is not recognized as an architect or adventurer of Liberation Theology, who is more of a Roman Catholic than an Anglican movement, perhaps he should be. Police brutality and corporate greed are a cliché in film and literature, including Motorama, but Stringfellow supports and illuminates such feelings with impressive writings, tradition and reason. <br /> <br /> His most significant work is an exposition of the earthly activities of these fallen angels to whom the Bible refers as principalities and powers. The principalities, Stringfellow wrote, are behind all of our three popular selves: Images, Institutions, and Ideologies. All these commend themselves to our worship by making false promises. The more deeply involved with an image, an institution or an ideology any person becomes, the more his own personality becomes "exhausted" and becomes a slave to them. Promising power, control, and immortality, they inexorably surrender helplessness, chaos, and death. As essentially fallen and defeated powers, they can do no more than that. Yet they seduce humans with that "rule over the earth" promised by God in the book of Genesis, while none of us actually controls an image, an institution, or an ideology that is inevitably based on its own hegemony and self-preservation. They take on their own lives. "Domain" becomes a translation error: a more precise interpretation of Hebrew would be "stewardship." But this is a problem alongside a more fundamental problem: most of us neglect the fact that God had delegated that power to Adam before the fall. We have no reason to suppose that we, your descendants, are still exercising it now: on the contrary, it should be obvious that demonic forces stole it from us. <br /> <br /> We could add two observations from CS Lewis. First, that "the conquest of nature by man" is a mere illusion and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as an instrument; and second, contrary to popular belief, Satan is not a kind of good weather Charlie. He may pinch pleasures at first, but he is very stingy with them and will pull them from any human firmly into his slave, perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for itself and seething with resentment. Now, applying these ideas to Motorama, it seems they have mirrored remarkably in Gus' experience. He is, if not cool, at least a handsome little boy before being the victim of the Motorama game. The first signs of advertising shine glamorously. The more he continues, however, and the deeper he travels toward the headquarters of the sponsoring company, the more worn out they become. He is lonely, finding no one else playing the game. The stations that distribute the cards have fallen into ruins or are made up of zombies. The people he meets along the way are increasingly ugly, deceptive and hostile. (The fact that principalities respond to a common dictator does not mean that they can support each other.) Gus's humanity is extirpated from him as he becomes not only totally self-centered and oblivious to the needs of others, but partially blinded ... disfigured ... prematurely aged as childish in the literal sense of linguistically problematized. Eventually, even his precious Mustang is taken from him in an accident, and he must continue to destroy a dead man. However, finally, having done everything he hoped for, he presents himself to the principality in his proud tower to receive his prize. Using the biblical power to confuse exercised by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity, its agents avoid it, disappoint, insult and finally throw it from the top floor. It falls long and hard, landing, finally in a body of water. In other words, in classical symbolism, he DIES. He found the inevitable bad end of anyone who put his faith in such a deceiver. <br /> <br /> But this fate proves to be just a warning in a changing future. He regrets and returns to Phil, and upon seeing him performs the first selfless and generous act we have seen of him for almost an hour and a half: noting that Phil is now disabled and can barely insert a hose into a gas tank, he asks : "Can I help you with this?" Then, seeing the "wanted help" sign, he decides to run for office, explaining to the driver he was asking for a ride that he calculates that he will get here because it does not look like a bad place. to the work. <br /> <br /> This interpretation is conjectural, of course, and may surprise or even outrage the movie's "cult classic" aficionados who see quite different points in it. <br /> <br /> If Motorama is not my cup of tea, I'm at least convinced now that it's not the worst movie ever made.
