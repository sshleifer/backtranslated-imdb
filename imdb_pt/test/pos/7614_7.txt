Never Been Kissed gives Drew Barrymore the chance to do something that maybe 70% of us would love to do. Go back to high school and make some necessary corrections. In fact, the first time for me was bad enough and at my age I doubt I could do what Drew does. <br /> <br /> Of course the reason may also be that once we get out of high school, it's like leaving a cocoon and we have to deal with the big and hostile world out there. I know some in my life who would come back and stay if they could. In fact, there is an episode of Law and Order that explores the shadow side of this same situation. A girl looking young enough to do this, passes high school at least three times and kills the person who stumbles on her secret. <br /> <br /> With Drew, it's a chore. She is the editor of the Chicago Sun Times, who yearns to be a reporter. Editor Garry Marshall, who plays the role as Donald Trump took over the Sun Times, gets this brilliant idea and has just seen Barrymore a person young enough to do the masquerade. <br /> <br /> High school for the first time was bad enough. Drew was not the most popular of the time and she's not doing better the second time around. That is until Brother David Arquette also goes back to school and helps her overcome difficulties. <br /> <br /> Of course this raises many questions for Drew, peer pressure from two sources, employment and school. What does a girl do? <br /> <br /> Never been kissed is a light and charming comedy that, in your favor, ignores the opportunity to be cruelly exploitative and gives us good entertainment. Drew is very funny and sweet and his performance in times of stress for his character moves well into pathos. Michael Vartan, as his English teacher, is the kind I wish there were more in the area of ​​education and Leelee Sobieski and Jessica Alba play a couple of cool, empty boys with whom Drew desperately tries to relate. <br /> <br /> It still does not inspire me to return to Midwood High School.
