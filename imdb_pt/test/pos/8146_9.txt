When I was told about this movie I was not too happy to see it, although by the final credits, it turned out to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film is very graphic self (male to male scenes, you do not see everything) would not be a gay-themed movie if there was not ... <br /> <br /> the movie is very light, humorous and contains some very funny parts. I highly recommend this movie, about 3 rooms through you really feel for the main characters, and this I think brings the whole movie together. <br /> <br /> Once again, very well together .. plus beautiful Mormon.
