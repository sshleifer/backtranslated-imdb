For all those people who believe that the dialogue is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is smart enough to take you seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a whodunit for people who may not be able to keep up with the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid). <br /> <br /> Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pit. He has not published a novel for four years, his wife is divorcing him, drinking a little, and being blessed or cursed with the caustic wit, which he freely dispenses with his students. He recommended a friend to progress, and a bright young student sent a manuscript for him as an independent project. Cornell does not even want to read, so he gives an "A" and pushes it aside. Leaning back with a drink in his office, he looks out the window as the bright young student walks past the window on the way to find the sidewalk on a date. <br /> <br /> Hal comes to talk, and they talk, drink some more. Cornell realizes that he has to read the manuscript now. When he goes home, his wife is waiting with the divorce papers. He drinks a little more. She leaves, and he goes to a college affair, only to find her there. He drinks even more. And when his wife finds out that the student is dead, she passes out and he finds out she was having an affair with the student. This, of course, takes you to drink more seriously. The next morning, he wakes up to find himself in the dormitory of one of his students, a freshman named Syd (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> He feels worse than a hangover, goes to the doctor and discovers that he has been poisoned, is irreversible and has 24 to 48 hours of life. He does not have much time to figure out who killed him, and there are sub-plots, motives, relationships and surprises at every turn, although it all makes sense in the end. All his discoveries and exchanges are adorned with sarcasm, dry perspicacity, and keen observations. Let's just say that this movie will give a new meaning to the saying "publish or perish". <br /> <br /> There are no bad performances in this movie. There are recurring images and symbolism used at careful intervals. Notice the cracked glass and the distorted images through the glass. Some of the camera outlets are revolutionary for 1988, and some of the violent actions are carefully and skillfully choreographed. The music is discreet and appropriate, although occasionally it makes its own statement, in the lyrics of the songs. The visuals in this movie are impressive. <br /> <br /> If there is a flaw, the 20 minute aperture moves a little slowly, and almost puts you to sleep. But the pace increases rapidly, with the right amount of exposure between the action segments. <br /> <br /> There are no explicit sexual encounters, although there is violence and some bad language. <br /> <br /> This is a writer's movie, and is best enjoyed by those who have a sense of humor about their own success or failure. I think if you take this seriously, you're already in trouble.
