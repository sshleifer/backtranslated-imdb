*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** There must have been something in the air in the immediate postwar years that made nightclubs attractive to movies. A bunch of nocturnal urban movies was made at the time, and not just in America. One of the most notable was Carol Reed's Odd Man Out, an English photo of a wounded gunman staggering through the streets of Belfast. In the United States, it was midday, or rather midnight, of film noir. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not really movie noir, but it has the noir ornaments, although it uses them for its own purposes. , which has to do with fanaticism. Directed by Edward Dmytryk, written by John Paxton, was adapted from a Richard Brooks novel. The book concerned the murder of a homosexual; in the film, the victim is turned into a Jew. Although filmed as a mystery, there is little suspense in the film, since it is quite obvious who is the killer from an early age. What makes the film so pleasing and appealing is the evocation of a city, Washington, D.C., shortly after World War II, by some of the most talented craftsmen working in films at the time. Unlike many nightly films, the Crossfire is set mainly indoors: in police stations, domestic homes and night-time cinemas. Soldiers are everywhere in the movie, and most are eager to get back into their civilian lives. Yet we realize, by most of the men we know, that their personalities were so shaped by their military experience that it will be difficult for them to return to their former quarters; for some maybe even impossible. They seem more connected to each other than to anything or anyone else. <br /> <br /> However, some men never really attached themselves to anyone in the military. The killer, Monty, is one of those guys. One notices that he has never been connected in his civil life either. He is a lone wolf who also needs people. Desperately alone, he has a sadistic side of a mile wide, and always needs someone close to being the target of his jokes. The man he kills did not do him any harm and, in fact, was a stranger to him. But once Monty discovered the man's religion, that was enough. He did not really want to kill the guy, as it was his intention to 'just' humiliate him and just hit him. But as he was quite drunk at the time, Monty's fists got the better of him. It is this act that defines the history of the moving story. <br /> <br /> When the movie is set up, the other characters will quickly be in focus. The opposite number of Monty is Keely, another soldier who, though introspective as Monty, and somewhat distant, does not harbor resentment against anyone and seems a reasonable, even kind, fellow. Finley, the pipe-smoking homicide detective, is dandy and a bit thin compared to men in uniform, but he is more than a match for the various, and most recalcitrant, soldiers he deals with. The actors who play these roles, Roberts Ryan, Mitchum and Young, perform excellent performances, each in a different shade. Ryan, like Monty, is tense and paranoid, always looking for someone to choose; and one may feel their anxiety at becoming a victim. Like Keely, Mitchum is discreet, almost indifferent; he never raises his voice; and he seems to have more to say, more to offer, than that allowed by the script. Young's performance has often been criticized for being too soft, but I think it's deceptively strong and very unusual. He cuts against the stereotype of the hardboiled cop, and makes Finley's character a bit of a crime detection prince. <br /> <br /> There are few surprises in Crossfire, although the script is sometimes surprisingly well written. , even bright. Character actor Paul Kelly presents one of the best short film performances as the "boyfriend" of a woman a soldier picks up at a bar. Kelly may or may not be her husband; and he may or may not live with her, although it seems relaxed enough in his apartment. The beauty of these scenes is that nothing is clear, and this man seems more than a little confused about what his role should or should be. In a way, these few scenes form the thematic core of the film, which is anomie. With the exception of the detective, all the men in the movie are adrift, aimless and basically lost, some more seriously than others. In this respect Crossfire is, for all preaching near the end, a film about the imprecision of identity, and how easily it can be lost or distorted. Men wander from bar to pub in this movie as they engage in a sort of sloppy camaraderie, their personalities merging into a sort of general American male model. Then something happens, something is preached. One word is mentioned, be it "Jew" or "hick", and things suddenly become tense, and the very notion of individuality, of an identity outside the group, of someone who does not like them, becomes deeply offensive, until disgusting. Then, after the moods are exalted and whatever has stirred them up has been solved or forgotten, the men return to their gross, not personal normality, and the order is restored.
