Warner Brothers has considerably tampered with American history in Raoul Walsh's "Big Trail" director's first-class film, "They Died in Their Boots," a somewhat inaccurate but moving biography of cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer. The film narrates Custer from the moment he arrives at West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him in the Little Big Horn. This is one of the main roles of Errol Flynn and one of Raoul Walsh's greatest epics. Walsh and Flynn were joined many times later, and "They died in their boots" reunited Olivia de Havilland as the romantic interest of Flynn for the last time. They appeared as a couple in seven previous films. This 140-minute black and white dealer is nothing short of brilliant, with dynamic action sequences, funny romantic scenes, and harsh dramatic confrontations between our hero and his opponents. One of the notorious errors involves Colonel Philip Sheridan, who is shown as the commander at West Point before the Civil War. In fact, Sheridan was a lieutenant at this time. In fact, the commander was Robert E. Lee, as the previous Flynn movie "Santa Fe Trail" showed. Another historical lapse concerns Lieutenant General Whitfield Scott; Scott was not commander of Union troops during the Civil War. Warner Brothers introduced Custer as a drinker (probably because Flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in real life Custer did not drink or smoke. However, these and other historical stories do not detract from a truly splendid film. "They Wied With Their Boots On" opens with Custer at the West Point Military Academy, dressed in a fancy uniform an African American carrying his luggage and tending his dogs. After the sergeant of the guard realizes that he was the honor guard of a future plebs rather than a high-ranking foreign general, the sergeant hands Custer to a cadet of the Ned Sharp ranks (Arthur Kennedy of "City for Conquest"). take care of him Sharp performs a hands-on work on Custer by installing him in the rooms of Major Romulus Taipe (Stanley Ridges of the "Task Force"), who promptly sends Custer away. Naturally, the volatile Custer attacks Sharp in a public scuffle. General Phil Sheridan (John Litel of "The Children of Katie Elder") is prepared to dismiss West Point's Custer for improper conduct. As it turns out, Sheridan can not oust Custer because Custer did not sign up. Once he enrolls, Custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with enthusiasm to fight and accumulate demerits in abundance. When the American Civil War erupts, West Point forms the cadets who did not complete their education and take them into combat. One of the last cadets rushed to the war is Custer. Eager as he is to get into the fight, Custer meets his future wife, Elizabeth 'Libby' Bacon (Olivia de Havilland from "Santa Fe Trail"), and they commit to each other despite Mr. Bacon (Gene Lockhart's " Carousel ") that detests Custer's vision. It seems that Bacon ran to Custer in a bar and insulted one of Custer's friends and our hero chided Bacon. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, in Washington, Custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment, but Major Taipe has him cooling his heels. Custer befriends Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott (Sidney Greenstreet, of "The Maltese Falcon") and they share an appetite for creamy Bermuda onions that become one of Custer's hallmarks. Scott not only ensures that Taipe attributes Custer to the Second Cavalry, but also Custer appropriates Taipe's horse to get to his command. During the Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861, Custer disobeys orders from none other than Sharp, attacks his superior officer and holds a bridge so the infantry can cross it. Wounded on the shoulder and sent to the hospital, Custer receives a medal instead of a court martial. When Confederate General Jeb Stuart threatens the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, Scott is shocked by the chance the South will triumph. When a brigadier general can not be found, Scott urges Taipe to promote the first officer available. An error is committed and Custer is promoted. Unbelieving at first, Custer embraces the moment and breaks Stuart's breakthrough. After the war, Custer descends and begins drinking with the boys in the local bars. Sharp appears as a crooked railroad promoter and with his father they try to enlist Custer to serve as the president of their railroad so they can get funds. Eventually, Libby intercedes on his behalf with General Sheridan, who was in charge of the army, and puts him back on duty as commander of the 7th Cavalry. When he takes command, Custer finds the 7th Cavalry very drunk and it is not surprising that Sharp commands the drink at the fort. Meanwhile, Custer has his first race with Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn from "The Guns of Navarone") and takes him into custody. Of course, Crazy Horse escapes, becomes Custer's opponent, and they fight. <br /> <br /> When Custer defeated Crazy Horse and the Indians, Sharp with Taipe as government agent conspired to destroy a peace treaty with the Sioux and other indigenous nations. They also take care that Custer is accused of assaulting Taipe in a hall fight. On his way to Washington, Custer discovers the treachery of Sharp and Taipe who made a golden attack on the sacred Black Hills. The settlers attack and the Indians attack the war. Custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men in the Little Big Horn in a clash against 6,000 redskins. Dealing with "Stagecoach" Bert Glennon captures both grain and glory. The long shot of the 7th Cavalry leaving the fort at dawn is spectacular. As a further premonition of Custer's imminent death, Libby collapses after he leaves his quarters for the Little Big Horn. "They died with their boots in" benefits of a top-notch Max Steiner score incorporating the regimental song "Gary Owen."
