Surface was amazing, I do not know how many Mondays I survived at school just thinking about the new episode of the surface. I loved it, sometimes I had to call home and tell my mother to record it for me. I was very upset when I heard that it was canceled, I mean, way to hang ourselves. So they can have their new comedy Tina fay (you could not pay me to watch this, I think watching the commercials made me dumber). I'm going to miss my Monday night shot of Surface, even though my sister made fun of me. though, hijacked looks good and, they still have L & O: SVU (I guess, I still have to check) (I just wrote the two lines above because they said I needed ten lines).
