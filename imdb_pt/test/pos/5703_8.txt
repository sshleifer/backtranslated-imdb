In retrospect, the 1970s were a golden age for American cinema, as demonstrated and explored by this documentary directed by Ted Demme and Richard LaGravenese. This IFC effort serves to illustrate and clarify the main idea of ​​what that time meant for the careers of these illustrious people seen in the documentary. <br /> <br /> The incredible body of work that remains, is a legacy for everyone involved in the art of making movies in this period. The decade was marked by the end of the Vietnam War and the turbulent end of those years of Jimmy Carter's presidency. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear, today's movies do not measure against the films that came out during this creative decade, because the industry as a whole has changed drastically. Today's great studios want to tame snapshots that will be instant hits, with no regard to content, or integrity, as long as the bottom line shows millions of dollars in revenue. The other thing that emerges after hearing some of America's finest creative minds speak is the importance of the spirit of independent film because it is about the only thing that offers its creators great moral and artistic rewards . <br /> <br /> This documentary is a must see for all movie fans.
