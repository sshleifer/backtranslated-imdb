Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, respectively, the second in the Universal series, where it is again established by means of a written prologue that the famous detective is legendary and covers time. This helps to comfortably set things right here in the "present" era of the early 1940s. In this offering, Holmes goes through a few different disguises (with the more prominent features of Rathbone, it is likely that people really does not recognize his true identity?) as he protects a physicist from the hands of the Nazis as well as Holmes's greatest enemy, Professor Moriarty (now played by Lionel Atwill). The scientist has developed a bomb that will greatly aid in aerial bombardment and promised his plans to the British. But Moriarty wants to get hold of him so he can sell them to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> A good entrance was boosted by the participation of villain Atwill, now cast as Moriarty (although George Zucco was not sloppy). himself in the ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES). It is always intriguing to see Holmes and his greatest enemy making witticisms together ("the needle to the last, eh, Holmes?").
