That was in a weird movie. I enjoyed the adventure that seems to be aimed at kids. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character assassinates a federal officer. So he's a fugitive running away. Later, they blow up his house and he finally commits suicide. It seems they should have made a movie for a more mature audience or make it more familiar. <br /> <br /> That was in a strange movie.
