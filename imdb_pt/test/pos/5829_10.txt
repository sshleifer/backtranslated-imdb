One of the best TV shows, if not the best. Because? Simple: have the courage to show us real life in prison, without any predictable clich√©s and twists. This is not Prison Break or any other show, actually comparing Oz to the Sopranos show sounds like children's story. Swearing, swearing, shots of explicit violence and drug use, disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes ... all that and more in Oz. But this is not the best part of Oz; the characters are the strongest point of this show; they are all excellent and not annoying, despite the fact that we are seeing brutal criminals. The actors are excellent, my favorites are the actors who are playing Ryan O'Reilly and Tobias Beecher because they are unique and completely change their behavior. And above all ... he has no remorse for his actions. Overall ... Oz is amazing show, the best out there. Forget CSI and show about stupid doctors ... this is the deal ... OZ!
