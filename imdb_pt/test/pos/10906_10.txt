Joan Cusack steals the show! The premise is good, the plot interesting and the script was OK. Somewhat simplistic in that a gay man's story was so positive when it's usually not so positive. So again, it's fiction. :) All in all a fun joke. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was the "inside joking" aspect. Since the target audience was probably straight, they may not have gay "things" in the context of the story. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline showed a facet of his acting prowess that writers sometimes do not take into consideration when suggesting Kline's involvement. <br /> <br /> This hit the target.
