In Paris, a few months before the Nazi invasion, manipulative actress Viviane Denvers (Isabelle Adjani) uses her ex-boyfriend Frédéric Auger (Grégori Deràngere) to hide the body of a man killed by her. Frédéric knocks on the car, the deceased is found and he is sent to prison. When the Germans invade France, Frédéric escapes with another prisoner, Raoul (Yvan Attal), and they become friends. In the flight to Bordeaux, they meet on the train Camille (Virginie Ledoyen), the young assistant of the physicist Professeur Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehlé), that is trying to leave France with its search of heavy water. Once in Bordeaux, the group meets Viviane with her new lover, Minister of State Jean-Étienne Beaufort (Gérard Depardieu), and is pursued by a German spy, journalist Alex Winckler (Peter Coyote), while Paris is falling and the population is confusing. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful and magnificent romantic adventure "Bon Voyage" is! The excellent and complex script has action, romance, war, comedy, espionage, drama and many characters, played by a fantastic cast, actually a constellation of stars; the direction is impressive; the score is wonderful. I really loved this wonderful movie, and I have to finish my review due to my adjectives limitation to describe this gem. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Journey of the Heart"
