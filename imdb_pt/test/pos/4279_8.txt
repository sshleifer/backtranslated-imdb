Fellowe's drama about the marriage of a couple who is threatened by a younger third-rate relative to the wife of the house (Watson). Wilkinson plays the role very well as the troublesome husband who can not control the betrayal of his wife, and deals with the issue. I also really like Rupert in his role as William Bule, the man with whom Watson has a case. Although I think Emily Watson is a great actress, I had a little problem with the way her character was written, I did not make her very nice (I know a cheater should not be nice, but some of her actions and things she does not had reasoning behind them). The screenplay was perhaps the weak part of this drama, although Fellowes' direction was good and the performances were also very good. This movie is better than Unfaithful, but it is not a masterpiece. --- Rating of the IMDB: 6.7, my rating: 8/10
