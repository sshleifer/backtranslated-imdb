I do not know what the last reviewer is talking about, but this show is pure entertainment. Basically 2 guys are placed in competitions in a club to pick up girls in 3 different scenarios. They mix the scenarios for each show, so it's not always the same. The panel of 4 judges is not afraid to call people or admit them when they recognize the game. They will break what the guy did wrong, and what the guy did right. Some competitors are weak, some are strong, but what happens is always fun. If you're a guy coming out, you can relate. I've seen a weak game, I've seen a strong game, and this show is for real. No doubt.
