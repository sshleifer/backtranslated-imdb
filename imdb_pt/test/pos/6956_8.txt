Howard Frank Mosher's adaptation of Jay Craven's "Where the Rivers Flow Northward" is one of the most subtle transitions from literature to screen. Craven is an admirer of Mosher's work - he also directed "A Stranger in the Kingdom". <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent - especially Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal. Torn offers what could be the best part of his career - Noel Lord, the fiercely independent lumberjack who stands at the center of this story. The portrait of Cardinal Tantoo of Lawn's housekeeper / Lord's common wife is also fatal. I'm surprised and disappointed that none of them were nominated for an Oscar when this movie was released. Performances of this caliber must be recognized. The only character that's a little hard to swallow for me is the executive of the energy company played by Michael J. Fox. He looks a lot like a kid in that role. I think there's a curse attached to the young look, no matter how much people want. Craven did a great job here by bringing the character of the early 20th century to the screen - places, angles, sets, all combine to transport the viewer to the time and place of history. Director of Photography Paul Ryan was exceptional. The Horseflies score is also top notch - it fits perfectly into the scenery and scenery. <br /> <br /> And the story itself ...? One of the most compelling portrayals of America's fiercely independent pioneer spirit - a feature that is in decline these days. When it appears in modern times, one is often looked upon with suspicion and disdain. In Noel Lord, we have a character that we can admire for his values, and even for his stubbornness. <br /> <br /> This is not an indigestible "period article" but a vibrant look in an era that is gone. and a type of character that disappeared. These are not gold-plated heroes, but real people, with both the strengths and weaknesses at play within them. fighting in a hostile environment to live their lives and at the same time be at peace with the world in which they live. As today, there are those who exercise the power they would have otherwise.
