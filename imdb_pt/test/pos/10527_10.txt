Great adaptation of the romance Christie. Amazing attention to the authentic details of the period (many films from the mid-70s and early 80s that try to make the 1920s and early 1930s look a lot in the 1970s and early 1980s to my liking, so they expected the worst here proved wrong) The costumes and sets are very well done. I really liked this production ?? largely due to Francesca Annis's adorable portrait of a young, bright, carefree Lady "Frankie" and James Warwick's charming Bobbie. The duo would play Christie's Tommy & Tuppence, which is funny, as some contemporary book critics compared Frankie and Bobby to the previous Tommy & Tuppence characters. Are the supporting characters equally well-made? o over the top Ms. Rivington (played by Miss Marple-to-be Joan H.) and "Badger" is interpreted perfectly like the post-WWI, "Bertie Wooster type".
