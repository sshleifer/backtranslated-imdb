in history. It is a reality mixed with the American and very original. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is a young woman tired of her boring life working on a minimum wage job in New England. Its despicable boss proposes it, she leaves and takes some money from the registry. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida, is not a short trip, and your Ford Escort is over. She then meets an older couple, portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have an RV and graciously offer to help her out - it is not safe for a girl to be alone on the road. Especially on I-95. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is very realistic as Alice, and initially lets the character of Judith Ivey help her; Buy your decent clothes, cosmetics, etc. In the beginning, it's a good season for Alice, who hopes to be with her girlfriend, who is studying in Miami. There is an interesting cinematography while the trio takes the trailer up to Florida: the rest, bland landscapes and eventually beautiful mountains of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Eventually, there is something wrong, and Ivey's character apparently has Stories fabricated about his daughter, as well as her husband, who now seems a bit sinister. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the outcome of this movie, but it ends positively as the audience waits in suspense. reminded me a bit of Spielberg's "Duel" - although initially not so threatening - the moral of the story is - you never know what people are thinking - especially if you're driving around the country. Caution !! You will enjoy this movie.
