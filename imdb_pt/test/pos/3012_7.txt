After all, is it another serial killer thriller, following the same kind of plot preferred by old favorites like Silence of the Lambs? A team of police follow the trail of murders (particularly unpleasant), someone else gets caught and they somehow need to figure out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need the psychodelic machine of psychologist Jennifer Lopez to come into his head and force him to say it all. This is where the movie gets all new and different when we enter (through a 21st century CGI update of the Dr Who's favorite kaleidoscopic fashion tunnel) a kind of Hellraiser-y strange world of creepy crazy stuff happening all over the place, ruled by D'Onofrio, now a sort of sovereign ruler of his distorted mental world, within his comatose body. The sequences within the mind are well perceived and often impressive, all the protagonists perform properly, horror is the maximum if you like this kind of thing but the hype around the whole thing led to a disappointment for me, as I expected something completely new and unlike anything I've ever done before, not this successful mix of genres of serial killer and horror special effects. Sometimes horrifying, often beautiful, a rather exciting story told with care and attention by talented filmmakers, but by no means the great leap into the unknown was marketed as.
