.... but at the same time part of you are thinking "Am I ready for what I am about to see?" <br /> <br /> In the end, you're glad you saw it. I was at least. Jackass Number Two has twice the laughter and twice the action. Some acrobatics will take your breath away. Besides Little Miss Sunshine, I think it was the best movie I saw this summer. Maybe even this year. <br /> <br /> The whole cast returns, plus some like Chris Raab and Rake Yohn. I do not think any of the cast members had a moment of boredom. Any and all trick was funny or dangerous or a combination of both; Stupid. The beginning was as funny as the first, and the ending was curiously hilarious; the cast performing a musical number. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two is the perfect movie to see with your friends. Stay during the credits, there are some very funny moments. One involves Luke Wilson.
