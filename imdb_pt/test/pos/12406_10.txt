The effectiveness of this image was better proven in the target audience, ie adolescents. My 14-year-old son was so absorbed in this film that I rate him as much taller than his impersonator "Mad City." This triggered a debate in our house on issues such as peer pressure and loyalty against doing the right thing. Just for this, I rate this movie as 10! Parents should watch with their teens and discuss it later. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed smart dialogue and consistent acting. I thought James Remar was right in his role, but the teen cast really carried that image. Other IMDB users praised Corey Feldman's performance, which is really inspired. All in all, I give this photo my highest recommendation. Go get this one!
