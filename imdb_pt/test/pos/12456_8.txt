Although he does not come any closer to Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan than, say, Johnny Wiesmuller's films, he has his own quirky and entertaining penchant for history. It's a well done Tarzan movie. Nice scenery, good photography, functional continuity, and a Tarzan cry that echoes the one described by Burroughs. All players perform well. The only negatives I found were, I think, related. It moves slowly in places. This slow movement? Make this image long. It could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter, which I think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot and the character's development. But the rest of the movie works well enough to carry you over these two tough spots and still leave the viewer satisfied with the movie. Short version of all the above ... It's a very good movie Tarzan.
