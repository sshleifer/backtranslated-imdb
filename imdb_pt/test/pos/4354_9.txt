While perhaps not as fun as some of Herzog's works, Little Dieter is another great movie from one of the greatest movie artists in the world. Drawing from the usual themes of Herzog, Little Dieter is a fascinating and edifying character study on a brave man and his efforts to continue living after a traumatic experience of life alteramente. <br /> <br /> Dieter Dengler wanted to fly from a very young age, and the Vietnam War gave him such an opportunity, but instead of spending the war in a cockpit, he spent most of his time as a prisoner of war. Dieter tells most of his story in an eloquent and passionate way, with occasional help from Herzog. Herzog makes very little voice over this time, but contributes a lot to subtly powerful sound and visual effects - which should not come as a surprise to those who are familiar with it. <br /> <br /> Dengler is a fascinating and extremely friendly person. As human as alive, I find the story of his life and his personality incorrigibly optimistic inspiring. Thank you to Herzog for (re) introducing him to us. <br /> <br /> The scale of the film is not so vast, and the drama is not as fierce as many of the early films that made Herzog a force to be reckoned with. However, I strongly recommend this to your fans and to those who enjoy documentaries. It's a very interesting and well executed film.
