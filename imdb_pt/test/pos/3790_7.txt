The big names in the movies tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was almost at the end of its launch. The tramp goes to war, performs with humor acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the rear. It's a very funny movie, although I do not think it's one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his best outing for First National before making his first masterpiece 'The Kid'. They are his first three winders, which contain sustained gags and more elaborate than he could orchestrate in his two-roll shorts at Mutual. <br /> <br /> It can be difficult to balance a pro-war message with clowning. tricks and burlesque scenes at the front, but no one would think about watching 'Shoulder Arms'. It is also preferable, in many ways, to a "more serious" dramatic work with a similar message, such as Griffith's "Hearts of the World." Chaplin had become a true virtuoso of the screen comedy at this point; it makes it look effortless. He knew full well now that a movie with fewer jokes - with more elaboration, refinement and careful timing - could be better than any other type of farce, a Keystone-type farce with a dozen plays per minute. The sequence in which Chaplin is disguised as a tree is a relevant example. Even with violent wars, Chaplin manages to raise the mood of millions.
