please, why not put this fantastic movie on DVD, I have been looking like the previous writer for years, what is the wait, or show it on TV. is so underrated is one of the most romantic and beautifully written books I have ever read, and I believe I read a few. I seem to think it was read on Radio 4, but I can not find it either. Why not try to re-do it yourself, I promise you will be the biggest winner, people love that kind of story, so please release and get us out of our misery or redo it, although I doubt this can be improved. Someone read to the land by the same author or saw the movie with Jennifer Jones, this is superb, but not to the same extent can be.
