I must say I thought the Greek show would be really ridiculous and stupid. As a member of a brotherhood, I did not want Greek organizations to look bad ... but I think Greek is hilarious. Yes, they have the stereotyped brotherhood and fraternity, but it is not mocking, but just a cute mood. <br /> <br /> All the characters are very friendly, except Rebecca Logan (I can not stand her), Casey and Rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister. Then there's Cappie. Who does not love a guy like Cappie haha ​​Your character brings a lot to the show. Rusty's roommate, Dale played by Clark Duke, is hilarious as well. <br /> <br /> It's definitely fun to watch so well in season two. I can not wait until I'm back !!
