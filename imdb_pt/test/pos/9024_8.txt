This is a great movie for pure entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. It's a nice and vaguely good movie. <br /> <br /> One small but still annoying thing about the movie is that we do not know why Justine and Chas are over. Okay, most early relationships do not work for one reason or another, but they looked more or less like a good couple. <br /> <br /> In short, it's worth taking a look to escape from reality.
