I was able to record THE DION BROTHERS on open TV (with the commercials) in the early 80's. I lent it to many friends, who agree that it's one of the best "bad guys" movies of all time. One day while walking to my apartment in New York, I saw Stacy Keach filming a scene for her TV series, Mickey Spilane. We had a moment to talk, and I told him how much I liked THE DION BROS, and I considered it a pure classic. He thanked me and said it was one of the best and most memorable cinematic experiences of his career. He was very nice and sincere, and I was grateful for the few moments he took to talk to a fan. This is a classic that needs to be on DVD.
