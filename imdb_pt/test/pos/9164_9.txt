I would recommend this as the most successful attempt so far to make a film about the Soviet war in Afghanistan. And it is a very honest and responsible image from small details of uniforms and weapons to human relations, war routine and the landscapes of Central Asia. It was filmed in Tajikistan shortly after the withdrawal of troops, which took place in 1989, not in 1985. The Italian star Placido was perfect in the role of Major Bandura. Other characters also seemed very natural, especially always drunk: the setting seems a little stuck in the end, but it could be an impact of the Civil War in Tajikistan, which started well during the filming of the film. Every movie crew had to escape sometimes even under fire. The last scene is purely harakiri and reminds me of the final words of a famous samurai movie - "we won every battle but we lost the war." It could also be a metaphor for the collapse of the USSR - the great country that lets itself be shot in the back by the little offended child.
