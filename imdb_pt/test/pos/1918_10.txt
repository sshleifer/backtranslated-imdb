well-done documentary about a sail race, sanity and the loss of both. <br /> <br /> I remembered reading Sir Francis Chichester's account of his trip around the world when I was in high school while watching this movie. What an adventure that was. <br /> <br /> Deep water tells an equally fascinating story. <br /> <br /> It takes a special person and an excellent sailor to run a journey without stops around the world ... alone. <br /> <br /> This movie does a great job demonstrating this. <br /> <br /> I love sailing, and my brother runs J-30s. <br /> <br /> But I've never been able to do such a feat.
