Some movies want to make us think, some want to excite us, some want to cheer us up. But sometimes a movie just wants to make us laugh, and "In & Out" certainly succeeds in this department. <br /> <br /> Indiana high school teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) will marry other classmates. Professor Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) in three days, but the whole city is more excited about the Oscar nomination of former resident Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon). But when Cameron wins an Oscar for playing a gay soldier, he thanks his gay teacher Howard for inspiration. What follows is Howard denying it in a hilarious set of setbacks in a truly inelegant manner. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline is great, exasperating gay stereotypes. Joan Cusack really has a knack for crazy jokes. Debbie Reynolds is totally hilarious as Howard's mother. And Bob Newhart is also a joke as the main homophobic. <br /> <br /> Gay scriptwriter Paul Rudnick really reaches a delicate balance here. He knows the stereotypes and exploits them in a way that is more tolerable to the conservatives of the Midwest and still harmless to the gay public. It's not exactly progressive, but it's funny and harmless, and definitely one step above "The Birdcage" of the previous year.
