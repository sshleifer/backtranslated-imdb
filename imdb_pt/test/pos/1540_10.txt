"Closet Land" was sponsored by Amnesty International and has a lot of political implications but there is much more to this richly exciting story than this ... <br /> <br /> This is not just about the political tension of the late 80's - it is about personal persecution that a woman presents herself as a child who has been molested by a family friend. We see the subtle allusion to the parallels of a dishonest government / society structure and the culture of sexual predation where one in four children are molested and one in three women experienced some form of rape. <br /> <br /> It brings me a frightening question: does the attitude of our sexual repression that leads to predation create the political environment of fear and censorship, or does socio-political dysfunction fuel a culture of sexual predation? The psychological ramifications of even asking this question force us to a place where we are led to develop our own answers. In the end, our young writer (Stowe) has a moment similar to the end of Hensen's "Labyrinth" - she realizes in a brilliant and brilliant moment that the idea of ​​having her power stolen by the police secret (Rickman) is an illusion. No one can steal your power - they can only induce you to give up, and then you have the right to take it back at any time. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie to be typed lightly, and you certainly do. The minimalist aspects, along with the infantile animation, shake the deeper parts of the psyche and leave no observer unchanged.
