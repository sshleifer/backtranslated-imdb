If I had seen Nurse Betty's poster, I probably would not have touched him with a ten-foot stick. But after hearing some positive comments, and knowing I was making some noise in Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I have is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining storyline. René Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse Betty, a woman who is sent to a delusional psychotic episode after a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (unsurprisingly) and was pleasantly surprised by the grumpy comedian Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> The film jumps continuously between comedy, drama, romance and suspense. However, despite this apparent identity crisis, it behaves very well. I found my eyes glued to the screen from start to finish, always waiting for the next turn in history. The whole cast is strong, if not spectacular. <br /> <br /> My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute (who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark "In Company of Men") depended much more on many Hollywood cliché conventions. . The mood-producing musical effects he crammed into our throats during every sentimental scene were unbearable! And he did the old standard "let's pick up some of the minor characters and pair them at the end in an unreasonable and illogical novel trick," just to be absolutely sure that everyone goes home with a smile on their face. Why should directors and writers treat their audience like idiots? <br /> <br /> But the film is still very nice to be carried away by these irritating irritations. In a very weak year for films, 'Nurse Betty' is one of the most enjoyable surprises of 2000. 8 out of 10.
