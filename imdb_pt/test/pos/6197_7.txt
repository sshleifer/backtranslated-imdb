If you watch this series, you will have 10 interesting chapters on the story of a sleeping cell and each character. And more intense with an infiltration from the FBI. <br /> <br /> Good story, cool characters and performances, but something is wrong (for me, of course). The end is wrong. You expect ten chapters waiting for a grand finale (it does not matter if they meet your goals or not), but ... well ... I guess that's not enough. It's a small end to a great series. I also expected more definitions about character stories. <br /> <br /> But, I repeat, it's an interesting miniseries. If you do not want to wait with large series (22-24 chapters), watch. I give 7 out of 10.
