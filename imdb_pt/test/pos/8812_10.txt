I absolutely love this movie. All about it. I almost felt like watching myself and my friends on the screen. The way this movie was filmed was a pure, very original and creative masterpiece. I relate to these characters and even had the same thoughts of some. I'm really glad I went through this movie. If only there were more genius like justin out there!
