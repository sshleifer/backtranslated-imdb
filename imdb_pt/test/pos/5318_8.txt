This has to be one of the most powerful messaging movies I've seen lately, it was absolutely flawless all the way, incredibly original and thought-provoking. The story is unusual and original, and the characters make this story very powerful. It's about a guy who kills his ex-girlfriend's older brother, and as he is sent to juvenile prison, through many memory flashbacks, you get a story and you do not let it go until the end. The murder he commits changes the course of life of every member of his family and the family of the deceased, and as you watch and realize that everyone has their own story and their own dark side, you simply enjoy this movie even more, it is a total tour of strength, because these actions can not be described in simple words. His motive for committing murder is left incompletely explained and makes the spectators think. Acting was practically flawless, and the cast was very good, it contains many familiar faces. If you like the movies that are thought out and that only make you think during them (eg 'Donnie Darko', 'Mulholland Dr.'), then 'The United States of Leland' is a great movie choice for you , otherwise you should pass this movie and watch it when you are in the mood to think seriously about the movies. <br /> <br /> 10/10
