Every American who thinks he understands World War II should watch this movie. Few Hollywood films about the war challenged the stereotype of Japanese soldiers as unemotional brutes obeying orders without thinking. We like to think that every Japanese man was ready and ready to fight to the death, until the day we bombed Nagasaki. "Fires on the Plain" shows a different reality: troops pathetically underused, demoralized and hungry to the point of cannibalism. They euphemistically refer to human flesh as "monkey meat." The film and the novel on which it was based also killed the myth that all Japanese soldiers preferred death to surrender: they had good reason to believe that their enemies were not willing to take prisoners. To me, this raises an issue that most Americans would rather avoid: if the Japanese military was so depleted at this point in the war, why did Hiroshima have to be blown up?
