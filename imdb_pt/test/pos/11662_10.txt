How do you know if a movie is good or not? It's the impact it has on you that makes the difference. "Dead Man Walking" really bothered me. I watched it twice. I do not know if I'll be strong enough to watch again. No, I did not feel good after watching it, but the movie was as successful as it can be. <br /> <br /> Robbins did a great job of incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic. He avoided making an argument that could easily be viewed as biased or subjective. I hope many people see Dead Man Walking. I believe that anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty with such enthusiasm should see the film. <br /> <br /> I do not know what else it could take to finally convince everyone that this relic of ancient times does not have a place in modern society anymore. <br /> <br /> The film itself does not make an argument for or against the death penalty. Describes reality. Reality is the best argument against the death penalty. <br /> <br /> A 10/10 for great acting, good film production and for the most important film made in years <br /> <br /> Thank you, Tim Robbins! <br /> <br />
