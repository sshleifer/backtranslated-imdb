"Nurse Betty" is the type of movie you can not describe on a poster or in a trailer or commercial. It's the kind of movie you get in waiting for a more mature "idiot and ass", which happens to a temporarily crazy waitress on a cross country adventure, avoiding crooks trying to kill her. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this movie is a wonderful and comforting tale about two people pursuing their dreams. The best part about "Nurse Betty" is her unpredictability. Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to separate dreams from reality, and along with touching drama and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what will happen next.
