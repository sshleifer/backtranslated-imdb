This is an action-packed movie that makes me feel very relaxed and relaxed every time I see him. The film (below its conclusion) shows that in the face of extreme odds, it is still possible to prevail. <br /> <br /> This movie is very refreshing, and will probably be banned at any time. Grab a copy before police think of all the copies they find. They do not want you to have hope for the future, or think you have a chance. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if Political Accuracy fails to suppress it, this would be an excellent movie to be released. on DVD. Such a release could contain interviews with the writer and director and related goodies. I'm sure he'd sell a few copies and I'd be one of the first to buy it. <br /> <br /> - Mincka
