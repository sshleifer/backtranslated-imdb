"Best In Show" follows the stories of a handful of human competitors as they prepare for one of the largest dog shows on the calendar. Any amateur psychologist would say that unconditional love and an obsession with a pet is a sign that something is missing in one's life, and each of the characters somehow fills that clich√©. There is ex-schoolboy Hottie who is now married to a nerdy man, the unlabeled and obsessed yuppie couple, the lonely outdoors man, a rich old man's young wife (along with his short-haired dog trainer) gay couple What makes this movie so funny is the way it portrays these stereotypes in a completely believable way - almost affectionate in many cases. Every ridiculous thing one of the characters does or says - with your dog as an innocent bystander - seems like the kind of behavior you'd really expect to see in a dog show. The biggest laughs come from the commentary of an American-style sportscaster, comparing moments in a dog show to parts of a baseball game, and his English, academic dog, foil. <br /> <br /> The judgments of the geeky husband as his blonde woman finds a surprising number of men from her past is also always good for a laugh, as is the demented behavior of the yuppie couple as the pressure increases, while your dog stays completely trouble-free. <br /> <br /> Worth watching - even if cats are more your purse.
