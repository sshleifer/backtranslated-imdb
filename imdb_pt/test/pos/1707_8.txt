Tia Carrere was the reason I decided to watch this movie, since neither the title nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this movie? which will show me and everyone that a DVD should not be judged by the cover. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** The movie looked like it was passing, not going anywhere for the moment ?? the embarrassment of Paul Faber (Zak Orth) around the girls is almost too shameful to watch, and the fringe of the attractive Kirsten Beck (as Alexondra Lee) being too high school to watch. Where did those really stylish in 1995? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Vicky Mueller (Tia Carrere) and Todd Boomer (Jason London) has been tempting since the beginning of everything! That first meeting on the other side of the lake? Magic. What a nice coincidence they should find again just as he behaved like a complete idiot ("Boomer, with two O's like idiots ??") in front of Alexondra. It really is a shame that we, as a public, knew who Vicky Mueller really was. (Well, the title did it, do not you think?) What really surprised me was the acting. Especially in the scene where Vicky gives Todd a metal version of his alter ego (the character of the dog), in the box of white jewels. Were the actors really able to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss? point of no return for Todd and Vicky. It's really a shame that the film ends with focus (after surpassing Todd's father at Harvard) his union with his friends. Could I imagine a whole new movie? following Vicky to New York? must there be a good university of art over there that Todd could attend? <br /> <br /> However, a film that does exactly what we want Hollywood: entertain us for the duration of the movie. Has anyone else noticed that none of the loves are happy in this movie? Todd's mother is a bit insane (on the phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), her father does not find her attractive (more?) Is Todd's teacher obviously disenchanted with his wife and vice versa? Todd himself enters into a marvelously erotic and daring relationship that, however enjoyable, would be very difficult to maintain (age difference, maturity difference, etc.), and Alexondra and Zak do not unite because Alexondra is not mature enough to deal with a relationship (-> their reactions to the condom, the cheating, the advances of Zak etc. are all very immature and often involve running away), and Zak the poor guy himself ?? is a lot of a best friend / as a brother-guy to even pull Alexondra. <br /> <br /> Mind yourself, good movie though! I gave it an 8/10. Brilliant performance of the actors - that give life to the script.
