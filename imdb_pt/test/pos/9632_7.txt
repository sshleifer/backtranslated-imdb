Man, I think people forgot to watch a movie. Everyone thinks you are a critic. They comment on things the average movie goer does not even know or think about. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie. It was what I was expecting, so I was not disappointed. Steven has a bad reputation for putting his views on his films, but that's also a reason to watch. What's even funnier are people who complain about their movies, say that he is the worst and that we should not watch their movies but watch their movies anyway. All so they can comment on how bad they are. Who is the mannequin? If you do not like his work, do not watch it. Then you will not have to submit to this supposedly painful event. <br /> <br /> Stop comparing movies to other movies and watch a movie individually and you may start liking movies again.
