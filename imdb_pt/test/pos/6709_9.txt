Many people say that the end does not make sense, but it happened. With the dead vampire, the bond with the earth was broken and the ship took off, having caught a lot of life force from hundreds of thousands of souls. Enough to re-energize the hexagonal cells and create new bat creatures. It seems they do not have carnal sex, like vampires of legend. vampire bats from outer space can be ridiculous, but killing them with a shot to force the center below the heart is consistent. All you can ask for is consistency. The viewer has to suspend disbelief, even for the scifi. <br /> <br /> The only problem is having to be a sword or stake, not bullets. This puts on a supernatural touch that does not fit with science fiction. So that's a problem. <br /> <br /> The only major inconsistency I found was killing the male vampires with the sword, but the girl's soul and Carlsen went up to the ship. I assume that the souls of the males also went up on the ship, but they were not shown. <br /> <br /> And all the dead humans? Their forces ("souls") rise to the ship as distinct entities? Is the whole life force merged into one for whatever use the ship deems appropriate? In other words, all human souls that went to the ship could be reincarnated as bat-creatures. <br /> <br /> The basic concept is no more ridiculous than Star Wars "Force" or even reincarnation. <br /> <br /> This movie was exaggerated, the kitchen sink (Dawn of the Dead meets Alien and meets Dracula), but in many ways is profound. It was also a lovely love story. The beginning and the end were ethereal. It all began ("what's happening to me") and ended up as a love story. <br /> <br /> Most of the reviews in the movie are about being bizarre. Bizarre is an art form. As for being ridiculous, everything fits. The concept of plague is far more interesting and subtle than the aliens who have just killed people. Maybe they did not need Patrick Steward's blood to form an image of the girl, but it was a very distant, surreal scene. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the movie is hated is because of the end. But the end fits perfectly with the beginning. People are so caught up in the naked girl that they miss the core of the movie. It's a lover's story, from beginning to end. It starts with Carlsen and the girl on the alien spacecraft and ends the same way. So, that fits perfectly. Most people are obsessed with the hero killing the monster, and this movie does not end that way, and that's exactly why I love it. <br /> <br /> Instead, it has a happy ending, with the two returning to the ship, to be reborn. Much cooler than the hero kills the monster, but that's exactly why he bombed. It was not straightforward horror or even science fiction / horror, but a love story with a beautiful beginning and end. All those souls flickering on the ship. And the crystal room pulsing with new life. <br /> <br /> Most people can not handle a love story that is also Alien meets Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula.
