This movie is breathtaking and mind-boggling. But I think maybe this can only be enjoyed by difficult RPG fun. It's like a game. One problem is that the plot is very much like games and only has many laps. The twists are excessive. Jude Law gives a great performance. I really like him in this movie, just like Jerome in Gattaca and Gigglo Joe in A.I.
