I'm not from educational documentaries, but this one grabs you and does not let go until the end. You will be so fascinated and fascinated by what you are watching that you will forget your home TV watching! This series is available for purchase on DVD and I recommend picking this up! With all the evil and death in this world, this documentary series gives us proof that life is beautiful and worth saving and preserving.
