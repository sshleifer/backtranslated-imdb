I read some reviews of this movie, which was recently released on DVD by Eclectic. Apparently, the opening titles are letterbox, but the rest (most) is full screen. The first release, in 1982 by Planet Video, is completely letterboxed. Although it was a primitive release, he got the right compositions. Later versions had sharper and better image quality, but they were in full screen as the DVD is. Any release of this film should be letterboxed as it significantly enhances the visual experience of the old Planet tape.
