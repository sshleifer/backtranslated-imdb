Martin Donovan's promise to play Jesus was honest enough to make me see the movie. Definitely worth it; intelligent and funny without exaggerating. Poor quality footage was probably an appropriate effect, but it turned out to be a bit shocking, and the ending sounded more like a PBS show than Hartley's. Still, many memorable lines and great moments for me to judge harshly.
