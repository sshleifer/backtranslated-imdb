Camp North Star and his extraordinary adviser Camp, Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray), would certainly like to end a long series of defeats for rival Camp Mohawk, a place where only the rich kids can participate. Meanwhile, we see how Tripper tries his hand in love as he flirts aimlessly with his fellow adviser Roxanne (Kate Lynch) while other adolescent counselors unite and also fall from one side to the other. The film comes to mind at the Camp Olympics, while rivals face competitive sporting competitions with Tripper, almost realizing they are doomed to fail another year. The film also shows the growing bond between Tripper and Rudy (Chris Makepeace of "Vamp" fame), whose father is always away all the time. Rudy does not seem to fit in with the other kids his age and he seems to spend most of the time running in the morning with Tripper or taking his peanuts in Blackjack. The film contains mostly ad-haphazard advisors from teenage camp hacking and joking. <br /> <br /> You have adventurous advisors, total nerd Spaz (Jack Blum) with his etched glasses and bad acne, beak-nosed "Hardware" (Matt Craven) who likes to blow things up, fat boy Fink (Keith Knight), who often fills his face, among others in the film. There's a basketball game where poor Spaz can barely hit the ball against Mohawk, much less shoot with a fine shot, with poor Fink playing with the voluminous balls between his knees, which fly over the back-board. There's a fire camp (with a scary story of Tripper about a hook-up killer) and boys drooling over the lovely ladies. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that sometimes it is hopeless to try to take every laugh it can and occasionally indulges in lapses of sentimentality (like the scenes with a sad Makepeace and Murray), but as much as this recent sight, I I found myself laughing. I'm licked and I can not stop loving it. It's a summer camp movie that simply wants to entertain you. I can not explain, or reinforce enough, the overwhelming joy that flows when I see the hand of Murray, who is sleepy, reach for the covers for the alarm clock that is punching loudly, pronouncing that a summer camp movie is about to begin. Your intercommunicating jokes are especially fun. But, the movie is, let's be honest, a series of comic vignettes with Murray dead-panning endlessly ... not that there's anything wrong with that. The film, however, could not survive without it, could it? Difficult to even think of this film without Murray in the lead. It's a happier time and I think the nostalgia of that summer camp experience is very important because we adults still connect with "meatballs" warmly. And poor Morty (Harvey Atkin), the camp boss who both wants things to run smoothly, and beat Mohawk Camp for a change, is the constant source of Tripper's fun and gangs, since they often play jokes about he ... especially when he's sleeping in his bed! Great enthusiastic cast that seems to be taking as much as we do.
