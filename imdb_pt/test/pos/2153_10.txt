I saw this movie during the Mod & Rockers festival in August. I was so inspired and touched. Harry had an incredible life and one of the best and most distinguished voices ever recorded. For those of you who do not know about Harry Nilsson do a little research and you'll find that Harry probably found his way into his life one way or another - maybe it was his 70's special "The Point" or "Everybody's Speaking" by Midnight Cowboy. For me, it started with "people let me tell about my best friend" - the theme song of "The Courtship of Eddie's Father". Watching this movie, you can really feel the love and admiration of Harry's true friends and colleagues. Do not shed a tear for Harry - he had a ball ... <br /> <br /> Brett
