Having seen The Lost Child a good many times since its release in 1995, and having read the reader's comments (mostly about Jane Tennison's background and the excellent role of Helen Mirren), it seems more than ever that no comment is made. on the glossy role Robert Glenister is playing as Chris Hughes. Even after 10 years, it is still one of the most reliable ways of portraying the complex personality of a child molester, carrying the weight of their own past. Watching the episode for a full hour and a half makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate for this guy, where hatred prevails because of the gravity of your actions. I've seen the brighter roles of my favorite actor, but he never fails to make the biggest impression on me. Helen Mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors at her side. Praise for Robert Glenister!
