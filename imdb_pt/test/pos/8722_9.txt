What an absolutely charming movie. The cast is wonderful and the story is witty and fun. A nice movie experience. Although the plot is somewhat predictable, it does not make the story less pleasant, in fact I did not want it to end. I was always a fan of Ingrid Bergman, and was interested in seeing her in a comedy role. She did not disappoint me, the performance of Ingrid Bergman as Mrs. Dickinson is fun to watch. I loved her interaction with Toni at the music store, just as she did Dancing and doing "the Dentist". She only proved what I already knew, that she is one of the greatest actresses of all time. Goldie Hawn is also delightful to watch. His amusing, kind and gentle Toni is the driving force of the film. You do not even ask why she would be so worried about Finacee's wife that you simply accept that she is just that kind of person who would not be happy unless she knew everyone else was. And Walter Matthau is great as Julian. His actions never create a sense of animosity towards the viewer, in fact, they almost make him more enduring. There was not an unpleasant character in the group. This movie definitely stood the test of time, I watched it last night and I think it's one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. If you are looking for a fun and carefree romantic comedy, look no further.
