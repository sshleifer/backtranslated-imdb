This version of Gulliver's stories is definitely bizarre. The production adds a picture story (which is what is becoming famous) of Gulliver returning to his wife and son. In a vieweing, incredibly long and sometimes unable to keep all the attention, but the odd pictures and diverse cast will keep you looking. Mary Steenburgen does the best work of the cast. Danson seems a bit out of place with his American accent. The whole asylum is terribly disturbing, but it's interesting and keeps Gulliver's travels together. Danson's character really does seem insane, however ... he should have worked on being a bit more believable to everyone, in my opinion. Also confusing is going from the present to the past. Does anyone else think the Yahoos are the ugliest things that ever graced a television screen (or queued for it)? Confusing, sometimes boring, but still enhanced by a good acting, wonderful visual effects and some nice parts. The first of many NBC events films by Robert Halmi, Mr. See for yourself to decide how it goes for you, however I give it to you * * * 1/2 (out of 5 stars).
