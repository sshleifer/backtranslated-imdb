I'm glad I read Sarah Waters's novel first, since I had my own pictures of the characters in my head at the time. The castings for this production, however, were not at all disappointing - in fact, after I got used to Rachael Stirling as Nan, I think Nina Gold did a great job in the casting department. (Keeley Hawes may be more delicious?!) <br /> <br /> The BBC did it again: this is a wonderful production of a very good book, and they did it in style. If you can get your hands on it (VHS, DVD), make sure you get the 181-minute (uncensored) version. It is a wonderful journey, although sometimes a bit rocky, which you will not regret taking.
