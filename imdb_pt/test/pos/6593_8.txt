I used to watch this too at the junior high school in Petersfield Hampshire around 1975. The strangest thing is that once in a while I still think about it (I'm 40). The big question is to go through the whole extension of the series (do not know how many episodes 6 ??) was the identity of the person riding a motorcycle! 'I asked friends in the past about this series and they have no idea what I'm talking about and think it's some kind of weird dream I've had. I never understood until today the educational benefit of this, but I thought it was great at the time, but a little scary. I seem to remember that there used to be some kind of pause in the middle of each episode. I have no idea why. I would love to see you again. I held a short clip through the BBC cult website.
