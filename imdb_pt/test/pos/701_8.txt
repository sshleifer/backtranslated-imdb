I liked this western starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford. It has pretty much everything a westerner should have. There are shootings, action, horse chases. There is a novel angle that is suggested. There is some nice comic relief in the form of Edgar Buchanan, who plays Uncle Willie McLeod, a character who pretends to be an old idiot but is actually aware of all that is happening. Randolph Scott plays the city Sheriff, and Glenn Ford plays Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith, an outlaw hunter who Eventually, I tried to change his ways. I liked the different mix of characters in the movie. I did not find this ever fast, but I never found it annoying either. Even if the film was in 1943, it is colorful. 8/10
