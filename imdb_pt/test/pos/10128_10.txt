I'm not usually a Drama / Feel Good movie type, but once I saw the trailer for "Radio" I could not resist. Not only is this a great movie, but it also has great acting. Cuba Gooding Jr. did an excellent job portraying James Robert Kennedy, also known as "RAdio". Ed Harris also did a fantastic job as Coach Jones. I was pleasantly surprised to see some comedy as well. So for a great story, great performance and a bit of comedy, I give "Radio" a 10 out of 10!
