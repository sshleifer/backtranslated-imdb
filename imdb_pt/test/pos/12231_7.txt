Most Christmas movies have a "redemption" theme, but most are a variation of a very similar storyline. This movie is crazy and has an unusual plot. You may need to stay there in the first half, where events may seem hard to believe for a movie (but not as unbelievable as real life - Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, says he never invented anything in his cartoons - they are all based on actual stories told to him by his fans). The second half begins to fit the plot together. I liked. BTW, one reviewer noted that the idea of ​​someone not having money available is not credible these days from ATMs, but it's perfectly believable if you've lost your wallet - which carries ATM cards anywhere else while on a business trip?
