I recently rented Twister, a movie I had seen several years ago on TV, and it has aged well; I've seen myself laughing loudly over and over again and as strange as all these people are, in the end I cared deeply about them. This is the kind of small movie that's made for a cult audience because, just like Howdy's gossip (well, I guess that's what it is), it's an acquired taste: you need to be attuned to its peculiar wavelength. The production values ​​can be cheaply called cheap and the pace and atmosphere take a while to be solved, but the film has a "visual", especially in some wonderful shots contrasting the dry flatness of the earth with the nouveau-riche opulence of clutch interior of the mansion: Michael Almereyda had a good eye even then. Life with sodapop tycoon Eugene Cleveland (Harry Dean Stanton) and his family (two adult children, a grandchild and a maid) seems so far from life outside that we could be in Gormenghast. Everyone in this movie is wonderful (especially Suzy Amis and Crispin Glover as the genial brothers Maureen and Howdy), inhabiting their roles so comfortably after a while you've just bought the strange premise that somehow survived the tornado and was apparently incapable of happiness, these people are lucky, and still do not know what to do with their luck. There are some truly grandiose scenes: Eugene's sudden confrontations first with his TV girlfriend, actress Virginia (a daring Lois Chiles), then with her children; William S. Burroughs practicing target shooting in the barn and telling a story about a mysterious Jim; Maureen's boyfriend, Chris, proving himself struggling against a branch full of hooded wasps on a tablecloth and napkin and old felt hat; Howdy, Violet, Maureen and Chris, all sitting on the couch (the last three in light and proper summer clothes, the first in a red blazer and black leather rock outfit) looking at pictures of deserts on the huge TV, and contemplating the future (the images were made by Bill Viola, who did the background video installation for the last Nine Inch Nails tour). Crispin Glover is predictably magnificent as Howdy: as always, he remains perfectly in character. Howdy made a cult of his misery and brilliance; he is like Oscar Wilde of Kansas, struggling to live up to his red velvet suit. If he's struggling off the hook, but high on an electric guitar, breaking a whip while wearing a black cowboy outfit, demolishing a room, or even doing simple things like steering or pouring the blender's soup, he's mesmerizing. If you like his work, you'll enjoy it.
