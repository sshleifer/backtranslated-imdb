In fact, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Although I'm just wondering how she ended up being a 'rehab patient' (?) Where Hurley is also trying to reduce his weight (as seen in previous episodes). <br /> <br /> Anyway, last episode is really suspended. The end is not so understandable. I think the writer was hoping that the audience would reach the 3rd season. <br /> <br /> I just hope the next season gives light to the darkest events that have happened. <br /> Do not wait for Season 3 anymore.
