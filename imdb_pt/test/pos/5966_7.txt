THE ASCENT is a very valuable addition to the recent re-launches of the Soviet Union. The director's 1977 film Larisa Shepitko examines the moral ramifications of loyalty and honor in German-occupied Russia during World War II. On foot and in a blizzard, two members of a Soviet party group go out to locate supplies and are captured by Nazi soldiers. The focus of the film is how each man manipulates or internalizes his or her moral alternatives. One chooses dignity and integrity, while the other opts for collaboration with the enemy. However, in the end, he can not accept his selfish decision. The film makes a lot of use of wide and slow pots moving to extreme close-ups, and highlights the spiritual dilemma within the souls of each man. This is not a great movie, but it effectively portrays an intense moral dilemma against the backdrop of a harsh and cold Soviet jungle.
