This movie was very funny with just a little blood. These are two tomb robbers who are doing business as usual when they discover that there are a different clientele they can serve. This changes the direction of the corpses they collect. The film is told by the younger of the two as he explains the subject to a priest before being sent to be beheaded. His partner had already been beheaded. The priest is forced to overturn the last confession and takes the form of a story. There is some animation released that gives you a sense of Tales From the Crypt. In history we find another group of tomb robbers that everyone fears, but at a certain point the younger of the two for execution gets a job, which calms the animosity somewhat between groups. When a woman joins the two men, she goes beyond her limits and puts them in trouble with the dreaded tomb robbers. The story leads to the reunion of the two groups, which led to the arrest of the man who is confessing and the man who has already lost his head.
