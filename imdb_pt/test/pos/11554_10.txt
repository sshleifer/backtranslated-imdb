Pola X is a beautiful adaptation of Pierre de Herman Melville; or ambiguities'. The comments here surprise me, it makes me think about what led to the overwhelmingly negative reaction. <br /> <br /> Shock value is the least attractive thing about this movie - a small detail that has burst out of proportion. The story is of Pierre's fall - and the subsequent destruction of those around him - which is openly demonstrated in its characteristics, behavior, and idiolect. Dialogue and soundtrack differentiate this film from anything I've seen, and transform a fundamentally traditional plot with controversial twists into an unspeakably emotional epic. <br /> <br /> I can not emphasize enough the importance of disregarding everything you've heard about this movie and watching, as I did, with an open mind. I hope you're rewarded the way I did. I felt nervous and nervous around the half hour mark, however, the film is far from frightening in any traditional sense. It will leave you with a thousand thoughts, each one of them both problematic and exciting. I know I'm gushing here, but I feel the need to compensate for the negative perception of this movie. It's the best I've seen all year.
