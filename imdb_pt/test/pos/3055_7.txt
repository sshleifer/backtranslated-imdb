The movie is not as bad as people want to make you believe it is. <br /> <br /> What is the reason so many people hate this movie? Is it because it's the last of Laurel and Hardy together and not the best of them? Or is it because of the lack of regular Laurel and Hardy? Or because it's not made by Hal Roach studios or by 20th Century Fox? <br /> <br /> It is definitely true that this film is not a successful attempt to revive Laurel & Hardy and bring them to the 50s. It is also definitely true that the film is far from being their best, but honestly, the film still entertains well, making this movie also stay away from the worst. Not the most worthy "goodbye" movie imaginable, but a fun and appropriate goodbye, though. Both retired from the movies after completing this film. <br /> <br /> The film still features some great moments of clowning and the chemistry between Laurel and Hardy is obviously still very present. It also makes this movie better than most of his films together from the 1940s. It is a surprise that clownish humor still works just as well as considering the days of comedy slapstick had run out since the 1930s. <br /> The story may not be as much fun as it could have been and it has many partners and characters, with the result that the movie loses its focus on boys sometimes. A shame, because they are still the ones who really carry and make the movie. <br /> <br /> It's sad to see how poorly Stan Laurel was about to make this movie. He really looked sick and old, which he too was clear. He was over 60 years old. But after a surgery he completely recovered and still lived for another 15 years, before dying in 1965, 8 years after his good friend Oliver Hardy. <br /> <br /> A fun, though not perfect, goodbye to boys, Laurel & Hardy and the end of 3 decades of entertaining, funny, quality entertainment, movies that are still being watched and loved by people from all over the world. world. <br /> <br /> 7/10
