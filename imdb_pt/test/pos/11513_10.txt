It's the best movie I've seen in the last 5 years. Certainly, it will be in the same line with masterpieces as The Platoon, Apocalypse Now, The Doors, The Dog's Heart (Russian film). Really, the game of the boy and his parents is so good that you can not even say that they "play". No, they live as if they were happening to them. Note that the smile is there when the main hero agrees to take a walk with them. Hate and love in one piece. And the final scene! <br/> <br/> Actually, I still have the impression of this movie. It is very difficult, even impossible to combine humor and tragedy, but if you succeed (and Frederikson did) the impact would be twice as strong. <br /> <br /> I compared him to "ONE FLEW OVER CUCKOO'S NEST". I also like this movie (and the novel itself is good too), but after the film Frederikson seems simple. (the same difference I noticed after I watched the movie "American History X" and "ROMPER STOMPER" - the latter is deeper). I mean, Milos Forman showed only the material point of view of the problem. You watch, so you say yes, it's a good movie, I like it, I do not like it, and that's it. But "Angels" leave you a broad basis for thinking. There are no bad guys and good guys in the movie. Because each of them has the right to behave the way they do. Like the girlfriend of one of the patients. Of course, she is young and pregnant and it is a problem for her that her husband is in the clinic, but the feelings and emotional experience of his girlfriend are even stronger (the result is her suicide). Why ask him what he did? Are not you crazy to ask? Why not support him, help him, understand him? Finally, it's even funny when these people talk to each other. They say great things! There are many things I would like to say about this movie, but I'm not that good in English. But I'm sure that you, who watched the movie, understand me. <br /> <br /> Good luck! <br /> <br />
