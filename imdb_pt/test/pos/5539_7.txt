If you are looking for a not so serious Mafia movie with a woman as a leader, you are in the right place. Pfieffer acted much better than that. You can see that she has matured beyond this image. <br /> <br /> When I first chose this film, I expected Pfeiffer to be misunderstood, yet she plays her role as mafia wife to the fullest. Nor is it a bad performance by Baldwin. <br /> <br /> If you do not pay attention to hair, you may like this movie. But do not take it too seriously ...
