Many people have a movie that they consider to be their favorite movie. My film will always be John Carpenter's The Thing! The main reason why this movie is a cult movie is perhaps the splatter effects created primarily by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from NY). it's not a big movie because of the effects, it has to do with the story, the atmosphere and of course the acting. I've watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day for the last 10 years), but none had the impact on me like this, not even the big "Das Boot". <br /> <br /> Here is My suggestion to you that likes science fiction and horror movies: Put yourself in the good chair of your house. Make sure you are not interupted by anyone. If you do not have a projector, sit next to your TV and watch this miracle of a movie. Let it absorb you, and you'll see it my way! <br /> <br /> Best viewing time: Late February between 5 and 9 pm.
