I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 and beautiful. What a pleasure to see her dance with George Murphy. The plot was typical for your day, but the dance was really special. I never get tired of watching Fred and Ginger, but Lana Turner in this movie was so fantastic. I always thought of Lana as an actress who used to act more. She should have done more dancing and less of the roles of Madame X and Peyton Place. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dance. Too bad the "Academy" does not give an "Oscar" for dancing.
