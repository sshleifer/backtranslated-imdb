I agree with the posts here that the book is not like the movie. I read the book as a sophomore in high school in Sumter SC. I instantly fell in love with the book and eagerly awaited the release of the miniseries. As much as I liked the film and thought it was very well done, I was disappointed that the film did not accompany the book. I was glad that Orry was not killed like I was in Love and War or N & S II. Having grown up in SC and graduated from the University of SC, I fell in love with the history of the South because of it. mini series and book. I had the honor of meeting John Jakes at a symposium in 1988 at USC. I stayed later and met Mr. Jakes. Unfortunately, I could not ask a question. But to meet him was honor enough. I majored in accounting, but I was my minor in Southern Studies. In addition, I modeled many of my mannerisms after Orry Main. Orry and I are very similar. I feel like I was born 150 years too late. I am a gentleman from the south and very proud of that. <br /> <br /> Well, I fell in love with two women in the movie .... Genie Francis and Wendy Kilbourne. Dude, I got horny for Wendy !!!! I could never find a real version of it. I hope one day too !!!
