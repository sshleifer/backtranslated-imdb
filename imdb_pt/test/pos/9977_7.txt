When I first saw the movie being announced, I thought it would be another Disney movie that almost goes straight to the video. I finally got here and rented it. I thought it was going to be bad because I could not see Shia in any other role than the recently canceled show "Even Stevens." When I called I was ready to turn him off from boredom in about ten minutes. It started a little slow and I could not understand the beginning because the years did not make sense, so they explained it later in the show, so I was relieved to think about it. Everyone and everyone thought it was a good movie and I would recommend it. The cast was top notch and even though I'm not a golf fan, it easily kept my attention with a good plot.
