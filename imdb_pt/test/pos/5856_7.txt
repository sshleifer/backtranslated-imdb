Now I know that Sandra Bullock produced this movie, but she needs to learn that sometimes you need to make certain sacrifices to advance the story ... like not trying to do the whole movie about your character! <br /> <br /> The story is about two high school students (one rich and popular, the other intelligent and antisocial) who formulate a plan to commit murder and follow you by the number ... just to see if they can get away with it. Enter Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case. The boys planted evidence, created alibis, and cleaned themselves up so well that the cops fell for the whole act. But Sandra has the feeling that not everything is as it seems to be. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a great Hitchcock-style thriller, but the movie spends a lot of time getting to know Sandra's character instead. than focusing on the crime itself. You see, something happened in your past that continues to haunt you throughout the movie. And we know all about it ... all about it. It only gets a bit boring after a while, especially when you're right in the middle of an intriguing murder investigation and then have to stop the investigation to hear about what happened to it in the past. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the real winners of this movie. They play their characters convincingly and with the right amount of malice. If the script had spent more time focusing on these characters, and kept the detectives there just to do their jobs, it could have been an immensely fun thriller. The way it is, most of the emotion is lost. They should have cut out all the material with Sandra's character and made a separate TV movie for the Lifetime channel. But I digress. It's still a fun movie, though. I recommend this movie ... but wait for the video / DVD.
