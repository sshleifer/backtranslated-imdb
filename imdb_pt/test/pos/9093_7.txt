The basic premise of the Flatliners is quite simple. Several medical students put themselves at the point of death to find out exactly what the brain does during the fact. It sounds like something a lot of bored students would do for fun, but it forms the basis of some very scary substances. In today's world, where Hollywood has to extract ideas from foreign markets to make a horror movie, Flatliners is one of those rare gems that show that Hollywood can do something different when you try hard enough. <br /> <br /> What separates Flatliners from many films based on this premise that would emerge today is that one does not rebel at being condescending or arrogant. Flatliners recognizes that people go to movies to entertain themselves, not to moralize. In this kind of supernatural suspense, the difference this restraint makes is truly incredible. What's even more incredible is that Julia Roberts appears without being annoying or demonstrating that she can only play Julia Roberts. The theory of obscurity, which artists perform their best work with the smallest public, is in force here. The subplots about what the characters encounter during the loss of virtually everything that makes them alive, and how it comes back to meddle in their present time, is done amazingly well. The moments when the character of William Baldwin finds his personal collection of videotapes coming back to haunt him are especially intriguing. The fact that William Baldwin seems so perfect on paper tells a lot about the script or the direction. I'm not sure which. <br /> <br /> Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, really shines as a leader. You really feel for him as the mystery of what past experience is intruding on the present and why it unfolds. As Kevin Bacon's character will find an old school pier whose life he did the hell out and tell him how sad he is, it becomes clear what the movie is about. We can try to change the past as much as we want, but it is what we do with the present that matters most. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of the Flatliners is how it reaches an atmosphere without the use of expensive, elaborate visual effects. Quite unusual for what is essentially a horror movie, Flatliners did not spend their budget in places they did not need. Much of what we see during the most surreal sequences is a case of professional pretense, simple trick photography or filming. Sometimes the simplest things are the best. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the film, it is as if it were ten minutes shorter. The ending seems more superficial than conclusive, as if someone in the studio asked the director to send the film so he could exhibit it at a certain point in the market. Of course many films were left with sore spots for this very reason, so Flatliners should not have to be different. The one hundred and fifteen minutes we get are highly satisfying, though not overly bright. <br /> <br /> I gave the Flatliners seven in ten. It works well as a date movie or some kind of late night popcorn movie. Also, it's a good reminder that low budget terror shows are not always junk sad.
