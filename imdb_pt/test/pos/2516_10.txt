Legal action - yes, the premise was made - but not this way - that's the trick. Hey guys - SHOCK - it's an X-File. To me - it's cool Scully / Mulder almost have no scenes together - they have to adapt, trust each other's intrinsic sense about what's really going on - and the other's adaptive skills. They read the movements of each other and do the work .... (kind of). <br /> <br /> Ah, yes - very good acting - are these people paid to do this? Or - a slow day, when the convenience store does not call them at work. (ei - Duchovny - where are the donuts of a day? Malcolm - go to school ...)
