The recounting of a classic story is set in the music of Burt Bacharach and the lyrics of Hal David. The actors look like real people in this fairy tale from the outside world meeting with the mystic Shangra it. It's a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose performance reminds me of Red Buttons and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke), who can always take seriousness in his roles. <br /> <br /> The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the eldest High Lama. Who would have known? <br /> <br /> All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this job a keeper for those of us who love people.
