This is possibly one of my favorite movies. It tells the story of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs), who lost her mother still very young, and so was bought by her father. She falls in love with the messenger named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes to the hotel that her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him. <br /> <br /> I thought this was an excellent adaptation of the story with great performances from the entire cast. It has wonderful special effects and the story fits very well and is easy to follow. I think it's a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. I've been watching every time I've been turned on since it came out and I never got tired of it, and that's why I gave it a 10!
