In the early 1980s, I recorded Honky Tonk Cable Freeway. Since then, I have waited, hoping it would be on DVD. Yesterday I found it. It's one of the best humorous studies I've ever seen. The episode of Old Fashioned is invaluable. At this time (04/28/02) only two have reviewed. One hated, the other loved. If you have a DVD player, rent it or buy it as I did.
