Ingrid Bergman (Cleo Dulaine) has never been so pretty. Gary Cooper as "Cleent" is as perfectly cast as a laconic Texan who knows this girl is not good. When the two look at the French market, we know that this game will be full of sparks. When they stroll in their garden in their restored French Quarter house and the theme of love is a dream for all of us romantic. <br /> <br /> The costumes are beautiful; the decor of the setting makes you wish the "Quarter" would be like this. And that Saratoga still had that hotel with the wide balcony, with all the old snoops gossiping. From the novel by Edna Ferbers, the story is of revenge for old mistakes and fights over who ran the railroads in the early days of this industry. <br /> <br /> In the scenes of Saratoga, Florence Bates as a great lady robs all scenes. <br /> <br /> But it's the scene of Cleo confronting her little lawyer. Relatives from New Orleans sent to buy it which is a magical movie moment. After Cleo overcame him in the negotiations, he looks at her with longing and says "I can say - you're very handsome." And Cleo with a happy and wicked smile says "yes, it's not luck". You want to yell "YES" !!! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite romantic movies of all time.
