This is a great family movie that deals with people who like their local interests, mostly dealing with horse racing. Lloyd Bourdelle, (Walter Matthau) is a farmer who also creates quarter horses and has a small son named Casey Bourdelle, who loves horses. Lloyd is able to create an adult horse he calls "Casey's Shadow" after his son and this horse breaks all speed records and is a possible winner of a million dollar race. Sarah Blue (Alexis Smith) is interested in this horse and offers to buy the horse for $ 500.00 dollars, however, this horse receives serious injuries in its legs and Lloyd receives a serious setback that disturbs the whole family. Walter Matthau gave an excellent performance and this is a great movie to watch and enjoy.
