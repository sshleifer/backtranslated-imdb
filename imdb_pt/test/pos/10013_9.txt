I saw this movie at the Rotterdam International Film Festival in 2002. This seemed to be one of the less popular films at the festival, however, as it turned out, even more interesting. <br /> <br /> The story of an actor trying to get along with him and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction is based on real facts. In addition, the characters that are in the movie are the real people who experience this experience again, this time for the movie, which is partially assembled as a play. Besides being good actors, Jia Hongsheng's parents are also real-life actors, the methods used to highlight their relationship with Jia are very effective. <br /> <br /> Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some Chinese Action Films in the late 80's start in the nineties. Later you can see him in great movies like Frozen and Suzhou River. Between these two career paths Jia becomes a drug addict and loses the will to act or do anything productive except to make futile attempts to become a guitar virtuoso. <br /> <br /> I like the way the scenario writer prefers to emphasize his behavior after withdrawal rather than the horror of drugs. We really feel the pain and the struggle that Jia is in. At the same time, we hate him for the way he treats those around him. <br /> <br /> The film draws the viewer to a grueling standard. Jia seems to be trapped, dragging along with her her parents and sister trying to take care of him. Because there are personal 'interviews' with the characters, we feel we are getting to know Jia not only through himself but through others as well. <br /> <br /> The movie has a heavy feeling, but scenes of Jia going by Doing and partying with your friends, brighten the tone. The same goes for the bitter humor at many events throughout the film. The music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after. This is a movie that may not easily attract many people, but for those interested in the most serious and modern Chinese movie, this is a strong recommendation.
