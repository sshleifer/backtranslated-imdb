Like many twilight zone episodes, one of my favorite parts of this was the obvious social comment Serling is making with the story. As was the case with a recent episode, "The Howling Man," I remembered my long suspicion that, for example, if Jesus came to earth to bring his followers to Heaven, he would immediately be judged insane and likely to be thrown. in an asylum. Our main character in this episode encounters a similar problem in trying to convince the Americans of 1860 that he is from the future and that President Lincoln is about to be assassinated. The episode erroneously states that this means that some parts of the past can be changed while others do not, but it is fun to travel at the same time. <br /> <br /> It is true that we do not know if history could be changed by time travel, because time travel has never been realized and unfortunately it will never be. But it seems to me to be logical that if you could physically put yourself in a time of the past, you could physically prevent something from happening, as long as you did not struggle like a lunatic screaming about murders. <br /> <br /> One of the consistently interesting things about time travel movies and TV shows, in my opinion, is the method by which time travel happens. There is really no method here, our main character is having a talk about time travel in an elegant gentlemen's club and then goes out for a dissolution from the early 60's until the mid-1860's, but it does not matter. The twilight zone so far has not impressed me by its complex sets or high production values. Russell Johnson plays the role of time-traveling Peter Corrigan, and upon discovering that he was somehow transported back to the exact day of Lincoln's murder, he gets thrown into prison, but fortunately for him, John Wilkes Booth, for some reason, happened to be walking into the police station and heard the frantic Corrigan desperately trying to describe his own murder. that Booth was planning for that night. <br /> <br /> Booth asks for Corrigan's custody for some psychiatric experimentation, and the cop sees nothing wrong with relinquishing custody of this guy. He had a business card, after all, how bad could it be? <br /> <br /> The program seems to suggest that you can change people's lives by slightly altering events in the past through time travel, and while I am not willing to accept that time travel would include such limitations, it is still a fun episode that really makes you think, which is one of my favorite qualities of the good shows of the twilight zone ...
