Someone says that this anime can be offensive to girls ... not really. Embarrassing situations are funny; The first time I see this series I was in the video store, people around me started to laugh, no matter the age or sex. One teacher said that to ensure someone's attention in a book, the beginning should be fun and the ending should not be obvious just by reading the last page. During the first minutes of the series, the boy is run over by a car, during the last moments of the series, the same car appears. The episodes had a touching and funny ending, especially the latter. I do not regret buying these series.
