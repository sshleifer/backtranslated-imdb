The summary line is the wet dream of some men for the ideal woman ...; o) Seriously, going back to the movie, which has classic cinema written all over the place (pun intended and literally shown in the picture, also as you will see)! <br /> <br /> How could anyone make a silent film in this year and time? It is not completely silent for once (get the music, for example). With great cinematography is the answer. And no wonder it has won awards (as another reviewer claimed) in this area! But it is also sometimes the downfall. Although the images are great, sometimes they go deeper rather than moving on (plot and time). If you can handle it then you will like it even more than I do. I did not tell you anything about the story, but I will never do it because I do not want to ruin anything for you ...
