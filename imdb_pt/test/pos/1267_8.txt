This is a great movie, but the Moment (another great Nolan movie) is so much better. I would recommend that people go see the Moment, and then if they like it, watch this movie. The film is filmed in black and white and I was a little annoyed at first, but once in the movie you understand that black and white is the best way for the film to be seen. It is extremely exciting and reasonably easy to understand, although the way it is done is extremely clever. Plot elements I think are a bit stupid, but the movie is definitely worthy of a second showing. Conculde the film has a clever plot, clever twists, very good acting and given the budget of the film, I have to say that is quite amazing.
