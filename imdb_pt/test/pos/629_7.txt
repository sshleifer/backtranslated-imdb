I liked the acting in that movie. Except for his sister. She reminded me of Janice in Friends. I could never believe she was anything but nasty. My main problems with the film were the anticlimactic end and the execution scene with the sister and the brother-in-law. The guy falling from the car exploding? Maybe if his hand had been ripped off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and hurried him to a hospital, maybe then I could have gone to the end. I think someone needed to die in the execution scene. Especially the brother-in-law. He was so annoying anyway. Or maybe her sister had to accidentally kill the guy who saved the dumb. I might even have bought the brother-in-law killing the hero and the ending being the two sisters being put into snuff films. <br /> <br /> It pays to watch again and, as I always say, it is much easier to be a reviewer than an author.
