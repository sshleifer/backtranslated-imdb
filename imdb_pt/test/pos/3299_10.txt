"Boy Next Door" is a hilarious joke through the male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most feature films can not match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing - this short is a classic from beginning to end. Congratulations to Travis Davis for having fulfilled the role of director and protagonist. He's the funniest nebulae since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back. If you thought all he could do was play "Bull," the bailiff in "Night Court," think again. This jewel of a movie shows the brilliantly funny writing of Stephen Garvey. Remember that name. Forget Charlie Kaufman, Steve Garvey is the true king of the current quirky comedy.
