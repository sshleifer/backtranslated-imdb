This film is almost as good as the first Jackass, but with a little more nasty skits. I would not say this was as good as the first, but came very close. Jackass fans will not be disappointed, but if you did not like the first movie, you're going to hate this one. There are scenes that will be seen as Jackass classics (old suits with "additions," "taxi ride," and many others), and those you'll wish you'd never seen (eating crap, drinking semen, etc ... ) Overall, this movie was a good watch, and I'm glad I saw it. I'm sure this movie will not get the best rating because of the critics who rate it (I sat in the press section and most of the older viewers looked disgusted), but do not let that stop you from liking it.
