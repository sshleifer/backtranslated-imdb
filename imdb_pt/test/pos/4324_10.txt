First of all, I just have to say that I'm a big fan of LOST. Everyone who does the show, I love them. It has everything, really. <br /> <br /> I'm glad they have great people doing it, for example, Jack Bender is the greatest director, well, maybe after J.J. Abrams. And, of course, total credit for Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse. They are geniuses. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the end of Season 2 is definitely one of the best LOST episodes ever !!! Live Together, Die Alone focuses on the story of Desmond David Hume coming to the island, and Henry Ian Cusick is so great playing this character! The creators of the show would have been very stupid had they let the old 'Des die on us. <br /> <br /> So, in LOST, the plane crash survivors were there for 65 days .. 65 days, man. While Rousseau had been there for sixteen years, and the Others had been there for God knows how long. Referring to Jeffrey Lieber, Lindelof & Abrams. Anyway, I hope we get the answers we need in the third season. Can not wait! My vote is nine.
