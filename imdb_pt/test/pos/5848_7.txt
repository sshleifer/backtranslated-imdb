Not bad, but could be a lot better, also seems to follow a basic diet for crime drama. You have Sandra Bullock as the cop who finds it difficult to work with others, you put her with a new partner. There's a closed case, but a cop who works on it anyway, and there are so many color lines in the movie that it makes you want to scream. <br /> <br /> However, if you can look beyond the elements of the formula, there is a good movie hidden beneath. It's exciting and the subplots worked for me. It's worth renting, but it might not be a purchase.
