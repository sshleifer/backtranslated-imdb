This is a fabulous movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a good thread, and is imaginatively told in a series of flashbacks and alternative views. What was deliberate and what was coincidence? Who is in love with whom? <br /> <br /> You have the chance to put yourself in the role of each character in turn (sometimes literally), and this helps to define each character to a satisfactory depth. With a little effort following the twists and turns, you can understand each of the characters; and the main events of the film are refocused from the point of view of different people. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the opportunity if it comes again to your art cinema; looks great on the big screen. <br /> <br /> More than keeping you guessing, the plot revolves in such a way that you just sit and watch what unfolds - I challenge anyone to foretell! <br /> <br /> But you're more likely to need more than one preview - I've seen it in the photos in its original version three times, and it got better each time. <br /> <br /> The performance was very good, with a performance highlight of Romane Bohringer as Alice ripped in three directions by the other three characters in the set. <br /> <br /> A classic. The second best film of the 90s.
