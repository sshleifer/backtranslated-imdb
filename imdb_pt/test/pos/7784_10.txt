Well, this is the best comedy movie I've ever seen ... My two favorite actors did a good job. Salman Khan and Aamir Khan waved. I hope to see Andaz Apna Apna part 2 as well as I heard they will get back with Part 2 as well. I have asked for those who have not yet attended. please buy DVD and watch it will not feel bored. I'm watching this movie 1 times a week. Everyone else was good too in this movie. Paresh Rawal, Shakti and others The music is also good and has cool songs. there is some sense that will kill him laughing Salman khan did very good role and also Aamir. <br /> <br /> so should watch excellent movie work by actors and director ..
