Adam (Eric Jungmann) and unpleasant best friend Harley (Justin Urich) are heading the country for a wedding. Along the way they catch the sexy hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Then, for no reason, a monster truck keeps trying to get them off the road ... and maybe kill them. Who is doing this and why? <br /> <br /> Good horror movie. Your energy is full of flashy direction as you go straight into action. It's also a horror comedy. Most of the humor is childish and REALLY crude, but actually quite funny. Also this movie really accumulates in the gore sometimes - but that's a good thing! The performance is good - Jungmann exaggerates a bit about his role of nerd; Urich is stuck in the desperate role of his best sex-obsessed and sex-obsessed best friend - but take the blame; Brooks is also good in a limited role. <br /> <br /> BUT I could see the "twist" ending long before it happened and the logic completely disappears at the end (especially the rescue). Still, this is a bloody horror movie, sometimes funny and sometimes scary. I give a 7.
