... I do not like this movie and everyone would understand why. The plot is poor, so is the acting. But in my opinion it's better than Halloween 5, although this does not give many surprising moments. Some scenes are very well directed. But those few moments do not give the reason to rent it. I do not despise violence in the movies, but the H6 features extraordinary strong and bloody scenes that do not fit the tradition of Halloween movies. The most shocking aspect of H6 is the lack of voltage. No comparison to the first masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 only gets 4 out of 10 stars from me. If you want, rent it. But do not expect a great experience of terror ... <br /> <br />
