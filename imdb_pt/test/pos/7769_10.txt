Love Jones is one of the best movies I've ever experienced. <br /> <br /> The main element that stands out for me is the fact that it is very well directed. I studied this film in its entirety - watching movies more than once, certain things awakening in you subconsciously - the direction of this film, as well as writing, is chic, modern and ingenious! I'm in love with driving. The scene in which Larenz Tate and Nia Long are riding their motorcycle through northern Chicago at night is amazing. The director of the film deserves awards for his great work. <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a sleek and sexy movie. It highlights the fact that we can be people who love, who have failures, who love to live, learn and be just us without the hype. To be our natural self. <br /> <br /> Poetry is wonderful, but the plot, the dialogue and the scenes really make this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves to be seen. It's a great movie for lovers and friends to sit back and watch, or the hopeless romantic (like me) to sit and enjoy alone on a Friday or Saturday night. Any day of the week where peace, solitude and a bit of entertainment is needed, Love Jones is what I recommend.
