The stuey unger was a legend that played cards. He was quoted in an interview as saying, "Someday, I suppose it's possible that someone is a better No Limit Hold'em player than I am. I doubt it, but that can happen." But, I swear to you, I do not see how someone could play gin better than I. "There's a rummy scene in this movie that is so incredible that you could have played in 'X-Men' as a showcase for the mutant power of a superhero. It's amazing how this man was. <br /> <br /> I have a few minor issues with this movie. As dark as this movie was, Stuey's real life was darker. poker pro Todd Brunson said: "During the last World Series of Poker, Bob Stupak, Mike Sexton and I had a drink and talked about Stu. Mike told us how he could barely speak, had not showered for weeks and how his fingers were burnt black by a crack tube. " in the film, michael imperioli seemed too healthy to be a tough guy in the last years of his life. when stuey won his last wsop he looked like a skeleton, but let's face it, this production was missing as long as the "deniro" to do this kind of transformation. My other problem was that I wish there was more poker playing with real hands and situations. Of course it could have bored the average poker enthusiast, but it would have been good for the hardcores. too bad the movie was not 6 hours or so. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie with 3 non-poker players and they all liked it. Just as you do not have to be a former member of the colonial army to enjoy Gibson's "patriot", you do not have to be a poker player to see that gem. I can not wait for the DVD. (8 out of 10)
