Although I had seen this movie when I was very young, I already knew the story of Wild the Thief-Taker and Shepherd who famously escaped from Newgate prison. <br /> <br /> In addition to the freedom taken at the end, the film follows more or less faithfully the true story. The temptation to bend the facts, which is the hallmark of so many so-called historical films, is resisted in this film and the filmmakers should be commended for it. <br /> <br /> From performances, there is hardly a poor one. performance, and Tommy Steele is ideally cast. Also good Stanley Baker as the thief-Taker and Alan Badel is good as always. <br /> <br /> Because the film sticks to the facts, it becomes suitable to be seen by the whole family.
