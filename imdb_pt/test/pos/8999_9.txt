I think several of America's baseball movies are among the best movies ever made. When this movie was in production and I heard it described as a rugby movie. I read about the Highland team in the papers, but I did not have high expectations for this movie about a sport that did not interest me. <br /> <br /> Last night I saw it "on-demand" and I loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball movies. Ryan Little and the cast and crew did an incredible job. Neil McDonough was especially convincing. As the "bad parent," he showed a good range and a subtle but moving character arc. <br /> <br /> I also liked the actors from the Pacific Islands. I have been fortunate enough to meet many of these excellent people and this film captures their wonderful spirit and culture. A flashback showing how the Islander culture became a key element of the Highland team would have been an excellent addition to the film. <br /> <br /> Some pretty good movies were filmed recently in Utah. It's good to see a quality movie like this from the Beehive State.
