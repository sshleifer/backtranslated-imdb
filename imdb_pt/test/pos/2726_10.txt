From time to time he comes across a film that forces him to rethink about society's reaction to people who differ from his definition of normal. Mitti having suffered at the hands of antisocial elements, left alone to deal with his tragedy, retreats to his idyllic world ... one which, according to her, is the real world. Surreal (the world of Mitthi) overcomes the real (his family). Mitthi, suffering from schizophrenia, forces us to reconsider our priorities about trying to rehabilitate 'patients' like them. Are we right to drag them back into our reality when all we have to offer them is pain and suffering? What right do we have to deprive them of their source of happiness? What right do we have to take their joy when we are unable to help them in their sadness? 15 Park Avenue is one of the best films on social issues ... showing us the need for any patient to need empathy, not sympathy.
