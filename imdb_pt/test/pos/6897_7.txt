(2009) ** 1/2 Dominic Monaghan, Larry Fessenden, Ron Perlman, Angus Scrimm, John Speredakos, Eileen Colgan, Brenda Cooney. Uneven mix of horror and comedy that resembles the 1960s horror films of Roger Corman and Hammer Studios, with two thieving tomb robbers (Monaghan and Fessenden) facing final punishments for the crimes through the guillotine, but not before their stories about the crimes. The occult can be remembered in flashbacks. Fun and some well-sprinkled bumps, but really a bustle of a B movie trying to be a cult classic largely thanks to the cast of veterans of the genre Perlman and Scrimm unsuccessfully; a good rental for Halloween.
