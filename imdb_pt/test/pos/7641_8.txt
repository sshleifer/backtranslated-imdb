I got this movie on the Horror Channel and was quite impressed by the atmosphere and the gothic tone of the movie. As a big fan of all things vampire related, I'm always happy to see a new variation of vampire myths, in this case, a ghoul-like creature residing in another Lovecraftian dimension. The director did a brilliant job of conveying the somber mood of the subject, using the decadent art scene as the background to what is essentially a tale of love that measures time and space - the pure love of friendship as opposed to thirst of blood and life by the vampires of history. The characters of the story are transported to another dimension through a mind-altering substance, where a vampire creature that changes shape seems to grant them the desires of their hearts while draining them of their vital essence. There are some analogies with drug addiction and loss of control, and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle. I enjoyed watching the 2 main male characters in the story, Chris Ivan Cevic and Alex Petrovich, who were very attractive, always a plus in a vampire story for women! The special make-up effects and creature effects were well made, and the design of the vampire-sized set was very effective. All in all, a nice take on vampire myths, and recommended to anyone who likes their vampires with some intelligence and not just action. The only thing left to make it even better would have been a little more eroticism and nudity, as it would fit the plot and themes.
