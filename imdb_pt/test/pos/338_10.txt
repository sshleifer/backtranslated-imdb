The director of Kannathil Muthamittal directed the first Indian film I saw "Dil Se," which led me to buy more than 122 DVDs in Hindi in the course of four months. I can say that I understood the full attraction, I was confused about why the movie stop for "video clips". It was a great movie, I did not know what to do with the dance and the female vocals were a bit strident for my western ears, but somehow I found the AR Rahmen hypnotic score. I bought the soundtrack the next day and then Lagan, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G the following week and, with the exception of "Ichi the killer" some other Korean films, I can not be bothered to watch so much more. A little strange for someone who has just watched a strict diet of Hong Kong, Horror and action / science fiction movies in the last 30 years. <br /> <br /> But I must go back to Kannathil Muthamittal, it is one of Mani Ratman's last efforts and I laugh, I cried, I was totally mad, terrified and above all I did not feel manipulated. The acting was superb, the photography was beautiful, I think you could stop the movie at any time and realize that any donation frame would be worthy of painting. The song fit perfectly into the movie and after the credits <br /> <br />, I wanted to watch it again ... so I did. <br /> <br /> It would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you might lose the pleasure of seeing the events unfold and the characters develop. This is what the great movie is! I stood and cheered in my home theater when it was all over! <br /> <br /> My wife is watching now, and I can not wait for her reaction, I can not expect it to be anything less than mine.
