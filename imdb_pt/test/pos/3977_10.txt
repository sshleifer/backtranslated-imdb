Contrary to what many may believe, this movie is a type of film and attitude "against the system". It's a great picture of the "system" in question and how ridiculous it really is. The funny parts of the movie are funny because they tell the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this film unrealistic is simply denying the self-evident truths about life. And that's learning what you like. That's what college should be about. <br /> <br /> I discovered that a commentary should have at least 10 lines. I think I gave my opinion on the subject. So I now write a few more lines as a filler. I hope you had fun during that time. I encourage you to go see the movie. It's worth your time as long as you follow and immerse yourself in the movie.
