An excellent debut film for the director of Batman Begins, follows a movie about a man who follows other people for the inspiration of characters in stories he writes. A man he follows, he decides to go further and the man ends up being more than he expected. <br /> <br /> Using a cast of non-actors and his uncle, writing driving and producing and doing this completely entirely on their own, with almost no budget and independently produced, this film is much more than you'd expect. <br /> <br /> For those who like Memento and complex twists, turn around, crash and play with time This is definitely a movie for you.
