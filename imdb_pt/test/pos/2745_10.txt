Every Saturday morning at 11 am I watched Superstars. All the biggest events happened on this show at the time. Dare, which aired on Sunday mornings, was decent as well, but all the great things happened on this show. The fighters would do all of their interviews with Mean Gene on a platform next to the live crowd or talk on their own on the screen in front of a background that promotes them. The games were usually squashes, but sometimes you would see two middle callers in the main event. There were also interviews that generally resulted in violence, setting up a dispute. These segments range from Pipers Pit, The Body Shop, The Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, The Brother Love Show, The Funeral Parlor and The Barber Shop. I do not remember any title changing hands at this show. This usually happened on pay-per-views and Saturday Nights Main Event.
