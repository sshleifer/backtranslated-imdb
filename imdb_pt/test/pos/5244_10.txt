A heroic tracker leads a large group of pioneers along THE BIG TRAIL to the west, with Indian attacks, natural disasters and romantic complications that are part of the adventure. As wide and magnificent as his story is, Raoul Walsh's GREAT RAIL is a wonderful movie, as entertaining as it has been for over seven decades. With very good acting and excellent production values, it lives up to its reputation as the first Western epic of the spoken films. John Wayne, removed from obscurity for his first film role, looks incredibly young, but he immediately impresses with the natural charm and masculine authority he brings to the role of the hero; he discreetly dominates the film with the attributes that would someday make him a great star. Marguerite Churchill is attractive as a charming southern belle who slowly warms to the attention of the duke. Comic Dialogue El Brendel is a lot of fun as a Swedish immigrant involved with mule and mother-in-law issues; his appearance in a scene signals laughter to the viewer. Looking and sounding like a human brown bear, Tyrone Power Sr., vast and repulsive, makes a wonderful villain. Slick cardsharp Ian Keith is a sophisticated villain. (His famous physical resemblance to John Gilbert is very apparent here.) Actor Tully Marshall, character in the silent film, is astounding as a cunning mountain man who helps guide the train car. The burly Russ Powell, as a nice fur hunter, puts his vocal talent to make good use of meaningless sounds. Sharp-eyed movie goers will identify Ward Bond as one of the Missouri settlers. <br /> <br /> What will surprise many modern viewers is that THE BIG TRAIL was filmed in an initial big screen process called Grandeur. More than matching his name, the image looks wonderful, with Walsh showing the mastery of new technology. It fills the screen, every part of it, with action. Observe during the scenes of the crowd, as everyone is busy doing the actual work, which greatly increases the likelihood of these sequences. Walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use widescreen. In addition, the film is blessedly free of rear-projection photography that kills so many old movies. It should also be emphasized that it is natural that the soundtrack sounds a bit primitive; The talkies were still in the cradle. That Walsh was able to use a microphone, with most of the scenes being taken outdoors, is more compliment to him. <br /> <br /> THE GREAT TRAIL was not a blockbuster. By 1930, William Haines' comedies were the big moneymakers, and audiences were looking for tickets other than smart westerners. Most of the cast fell into obscurity, including Wayne. It would not be until 1939, when John Ford rescued him at STAGECOACH, that John Wayne's legend would begin in earnest. And despite its grandiose and sweeping vistas, it would take another 25 years before a wide screen was captured by Hollywood, largely as a response to the economic threat of television.
