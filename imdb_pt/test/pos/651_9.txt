I remember watching this movie several times when I was a kid. I loved. Although I did not see it recently, I'm sure I would enjoy the same thing today. It's a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh. The situations with each of the characters were so funny and imaginative! I particularly liked the girl who traveled with the ashes of her mother (who ends up getting on the road after the explosion), the thieves and the nuns. This style of good mood is much forgotten these days. In addition, this movie proved that actor Paul Keenan (Dynasty / Days of Our Lives) had a great start. I recommend to anyone lucky enough to find it at your local video store.
