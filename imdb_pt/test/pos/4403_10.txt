The Coen Brothers really excelled in this wonderful saga of three convicted fugitives. Although it is based on "The Odyssey", the old work of Homer, you do not need to read "The Odyssey" to be able to follow the story. The Coen brothers wove a tapestry of celluloid and aural pleasures! The soundtrack is intrinsic to the film, in fact it is as if the soundtrack were the product and the film was wrapping paper. Each character is wonderfully explored and traces back to the ancient times when the films were rich in character actors whose look in the film adds richness, texture and authenticity. George Clooney is magnificent as Everett Ulysses McGill, who has gray hair, an honest blow, whose pompous language and vocabulary are comical and captivating. The Brother, Where You Are you are easily the best Coen film so far, as well as Clooney's best effort. Clooney is good enough to secure an Oscar nomination for best actor as well as Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of the ill-fated friend Delmar while the film itself deserves a nod to the movie Best.
