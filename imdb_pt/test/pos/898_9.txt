I have a lot of hope in the sequence of Gen-X. Fortunately, my hopes have come true. You have a lot of action, comedy ... silly comedy and surprises. I think the newcomer Edison is really a hit in the movie, but I really think Sam's 'Alien' is stupidly annoying with English. Although the film has some flaws in the robot's graphics and in the silly dialogue, the action always keeps it strong. The action setting is much stronger than the first setting. <br /> <br /> This movie is getting more American, since 60% of the film is in Cantonese English. This movie will not disappoint you. I recommended this to young people who do not mind pure action-filled fun. <br /> <br />
