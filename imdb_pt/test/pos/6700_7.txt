Lifeforce is certainly one of Tobe Hooper's best films. It has great special effects and lots of nudity, so it looks like the typical dream of a horror fan. The film, however, is creative and I think it's because of the screenplay of Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby. Good cinematography and a scary atmosphere make it a solid movie.
