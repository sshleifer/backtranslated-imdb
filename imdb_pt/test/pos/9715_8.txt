The role of economics in the industrialized North American market must always have been theorized in creating engine creation. People and manufacturers such as Mercedes Benz and Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) certainly noticed the North Ameircan market opportunity with the purchase of fuel and the number of cars purchased per family. This type of economic phenomenon triggered the concept of Speed ​​Racer. After the new constitution of Japan, the industrialization of the isolated island nation of Japan should seek an opportunity once again via economic partnerships with its global neighbors. This also helped to spark economic opportunities in the European and North American markets, if not in the global market. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is an avid young rider who, unknowingly, is driven by his demanding father Pops Racer, who has challenged himself all his life to improve the machine in winning races. It was actually Pops Racer that took his first son Rex Racer to the brink of destruction with his strategy of how best to use the technology he developed. As a mature Racer, Rex finally realizes his own inherent values ​​and becomes independent, but still feels compelled to his youngest Speed ​​nuisance. <br /> <br /> The exact relationship of Rex Racer to people like the Inspector are never really clear, but put into drama. Rex ends up being accused of being a kind of agent for a country or organization because of his ability to be in places when there is no other explanation as to how he would know that Speed ​​was in trouble. Or the fact that situations involved some types of illegal activity were their secret knowledge is leveraged against an evil plan. This brings a level of cover and dagger romance to Speed ​​Racer. <br /> <br /> The blend of Innocence Speeds with Trixy, Sprital and Chim Chim brings a level of comic human nature. This concept is a good form of rhetoric to balance themes and plots as they are reproduced from episode to episode. So instead of a detective story the thrill of driving international race cars, cover novel and dagger and comedy of human nature is put into a story, Speed ​​Racer.
