The film invites comparisons with Shakespeare. The Mandarin is beautifully written and spoken, and the plot is intricate and intriguing. Never Gong Li looked better, the glory of China was never better represented on the screen. The balance between the political turmoil and the personal intrigue that Gladiator has suggested, but which never came to be, is here to spare. Simply incredible.
