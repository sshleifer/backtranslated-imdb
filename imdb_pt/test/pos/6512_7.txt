I do not understand why this movie has such a low rating. Totally deserves more! Of course, it's completely ridiculous, but it's what it should be. Do not expect cinematic transcendence from a movie about beauty pageants stranded on a Caribbean island! What you should expect is a great parody of virtually every relevant science fiction, fantasy and block-buster film in the history of cinema, and even references to other spoofers. All completely overdone and sometimes totally unnecessary, but that's exactly what makes this movie stand out. If you like parodies, and you like to say, Leslie Nielsen or Mike Myers, you will love this. I'm sure yes!
