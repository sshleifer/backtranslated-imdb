RKS after the success of GHAYAL began working on this movie which was a comedy The movie was in production 3 years ago and finally released in 1994 but did not work for some reason. Before this movie, DAMINI (93) released and did well <br /> <br /> The movie is a crazy comedy film like most Priyadarshan movies nowadays but it is funny and well treated The movie has a suitable plot unlike the movies of today and makes you laugh more characters became famous , be it Crime master gogo (Shakti Kapoor), Paresh Rawal and others. <br /> <br /> The movie keeps you laughing throughout your runtime, although it is very slapstick and overkill but it is one of the funniest movies <br /> <br /> The RKS direction is very good music is good <br /> <br /> Among the actors Aamir steals the show and delivers his funniest performance, this was his first comedy Salman does well but looks like an amateur in front of Aamir, but does a good job and his chemistry is delicious Karisma is annoying and sounds like a child Raveena is suitable Paresh Rawal is very funny in both roles, Shakti Kapoor is hilarious in her act superior Shehzad Khan (nicknamed by Ajit) is very good and Viju Khote is also funny rest all are good too
