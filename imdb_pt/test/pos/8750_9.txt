What an incredible mini-series. The original TRAFFIK stole me completely from anything else that was attached. Much more engaging than the American remake, the original TRAFFIK features an incredible cast of lesser-known actors from the American public. Juliette Binoche is the best known actress who plays a teenage drug addict daughter of a government official. But it is not the power of the star that carries this movie (although I liked the American version, I felt that the famous Americans in the picture were overshadowed). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I saw the American version before finding the original BBC miniseries. Of course there were no image filters, lush locations and the big stars / directors. However, the dust and dirt of Europe (through the world of drugs) perfectly complement the imminent sense of danger that pervades this whole film. Problems, such as driving drug addicts away by giving them more, poor drug campaigns and the resistance of foreign governments to help destroy their drug growers from within, make TRAFFIK bold, immersive and horrible at the same time. time! <br /> <br /> The truly incredible parts of the movie come from Pakistan. My God, I never knew how bad the problem really was in Europe ... it's all over! For true education about drug problems, in addition to how they affect the human body, you should look at both this and the American version. Each shows a very clear and undeniable fact. These countries, which are leaders in the eyes of the world, have a culture that has led to the death and suffering of many. <br /> <br /> Drugs are worse than war. They work in the shadows, in the dark secrets of any "successful" society.
