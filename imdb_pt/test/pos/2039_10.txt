This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen. The picture of Geena from the hard as nails, 'Charly' / gentle mother 'Sam', was superb and Samuel L Jackson just keeps you laughing all the time with his classic liners. Of course, there were some holes in the real story, but this fast movie keeps you on the tip of your seat until the end. <br /> <br /> I felt Geena was the perfect choice for the role of Sam. / Charly and her versatility as an actress is evident by her role as the mother in the recent movie "Stuart Little." Samuel and Geena were well supported by David Morse, Brian Cox, sweet Yvonne Zima and the newbies, Craig Bierko and Melina Kanakaredes. This film accentuates the growing trend of strong female character and the shift from traditional male / female stereotypes as we see Sam / Charly (Davis) and Mitch (Jackson) moving from one disaster to the next. <br /> <br /> While I and many others love this movie, it's fair to say that there will always be people who do not do it and that's okay - each one, for yours. I highly recommend this movie to fans of action, for their hilarious scenes and quick action.
