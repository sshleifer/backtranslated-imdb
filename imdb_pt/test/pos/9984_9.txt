I was impressed by this movie. I'm one of those people who just takes risks with movies that do not appeal to me sometimes, and I have to say that it was worth it. I mean, Wow! Even my young boys liked the film (5 and 6 at the time), although I'm sure it did not fit into their age group. <br /> <br /> This movie was also clean, which is great more. It's so good to sit in a movie that you enjoy without swearing, violence (except for a very brief scene) or anything else that might be morally objectionable. <br /> <br /> This movie brought you throughout a movie. journey you're so ready to believe because of the great acting. You feel the wide range of emotions portrayed along with the characters. <br /> <br /> I never thought a golf movie would leave me on the edge of my chair, but I could not help but be intensely interested in how this one would turn out. I have nothing to compare since I have not watched golf in reality or in the movie before but everyone has done a great job at keeping pace and captivating emotions here. The score also did wonders; excellent, excellent score. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not think this would be your kind of movie, watch it. You may be pleasantly surprised. I certainly was.
