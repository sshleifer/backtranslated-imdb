I really wanted to see this romantic drama (with a World War II scenario) and now that I have it, all I can say is that it is a true masterpiece of Russian cinema! <br /> <br /> Soviet films are known for their overly zealous propagandist approach, but fortunately it is free of such an emphasis - with firm interest in the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a lively girl condemned by outbreak of the war for which he voluntarily offers himself, but from which he will never return. The girl (a remarkable performance of Tatyana Samojlova) is also loved by the young man's cousin, and when she does not hear from her boyfriend, she gives in to her and marries him. He, however, is an aspiring bitter concert pianist about the war having reduced his chances of success and, knowing also that the girl is still dedicated to the soldier, begins to neglect it. Finally, the news arrives at the girl's death of her beloved, but at the end of the film she has learned to accept it as a sacrifice for her home country and is content to live with her memories of him. <br /> <br /> The film features a really incredible camera job that makes extremely judicious use of screen space and, often adopting control images, tilted and high or low angle, gives great power to the unfolding of emotional drama. Individual sequences are equally impressive - two in particular: the dazzling scene, frantically edited and accelerated, in which the girl rescues an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck; and the young man's untimely death in an unfortunate incident at the front, no doubt one of the best of the kind I've ever seen (with the sun moving away from him, symbolizing the life that's fading from his body as he imagines the wedding day he will never have it!). Also noteworthy, however, is the scene in which the girl goes looking for her parents in her home which was hopelessly devastated during an air raid; as is his violent final rendition to the concert pianist - which she tries to resist repeatedly beating on his face - occurring during a later air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of undulating curtains! <br /> <br /> Disappointingly, the R1 DVD of this excellent movie is a simple case (the RusCiCo edition features some add-ons, but being an export, it tends to be overpriced and difficult to crawl to boot!); Criterion released in conjunction with another Russian war classic, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER (1959) - that my friend at the local DVD rental told me that it's coming ... <br /> <br /> The only other movie I saw of that director the epic ARCTIC THE RED TENT (1969), an international production full of stars based on true events; Given the unmistakable artistic quality of THE CRANES ARE FLYING, I regret to lose now his famous documentary I AM CUBA (1964) several times when I was in Hollywood at the end of last year: in addition to receiving a one-week theatrical season, more than one time on TV accompanied by a feature film "Making Of" !!
