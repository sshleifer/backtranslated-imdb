I was having a horrible day, but this movie got me, and I could not stop until the end ... and I had forgotten about my horrible day. and the end ... by the way ... where's the sequel !!! <br /> <br /> The budget is obviously extremely low ... but ... see what they did with this! it reminds me of a play ... they're basically working with a tent, an "escape pod," some guns, uniforms, camping gear, and a "scanner" thing. this is for props. Maybe that's even a good thing, forcing the acting and writing to have to stand and take their rightful place in the film, like the work centers, rather than how the later thoughts used to have an excuse to do CGI fights (Star Wars). <br /> <br /> CGI is fine. It's not exactly "seamless" ... but it still works. because? because there is not much of that, and what exists is not "taking care" of an army of people trying to put everything they can into the scene. this stimulates the imagination ... it's a relatively simple thing with decent composition (especially the heavy shot of the freighter ... there's a long shot that should be at least ten seconds ... that tracks the entire length of the ship .. must be a science fiction battle sequence footage in the last 10 years, to have an action sequence that lasts longer than 0.75 seconds) and some relation to the story. may seem old or not "state of the art," but it does not look stupid and does not take history. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, except that the characters die too fast. to get to know them. The captain was great, but some of his scenes might have used another take. I was also confused by his character losing his temper and banging on a corpse, I like to think that the captains are calm and controlled ... what was going on in that scene? the other team worried about him losing him at that moment? Did he feel losing control? <br /> <br /> Now, as for the plot, it's mostly good ... why? Why do not you try to explain yourself. That just happens. It's called the 'planet', it's a mystery, got it? No one knows why there is a statue and neither does it. The mysterious cult? The strange scientist with the tattoo? What do you expect to discover in less than 90 minutes? This is not war and peace. And, thank God, it's not a star wars either. Not midichlorians, there are 5 minutes of annoying expository dialogue that has no purpose in history. The characters are stuck, and are only able to discover some basic things ... it's not a Star Trek episode where they discover that it's leonardo davinci or a child as a space walker. It's mysterious and I liked that. I do not know why, maybe I can identify more with these guys, since they do not know what's going on, and neither do I ... they do not talk much scribblings or have magic boxes telling them what's going on. <br /> <br /> Actually, I would say that one of the weakest moments is when the 'traitor' connects the crew, and tries to 'explain' the reason for the planet, the cult, etc. This coincidentally has some of the weaker dialogues, imho, throughout the movie, and stops the flow and some of the characters seem unnatural in that scene. <br /> <br /> OK, sometimes I felt it was a bit mysterious, though. Like, why the guy was fried through his eyes with lightning? That was weird. Just weird. The end of the 'hamlet' ... again I wish I had known some of these characters better. And would it have been so difficult to have a 30 second rescue scene in the end? This is not a serial, it was a movie and we like to close movies, even though they may have a sequel. Imagine Hamlet without 'angel throws sing you for your rest' <br /> <br /> Anyway. What can I say. That was worth the dollar I paid on the 'red box' machine in the supermarket. It was also, imho, a better story than the starwars parts 1 2 or 3. As I said, this sucked me in, wondering what was going on, and I could not stop watching until the end.
