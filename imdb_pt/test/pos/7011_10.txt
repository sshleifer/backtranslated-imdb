It's funny how time went by and I've never seen this movie ... until last week when I was like a spell. I saw it twice a week and still it was not enough. It's a great movie and I'll love to see it again. The story is great and really thrilled me. I would love to live such a story. The actors are great, the music too and you can dream about your own love story. I just hope one day I will find the opportunity to learn how to dance like Johnny and Baby. I feel that dance connects people and unites them. I think people should learn to dance ... it helps a lot, especially in a relationship. It's great to feel the dance in your blood and in your body.
