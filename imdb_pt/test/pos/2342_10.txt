I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was amazed by it. Made in a micro budget, this black and white digital film is much more a European film and achieves brilliantly, despite the limitations of the DV. The film works because it's in the indie tradition - dealing with complex issues, but moving and relieved by touches of low-key humor. One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other realistic films from the UK, with ordinary people working portrayed as hopeless victims or comic stereotypes. The performances are strong, particularly Maureen Carr as the mother, Trise. I understand that the movie was recently released on DVD and I would definitely recommend it. The rating on this site is misleading, which is why I gave it a high note because filmmaker May Miles Thomas obviously put his heart and soul into it and deserves more than 2.8 for his incredible achievement.
