Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives her life through the operatic "A Reason to Love" as a way to escape from her sloppy husband and monotonous life. After a shocking incident involving two murderers (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), Betty goes into shock and travels to LA, believing she is destined to marry the main character of the show (Greg Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty is a rare thing, a lesser known film with a cast of stars and a cute plot of Rom-Com, which surprises with her great script and acting. In fact, such a plot makes a question the R rating, but it's alright sure. The shocking incident that drives Betty to the limit is a little too much compared to the light and entertaining comedy that is to come and looks something out of a different movie but at the same time it is necessary to show Betty's transformation in the film. While working with Betty on her journey, director Neil LaBute works with an extraordinary magic that makes the film unique and well above its standard comedy of mistakes. An example of this would be Betty's first encounter with her passion. She pours her heart out to him and he plays along, thinking she's auditioning for a part in the show. Even when we are aware of the ridiculous nature of Betty's ramblings, the music increases as she speaks, giving us the audience, Betty's emotional perspective. We almost believe what she's saying, but we understand that her mind is fractured. While other filmmakers tried to accentuate the ridicule of the situation to get every possible piece of comedy out of the scene, LaBute is sensitive to its main character and treats it with the greatest sympathy and understanding. <br /> <br /> Play between the successful men played by Freeman and Rock is invaluable, the excellent script distributing smart line after smart line for them to riff off. Freeman in particular is excellent as ever, pacing from side to side as his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his own ideal of Betty without even knowing who she is or what has happened to her. Aaron Eckhart again shows versatility in the ungrateful role of Betty's non-good husband and he is almost unrecognizable. The other revelation here is Kinnear, whose portrait of the soap star is not too overcooked. There is a tendency to put the bastard clich√© as dense as possible, and Kinnear resists, instead imbues him with a pompous but restrained self-esteem, though he is simply a soap star. <br /> <br /> The novel is performed so well, it could almost exist. LaBute and co banged the nail on the head with this and a good thing too. If the novel had been too satirical, much of the film would not have worked. To make a parody of "Days of Our Lives," as seen in Friends, would have been the wrong move for this movie. The dedication to detail is worth it, as the style and feel of the novel begins to become more and more of Betty's reality, while maintaining the overall comic aspect of the genre, unintentionally. The scenes on the set look real, unlike some movies in which the atmosphere seems so fabricated, you wonder why people who do it for a living can not get it right. <br /> <br /> The perfect resolution of the final act, though somewhat predictable, is totally satisfactory overall. It's a shame that after LaBute directed this wonderful film, the mainstream came calling him to direct the abysmal remake of The Wicker Man, a good example of a man so totally above the material given to him. Unfortunately, you can not absolve him of all responsibility. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Nurse Betty yet, it's something to discover. If you have it, it's worth a new visit. There is a charm for Nurse Betty that is contagious, even if it does not leave you thinking much later. A hidden gem, however.
