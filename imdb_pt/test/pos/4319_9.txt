"Live Together, Die Alone" is divided into three main lines, and each one alone would be enough for a great episode. So when you put them all together, you have a great episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond), who only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his story is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the island's past and the Swan station itself and honestly moving. Desmond and Penny seem magically connected with each other, even when they are at opposite ends of the world, and both characters are beautifully represented (it's hard not to cry when Desmond reads Penny's letter). The action inside the hatch is tense, since Locke is determined not to let the button be pushed again, convinced that it was all just a psychological experiment, Desmond gradually realizes the consequences of that decision, and Eko is locked out and tries desperately to go back inside. The melting of the clock and the "I was wrong" of Locke are unforgettable moments. External action has Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley captured by Others due to Michael's betrayal (after they discover an intriguing discovery linked to the Pearl), and the return of "Henry Gale" as the leader of the Others. Even the less important plot, Sayid, Jin and Sun sailing to the beach where the Others are supposedly camping, contains one of the show's greatest mythological mysteries, the giant statue that is almost totally absent except for a four-toed foot. In short: emotion + story + mythology + adventure + suspense + the threat of annihilation + a ray of hope = a classic episode of LOST. *** 1/2 of 4.
