Proudly and defiantly, Perks (Mr B. Cribbins), a working class worker, is finally conquered by the upper-middle class family, who are in luck. Father (Mr. I.Cuthbertson) imprisoned for treason - for whom the penalty was death in those days, lest he be forgotten), mother (the very beautiful Miss Sheridan) brave and ingenious, loyal and loving and - especially - older daughter (Miss J. Aggter) staggering on the brink of adolescence - hurt and confused about her father's fate. Mr. Perks, like many of his time workers, will have nothing to do with anything he considers "charity" and it is a key moment in the film when he finally accepts that the birthday presents he received from his children did not compromise his Principles. Although the lovely Miss Agutter has received all the praise, it is Mr. Cribbins and Miss Sheridan, whose performances dominate "The Railway Children". They both know how Edwardian society works on opposite sides of the spectrum, but there is mutual respect and understanding between them. . But this is basically a film about family. At a time when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and rescue her and be considered as "socially inept" rather than unable to live in a decent society, and when two " "can beat and kick a baby to death without being charged with murder," family "can be seen as an old-fashioned, elitist, racist and even homophobic concept, but a century ago it was the glue that kept society together in all Ms. Cribbins Miss Sheridan's families are archetypical for the time. Strong and loving, united against external influences, integral units with a ridiculous moral certainty in the 21st century. What appears to be a monotonous and boring political deal is transformed by Mr. Lionel Jeffries into a delightful hymn to hope, faith, optimism, and courage. That all these attributes have already been considered the norm and are now often object of contempt and cynicism is a reflection on our society and not on that of Miss Nesbit. No one with more than a fleeting concern for the human condition can fail to be considerably moved by this perfect movie.
