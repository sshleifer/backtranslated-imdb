I usually do not like movies with / about aliens, but K-PAX is different. The actors are great in the movie - especially Kevin Spacey played his breathtaking character! The movie never falls to a lower level - the suspense is always in the movie and you absolutely want to know how it ends, what about Prot ... You have to think long after the movie about the movie because there are some open questions. .. Robert Porter Prot or is Prot just using Robert Porter's body as a means of transportation. How can he see ultraviolet light and how can he know much about astrology? But everyone can make their own end and can decide on what he wants to believe. Very good movie with a great Kevin Spacey!
