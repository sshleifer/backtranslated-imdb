After two brief scenes that at first seem unrelated to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired beauty, obviously rich, in the back of a limo. Your driver stops at a strange location on Mulholland Drive which is a two lane road, full of trees and mansions overlooking Los Angeles. Just as his driver and another man in the passenger seat turned to kill her, two drag racing cars from the opposite direction entered the limo. Only the dark haired woman survives. She descends the slope to Sunset Boulevard and hides in a woman's apartment on vacation. Soon after, Betty (Naomi Watts), the wife's niece on vacation, appears in the apartment and finds the dark-haired woman, who now has amnesia. The main part of the first part of the movie is Betty and the dark-haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a weird key in her purse. This is interspersed with strangely surrealist threads about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional incursions into a land of vandals and prostitutes. <br /> <br /> The above text may sound a bit complicated and disjointed, but it is not half that. The film is constructed so that meaning is always open to interpretation. It is basically guaranteed that you will not understand this movie and you will not have much confidence when you get your own interpretation the first time. Even if you have a lot of experience with movies that think like - like Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), The I Inside (2003) and The Butterfly Effect (2004) - you may not understand this second preview, too. The studio was aware of this in that they had director David Lynch writing "10 tracks to unlock this thriller" and put it in the back of the chapter insert on the DVD. Being Lynch of a particular disposition, these clues are almost as enigmatic as the film itself. It does not help when we try to discover in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex. It takes a long time to figure out which parts should be "real" and there is a complex pooling of flashbacks in some sections, with only contextual clues that are flashbacks. <br /> <br /> But is the movie worth watching, or is it worth trying to figure out? That depends on your taste, obviously. On a surface level, the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism, although it tends to seem a bit slow and overly disjointed for some viewers. But these qualities and many other surreal aspects of the film are typical of Lynch. An exquisite moment of Lynch is the old couple at first giggling bizarrely as if they were alien people trying to put up a front. If you are familiar with this style and like it, you will find much to love here, although in many ways, Mulholland Drive is rather discreet for Lynch. It is also worth noting for viewers who will be primarily interested in him or who enjoy as much as other aspects, that Mulholland Drive has a rather steaming lesbian scene. It is not free, although I do not have problems with gratuity, but rather an important hinge in the film. <br /> <br /> Like all Lynch movies, it's easy to be fascinated with its unique approach to every aspect of cinema. art and its attention to detail. Any serious film student (including "armchair students" / "moviegoers") should study Mulholland Drive; many will love it. Lynch does not miss anything unmanipulated. It includes brilliant color schemes (such as infinity of reds and roses) with important symbolism. He makes unusual use of sound, like the telephone ringing in the score section that follows him (when Betty arrives at the airport for the first time). He directs his actors to deliver their speeches in an infinity of bizarre forms, such as their peculiar pauses. He lets his strange and surprising sense of humor penetrate, like the name "Winkie's", and the sign "Hot Dogs - Made for Pinks", which provides a clue to some of the symbolism of color. <br /> <br /> Lynch's attention to detail in production design provides important and subtle clues throughout the film to help unravel the meaning. It is interesting to note that Lynch apparently requires DVD programming to be uncommon - there are no chapters on the disc; you must watch the movie in real time or advance or rewind to return to specific points. <br /> <br /> If surrealism and the veiled meaning of the film are appealing to you, or if you simply like "jigsaw puzzles," it's worth noting Mulholland Drive for that. There is a widely accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad and widespread level. I will not recount the standard interpretation here - it's worth researching, but only after seeing the movie a few times and having come to your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs were written about the film and interpretations; there are even sites dedicated to it. <br /> <br /> For my money though I generally like Lynch and find many interesting things about Mulholland Drive, it's not quite 10 for me, at least not yet (I have the feeling that my score still can up in subsequent views). For me though, the "twist" aspect of the film is much better in other works such as The I Inside and The Butterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive is more appealing to me for its surreal surface touches, but the plot does not take them as well as some of Lynch's other films. <br /> <br /> Still, Mulholland Drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd. If you are serious about movies and you do not mind having to think about what you watch (as if those two do not necessarily coincide), you should not miss this one.
