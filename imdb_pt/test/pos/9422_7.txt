Starting in 1942, the character of Sherlock Holmes, as portrayed by Basil Rathbone, was set in then-modern Britain. Many Holmes purists praised the first two entries in the series (produced by FOX), but rejected the following 12 traits. I at least have never been an avid reader and therefore appreciate these movies as they are without any initial bias. In fact, the WWII scenario for this entry poses as a part of the period with British propaganda evident throughout the film. The execution of modern Holmes is treated with much more care than the previous entry (Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror) and the rates are much better for two reasons. First, Roy William Neil is on hand to direct (and would be for the rest of the series), and second, although Holmes is confronted with the Nazis, the inclusion of Professor Moriarty makes it look like another battle of intellect between two rivals. . Lionel Atwill's performance has been criticized by many as being far less than that of George Zucco and Henry Daniel, but I feel it is more the script than the interpretation of the characters. Especially after seeing that Atwill was very capable of being much more diverse and enthusiastic in other roles of terror. Basil Rathbone, on the other hand, is exceptional in this entry. He seems to be amusing himself in the role of Holmes, but for this I blame writing. For example: Holmes's introduction to the Voice of Terror tries hard to immediately establish how magnificently intelligent Holmes is as soon as he is on the screen, while this film shows Holmes's brilliant deductions but also his shortcomings. Even at the climax, Holmes initially has the upper hand, only to later have his blood slowly drained from his body. Now there are some flaws in this movie that I thought I could point to. First the opening; Are not Germans too easily deceived? Maybe it's just me, but the book seller just walks into the bar, says it will make Tobel not only answer his door after weeks of hiding, but allow him to go in and walk with him? What!? Secondly, Tobel certainly seems to put everyone around him in danger. Leaving the secret parts of the bomb with genius scientists. Leaving note with your fianc√©. Like what was he thinking? He was risking them all. I thought he was an excellent scientist trying to save England? And it's not the whole concept of "using it before you use it on us" a little hard. Obvious propaganda. Third, how in the name of God should Holmes fit into the bottom of that chest? It's really small! In fact, the whole execution of Holmes, in finding Moriarty in the ex-offender's guise, really does not explain very well. I have seen this movie well over fifty times and there are still parts like this that I think are run in a very confusing way. Fourth, okay, so Holmes finds out that the first three scientists are dead, so immediately assume that Moriarty could not know the name of the fourth man because he was not yet dead. Well, if Holmes did not know the name, then how could he assume that? The guy might as well lie face down on a lake. Lucky guess. Fifth, again with the confusion. When Holmes is supposed to be dying on Moriarty's operating table, how can he recover so quickly? He sure as hell was acting like he missed a few drops of blood, but not enough to stop him from saving the day. Now, despite these flaws, this is a very fun movie. The disguises are well made, the mystery of the dancers is well done (especially the consecutive scenes of Holmes and Moriarty, each imagining they were further analyzing them) and Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade is always an advantage. And as a final note, the interrogation scene still bothers me, I always found that this was one of the most well-done sequences in the entire film. Overall, this movie has a special place with me, which is what solidified my Rathbone as an obsession for Holmes. One classic. 7/10
