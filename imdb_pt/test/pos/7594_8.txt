There are worse ways to spend a night than watching this movie, although it's a bit predictable. Drew Barrymore does a pretty good job of being the nerd pioneer in this movie - excellent casting choice. What I found a little hard to believe is that the popular girls finally accept it - in my experience that the crowd has a bigger memory than that, and how AWFUL Drew's character was (ostrich feathers?) school year would have kept them from miles away regardless of the rumors that his brother was talking about. (And "Kole Slaw Food" really makes it so popular? I doubt it). As much as hoping Drew's character would make a lot of reporters - well, I would have hoped she could have a story long before the prom. A bit artificial. Having said all that, it was a fluffy piece that will be fun as long as you do not expect too much.
