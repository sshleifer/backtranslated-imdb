This movie is a good start for beginners who have never watched a 'Silent Movie' and for those who believe that quality cinema began with the efforts of their generations. They are doing a disservice to themselves, not expanding their horizons. Silent Film is an art form of acting in pantomime that is different from sound film and stage, it can stand on its own merits. <br /> <br /> THE BELOVED ROGUE (1927) United Artists is a fictional story of the relationship between the French poet Fran√ßois Villon and King Louis XI. Through 'Villons' nudging 'King Louis' will defeat his enemy 'Duke of Burgundy' minimize the feudal system and establish the king as head of state and the beginnings of modern France. <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional, led by JOHN BARRYMORE (yes, Drew's Grand Father). For those who only remember him for the decadent actor 'Larry Renault' in The Dinner at Eight (1933) or Ham in Invisible Women (1940), this will be a revelation. Fit, trim with the 'Great Profile' still in evidence, it commands the screen. Co-starring in his first American film is CONRAD VEIDT with his interpretation of 'cadaverous spider' from 'Louis XI'. This is a duel of titans in action, each not giving the other an inch. On a trivia note is Character Actor and Dwarf ROSSITTO ANGELO in his first film, his last, MAD MAX BEUND THUNDERDOME (1985). There are other character actors that would continue in the sound that are easily captured. <br /> <br /> United Artists spared no expense in this beautiful production supervised by WILLIAM CAMERON MENZIES. Costumes, props and ensembles are well made and not exaggerated as in DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS productions. There is a touch of reality here. The DVD copy we watched from 'Delta Entertainment' came from a good master. Although not "restored," the musical soundtrack was clear and the impression only suffered from black spots (dirt) and neglect. The only big damage at the end of the last roll of water. 'Kino' also has an edition that can be of better quality as they make great restorations in your prints. Better check with them. In our opinion, this is a "must have", especially if you do not have "silences" in your collection. This is a good place to start.
