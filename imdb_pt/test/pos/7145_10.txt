This version did not excite me as deeply as the later Hollywood version starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. While beautifully filmed and superbly represented, the BBC version was full of dialogue that conveyed information that I found fascinating. It gave me a detailed glimpse of the intellectual, theological, and moral considerations that motivated C. Lewis. It was therefore more interesting and exhilarating than the Hollywood version, but not so visually impressive or viscerally affecting. Still, although I have not left a lot of Kleenex soaked in the theater, I used one, and at frequent intervals. I liked this movie as much as the Hollywood version and was thankful for the increased understanding I got.
