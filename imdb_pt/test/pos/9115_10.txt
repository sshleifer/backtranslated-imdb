If you're like me and bought Tenacious D's new album the day you left, and entered the movie knowing all the lyrics of every song ... then you'll certainly enjoy this movie. Yes, I'm biased as a big fan of Tenacious D, but I really enjoyed this movie that made me laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty much everything I expected. Comic genius supported by great compositions and great participations of Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. I particularly enjoyed the part of Tim Robbins. <br /> <br /> If, however, you are unfamiliar with the Tenacious D HBO series and the fantastic debut album, then this may not have the same comic impact on you. I still recommend you go and watch this because it is still worth every penny of the admission price and will make you smile even if you are not in points all the time.
