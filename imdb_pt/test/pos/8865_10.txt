I'm ashamed to say that, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this movie was only a year ago. After seeing it, I left immediately and bought the edition of DVD collectors and watched several times since. <br /> <br /> The film is fantastic on many levels. It functions as a monster type movie or action, as a horror / science fiction and also as a very intriguing look at the human psyche. The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust, and fear borrowed not only from Carpenter's direction (which is impressive) but also from the incredible cast performance in general. Kurt Russell (obviously) is spectacularly discreet in MacReady's lead role, and as a direct result, he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "every American hero." All other cast members carry their roles in style, and the end result is an intensely compelling atmosphere and a truly fantastic film.
