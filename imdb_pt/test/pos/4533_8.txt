I think every critic who criticized "Tommy Boy" when it was released in 1995 should come back and watch and know it's not a bad movie. All critics criticized the films of Chris Farley and David Spade. Yes "Coneheads" was funny, but sort of had a premise of a joke and "Black Sheep" I agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made. But "Tommy Boy" does not fit into the category of "Coneheads", which could have been a little funnier and "Black Sheep", which is a piece of gut. It's a lot of fun and fun. I agree with critics that Chris Farley was not John Belushi or John Candy as he claimed to have idolized these guys and these guys had a genius for comedy but Chris Farley was very funny and I wish he was around to prove to critics that Yes, he was not John Belushi, or John Candy, but he was very funny. The scenes between Farley and Spade as nemesis are hilarious and the premise is also entertaining. It's very sad that Chris Farley is no longer here to make us laugh, but we have movies like "Tommy Boy" to remember how funny he really was. "Tommy Boy" is one of the best comedies of the 1990s.
