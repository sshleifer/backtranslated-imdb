I got this movie as one of five for five dollars from a local store, and it was a very pleasant surprise. It's a collection of four interrelated tales built around four kids who just had a car accident and are waiting for someone to pick them up. They tell each other stories to kill time, and occasionally they are surprised by flashing lights and funny sounds that come together in an end of O. Henry that made me happy. A real find. Blood (and plenty), breasts and crossbows all around very well ... Jacinda Barrett is worth the price of admission alone. This is a keeper - Jim Bob says check it. <br /> <br /> Strangely, "Pumpkinhead" was one of our five options too, and IMDB recommends that, for those who like "Campfire Tales." I'll follow up as soon as I have the chance to sit and watch it. Joyeux Samhain!
