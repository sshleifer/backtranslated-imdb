This show was not only a great human drama, but portrayed racism in this country in a crude way, very true to life. When a show can be so witty and fun and at the same time so poignant and educational at one and the same time, it is television in its highest form. The acting was phenomenal. The writing was exceptional. Not only has the program depicted racial relations in a direct way that seems incomparable with any other television series, but its ability to describe this subject as it existed in the 1960s, alongside how it exists at the beginning of the 21st century, powerfully demonstrates the ways we have changed and, unfortunately, the many other ways we do not have.
