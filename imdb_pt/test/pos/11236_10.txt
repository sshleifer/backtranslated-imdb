Keys to the VIP, an original series from the Canadian Comedy Network (comedynetwork.ca), had great success with this fun and inspiring game of video games. This show is presented by four funny and beautiful guys who judge others in their 'game' (ability to pick up women). Each episode features two guys facing various pick-up games. There are three different sections and the winner marks one night as a VIP in an exclusive nightclub in Toronto. <br /> <br /> Being a guy, of course I find this show hilarious. We all know that it is difficult to confront women and observing these guys naturally arouses the curiosity of men. The guys who compete in this show may even give you some tips - if you pay attention.
