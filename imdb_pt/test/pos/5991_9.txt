This movie is a gem difficult to find! It's the story of Juliette, a perfectly clean housekeeper who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company, and Romuald, the president of the same. He does not take notice of her, he takes no notice of anyone until several conspiracies to wrench his company away from him, all beaten at the same time. He's lost, no one to turn to, and no one to trust when he discovers Juliette. Like the maid, no one pays attention to her, so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to understand and use to help her helpless and unlucky boss. The complications are wild; she's not as common as she looks with five children of five different ex-husbands who are still madly in love with her, and he's not as insightful as he thinks he is. This movie does not follow a predictable path and that's what keeps you watching. The acting is superb and there are some very exciting moments along the way as well. The working class is smarter than those above them, in much the same way that "Gosford Park" showed that the top layer is not all broken to be mentally. I highly recommend this movie. Look! 9/10
