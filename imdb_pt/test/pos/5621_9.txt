David Lynch recorded his first film, 'Erasurehead', over several years, adding new scenes each time he managed to raise a little more money. Kevin Smith made 'Clerks' at work while working as a clerk, and Robert Rodriguez boasted that 'From Dusk Till Dawn' cost exactly $ 30,000. But $ 30,000 is still a lot of money to raise if you work as a janitor in a graveyard. And if an aspiring filmmaker not only had such a job, but also had all the ambition of such luminaries, and all of Smith's mannerism, but absolutely no talent? Such a figure is Mark Borchardt, the theme of this hilarious documentary that chronicles his attempt to make a couple of films over many years. Borchardt combines his lunatic dreams with flights of depression and a fatal inability to close the day; It is perceived that he almost prefers the incessant work of seeking an impossible perfection for accommodation with the reality that he is simply (based on the evidence presented in "American Movie") not very good. And like a modern Ed Wood, he engages with an epic throng of losing comrades, his genuine affection for his greatest redeeming feature. The collection includes his parents at war, his best friends (one criminal, the other a retired drug addict), his own unhappy children and, above all, his old Uncle Bill. Bill may live in a trailer park and have almost given up on life, but he owns a small fortune ($ 280,000 to be exact) and the poignant but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men is at the heart of the film. . Borchardt manages to recruit some actors to act (next to himself, of course), but overall he is totally dependent on friends and family to complete his work (even Bill has a role in the camera). On British TV, the BBC brilliantly booked a consecutive 'American Movie' screening of 'Lost in La Mancha', the story of Terry Gilliam's ill-fated attempt to film 'Don Quixote'. In that film, he was impressed by the sheer amount of professionalism on display (inadequate as it was for the task at hand), and how difficult it is even for experts with millions to spend making a movie; while Borschadt is not only a poor, but also a clown who can not even pronounce the name of his own work ('Coven') properly. Ultimately, Borschadt is human enough for you to want him to succeed, but terrible enough for the viewer to still be able to laugh at his failures. If this movie were fiction, you would dismiss it as unbelievable; but, as it is, it's one of the funniest documentaries you'll probably see.
