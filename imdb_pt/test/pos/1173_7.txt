with two old friends. <br /> <br /> I've always liked Lemmon's and Mathaeu's films so much, and of course their efforts are always worth watching, and often hilarious. <br /> <br /> I personally consider this movie as in the hilarious category, it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of both main actors and romantic comedy style plots in the 60s. <br /> <br /> Brent Spiner can actually steal the show in terms of laughter, like the arrogant and tyrannical cruise director. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven proves that older women can remain hugely attractive.
