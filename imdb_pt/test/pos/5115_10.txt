This movie brings so many memories to me! I was very young when I left, but I remember the first time I saw it! My father and I always watched "Ernest Movies" together. We had not seen any of them for several years and I found some of them very cheap. We watched them and we could not stop laughing. I love all "Ernest Movies", but this is my favorite. <br /> <br /> Spoiler part! <br /> <br /> The part that I remember most is the part of the "magnet". My dad still plays the electric chair scene! <br /> <br /> End of the spoiler! <br /> <br /> This is a very corny movie ... but great! It's perfect for families (it's not like a lot of garbage out there), but at the same time adults can laugh too! If you like physical humor (such as facial expressions and the way people move) then this is the movie for you!
