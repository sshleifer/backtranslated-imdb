For those who do not know Paddy Chayefsky, this is a very good introduction. While Chayefsky deals with the reality behind the myths of many things including medicine, this work is surprisingly prophetic in the way medicine is going today, two decades after the film was made and more than a decade after his death. In addition, some insights into Chayefsky's life-view are generally "inserted" in the film as well. The 20th century may turn out to be the first and last century of the United States in World History. If the contribution to the arts by the United States was in the "film" dimension, this is an excellent example of this art.
