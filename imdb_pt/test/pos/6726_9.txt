It's good to see that I'm not the only person who remembers this great movie. I have fond memories of this movie - it seems to remember vaguely when I was about 8 years old and watching children's TV shows after school (Broom Cupboard, anyone?). This was the first and last movie to scare me - and the images of the boy surrounded by fog on a hill will stay with me forever! Like most films of this era, it has a happy ending - aimed at children, but with a definite ability to capture the attention of adults. The beautiful landscape of Cornwall really sets the film to feel isolated - and the "ghostly" scenes are simple but very, very effective! I would love to try to find this movie again - see if it still comes home!
