I do not understand where these bad comments are coming from. The movie had you on the tip of your seat and made you a little afraid to go to your car at the end of the night. <br /> <br /> The part that catches you is that all this can happen. Not to the extent that perceived in the film, but the whole idea is reality. This film took this reality and turned it into a nightmare Dee Snider. <br /> <br /> Three thumbs up (the third is from the corpse in my freezer).
