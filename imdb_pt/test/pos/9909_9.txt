I really really liked this movie. For one thing, it did not have the gross special effects that big budget movies have. The acting was decent in this, only you can say right away that is nicknamed, but once you overcome that fact, and you can not change language in the DVD version, it's cool. The plot was very original, you take a situation like a very common heat wave around the world, especially in Frankfurt that I've been to many times, and you do a junk strike that happens often in this country and you have a recipe to the disaster. I loved how the hordes of rats went everywhere and like the idea that if you pick up the trash, that's the last thing you want to do, you take it, the rats do not understand what they want, they are essentially the following the garbage pick up, then you ask well if the garbage men are on strike, who picks up the garbage, private contractors, anyway military wants to quarantine the city oops wrong thing to do then you would have all the rats take over the city , then play in a mayor who wants to keep a budget cap and fill their pockets, you have a realistic film, and the female lead is also a pleasure to watch on the screen, a very decent movie I thought, I wish more were made so , another small detail is that the Frankfurt performance could have been made a bit better but for the average viewer who has never been to Frankfurt ... I was born in Germany and went to Frankfurt many times. No matter, but all in all a big thumbs up.
