This is one of those rare comedies where you can try, you can not help laughing, laughing, laughing and yes, even laughing out loud. The performance of the lead actor as Hyde is pure manic genius. See if you can keep a straight face when he does his transformation. Good luck. :) On the downside, there are times when the movie stands still. It seemed more than his 90 minutes.
