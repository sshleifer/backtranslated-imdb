WONDERBIRD, surely an unbelievably refined drawing, drawn in a delightfully ancient and sensationally ancient way, formed in almost every respect, takes place in a kingdom ruled by a stingy and petty monarch; so the kingdom, or at least what we see in the vicinity of the king's palace, seems destitute, uninhabited. <br /> <br /> Some inhabitants are far from the sun, in the withered underground. City. <br /> <br /> Advice? call allegory, call parable, just do not call it fable. <br /> <br /> Because the IMDb encourages prolixity, and perhaps for other reasons. Besides, I'll add that this cartoon is the work of the great Paul Grimault.
