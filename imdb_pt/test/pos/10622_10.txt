This movie made me suffer and I loved it! LOVED IT! This haunted me for days. I think Erika is the kind of character you both hate and regret. The most terrifying sex scene ever got in the movie. This is the best of Haneke's work so far. He is the only living director to redefine the pace since Kubrick. The violence in this movie is beautiful. In a word, the movie is about self-hate. In one sentence, the movie is about trying to find love in order to stop hating yourself and find out that this is a hope without hope.
