This movie is hard to beat. It follows the tradition of Pulp Fiction, but achieves even more stamping its own unique style. The cast is amazing, the script is great - and things like the weird time sequencing (Pulp Fiction-esque) is done brilliantly. I particularly like how the images provided in flash back vary dramatically, depending on who is telling the story at the moment. When it is one of the criminals indoctrinated, everything is flashy and cool, but when it is the memory of the hero, everything is shocking and disgusting. <br /> <br /> This is an incredible movie - and so I'm extremely annoyed to find out. I can not buy it anywhere!
