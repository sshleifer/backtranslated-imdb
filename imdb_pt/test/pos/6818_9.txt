This short has all the elements of a great movie. Every time I show it to friends (on the DVR) they also love it. The dialogue is thus 'real'. The acting is superb. While the effects / props have not been so compelling by themselves, taken with the rest of the shot, they are expertly positioned / used. The song is so amazing, perfect for this kind of 'moment' movie. People who cherish their beliefs and thoughts are shaken in their core about what they see in this film. Most go 'is it?', But in the end they bloom with a new understanding, and leave the movie with a word to describe it: 'Linda'. The beauty of the film is also superficial. I love the fact that there are conflicting opinions, no other voice and the voices you hear are agreeing with each other. no conflict, but at the same time there is one. And the end made me love more! Rough reality is sometimes more film-worthy than any plotting device, or twisting. <br /> <br /> (was not Joshua Leonard the guy in the Blair Witch Project?) :) Movie for a fictitious dead guy .. great!
