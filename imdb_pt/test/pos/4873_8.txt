Remember that friend in college who always insisted that you rent the strangest movie possible? This is the movie he would have done if he had had the chance. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell you exactly what Sea of ​​Dust was. He pretends to be the story of a doctor sucked by strange things in the "Black Forest." He goes there to help, but ends up being caught between two young women, of whom he seems to have a fall. But that's just scratching the surface. This is the kind of movie where things happen randomly ... and it's not cool. People are constantly being whipped and stabbed. There are a couple of scary little girls who seem to have left The Shining. Tom Savini is some kind of imaginary religious figure who decides he no longer wants to be imaginary. He has a plan to dominate the world by sharing the suffering of Jesus. <br /> <br /> On some level, this is a movie about sex. It is a no nudity, which was a disappointment, but there is no doubt about the intention. On another level, it's a stoner's paradise. Unexpected things happen so often that they stop being unexpected. The moment the doctor travels through his girlfriend's birth canal to be reborn, you just attribute it to the crazy nature of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, the film is pretty wordy. Some of the points are hammered over and over again. If you're watching with a lot of buddies friends, this can be an advantage.
