I originally saw this movie in a movie theater in Times Square in the late eighties. Who would have thought that this movie would generate two sequences and have this next cult. The Night of the Demons was like most of the other films that appeared at the time. A group of excited teenagers find themselves trapped in some isolated spot and then killed by one. in several horrible ways. Come to think that the formula is still used and still seems to work as evidenced by Saw II that I saw recently. <br /> <br /> I saw Mimi Kinkade at a Fangoria convention about Six years ago and she was so kind-hearted! I think that makes her a very good actress if she could make a career of playing this demon-possessed woman in all these horror movies. Anyway, I just this movie again on VHS tape and this movie still lasts. A bit slow at first, as I remembered it when I first saw it, but then it quickly raced up. One of the horror classics of the eighties and worth a look!
