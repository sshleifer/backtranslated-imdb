15 PARK AVENUE is the address "Mithi / Mithali" (Konkona) that has been sought since the beginning of the film. "Prof.Anu" (Shabhana Azmi) is the extremely affectionate and loving half-sister of Mithi from the previous marriage of Mithi's mother. The film revolves around these characters and analyzes the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through his continuous chatter to Anu and others. <br /> <br /> Konkona deserves not one but thousands of prizes (which I'm sure she'll be getting) for this Mithi interpretation in this movie. You can see the look of a patient written on her face, by the drooping lips and sleepy eyes, of the first scene itself. Rahul Bose did a good job but was reduced to half of the film despite its importance in his life. <br /> <br /> Beware of the intense relationships shown between the characters of the film, Mithi & Anu, Anu & Anu's Mom and between Anu & Sanjiv (Kanwaljit Singh). Shabhana Azmi, as usual, made a fascinating performance to be remembered as the sister, who sacrificed her life for Mithi. <br /> <br /> The movie may not be your normal Hindi potboiler, but it can certainly make people look at the schizophrenic patients in a completely different light. <br /> <br /> As usual, Aparna Sen brings the film to a different end, instead of any clich√©, we can think outside. Let's get the hat for her, for this great movie !!!
