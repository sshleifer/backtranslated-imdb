I saw this movie for the first time when it first came out and also bought an LP recording of the soundtrack. I liked it very well, I saw it several times. I can not understand why it was considered a flop. Julie Andrews was adorable in this movie, her voice was in her best shape and the clothes were beautiful! <br /> <br /> The film contains a bit of everything and even though some of the scenes are a bit heavy, they were still fun. <br /> <br /> I recently discovered that I could get a copy on DVD and ask for it ...... I was disappointed that some songs and movie sequences were not included in the DVD version I ordered.
