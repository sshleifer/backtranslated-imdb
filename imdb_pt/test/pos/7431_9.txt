This movie is based on the series of games: Final Fantasy. This is particularly about FF7 or Final Fantasy VII. I loved the game, and I was very happy to see it become a movie, I loved the CG, that was incredible. Lots of great fighting scenes, action and characters to make the movie memorable. If you're a diehard fan of the game, you'll love this movie. Personally, I'm not a diehard fan of the games, but I'm starting to become one. <br /> <br /> My favorite character from Final Fantasy VII, plus Cloud, would have to be Cid. I love Cid, I think he's cute. I was amazed by the reality of CG images, it was amazing, it's the 3D game. I had a lot of fun watching the movie and by the way, I love the aeons, especially Bahamut, it's great! Overall, I gave this movie a 9, because yes, I loved it. I thought it was a really good movie, but it's on my movie list. The characters were incredible, I loved the CG, the story was wonderful with lots of action and fighting scenes. Overall, it's the best movie I've ever seen, based on a video game.
