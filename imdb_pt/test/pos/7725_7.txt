This is a good movie with good performances by Paz Vega and Leonardo Sbaraglia. Of course Vicente Aranda is a legend in Spanish cinema and certainly one of the great directors of Spanish cinema, but I do not think this is one of his greatest films, even if it is good. The script touches on the introduction of Merimee as a character, it's a nice touch, but it's unbelievable. The song is composed by Jos√© Nieto, Spanish National Film Prize. I mean this movie is very good in all technical aspects. There are very good actors in supporting roles like Antonio Dechent, Maria Botto and others. I give it 7 out of 10 because I think this could be a better movie, but as it is, it's not boring at all.
