Ok, Anatomie is not a reinvention of the Horrormovie genre, but it's still done well anyway. Good actors (Potente and FÃ¼hrmann at first) and some good ideas made me happy. Maybe I would not have been so positive if this was not a German movie, but who cares. It's good to see familiar faces in a good and exciting story with a few jokes and some good jokes. All of you complaining about the dubbing: I have not seen a dubbed version (of course), but I believe it is not easy for you to watch dubbed movies. We (Germans) are used to watching movies like this, so it's not a big deal. But try watching in German with subtitles. The actors are very good!
