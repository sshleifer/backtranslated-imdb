Great movie about a great man. Thomas Kretschmann is first rate as in all his other films. I would never have imagined it as Pope John Paul II. Speak volumes to the casting director. Why do they continue to climb him as a German officer in the movies? And he only came to universal attention after "the pianist"? Of course he looks so hot in the uniforms. I know a lot of girls drool on your pretty face. But this guy is a great actor and has such great potential. If you do not believe me, go watch "Stalingrad". I hope he has many excellent roles in the future with more diversity. Otherwise, what a waste of great devastating talent.
