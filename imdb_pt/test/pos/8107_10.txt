Here we have the inimitable Charlie Chaplin, abandoning his dirty past to face the serious subject of anti-Semitism and intolerance in general. It portrays two characters - the sweet and innocent Jewish barber - a veteran of war and the delirious and relentless dictator Adenoid Hynkel. The Jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for long, due to the whims of Hynkel and his armed henchmen, who routinely leave their villagers rustic, or leave them alone, depending on their mood on that day or week. The barber is among them but is aided by his former commander, Schultz (Reginald Gardner), who seems to keep things a secret for a while until Hynkel sentences him to a concentration camp. He seeks refuge with the Jews in the ghetto, more specifically the barber, and the aggressive young woman, Hannah (Paulette Goddard). The premise will be - who will be the one among these Jews to put their lives at risk to get rid of Hynkel and his companions? We do not need to guess much to know the answer; the barber is a dead idiot for the dictator, and he is equipped in his image, accompanied by Schultz, also with complete military equipment. Hannah escapes with several of her ghetto friends to the country of Osterlich, where Mr. Jaeckel's cousin (Maurice Moscovich) has a farm, and they can live in peace for a while. At this point, Hynkel himself was arrested by his military, thinking he was the notorious barber. The latter, however, was escorted with Schultz to a podium, to make a speech announcing the conquest of Osterlich. The next ten minutes are pure Chaplin himself, speaking of his heart of tolerance, love and freedom, and denigrating greed and hatred. Although Chaplin began producing the film in 1937, one can forgive some naivety. He supposedly did not know the severity of this persecution and hatred, and said that if he knew how much, he would never have made the film because he probably believed that would have trivialized the situation. He has a wonderful supporting cast: Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell as Garbitsch, his field helper, the ever-wonderful Billy Gilbert as clumsy herring, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie as dictator Napaloni, his rival for conquest, veteran European actors David Gorcey (father of Leo), Maurice Moscovich, among others. The scene he choreographed with globe, with only a musical accompaniment is pure luminous inspiration, and luminous, too, is Paulette Goddard at the end of the film, smiling through his tears. I've seen this movie before, but there's always something new to me. Last night, when it was over, I sat in tears. I challenge anyone to be moved by it.
