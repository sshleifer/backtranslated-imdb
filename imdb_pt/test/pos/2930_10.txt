This is a simple episode ad so far after watching every episode of season 11 (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is what made you laugh the most, it's definitely my favorite so far of season 11. a toy store, a child who has Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and it's great since Kyle, once he knows about it, is like "he's faking it". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, the principal, anyone. On the other hand, we have Kyle, who is now intolerant, basically by saying that Cartman was pretending to be taken to meet children with Tourette's syndrome just to let him see that Tourette's syndrome is real and it's great since Kyle is "Well" maybe someone is pretending to have the Tourette for fun, "in short, Kyle could not explain that Cartman was faking it. Probably my favorite scene of this episode is when Cartman is with Kyle's family, but soon after that scene, another child that Cartman is simply pretending, the boy with Tourette who was in the toy store, Cartman basically said to that boy: "isn" Not having Tourette is incredible. " But to say all he wants and be for everyone, a brave boy is just the beginning for Cartman, his master plan: go to National TV to say whatever you want ("people will call it brilliant TV, they'll probably give "I think it's an Emmy" - fantastic, in this episode the word "s ***" is used 26 times and that's certainly not all. But here's a twist, Cartman basically removed all the bricks from the wall, he says it all without thinking, so we hear from Cartman that he wet his bed last night, now it's no fun for Cartman and he's like "I can not control what I say "and certainly the person who was with him is like" well, of course you can not control what you say, you have Tourette, "then Cartman is like" my Tourette got worse before I let go cool things about the Jews being lame and things, but now it got really bad. " There are also things about Chris Hansen and To Catch a Predator, in fact what happened to a pervert here happens with a lot more perverts, Kyle and Thomas were behind this to stop Cartman, Kyle ends up being the rescuer of Cartman! Fantastic! <br /> <br /> TSA VOICES CONCERN About "South Park" October 3 Episode <br /> <br /> On Wednesday, October 3, Comedy Central's cable network will aired one episode of the series animated "South Park" in which one of the young characters, Cartman, "receives" Tourette Syndrome. Given the nature of this program, we expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with TS and to receive numerous phone calls and emails from our members and the TS community. <br /> <br /> We have already taken some prerequisites. strikes, such as asking Comedy Central to publish our public service announcement (with comedian Richard Lewis) during or after the show. Also, as soon as the episode is aired and we are able to see exactly how the TS is portrayed, we will be able to respond with specific questions and problems we have with the series to writers. <br /> <br /> "We are surprised that the creators have taken so long to use TS as comedians in this program, as no disability, illness or controversial subject is off limits to them," said Judit Ungar, president of TSA. "We always see TS portraits (good and bad) as an opportunity for awareness and education, and a show of this magnitude and popularity is certainly no exception and provides a way for TSA to spread factual information about the disorder, "said Tracy Colletti, Flynn, Public Relations and Communications Manager, TSA. <br /> <br /> We will be posting an official statement on this site with TSA's reaction to the show after the show airs. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as has been the case with many media portraits of people with Tourette's Syndrome (TS), the opening of the season South Park ("Le Petit Tourette", 10/03/07) served to further perpetuate the myth that most people affected by TS have involuntary blast of foul language. In fact, 85-90% of people with TS never experience this symptom tragically socially stigmatizing (medically called of coprolalia.) For viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder, the deceptive message of removal could not have been clearer? Unless you curse, you do not have TS. <br /> <br /> Despite our pre-conveyed apprehensions, we admit that the episode was surprisingly well researched. The exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia, nonetheless, for the watchful observer, there was a surprising amount of accurate information conveyed. The scripted input from parents, a neurologist, colleagues and the therapy session with the "TS children support group" served as an intelligent device to provide these facts to the public. "Without a doubt, this episode of South Park has generated a greater national awareness about TS, but we are very concerned that children with TS are ridiculed and even intimidated by insensitive colleagues who may have seen the program," said Judit Ungar, president of TSA. "We realized that for more than a decade the screenwriter's satirical parodies spared no group, be they celebrities, people with disabilities or political figures. The fact that TS was the subject of a popular TV show attests that the public is much more aware of the disorder.Of course, this heightened awareness that we work too hard to accomplish can sometimes prove to be a double-edged sword. "TSA contacted program executives before the broadcast , and we will contact them again. Perhaps we can turn this into an opportunity for a positive perception of TS.
