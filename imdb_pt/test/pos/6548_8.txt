Having discovered the Ring trilogy, I have eagerly swallowed all the other Japanese and Korean films that are on the way or following the movement. <br /> <br /> I do not have an easy definition of horror, but this movie certainly pushed some of my buttons, even though I can not claim that the movie makes a lot of sense. I'm picky, so there were several points in the movie when I just did not want to see what was happening on the screen. The movie irritated me, so I was apprehensive of seeing things I thought I would see. <br /> <br /> It's an imaginative movie that offers a lot of visually. It also provides food for thought. And a lot of material to discuss when the movie is over. <br /> <br /> The characters are well defined to say the least. Could they make movies like this in the West? <br /> <br /> So, it does not make sense at the end, but when you have an appetite for the occult, the supernatural, the bizarre, the supernatural, then the film will not deliver a final reward that explains everything.
