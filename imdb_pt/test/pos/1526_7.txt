The good news: the director is openly committed to the cause of Amnesty International and eager to convey a solid message about freedom of expression and the evil of oppression. The plot is distinctly original and the actors are two of my absolute favorites. The not-so-good news: "original" is not the watchword of everyone when visiting the movies or video stores. Moreover, notable critics such as Maltin and Roger Ebert dismissed the film as a genuinely unsuccessful attempt to convert a piece from the stage to the cinematographic form. As I recall, the title is taken from the fairy tale that Stowe's character wrote and that made her a possible subversive and suspicious person in the fictional place where the story takes place. His dreams are dangerous to the government, represented here by Rickman as the intense interrogator and manipulator. Since these two people are virtually the only ones that appear in the film, the director is in a real challenge in keeping the viewer's attention. In the end, I found the whole thing fascinating. Not flawless and definitely not for everyone, but rewarding. It is nowhere near a masterpiece like Kieslowski's "A Short Film about Killing," or as explanatory as "A Dead Man Walking." But if you like these movies or some political thrillers from Costa-Gavras, you can also enjoy this movie. Just do not expect any overly explicit sermons or sequences of mistrust.
