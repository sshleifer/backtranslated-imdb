Vanaja is a superlative film. It has an exceptionally well-planned cast, with Mamatha being the jewel in the crown, superb production and possibly pre-production with Rajnesh at the helm, a fantastic rural journey through southern India through the eyes of a 15-year-old girl, a remarkable mix of music and dance, traditional and modern, combined perfectly and a beautiful setting of lush colors of flora and fauna that make up the magnificent experience. What a great achievement for a director! The cast was dead. I wish India would show up with more such films. This movie will remain as one of my top favorites throughout my life. 9/10
