On a second screening, this is still a wonderful novel that is, in my opinion, far better than the movie that came along on my set of 2 DVDs, Leo McCarey's classic "An Affair To Remember." However, it seems to have fallen into disrepair a bit (only a rating of 6.6 here in IMDb, and dismissed by many critics as "gooey slush"). How sad, because this is a smart romantic drama with very good work on both tracks, Jennifer Jones and William Holden. If anything the film should be well remembered for the beautiful color cinematography and unforgettable soundtrack. I do not really like Valentine's Day, but it gave me an excuse to watch this movie again, and I'm happy about it. While I still think that the death of Holden's character is very heavily prefigured, leading suspense out of the final scenes, this movie is very touching and I really like it.
