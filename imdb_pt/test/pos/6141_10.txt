Although several scenes of Wirey Spindell can be described as "over". I found it refreshing to see something that was willing to reach a distorted and almost taboo level of comedy. <br /> <br /> Wirey Spindell is a great movie with great dialogue. I would not say this movie is for everyone, but the movie is on my top 10 list. <br /> <br /> If you can look beyond the occasional offensive and watch the movie that is, I would do it Hope you can see in the same light as I do.
