To suppose, this film involves two actors (Caine and Moran) trying to fool a gangster. The plot is fragile at best, as there are several holes in the plot. However, that should not normally matter, since the comedy should bring such a movie. There are some really funny bits (mostly provided by Dylan Moran). However, other times, there are long melodramatic scenes that add nothing to the film. Caine's character seemed exaggerated to me. Especially in the beginning, he continually quotes Shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor. It could be said that he was interpreting the piece properly, but the character seemed flat and bland. Overall, I would say see only if a fan of the actors involved. Otherwise, wait for video or tv.
