I thought this movie was very good and a lot of fun for a movie heavy on emotion. I agree with what another reviewer wrote about the script being sympathetic to the three main characters. I think that's what made the movie good. It was not villainy, not Mr. or Mrs. Kramer, and it was refreshing, I think, to see two people essentially settle the issue on their own and eventually do their best for Billy. And although it was a little weird, I really enjoyed the song in that movie as well. For some reason, the song seemed appropriate to the journey the three main characters had embarked on. This film flowed very well and did not scribble, as some emotionally heavy films tend to do. He dealt with a serious situation, but he did not take himself too seriously. He simply told the story in a straightforward way and it worked very well.
