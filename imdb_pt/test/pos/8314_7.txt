This documentary about dinosaurs was undoubtedly fascinating and very well done. However, I found myself watching many of the bits with discomfort. The film usually took a very confident position on anything he said and showed, but inevitably much of the behavior of the beasts, their interaction, how they looked, how they moved, what they ate, and so on. guessing - sometimes guessing with reasonable confidence, sometimes just wild guessing. But the viewer is never aware of this, the film pretends to actually observe real dinosaurs and their actual behavior, etc. This probably makes visualization better than confronting the public with mountains of disclaimers, but that makes it a bit too populist in my opinion. .
