Jack Frost 2 is probably the cutest movie I've ever seen in my life. The complete title of the film, is Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman. Fans of horror movies who enjoy fancy stories will be thrilled to watch this. This movie went straight to the video and for good reason. Here's why: The acting was so atrocious and so terrible that it could make someone cry. The main character had no personality, and the poor acting of the actor made everything worse. The script was over, it was also atrocious. Each character always says a cheese line, and adds the cheese lines to the bad choreography, so you have something bad. Second, the plot is not really that impressive, but since this movie went straight to the video, it's forgiven. The director and writer could have turned the idea of ​​a killer snowman into something cool, but they did not. Their story has many holes in the plot. At first, a cup of coffee is thrown into the aquarium, with Jack Frost melted. Scientists try to restore their lives, but they could not. Once the cup of coffee fell into the tank, Jack Frost was completely restored. Now he's immune to antifreeze. In Jack Frost, part 1, the main character's DNA was confused with the Anti-freeze that was used to kill Jack Frost. As the main character is allergic to bananas, Jack Frost is also. So here's my point. Sam's DNA is said to have matched that of Jack Frost. But one of the scientists had some saliva in the cup, so when it fell into the tank, scientists' DNA would have been combined with Jack Frosts. Another thing, the special effects were also not very good. Here's the plus points: Jack Frost 2 has a lot of blood, which looks very realistic. Even though this movie is flawed, it's still fun. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is a nice horror movie. The first one was better though. 7 out of 10.
