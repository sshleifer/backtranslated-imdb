By the time it was inaugurated, "Heaven's Gate" became, to its detriment, more of a cultural phenomenon than a movie. At a time when preoccupation with excessive budgets and arrogance of direction was growing, it was a desirable target, as it was a job well above the budget of the most recent "author" to reach Hollywood, who had not yet established the record he the benefit of the doubt between the critics and the industry. As someone pointed out at the time, no one would jump on Warren Beatty's even more expensive and dark "Reds," because Beatty was "one of us," while Michael Cimino did not reach that status. But the Paradise Gate was also affected by a cultural shift taking place at the time, the political movement to the right and toward more unquestionable patriotism and consecration of the myth of the West (and the West). A few years earlier, Cimino's demythologization of the frontier might seem timely, new, and necessary. But in 1980, in the wake of the Reagan Revolution, it was considered almost non-American. <br /> <br /> What a shame, because the film, viewed from the point of view of several decades, is a fascinating and thought-provoking look at that specific time and place as a world in which life, in the words of Hobbes , was "unpleasant, brutal and short". Kristofferson plays James Averill, a high-class Eastern man who, in search of adventure, becomes a sheriff in Wyoming, where he is forced to lead a resistance from settlers and squatters against an attack by a mercenary hired by wealthy landowners, including Averill's best friend. In a more innocent time, Averill and his "army" of poor farmers were triumphant; but that's all but a traditional Western, and when the American cavalry joins the fight here, it's not on the "good guys" side. Cimino's previous film, "Heaven's Gate," spends a great deal of time building the details of the lives of its directors, giving the film a rhythm sometimes relaxed that, however, leads to an exciting conclusion. With great acting, a good soundtrack, and the visual texture that makes someone believe that they are actually seeing the "Old West" through new eyes, "Heaven's Gate" is a movie that rewards repeated visualizations. I just wanted MGM to release a new DVD, with an improved download and a comment from Cimino. However, the current version is satisfactory enough to allow viewers to see which critics in 1980, possibly blinded by the film's cultural subtexts, managed to lose ... that "Heaven's Gate" is a great movie.
