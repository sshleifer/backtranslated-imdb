I saw this movie for the first time when it was very small. I was born in 1985, so it was around the age when the '80s cartoons were great. My mother recorded one day thinking I might like it. I had never heard of the Rainbow Bright TV show before being introduced to the movie. When I saw (on one of those old BETA tapes ...) I loved it. I became addicted to it. There are people who say it's badly written and all, but it's a children's movie, and things like that do not really matter to kids. I loved the story and especially liked the songs and all the female characters. Of course I pretended to be them, and in the scene where Rainbow met Krys and they were repulsed, they had to work with the opposite sex, I could totally relate. History was the basic good against evil that children enjoy, and there were moments happy enough to balance the scary ones. The world is a fantastic place that stimulates the imagination of any small child. I am very happy to have had the opportunity to see this movie when I was little. This has made a big impact, and seeing him now brings back happy childhood memories. I would recommend to any parent with small children to rent this movie. This will trigger your imagination and provide lots of entertainment. You're just a kid once, so do not let her lose that!
