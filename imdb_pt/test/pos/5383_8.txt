Bravestarr was released in 1987 by the extinct American animation company Filmation on the back of He-man: Masters of the Universe and She-Ra: Princess of Power in 1983 and 87 'respectively. The plot of the cartoon was about a Native American cowboy named Marshall Bravestarr, who has the strength of the bear, the ears of the wolf, the speed of the puma and the eyes of a hawk, and his faithful companion, a talking horse named Thirty-Thirty. , who carried with him a weapon suitably titled "Sarah Jane" and with the help of Deputy Fuzz and Judge JB serve to protect New Texas from the evil Tex Hex and his bunch of lawless. <br /> <br /> Futuristic Texas, that was and still is to this day, one of the few cartoons created in a particular city in the United States - and therefore in the South - thousands of light-years ahead in the future . Since this was done in the 1980s, the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the look of the Wild West, but from a Sci-Fi based perspective. Bravestarr not only evoked good morals and bad verses, but also taught children lessons about life, but also highlighted themes of culture and community, and that we should not take things and life for granted. And despite the fact that this was an action and adventure cartoon, many of the stories, themes and issues addressed resonate in children and adults in a way that makes sense to them. In addition, Marshall Bravestarr was one of the first great cartoon characters of a (ethnic) minority, to make impact on the TV. <br /> <br /> The sound effects were amazing, the music was great, the song theme equally memorable and the animation was wonderful. The characters were well-designed and the stories were diverse and taught children's morals and the importance of what is right and what is wrong. Something that the same can not be said about today's cartoons, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Although Bravestarr was overshadowed by He-man's success, it is still a personal favorite of many 80's cartoon fanatics. Suffice it to say that I preferred Bravestarr to He-man because of the diversity of stories , of the characters and that the depth of the situations and problems faced by the characters was more what I would say realistic and identifiable in contrast. For some reason, they resonated more with people because, for example, in 'The Pledge', where a boy dies of drug overdose, the fact that there was no happy ending was important - in the sense that when children Watch that episode Well, actually, anyone who witnesses this episode will realize for themselves the devastating consequences of drug use and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs. <br /> <br /> Bold, brave and sometimes thought-provoking, Bravestarr is definitely that - brave, courageous and thought-provoking. A classic of caricatures for many years, he dared to take some risks, but it was worth it in the end. Will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the most interesting and best cartoon of the 80's, and rightly so <br /> <br /> 8 and a half in ten
