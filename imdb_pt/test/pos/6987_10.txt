I saw "Into Pitch Black" on t.v. and then I had to see it. I must say I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> Not only has David Twohy's style improved since he wrote "Critters 2," as Vin Diesel called my attention. Of course, he was there in "Into Pitch Black", but here he was fierce, scary and intense. I have not seen this kind of charisma since Schwarzenegger in the 1980s. The story is fairly simple, but it's the characters that make this movie interesting. Then there was what happens to the female leader. Unexpected. Black humor helps the movie progress, the effects are not grandiose, but when Riddick fights the alien ... he blew up all my complaints. <br /> <br /> Diesel has not done much since this movie I care, but I'm anxiously looking forward to the sequel.
