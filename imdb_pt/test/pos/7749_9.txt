This show is great. Not only is "Haruhai Suzumiya" a very well-written anime, it also reflects things like Philosophy, Science Fiction and a little religion. It is hilarious in some points and "cute" (for lack of a better term) in others. In fact, this may be an effect for my lack of experience with Japanese anime programs, but it is one of the best of the genre I've seen. <br /> <br /> I mostly have to give credit to the writers. I have not seen such brilliant scopes of imagination on a television show since the original Star Trek. I hope the writers keep adding new strange characters and giving more information about the great characters already added. <br /> <br /> 9/10
