Crossfire remains one of Hollywood's best messaging movies because, unlike the admirably intentional Gentlyman deal that he hit theaters for a few months, he chooses to send his message through the form of an excellent noir thriller instead of having a star "It is much easier to get the message that hatred is like a loaded gun when the corpses are real rather than metaphorical." Somewhat shamefully, the brief report on the Warner DVD did not mentions that novelist Richard Brooks disowned the film about switching from a homophobic murder to an anti-Semitic, but it is interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is Jewish, there is little doubt in Sam Levene's performance that the character is in fact also gay? is not a spicy caricature, but there is definitely an aspect of two lost souls in their scenes with the soldier There is not much mystery about who the killer is: even if murder is performed in classic noir shadows, the killer's body language is instantly recognizable, but then the movie has its characters reaching the same conclusion before the middle of the way. : the tension comes from proving it and saving the hick. <br /> <br /> There is an element of Ealing Films for the gang of soldiers joining to get their friend out of a crisis (you could almost see this aspect as a model for Hue and Cry), but the atmosphere is pure RKO noir On a long, stifling night, the film looks great with blacks and dark shadows that were born in both economy and style (it shortened lighting time and allowed director Edward Dmytryk to have more time to work with the actors). excellent cast makes the most of writing: a laid back but charismatic Robert Mitchum, Robert Young's detective, Maigret, Gloria Grahame's vagabond, and the perpetually scary Paul Kelly as his liar-compulsive admirer, a guy who tries to tell stories the way other people they try on ties. But the lasting impression is of Robert Ryan's excellent performance as a guy who could make a good start alone as he does his best to help the man wrongly accused down the aisle. A major surprise in 1946, as a reward, Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott were investigated by the HUAC, which in turn had a notable tendency to attack the Jews. So much to cross?
