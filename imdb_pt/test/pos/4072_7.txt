This is a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feels like it might lead to a sequel, but I doubt they'll make enough money. <br /> <br /> Deniro proves that he can be a great straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo- well, she's just plain fun to watch anyway and she's played her excellent role. <br /> <br /> Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. That was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and we got a lot of the movie and the big hits at the end. DO NOT LEAVE at the beginning of the credits! <br /> <br /> At least 7.
