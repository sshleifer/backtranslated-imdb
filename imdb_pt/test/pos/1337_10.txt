Hey, what do you expect from a low budget movie!?!? Although I have not seen "Dahmer" (2002), I can say that after what the media has posted about Jeff, this is a pretty accurate representation. I studied Jeffrey Dahmer's case and learned all I can about this man. This is a low budget movie, but it shows the mentality of a serial killer. If you can get through the blood and see what is the underlying story of a sick mind. I loved this movie! Just get ready for low budget and no blood. It is a story as seen through the eyes of a murderer and his actions and thoughts from childhood to his imprisonment. My favorite line is, "If they bothered to look in the backseat, it could have saved a lot of lives."
