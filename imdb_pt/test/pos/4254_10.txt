I saw this movie in its short film show "art house" in 1969. I found it so funny that I literally spent part of the movie on the floor, having laughed so hard that I fell from my place. In retrospect, years later, I thought it was made by Melvin Van Peebles. When I mentioned this to a friend, he said that a friend of his, Downey Sr., filled virtually all the non-acting roles in the film: director, producer, screenwriter, etc. He was right, of course, and my memory was wrong except that this was one of the funny movies ever made. The "Arab" part was particularly invaluable.
