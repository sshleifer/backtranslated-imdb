Flatliners left a very noticeable impression on my head. The story is swift and leaves you constantly absorbed and often quite tense. Its about five notable medical students (notably Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon) among whom, one of them invented the mechanism of staying dead (or staying flat-lined) for a few seconds and then coming back to life. <br /> <The procedure is quite "complex," involving a multitude of medical trinkets-injections, electric blankets, oxygen masks, and a variety of esoteric medical terms. I strongly suspect the doctors have coined all these words so they never have to resign. But amusingly they follow the KISS philosophy (Keep It Simple, stupid) (extended version for doctors: keep it stupid, simple) too. At the risk of being euthanized by some revenge reader, let me continue. <br /> <br /> So the first man who has plans has hope of finding the answers to life that philosophy and religion can not respond convincingly. He hopes that it will be answered (and become famous) through applied science. It flat-lines for about two minutes and then back to our world left quite shaken. During his death, he had a vision of an incident when he was young, which left the strongest impression in his life. He killed another kid as a child by accident, and he still feels responsible for it. <br /> <br /> With the success of the first flat-liner, others follow the example of each one of them stretching their straight line. more and more time to test the limits of how long one can remain dead and experience the afterlife. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, monsters of the past and future, keep coming back to haunt them after their flat-line experience. The first flat-liner is haunted by a boy who tortures him when he is alone. The second who filmed all the women he took to bed, sees televisions playing his videos. The third is haunted by a young woman he provoked at school. The fourth is haunted by her father killed by suicide, for whom she feels responsible. <br /> <br /> They are all driven to madness by these hauntings and obsessions and think that the past seems to want revenge on them. The main focus on getting a straight line is that your whole life passes through your eyes, at the moment of "dying", whatever stage you are in, and you get the strongest impressions of life in your mind . Since they did not die, these strong impressions somehow resurfaced and became the focus of their lives. <br /> <br /> They all somehow come to terms with (and extinguish) their past demons. All of them, except the first who realizes that the only way he can move on through life is rolling up again. During this session of flat lines, he sees himself getting smooth the first time and also sees the boy he killed, trying to kill him this time. The boy kills him this time for a few minutes, and in doing so, sought revenge. For a few minutes in the movie, it remains to be seen if he will return. Fortunately (because most of us like happy endings) the boy absolves him of his past and he comes back to life again.
