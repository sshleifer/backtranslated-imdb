This movie has 4 parts and each is about 170 minutes long. It's based on the true story of Joe Bonanno's life and he's counting everything as he saw it. So in some events, we may realize that we hear different talk about it. Film make you tied to the chair all the way, I think it's possible to watch all 4 in a row, and did not notice I watched 2 in a row and 2 the next day in a row. Acting in movies is good in some awesome scenes, but overall it could be a great place, but this movie is not about acting or special effects and glamor, this truth and story show is central to this movie. So anyone looking for the same spectacular Rambo / matrix / titanic movie, you can skip this one. The good thing in the movie is to follow the main story so you do not have long, boring love scenes or any different interruption with something that is not important to Bonanno's criminal affairs.
