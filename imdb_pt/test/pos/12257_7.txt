Good drama / comedy, with two good performances by Hunter & Hurt, but Albert Brooks steals every scene he's in. With a great script, this movie rises and gives everyone the chance to showcase their acting talent. And although Joan Cusack is not very present, but she has one, if not the funniest scene in the movie. The highlight of the film for me was Albert Brooks' speech about the devil. Just a setback is the fact that it gets a bit slow in some places. And I was only totally interested in the role of Brooks, not so much in Hunter or Hurt. I give it to 7 out of 10.
