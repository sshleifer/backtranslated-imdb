I'm sorry that SURFACE was not chosen for the 2006-2007 NBC season. I think the market demand for inane games and reality television shows, a reflection on our sense of culture, has conquered a good story. I hope and pray that some networks will pursue this, as will STARGATE and spin-offs. <br /> <br /> I also hope that producers will find a place where they can produce the post-production level. desired in an interview on TV Guide. At this point, science fiction reruns, marathons, will have to be made. I would love to see where the story goes after the tsunami that ended Episode 15. I would like to discover the mentor of the effective effort to overshadow the true identity of the creatures. <br /> <br /> FYC Morningbear
