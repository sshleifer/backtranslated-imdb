I've decided that I need to lengthen my review for my all-time favorite movie. Unlike other war films that focus on the event, Apocalypse Now takes the viewer on a psychological journey. Pure surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, but you can not take your eyes off it. Based on the Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, Apocalypse Now slowly descends its protagonist, Willard (Martin Sheen), probably in the same way that Kurtz plunged into insanity. The production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and by Brando's unprepared performance (he read his tips card talks). There is a documentary entitled Apocalypse Now: An Apocalypse filmmaker who shows the hell that everyone went through doing this. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any movie. When the helicopter blade is heard in slow motion and napalm falls in the trees, The Doors' song "The End" can be heard. The next shot is for Willard in his bed with the fan on, so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan. We are told that he does special missions for the military, mainly murders. When his next mission is given to him, he is perplexed. "Charging a man with murder here is like giving a speeding ticket on the Indy 500." The man he had to kill was a respected colonel who went insane and isolated with the tribes. Kurtz is ordering atrocious acts that are performed by these people and he should stop me. Willard does not go alone though. He is taken on a boat with several soldiers and they are faced with several battles. Along the way, they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore "Hoorah" about the war. Willard ponders that if Kilgore is as crazy as Kurtz might be? There are many scenes depicting Willards plunging into insanity: the tiger attack, the massacre of innocent Vietnamese, the incessant rain, the stacked corpses, and the deaths of its crew. When he arrives at Kurtz's complex, he is greeted by the village people and by a hippie photojournalist (Dennis Hopper). Instead of murdering Kurtz immediately, Willard begins to talk to him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do. Kurtz, on the other hand, wants to die. He is tired of war and wants to go down as a soldier. Willard kills him with a machete while in unison, a buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by the people. Once they realize that their leader has been killed, instead of killing Willard, they hail him as their new king. Willard rejects the offer and leaves them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography here is absolutely stunning. The colors are grain free, something that is rare in old movies. I can see him dumb and admire the beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> The acting set is fantastic, with everyone playing their parts well. Many criticize Brando for some reason, but I think he sings his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten by the war. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack and the trail are haunting and providing the mood for the movie. I'm wondering what instrument they used in that guitar sound when the credits roll? There have been many parodies of this movie, but my favorite line comes from Marge Simpson when she explains to Homer why a character with the same name on a police show is behaving like an idiot: "Your character provides comic relief for the show, like Marlon Brando on Apocalypse Now ". Those who saw the movie know why this is hilarious.
