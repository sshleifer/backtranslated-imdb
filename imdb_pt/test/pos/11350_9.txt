Two people living in the same complex plan think their partners are having a case with each other. As they try to understand how this happened, do they also embark on an emotional journey that hurts to a resolution? <br /> <br /> Based on his previous success with Happy Together and Chungking Express, Wong Kar Wai gives us old-fashioned and wonderful history of resurrected passions, longings and unrequited love. <br /> <br /> Possibly, In the mood for love is not for everyone. He wanders lazily at 98mins: not particularly long for a movie, but seems longer because it does not happen much. But this lazy feeling hides a rather well-constructed movie. Most of the story is ingeniously woven around a series of dramatizations together, where the characters interpret presumed scenarios between their respective spouses, trying to figure out how the affair began. I say cunning because, of course, it makes it difficult for the audience (and the characters) to say what is "on paper" and what is genuine. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds arty and self-awareness, it is because it is. No shame then. And it's played perfectly by two of Hong Kong's best, Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai, with excellent support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan. It's also a virtuoso performance of Wong Kar Wai. , which treats the audience with a sensory and sensual overload. Gathering Christopher Doyle (who later deployed his lush and mature style in Hero) and Pin Bing Lee (whose gorgeous style can be seen in the spring in a small town) was a cinematic genius. It has all the daring beauty of Doyle, without, frankly, Athena's slogan of his work in Hero. The music, as always with Wong, is prominent. From Nat King Cole singing in Spanish, to the haunted ropes of the main theme, it blends perfectly with the eclectic beauty of the images. <br /> <br /> All in all, a hit movie, whether judged in plot, acting, cinematography or soundtrack. Similar to, but more accessible than, Wim Wenders of Desire by Wim Wenders, this is a beautiful, old-fashioned story about lost and reclaimed love. <br /> <br /> And beware of Tony Leung's hotel room in 2046, which provided for the recent Wong movie of the same name.
