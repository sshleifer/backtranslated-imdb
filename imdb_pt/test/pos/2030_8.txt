Mark Walhberg, in a big role, idolizes a rock star to the point of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection and dressing like him. When the opportunity arrives for him to take on the role of "idol" in the band, he jumps into the opportunity. However, the role of a rock star may not be what it's ready to be ... and relationships can change .... This movie certainly caught my eye, for having the theme of what you conquer may not be what you think you are. once you succeed. Overall, a very good movie with great performances from the entire cast, as well as the two leaderships, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston. It made me feel sad, especially when Emily (Jennifer Aniston) met Chris in Seattle and saw the depths of what he had sunk. If someone has ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie, they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, while fascinating for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you might want .
