If there are people who do not like this movie, I do not think they are human. This film implants all the emotions and shows many sides of the character of Judith Light. Made in 1997, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen and really the movie that Judith Light starred in to make me a big fan of her. This movie, although you sometimes want to shock your son so much by trusting her, is incredibly touching. I cry at the end every time and it takes a lot to do this to me! The plot does not have much to see, but the acting of Judith Light is incredible. She's beautiful all the time, and in the end, you do not want the destiny imposed by the courts to happen to her. Overall, a movie is worth my highest praise! Thank you for doing this and redefining my opinion on the death penalty. I look forward to this movie to come out on DVD or some other form of media since Lifetime is starting to release some movies to customers. Although I do not have high hopes for this, because this happened almost 9 years ago, which is still hard to believe, since this movie is still rooted in my head after all this time.
