This was a very good 1950's western, one of the best I've seen in a decade that featured that genre on screen and on TV. Certainly there were three great actors in the tent: Glenn Ford, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. It turns out that Ford was the star of this film, while the other two stars were in supporting roles. Ford had most of the dialogue. He was also the "good guy" while Robinson was the "bad guy" and Stanwyck was twice as bad as Robinson. She interpreted the real weight in this film and the character she played was a bit contradictory at times. <br /> <br /> Ford coped very well with his star status, as he usually did - especially in westerns. He played a nice guy who did not want to fight, he was a peaceful man ... but if you pushed him ... look out! <br /> <br /> The story had a good mix of action and calms, not overdoing it either. It had an expansive western setting that was well used with the widescreen CineamaScope. It also featured realistic people in a realistic setting. This credibility with the characters, especially the supporting players, was very impressive. The men escaped from the women in this movie, acting and character. Dianne Foster and May Wynn were weak - the only negatives of production. It's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars. <br /> <br /> Although you are over 50, this Western is one that you still think is fast enough to have fun, no matter how old you are or what you are used to seeing. For fans of classic movies, this is almost a must with this cast and good story. Highly recommended.
