In August Days / Dies d'agost, Marc Recha gave us a road movie in Catalan style saturated with the sun, which is mainly an improvised and sinuous meditation on fraternity and the recovery of the dead. The beautiful, sometimes large-scale, richly atmospheric 35 mm. images of landscape, pleasant soundtrack and narration in Catalan are charming as a piece of humor, if one is content with a trajectory that does not have much impetus and does not lead anywhere in particular. Filmmaker Marc Recha and his non-identical twin, David, are the stars and the narrative is dubbed by his younger sister. Marc was researching the life of Ramon Barnils (1940-2001), a socialist editor who had been a friend of the family. He felt that he was saturated with information and had to pause. The breakthrough has been to make this film, which seeks to capture the mood of interviews with Barnils associates, thoughts about the Spanish Civil War, the dry season they were experiencing, the rugged landscape, the affection of the Brothers Recha one for the other , nothing and tanned nudity and any characters or stories they encountered while camping in their van. This leads to the search for a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. In the end, David has to return to Barcelona to be with his daughter and Marc has to return to his project, and then it ends. I found it fascinating to hear an extensive narration in the Catalan language with its mixture of Spanish and French words (perhaps linked to the Proven√ßal?). This is not a great movie but it commands the attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing with genres and mixing autobiography with fiction and documentary in a new and thought-provoking way. <br /> <br /> An official selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center.
