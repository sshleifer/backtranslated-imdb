Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are brilliant as Sir and his Dresser. Of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing compares to the immediacy and collegiality of the theater, and I think you hear better in the theater; but on the screen we become more intimate, we are closer than we are in the theater, we witness subtle changes in the expression, we "see" better and we hear. Both the play and the film are wonderful: moving, intelligent, illuminating - from the company backstage history, from the historical context, from the two main characters and from the parallel characters in "Lear" itself. If you can not see it in a theater (I do not imagine it's much produced today), then, please do yourself a favor and get the video.
