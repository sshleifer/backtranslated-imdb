This is one of the anime films from The Animatrix collection, one of nine - the only one made in black and white and the only one with Trinity. Richly textured and beautifully rendered in every way, and the animated version of Trinity definitely does justice to it. If you are a fan of The Matrix, you need to put this on your short list.
