I can not believe this movie has only 7.4 points! This certainly fits with the best of Hitchcock films, such as VERTIGO or MARNIE. The only reason I can think of why the score is so low is that, most of the time, MAN ... renounces violence and certainly will not get a degree in "sex and crime." <br /> <br /> What derives from their tension is not violence; it is the irresponsible energy of these criminals who take a child from their parents and are ready to kill the child if the operation fails. Today, having watched many kidnapping films like Mel Gibson's RANSOM, this seems normal, but in the 1950s, where the family was all in contemporary America, the thought of such a crime certainly triggered many emotions. <br /> <br /> And this tension still works for me today. Yes, these guys are selfish, ignorant bastards, disruptive in how they act: it's a business for them, and they want to be "good entrepreneurs," disregarding the fact that business here is kidnapping children and murdering politicians in the opera !! <br /> <br /> What makes the movie great, however, are the creative aspects, the perverted ideas of Hitchcock, the outrageously disturbing scene in the church (which catches the viewer's attention as alone, as the protagonists are abandoned , no one cares, no one helping, church people going home ...), meeting with the owner of that store filling and preparing dead animals (which emphasizes the "oriental" talent that the film has in the opening scenes in the exterior)), last but not least, the role of MUSIC in this film. <br /> <br /> Music is the key principle here, as *** SPOILER *** The assassination of the target politician must be done exactly at the time of a high orchastra tutti / gong; then Hitchcock lets the camera follow the score of the orchestra and now you will happen in a second *** BANG *** And then, of course, DORIS DAY singing Que sera, that became more famous than the film itself; she sings to warn the boy of his parents at the embassy ... In all: A classic !!
