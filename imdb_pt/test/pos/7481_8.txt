I love the premise, but the replay value is only for certain parts (the opening scene, of course). Some characters are a little outrageous, but they are fun, though. I think the Ballping Mall was pushing. I know it was to show that Nick and Casey were living in Los Angeles and to show why Casey left the lifestyle, I just think the flashback story could have been better. Also Jamaican rap on the phone is smart and fun, but again I think the story was told sloppy. Sounds really unbelievable. I really believe that Swordfish (the other movie Woods wrote) is more than some of the parties on Thursday because the government keeps it secret all the time, and there are organizations the public will never know about. <br /> <br /> Thursday is the best Quentinesco movie I've seen. I think Woods is creative, intelligent and intelligent; however, his work needs more maturity even to get to the script of the Natural Born Killer (not the Stone movie). How old is he, anyway?
