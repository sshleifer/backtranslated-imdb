Participate in Sweeney Todd's tale ... The strangest, most daunting, but most wonderful Broadway musical. It's creepy, fun and moves at once through Sondheim's memorable and incredible track and its sharp performances. George Hearn is unparalleled in the title role, bringing a strong, dead voice (no pun intended) mimicking the legendary demonic barber, while Angela Lansbury provides comic relief while she cheerfully grinds her victims into meat pies. If you just allow yourself to enjoy it, "Sweeney Todd" is a real treat.
