To summerize this movie: good for the TV, but too small for the theater. I enjoyed watching this movie at home, but I do not watch it a second time. The concept is good, but what ends up in the movie is just a summary. The end has a 'cool' touch, but it's still unsatisfactory. Maybe it was the director's intention, but it did not work as it should. But again, it's a kind of movie OK.
