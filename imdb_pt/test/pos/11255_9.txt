Spoiler begin The film focuses on three friends, Samantha (Summer Phoenix), Chris (Nick Stahl) and Owen (Aaron Paul). The film begins with Sam and Owen as drug addicts, and Chris, the star of the trail, as the one who takes care of them. As things get worse and worse at home for Chris, he asks Sam how's the damn thing. Sam is out of rehab and sober at this point and tells him that he makes it all better. Chris then catches Owen and they start to use it. It takes chris twice until he's a "full-time member." After some trouble with a drug dealer and a confession to Sam, she re-enters.

He's going to get an Oscar one day. His interpretation of Chris was heartbreaking. He was the only one who felt real in the movie about using drugs. Aaron Paul, who played Owen acted as though he were at high speed not heroin. Summer Phoenix was fine, she's talented, but what I can say that Nick Stahl stole the movie. His drugged eyes, his slow movements, everything was perfect. <br /> <br /> The writers had to show retreats in the film. That's the main reason people do not want to give up.
