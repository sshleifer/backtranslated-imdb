So I called the TV today at 1:00 p.m. on a Sunday, expecting to see crap and infomercials, and this great movie was just beginning, I did not know what it was, but it drew me almost immediately. The movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> There were some things that did not make sense. I did not understand why the dead guy was talking about doing things to get rid of his bad situation, but then Jimmy really does nothing but the basic things to survive that anyone would do in his situation, in other words, it was not his initiative that the took out of her bad situation was just luck, second I do not know Take the thing about the girl killing the gangsters in the end because the whole thing was partly by the thief stealing the money from Panda, and then the other thief kills Panda in the end, so they steal your money twice, and they kill you. How good is that?
