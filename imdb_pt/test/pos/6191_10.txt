Nice description of the situation in the US, explains different types of Islam, not only show terrorists and extremists. Islam can be something else to kill, they show why some people become terrorists and how to be Muslims without being extremists. It's a great series that Muslims and non-Muslims should see. Now we hope that other series or films are made to change the idea that all Muslims are terrorists and all Americans want to destroy Islam. This gave me the interest to find out what Islam is exactly and what the US and the European government do to help cohabit between people of different religions.
