Former reporter Jacob Asch (Eric Roberts) is hired by an acquaintance (Raymond J. Barry) to find his ex-wife and son. Asch goes to Palm Springs and quickly locates the former Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) with someone he believes to be the son (a young Johnny Depp). But things get a bit more complicated as Asch discovers that former white trash Laine has definitely married in the form of millionaire Simon Fleischer (Dan Hedaya) and his first child is far from being seen. Director / screenwriter Matthew Chapman is channeling the BODY HEAT here and this 80's neo-noir is quite enjoyable, thanks to a cast of stars and nice locations. D'Angelo was still fine by this time, so she creates a good femme fatale and is not afraid to show off some skin. However, the mystery is not very attractive in the end. Co-starring Dennis Lipscomb, Emily Longstreth and Henry Gibson. Chapman made several thrillers in the 1980s, but his "greatest" career achievement was co-authored in the script of the infamous COLOR OF NIGHT.
