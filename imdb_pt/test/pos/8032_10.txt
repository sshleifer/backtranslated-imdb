2002, Bourne Identity is one of my all time favorite movies. however, many fans of the book complained that the film had very little to do with the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Task is the real deal. It's strange that no one on the topics "Bourne Identity" mentioned this movie. (Well, I jst did.) <br /> <br /> In addition to the excellent plot, I personally found this movie as good as any espionage movie I have ever seen, with the possible exception of the Bourne <br /> /> Identity itself. <br /> <br /> The action is totally realistic. I especially liked the training regime of the protagonists, which was very inventive. <br /> <br /> The feeling is dark and brave. There are some startling twists. The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> If you like this genre, I can not recommend this movie highly enough.
