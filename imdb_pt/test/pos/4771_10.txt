It's the 1920s. And a man named Walt Disney was on a mission: to satisfy families and children around the world with one thing: entertainment. What did he do? He made cartoons! Whoo !!!!! And he made a character who is as good as a mouse ... Mickey Mouse. Ha ha! Oh boy! <br /> <br /> Two films were designed by Mr. Disney himself: "Plane Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie." This review will focus on the 1928 feature, "Steamboat Willie." <br /> <br /> Since learning about this movie as a little boy, I've always wanted to see this movie. Well, in 1997, I rented an old VHS that had lots of old Disney cartoons on them, starring the Mouse !!!!! Mickey Mouse!!!!! And guess what? That short was there, and I loved it !!!!! Shortly after I got the tape back, I was playing the old Disney Channel (note: the "Old" Disney Channel) early on a Saturday morning. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a great cartoon; this paved the way for more great Disney stuff from 1928 to 2002! <br /> <br /> 10 stars, indeed !!!!!
