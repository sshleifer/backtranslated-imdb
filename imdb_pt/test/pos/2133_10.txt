If this film had been directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, it would be recognized for what it is: a cinematographic masterpiece, told with depth, subtlety and passion, a film unmatched in the visual world. It is ceaselessly impressive and also very brutal in its depiction of our great heritage of greed and annihilation. And of course, what the reviewers could not stand is that it does not tell a simple narrative of Dick and Jane as 99% of Hollywood's production. Their characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions. They even seem to be thinking, something that their movie critics generally do not understand and can not stand, so they destroyed it. See the original uncut version on wide screen. It's impressive.
