If you know anything about the Manhattan Project, you'll find "Fat Man and Little Boy" at least an interesting description of the events surrounding the story. The film is, in all respects, a very realistic picture of these events, and in many ways it is almost too real (like some scenes involving radiation poisoning). Paul Newman, as usual, is brilliant in his role and always manages to come out as a real person on the screen. The supporting cast, such as John Cusack, Laura Dern, Bonnie Bedelia and Natasha Richardson, is pretty good as well. This film is not, however, one of the best examples of turning a true story into a movie. Great movies are able to have a real story and use just enough artistic license to keep their audience engaged throughout the movie. This, however, tends to drag on a bit, and some scenes (like the love story of John Cusack and Natasha Richardson) could have been eliminated altogether without the film losing much. However, there are interesting facts and little bits of humor to at least keep the audience interested enough to see the entire movie. He does not always amuse himself, but as far as large representations are concerned, this is very precise, fascinating and will leave the audience with something to think about. ***
