The only pure life is one that ends with a signature in the blood. <br /> <br /> So says Mishima, anyway, a sheltered young boy who becomes a celebrity author. The life of one of Japan's most celebrated literary voices is told from three perspectives, his life shortly before him and four members of his private army take up a Japanese military base and commit ritual suicide (shown in color), flashbacks and white), and scenes from his novels (shown in a sort of dreamy scenography somewhere between the traditional Noh Theater and the "Wizard of Oz." These stories are often told at the same time but are edited to reinforce the slow merger of Mishima's life with his fictions to the end (or the beginning) when as the ancient samurai he so admires, he will be in a balance of pen and sword (when his words and deeds are the same, and he is a complete and "pure" being. Paul Schrader wrote the script for "Taxi Driver" and directed "Cat People" (a bizarre erotic horror film that left strange impressions on me as a boy). , in Mishima, he comes close to make a really great movie. <br /> <br /> What is interesting ng is watching the poet, the homosexual, the shy and clumsy man with a low body image who exaggerates his Tuberculosis to get a WW2 (of which he seems ashamed forever), make he became a bodybuilder, obsessed with samurai, a-sexual, media phenomena, while writing prolifically prolific numbers of novels, stage plays and short stories. A short, sweet version is to say that Mishima has no father, and becomes obsessed with masculinity, beauty, sex, and self-destruction, in some tragic attempt to feel attached to something greater than himself even, that he was always losing. Watching him with his fellow suicide cadets, do you see him happy, delivering his great paternal speech, giving orders and loving control ... to the very speech, the point where the pen and the sword meet? This, of course, ignores the subtlety of the art of narrative here that makes this transformation so natural and remarkable. <br /> <br /> Although the story, sometimes fascinating, is not the greatest success of cinema. Cinematography, performances, editing, music (by Philip Glass), and scenographies, are really what make worth seeing, and more than a traditional bio-photo. <br /> <br /> One day I'm going to pick up a Mishima book, it seems to have an ear for prose, and to stage ideas, but for now I'm satisfied with the movie. <br /> <br /> Those interested in Japanese literature and postwar culture should check. Fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions should also have fun.
