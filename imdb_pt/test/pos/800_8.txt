Good movie. <br /> <br /> I got it on DVD at a local store. Â£ 2.99 seems to be a good deal and it is. Thing is the movie is called "To Kill For". It took a bit of detective work to figure out his original name. <br /> <br /> In the UK, he was ranked 18 and rightly so, although the standard of the films depends on the "ability to sell." Having seen Final Destination 3 last night, in my opinion, it should have been 18. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the fact that the charming Traci Lords are in it tends to get the grading frame up to 18. It's a shame. <br /> <br /> Traci is an excellent actress and should have the chance to appear in larger and larger productions. She is able to turn what is called B-Movies into a Fine performance, it's nothing short of incredible. <br /> <br /> Viva Traci Lords and her incredible talent as an actress.
