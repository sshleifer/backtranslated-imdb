I do not just consider this to be the best film Jon Voight ever made, but a true tribute to the teachers. Despite the incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) was able to reach out to a group of students and bring them out of nowhere for basic literacy and world awareness. His methods can be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but professors like Conroy will always win. <br /> Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that he was a natural. high for him. he did not overdo the paper, and I found him totally totally believable. Voight is Conrack. <br /> <br /> In addition to the love of teaching, we also see another important point in this film. No matter how good you are at your job, if you rock the boat, the bureaucrats will get you.
