I remember seeing it in the theaters when I left, having no idea what it would be and being so pleasantly surprised that I promised to buy the video when it left. <br /> <br /> Although I do not go very far in dissecting this movie, I'll say I gave it 8/10 for all the reasons you can read in another user's reviews. <br /> <br /> What I'm going to say is this: <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of this movie are amazing. It's the closest to a textbook audience I've ever seen. I once put this movie at a party where everyone was finishing up and getting ready to leave. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Everyone, who attended the opening, stayed until the end.
