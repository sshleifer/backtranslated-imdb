What makes this documentary special from a cinematic perspective is its passivity; which involves the audience to enjoy the pleasure of gypsy music. It innovates as a documentary while showing a tapestry of sound and movement that invites us to celebrate the primordial likeness found in the traveling music of (historically) travelers. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film itself is a "take" single of sweeping motion that travels the globe and transitions effortlessly from one rhythmic culture to the next. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, someone's breath is carried away by simple beauty in our common connection to music, rhythm and dance. If there is a deeper and spiritual homage to the sound and movement of Gypsy cultures, it still needs to be filmed.
