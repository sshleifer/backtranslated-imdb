It is not uncommon for a great director's last film to become such a moving, brilliantly executed and filmed masterpiece. The cast is great, just like the camera work. What begins as a cheerful gathering of a group of well-educated citizens of Dublin from the early 20th century turns into a somber and philosophical narrative about all of our fear of death and the sometimes dark shadows of the past. Thank you, Mr. Huston, for this last great film!
