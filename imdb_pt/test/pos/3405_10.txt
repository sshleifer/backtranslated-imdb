I was 13 when this mini-series (and its sequel North and South, Book II) aired for the first time. I had already been captivated by the stories of personal interest in / around our American Civil War, which is what interested me in watching this program made for TV. <br /> <br /> I loved it. And now I'm 29 years old and I just love it more. It's full of history, gorgeous costumes, real-life characters interspersed with and out of the life of fictional characters, of whom you care deeply. There is intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, extended family, lust, battles, victory, defeat and rebuilding. <br /> <br /> Although I had the full set of episodes on tapes, I recorded it when originally in the air, I bought the complete set of N & S and N & S II from Columbia House a few years ago when they became available . Once every few years I'm going to have a whole weekend and watch all the plots from behind - and I'm saddened when the last episode comes to an end, because I see myself wanting to continue watching the life story of these characters. I can not recommend this miniseries anymore.
