This scene shows how Wallace's experiment using his invention of brain-manipulation gives terribly wrong, creating the "Rabbit Era." His desire as a social entrepreneur is to improve society for the better, so he created a "Brain Manipulator" machine. He risked his own life to help solve the problem of Tottington's pest rabbit and, more importantly, to overcome the overcrowding of rabbits collected and stored in his basement. Although he thought his experiment worked, however, it resulted in putting more pressure on him and Gromit to find a solution before the Annual Vegetable Competition, risking his life again. Gromit, who is a faithful and quiet dog and a loyal helper, finds himself continually thinking of innovative ways to save his master, his crazy and radical inventions going terribly wrong. What is interesting in this film is trying to identify: who is more enterprising, Wallace or Gromit?
