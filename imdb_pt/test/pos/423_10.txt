I like "Hack". Think of the "Lone Ranger" reincarnated as a 2000-year-old taxi driver, a decent but flawed guy in Philadelphia doing his best while looking for trouble from a troubled past, and you have the synopsis. David Morse is almost perfect as Olshansky. He helps people, but instead of riding "silver" in the old west, he drives a taxi through the streets of contemporary Philadelphia without distributing silver bullets. The support cast is first class and well above average. Sometimes the witty dialogue almost reaches the level of the classic 1970s series, "The Rockford Files." This show deserves a comeback, hopefully at a better time than 9PM Friday (East).
