With nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie filmmaker Neil LaBute (in the company of men, her friends and neighbors) makes her big budget advance (Betty's $ 24 million as opposed to the meager $ 25,000), mainstream - and still remains true to its roots. While his cast is now comprised of top-notch Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman and comedian Chris Rock), his material remains as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he may be next. Big Deal. Nurse Betty is one of the darkest comedies to be announced to a mainstream audience for years, and considering her moderate box office and critical success, maybe viewers were not as dumb and brainwashed as we thought. The story follows (both figuratively AND literally) a na√Øve waitress (Zellweger) who fell in love with a handsome soap star (as good as he is Greg Kinnear), but is stuck in a loveless marriage to a car dealer viscous (Aaron Eckhart, who made his big screen debut in The Company). When her husband is horribly murdered by two murderers (Freeman and Rock), she is sent to a state of shock and, indifferently, leaves for Hollywood to find her object of affection - not knowing that he is just an actor. When Freeman and Rock discover that the car she's carrying contains 10 pounds of cocaine, they take the road too and scandal ensues. Fans of LaBute's earlier work may find it difficult to figure out how this could be the same guy who drove in The Company of Men - a tragic comedy about two ruthless male chauvinists who play a joke with a deaf coworker - but when you think about The connection is very clear: in the company, a vulnerable woman does not know that she is being ruthlessly taken advantage of. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife does not know that the man she is chasing thinks her genuine worship is no more than a joke. Some may begin to wonder if LaBute is actually some kind of misogynist - considering that its recurring theme involves the fall of innocent women. But personally, I think he's coming to the defense of the beautiful sex and dealing much harder with the aggressors in his photos than with the abuse. One of the many charms of this film is that the absurdity is complete: most directors, in dealing with a script like this, would leave the story of two murderers chasing after a woman who is chasing a dream. But LaBute knows best and has one of the killers (Freeman) obsessively falling for Betty as well. This was an interesting role for Freeman because he allowed him to play with his trademark "this-is-the-last-time" character (see Unforgiven, Se7en, and 1998 Hard Rain); the supporting cast also includes such names as the famous weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney and Kathleen Wilhoite of Mad About You. The screenplay, written by the newcomers John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is deliriously over-the-top -top (honestly: have you ever seen a comedy - or ANY movie, incidentally - in which a man is scalped in his own dining room?). You could argue that the ending is a bit too perfect, but it really is not worth denying everything that is great about the movie to a trivial complaint. If Nurse Betty is any sign of what LaBute has in store for us then you can bet I'll be lining up for whatever he decides to go through with it. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
