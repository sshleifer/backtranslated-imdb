This was a funny, romantic and simple movie. I really liked it and definitely would say to watch and enjoy, Will Smith was funny, fumbling, nervous, sweet and just a simple guy who was hit by Love. It was cute to see him falling in love with someone and being so nervous and lost about what to do or say. It was great. He was great, funny as ever. Eva Mendes was better than I expected her to be too, I thought there were moments in the movie where Will took the ax, he was doing everything he could be a good guy and still be treated badly. The ending was romantic and happy and it was great. I've seen it several times and watched it again. A funny movie, something you do not see anymore. He had the old time with a new look.
