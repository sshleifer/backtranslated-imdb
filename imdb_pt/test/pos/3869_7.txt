Bart The Genius Although not the first episode of the Simpsons, Bart he Genius is more or less the first typical episode. There are no tricks or themes, it's just your typical Simpsons episode on set-up. It always seems to me that it's an episode that grows in you. There are certain elements that do not interest me, largely the stained animation that can be forgiven. But over time, I like this story of its uniqueness. <br /> <br /> For example, it would be very difficult for a sit-com live-action with a standard budget to make this episode several different sets appearing in this episode, the computer stalls in Mrs. Melon's room, the opera and so on. My point is with that, The Simpsons realizes one of the greatest strengths in animation. The simple lack of visual limitations when compared to live action. <br /> <br /> From a writing point of view, she is also highly intelligent and innovative. The concept is very singular and particularly the problems faced. Instead of the failure proof that the work was very difficult, it was simply Bart's social isolation from his classmates who failed him (although the explosion of the scientific experiment may prove otherwise ... I also think I am one of the best jokes of the series.) The ending seems a little unoriginal, largely because Bart running naked in his room to avoid Homer was already wearing the shorts, but it's still funny for the short and lows of Marge and Lisa if not go for nothing else. /> <br /> Ultimately, it's a very good episode with many new interesting points in the series, though not exactly perfect. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the now iconic name Kwijybo was, of course, cast on the world.
