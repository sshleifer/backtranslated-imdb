Wales seems to be producing some quirky movies recently. In fact, Wales seems to be developing its own small film industry. I recently saw Very Annie Mary, which I thought was very good. But Plots with a View is not just quirky, it's funny out loud, it has a cast of wonderfully talented actors (Brenda Blethyn is amazing), and a plot that, while not totally original, is so cleverly written that it is always picking cheerfully. which can be almost disposable lines. It was the kind of movie I wanted to watch again right away, and one of the few that I really wanted to have. Even though many of the characters are caricatures, and you have to have gone to a Welsh village to appreciate it, they are also very human, and the relationship between Blethyn and Molina is a joy to behold.
