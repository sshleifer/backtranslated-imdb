Travis (James Franco) is a young man who walks by train for business reasons (we suppose) that leaves his beloved phone behind. He is caught by a prostitute, Terri (Rachel Miner), and when he goes to his town to pick him up, a series of events occurs that will stay with him forever. <br /> <br /> Both characters have barriers that they put up to defend themselves from communication. But despite their facades, it is obvious that both are eager to overthrow them. In total, there are about 30 spoken lines, but the way James Franco and Rachel Miner use their faces, you can also turn off the volume, words are unnecessary. One scene to be seen is Terri staring at herself in the mirror. You can feel your despair permeating the room. <br /> <br /> But the movie is not perfect. It is mostly shot using handheld cameras, which causes a bit of distraction. Mainly due to Mr. Franco and Miner's acting and photography, the shortcomings of the script do not stand out so much. Still, it sometimes seems like the story does not really know where you want to go. <br /> <br /> After all, this is the kind of movie that really stays with you long after watching it. An hour after you see it, you're still behaving on behalf of certain characters. Not flawless, but still leaves you wanting more, wishing it were at least 4x longer.
