... the dream of a true geek girl: high-tech, great drama, smart-asses, steamy sex and big bangs. (VERY BIG EXPULSIONS.) Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that the REAL Oppenheimer tapes sound strange: apparently he had a voice like Ronald Reagan! Oppenheimer's triumph and tragedy is one of the most tumultuous dramas of the 20th century, and this film is a model of what the document should be: facts can speak for themselves, while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill the record, not to draw attention to itself. An interesting fact: some of the technical details used have been recently declassified and therefore are of particular interest. Unmissable!
