This is the best movie ever, but that's my opinion. Some say it's tacky, but I think it's really a beautiful movie. The chemistry between Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze is like no other I've ever seen, and that's what makes the movie so perfect. I always wonder what would have been in this film if these two actors never existed, because not only did one of them do it for me, they both did. If you've never seen this movie, when will you understand what I mean. Dirty Dancing looks like it was made from the heart and looks so real for some reason, like magic and the LOVE IT soundtrack. Besides the two main actors, the soundtrack makes the movie the beauty that it is. As you can tell, I'm in love with this movie and I know you will too.
