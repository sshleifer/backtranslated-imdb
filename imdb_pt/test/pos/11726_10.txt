Dirty Harry goes to Atlanta is what Burt called the fantastic first-rate detective thriller, which takes part of his plot of the venerable Dana Andrews movie, "Laura." Burt Reynolds not only starred in this superb saga, but also directed it and did not make a single mistake, either staging the action or with its cast of characters. It is not a poor performance in the film and Reynolds does an excellent job of directing it. Henry Silva is really cold as a killer. <br /> <br /> Detective Tom Sharky (Burt Reynolds) is in a narcotics case in Atlanta when things go wrong. He ends up chasing a suspect and firing a sniper on a bus. During the confusion, an innocent bystander dies. John Woo's "The Killer" replicates this scene. Anyway, the Atlanta Police Department knocks Burt to the Vice and he takes orders from a new boss, Frisco (Charles Durning from "Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?") In the basement. Sharky ends up in a real crime pit. Sharky and his fellow detectives Arch (Bernie Casey) and Papa (Brian Keith) set up surveillance on a high priced girl named Dominoe (Rachel Ward from "After Dark, My Sweet") who has a luxury apartment that she shares with another girl . Dominoe is seeing a local politician Hotchkins (Earl Holliman of "Police Woman") on the side who is campaigning for governor, but the main villain, Victor (Vittorio Gassman of "The Dirty Game") wants him to end the case. Hotchkins is reluctant to accommodate Victor, so Victor Cocaine smelling Billy Score (Henry Silva of "Wipeout") finishing Dominoe. Billy opens a hole the size of a twelve-inch pizza on the door of Dominoe's apartment and kills it. <br /> <br /> Sharky did the unthinkable. During the watch, he fell in love with Dominoe to the point of falling hopelessly in love with her. Sharky's mission in life now is to munch Victor, but he discovers that Victor has an informant inside the Atlanta Police Department. The plot really heats up when Sharky discovers that Billy shot the wrong girl and that Dominoe is still alive! Sharky takes her into protective custody and things get even more complicated. He sets up his "Machine" title to deal with Victor and his hoods. <br /> <br /> William Fraker's widescreen action lenses are immaculate. Unfortunately, this widely underrated classic is only available as a full-frame movie. Fraker definitely contributes to the atmosphere of the image, especially during the mutilation scene on the boat when the villain cut off one of Sharky's fingers. This is a pretty awful scene. <br /> <br /> Burt never made a movie that outlasted "Sharky's Machine".
