Yes, 2:37 is, in a sense, a robbery of Gus van Sants Elephant. It's about some students who are dealing with their problems leading to the suicide of one of them. Yes, it's full of clich√©s, but it's life. You can not deny that scary nerds, people with disabilities or popular students who, despite their popularity, have problems in the real world. <br /> <br /> But this is not, what is this movie. It's not about living in high school. It is not the misery of one's own life. <br /> <br /> If you look below the surface, under the soap-like social relations that are shown, you will find some exciting and instigating criticisms of our society. Why do people commit suicide? Do we really understand your motives? Or are we just trying to understand, after it's too late? And why is it always someone, you never expect it to be? <br /> <br /> This movie does not answer that question but raises it. And this happens in a very intense way. All the way you keep guessing, whose blood might be, you see at first. You are following the paths of some students, all of them having a more or less good reason to end their lives, only to be forced to watch the horrible act in the end. <br /> <br /> Did you know who it would be? Or were you taken by surprise, like in real life? <br /> <br /> The message is verbalized by one of the surviving children in the end. We are always so fixated on our own problems, we forget to see those of others. There may be someone, a colleague, a friend who does not want to live any longer. But if you do not open your eyes, you'll never know until it's too late. <br /> <br /> This movie is good. It may have some flaws, but they do not matter anymore when they're done. Either you see a reflection of society or you are blind to reality.
