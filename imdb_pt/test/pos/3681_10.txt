I saw this movie for the first time at a queer film festival. 10 minutes after the movie ended, a gay couple came to me and asked if I needed help - I was still sitting, crying like a maniac. The movie is bizarre, it's bizarre, it's exaggerated, it's gay - but it's incredible. I think every character is plausible. Everett's character is bad for a woman who only tries to help, he brutally throws his friends (terrible), has a temper, can hurt a fly, the "fly" that killed the love of his life, doubly. Bates is a miracle, she's perfect, just like a role. A woman whose love and admiration is so strong that even she loves the homosexual lover of her idol is to me the essence of true love. I even understand Max (the husband), he is bored with his life, he has a midlife crisis. He moves, tries to lead an exciting life, only to realize a) that he is the really boring part in the relationship and b) that he loves his wife. I love the fact that she comes back to him in the end because I think it gives the movie the right balance between dream and reality. Because in the end he is her husband and he may not be as exciting as Victor, but he is real, he is the man she loves in a very realistic way. I watched about 50 times and I love this movie, all about it unconditionally. BTW, just read the autobiography of Rupert Everett and UL is the only film he speaks as one of the best movies he has ever done. For me it's the best film he's ever made.
