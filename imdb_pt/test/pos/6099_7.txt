"Hit and Run" is a stunning story starring the always wonderful Margaret Colin as a society lady who "has it all" until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene. Hence the title. The tragedy is that she will ask for help and return, but is frightened by angry passers-by who think the hitter has left the scene. This was done on days when not everyone had a cell phone or there would not be a story. <br /> <br /> Colin's guilt and anguish are palpable and make her act so strangely that a detective stands on her right. far. Your lies sink deeper and deeper into a hole of self-loathing, making it worsen a bad situation. <br /> <br /> This is a very thought-provoking story, and we can not help but feel it. The lady's pain, wishing she would just come clean. Like a TV movie, thanks to Colin and a strong script, this is a TV movie well above average.
