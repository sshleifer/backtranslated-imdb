22. JOE (drama, 1970) Joe (Peter Boyle) is a racist factory worker who is known for hating "hippies and children." He meets Bill, a businessman who has just murdered the mistress of his daughter, drug addict Jill (Susan Sarandon). Jill runs off and joins a hippie community on the outskirts of town. Bill asks Joe for help. Their quest leads them through the most troublesome parts of the city, where the hatred and inner hatred of both men are tested. This was the first success of director John G. Avildsen (an incredible race that included: 'Rocky', 'Karate Kid', 'Split-Image', 'Weekend at Bernie's' ). The film is interesting enough in that it served to encapsulate the themes and ideas of the turbulent 1960s (Vietnam War, Black Power, Women's Lib, etc.). Also has a good performance of Peter Boyle as Joe, one of the first movie anti-heroes. He has always been good at playing scary, bossy kids whose abstract ideas are reinforced by his intimidating presence (he would play Frankenstein's monster in Mel Brook's parody, Young Frankenstein). It reminds me of a little child trapped in a big, stupid, awkward body. The film has a weak script (the meeting of Joe and Bill, for example, is a bit accidental), but has a particularly shocking ending, after Taxi Driver. CITATION: Song title: "I saw a guy selling junk to kids. He gets nervous every time I step in because he knows that if I get him, I'm going to kick his head and kick the fat from it for $ 3. "
