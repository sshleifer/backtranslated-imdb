I love this show! It's incredible ... I can never miss an episode, even though I've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parties ... I Love Gilmore Girls! I have all my friends to watch. even their parents watch now. I watch daily and usually watch more than once a day. I wanted my mother to be like Lorelei. my friends say that I speak and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful relationship between mother and daughter. is a great program for teenagers because they really learn by watching. my vocabulary widened while watching Gilmore Girls. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bled are perfect for the parts of Lorelei and Rory. I think Luke and Lorelai should get married because Chris left Lorelei and Rory many times. and broke Lorelei's heart too many times.
