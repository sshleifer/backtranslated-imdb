It seems to me that a lot of people do not know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and others. What all these heroes (and in the case of the X-Men group of heroes) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better boring word. So boring that the character was archived and has never been used in the Marvel universe. At least until it's reinvented. <br /> <br /> David Goyer made a stroke of genius when he took over the Blade character and turned him into a dark knight dressed in leather. He can not take all the credit though and a lot of it should be for Stephen Norrington as well as who with his distinctive visual style brings the best of character. The character Blade (Wesley Snipes) is quite amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman as the darkness. Snipes is very good as the title character and is successful in bringing the character's duality and inner demons. He is, however, a fairly rigid actor, both in voice and posture, and is just interesting enough for a film (which is clearly seen from the lower sequels). Kris Kristofferson is good too and really brings the tormented character of Whistler to life with energy and sense of opportunity. N'Bushe Wright, however, is quite weak as a protagonist, making his character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is very funny and can do a lot with a minor character. The German, Udo Kier, should also be mentioned, since he brings a lot of subtlety and style to the vampire race, probably born of his experiences while playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf offers the best performances in the film and his chilling performance when Deacon Frost is one of the best screen villains I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story is good and, I feel, renew the vampire. genre (something that has not been done since "From Dusk Till Dawn" by Robert Rodrigues), adding many contemporary elements and retaining the comic sense. Saying that the film has a comic sense does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. A lot of effort was made to try to make the film look as real as possible. Including effects that are very good for your time. I found vampire dustings as a very nice touch. Instead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies, Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously burst, which sounds great. The fact that the overall effects were well done increases the credibility of the film that otherwise would have fallen flat on the floor. <br /> <br /> As stated earlier, Norrington has a very distinctive visual style that sets you apart from the directors of the following Blade movies. Del Toro is almost as skillful, but I prefer the Norrington style. His style gives the film a very special look and feel, but more importantly, it gives it a cinematographic atmosphere. A very tense dark atmosphere that works very well in tune with the main character and story. Along with the visual style, the music also works well and adds a lot to the movie's atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In total, Blade is a very entertaining movie that should probably have an 8 of me, but a few annoying glitches (which can not be revealed without spoiling the movie, suffice to say, many of them are located close of the end of the film) that the film must solve with a high 7. <br /> <br /> 7/10
