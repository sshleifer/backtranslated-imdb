The historical drama is one area in which the British can not be overcome. So while I'm not a big fan of the genre, I can usually be persuaded to watch something lite this if it's British and with decent actors. <br /> <br /> I've never read anything about Sarah Waters, which is of course something I should do. So I really did not know what to expect from this. I had heard that there would be a lesbian love story, but not much else. While watching I thought it was much more interesting than I had anticipated. Without saying much, the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected and well-crafted. Although there was almost a turnaround somewhere, it took me a minute to figure it all out. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are good, the actors are very solid and the pace is decent, although I find it a bit slow in the last half hour. This may just be me, I usually have a problem with dragging movies after the plot is more or less over. All in all, this is a very pleasant three hours. I recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas.
