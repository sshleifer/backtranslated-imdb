David Lynch's ninth feature Mulholland Drive is a deeply moving story about betrayal and jealousy. If anything, it brutally contrasts our ambitions and hopes for the often bitter truth. Each frame of this film has importance and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time. Nothing is what it seems to be and you get a real puzzle when you try to piece together. It's a film that does not compromise, nor does it fail to fully address the challenging form and the camera language, as might have been the case previously with Lost Highway. While clearly recognizing classic motifs and devices, the film remains highly original, even in the light of being a Lynch movie. Lost Highway marked a new way of telling a story; created an unconventional way of putting emotions on the screen. With Mulholland Drive, Lynch not only managed to control this technique, but took it to new levels, making it much more complex and multidimensional. In doing so, it creates a picture of different layers in time and the human mind. At a press conference at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, David Lynch said that the quest for perfection could at best yield a result in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Talking about such synergies becomes highly relevant to Mulholland Dr., where the different sequences and many details contribute to the total; dreamscapes and parallels intertwine to create history. In some arts, the beauty of this lies in its simplicity. This is not the case with Mulholland Drive and has never been with Lynch. It is the complexity that colors and builds the worlds that Lynch creates, the same complexity that characterizes the real world. <br /> <br /> It is never forced like, in my opinion, for example, Memento, using an original way of communicating with viewers. Comparing Mulholland Drive with other films, I think this proves David Lynch as a master of what he does and bridges art and film in a way no one has ever done. Compared, for example, to Alejandro Jodorowsky or to contemporary Matthew Barney, I believe that Lynch can more clearly not let the artist dominate the filmmaker or, more likely, David Lynch understands better and performs the production of films as an art form. Understanding the plot is no small thing, but Lynch's way of working with sound, perspective, chronology, and form paints a work of art so somber and scary that at times it seems more realistic than real life. The filmmakers cinema is often, and definitely on Mulholland Drive, a wave of human emotions. Working with emotions is a delicate craft that requires understanding and depth. As Lynch puts it, "A little too much, and the excitement is gone. A little too much, and that does not happen." At Mulholland Drive, David Lynch has no problem making that balance. Lynch's portraits cover all kinds of dimensions and take different directions, creating incredibly realistic characters and situations. Watching Mulholland Drive is a journey through the subconscious. It is a true and naked film with indisputable artistic value. That's why I love Mulholland Drive and what drove it to the pinnacle of movie history. The final movie.
