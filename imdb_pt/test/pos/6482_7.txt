The Beat was an exciting film about a couple of young punks trying to survive in New York in the 1980s. This involves fighting with the other street gang with whom they directly share a high school class, try to stay in school as well as go to local shows that involve bands similar to the Dead Kennedy and have the name Skulls by the name of the band. Rex (played by David Jacobson) plays an autistic boy who starts to spend a lot of time with all these guys, and begins to show that poetry is really beautiful, and if applied to what these children do in life can really make things work for the best! Billy Kane (played by William McNamara) and Kate Kane (played by Kara Glover) are brother and sister. Although they roll with this mob of thugs, these children are not the same kind of people as this group. They take care of Rex and they care about others, and really show a lit side of themselves. While her sister sleeps with Gang's head, she is also falling in love with Rex, trying to show him that she is not a bitch. But in the end, the school's teachers finally come to him and want to put him in a mental institution, he finally feels it's time to end his life while Animals of Sound played without him. But they like to think that he is not dead, he is just living his life to the fullest, riding sharks and being happy living in the ocean. This movie was one of those films that I was happy to see. Although it was extremely entertaining, he also had a great message for him. Something for a long time the lines that these children had no direction, no future, no figure heads to look up but because a troubled child came together they all realized that there were much more important things to life then fighting the local black children, or being destructive to everything. Rex showed them the beauty of angry music. Rex showed them the beauty in Rats, Disease and Murder. Rex showed that beauty in almost everything, while some of these things have no beauty involved, they were still able to see that when used in poems, these poems speak to people. Rex played a major role in this movement, which changed everyone's heart to depression, to see that there is hope for them, which is why he began to show them; The Beat.
