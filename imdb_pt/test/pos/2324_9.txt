I just discovered this movie and I love it. Just the right mix of moving story, fun characters, hilarious moments (but not overloaded with stupid jokes) and fun presentations by Kelsey Grammar, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron Schneider, Rip Torn and more. Buckman is especially good, and I really enjoyed watching the guy who played Stapanick. <br /> <br /> I also find it interesting that they used a real submarine, the Pampanito, to run the scenes above and imitate that almost exactly. for their sets. The decor of the setting is really impressive if you do a digital tour of Pampanito online and compare it to movie scenes. They did a great job on this movie. <br /> <br /> What a fun and truly enjoyable movie!
