The main criticism of AT THE EARTH'S CORE is that it's cheap, the special effects are bad, and so on. Yes, some of the special effects are painfully bad, but what many people ignore about it is that it's really a lot of fun, which is very important in my book. <br /> <br /> By comparison, just look at the latest STAR WARS Movies: they have the latest and greatest special effects created by the latest technological advances that are capable of creating stunning visual effects that the human imagination can imagine and yet, with all the dazzle, these films were as exciting as a funeral. As Yoda would say, fun they are not! In other words, who cares if the FX is not the greatest when the spirit of the film is fast, humorous and clearly placed next to the action. I love everything in the NUCLEUS OF THE EARTH: the contrast between Victorian England indigestible VS the otherworldly, colorful scenery of Pellucidar, the cast of characters, the concept of a lost underground world, the telepathic Pterodactyls, human slaves rebelling, Jubal the ugly (lol!), The inspired team of Peter Cushing (that's great!) And Doug McClure, the great music (really good), the cinematography of the incredible Alan Hume and last but not least, Caroline Munro. She's feeling sexy in this movie. One of the sexiest B-movie girls ever captured on screen. <br /> <br /> Seriously, anyone who does not like this movie does not know what fun is. Give me in the EARTH NUCLEUS about any lush STAR WARS star at any time! At least there's Caroline Munro, which no CGI fx can recreate.
