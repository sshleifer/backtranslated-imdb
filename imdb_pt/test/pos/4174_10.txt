What can I say about this movie that was not said by all the other reviews here, they pretty much sum it all up, people who love to enjoy it, people who hate it ... well, they hate it. This is the cinematic equivalent of Marmite. Personally, I dedicated every second to memory, it is cyclical, claustrophobic, introspective, magical, and stands out as one of the most exclusive films of all time. Despite what many have stated, I believe this is really a cult movie, it's a rough diamond just waiting to be discovered, once unearthed is fantastic psychedelic visual and incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable, which is an achievement in itself. One of my friends who watched this compared more to a musical, and in many ways to those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made, would probably take more advantage of it by seeing Head as such. I've always liked the Monkees, especially the TV show when it was replayed during the '80s. My mother had recorded Head for me when it was shown on TV late at night because she knew I liked them , watched a day later and stayed in my memory until I was able to find a DVD copy about 2 decades later, which I would love now is a special edition, it would be fascinating to get a bigger insight into creating this masterpiece. We can just wait.
