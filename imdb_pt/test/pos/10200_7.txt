This western was created in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were established by Western Union. While cool guy Dean Jagger (boasting lots of hair) did his best to do this, there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons. So it's up to Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the day. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the best westerns of the 1940s that I have seen and almost amassed an 8 - it was so good. However, for my life, I have no idea why Fritz Lang was assigned to direct this film - after all, he knew nothing about Westerns. His forte was the drama - and I think this movie is a kind of drama - just set in the old west. Strange, yes, but it seemed to work well, though I wonder how this great German director felt about that job. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the film, it is exceptional - with vivid colors. , great filming location and very good acting. As usual, Randolph Scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance. I was surprised, however, with Robert Young also being cast for the film, but it was a good escalation decision - he should be a Harvard-trained orientalist. When I saw Barton MacLane was also in the movie, I practically assumed he would be the "villain" and my thoughts were well-founded, since he made a career of idiots! As for the script, it seemed pretty common for the most part, but the final showdown between Scott and Barton MacLane was far better than I'd expected - making this movie end on a very high note.
