Business versus personal conviction. Profit versus Art <br /> <br /> As with any documentary that puts large capitalist corporations against the small producer, the viewer will invariably have to take sides with one or another based on their own beliefs. This is both a documentary of the new standardized way of doing things that globalization is bringing us, against the old traditional ways in which the character and art of doing things matter more than getting the product sold. <br /> <br /> If you have to remember one thing about this movie, it is that the masses can no longer decide for themselves, they only follow the taste of one or two critics who tend to equalize and standardize the taste just as MacDonalds used to do for the quick bite (something Parker himself admits in the movie against a backdrop of a Burger King plate). "It's all about image" against content, as another respondent says. This is the easy way, the standardized path. Easier than taking the time for a good wine to mature, easier than forging your own taste, trying and trying even more once. The taste of the controlled brand is easier. <br /> <br /> There is a glimmer of hope when even some of our cousins ​​on the other side of the ocean agree that some people are "leveling" the taste of wine to maximize profits and ensure maximum. is sold for the "gray masses". Individuality and difference are sacrificed for extra money. It is good to see that not all or all are yielding to standardization, even on the other side of the ocean. <br /> <br /> As in many other areas of the world today, the domain of few and reduced freedoms of choice affects us all. ... let everyone decide and decide what to do. Too much standardization kills mind and taste; The difference brings innovation and healthy competition and will allow for choice - not just the "more of the same" vacuum-packed. Standardization sells easily and much, and brings everyone to the same level - the bottom. <br /> <br /> In this, I'll open a good bottle and wish you a hearthy "sante".
