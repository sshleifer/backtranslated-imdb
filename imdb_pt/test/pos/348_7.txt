What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson movie? Are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories? You would think so for some of the comments. Al Adamson's films are despicable and sloppy, not much more then if you get into them knowing that this already helps, and they should not necessarily be taken seriously, especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value. First, this starts by ripping out the final theme song of Outer Limits, so you know things are looking promising. This is the story of a crazy cult that lives in the hills and, when trying to raise a corpse, the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital. Of course Nurse Sherri meets your needs and everything, and when an operation is needed, she simply stays in the operating room when the guy passes by for his spirit to invade her. And Nurse Sherri starts to change. No longer the beautiful nurse, she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects. There are some small parallel stories going on like people trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blind soccer star who became the love object of one of Sherri's co-workers who also just happens to get involved in voodoo. This is not bad if you are a fan of cult movies, but it can be bad if you are a fan of "Spiderman" because you will not like it. Sometimes this really goes around "respectability" (for Adamson, anyway), but "do not redeem: with some ridiculous event. If you like the Adamson movies and similar garbage, you might like that, for anyone who is looking for for a lost treasure, keep digging, 7 of 10.
