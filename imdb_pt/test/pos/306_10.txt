Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) was sent on a secret mission in Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), since he was completely insane and is no longer taking orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the military, it is difficult for Captain Willard to understand how Colonel Kurtz could have gone as deep as he, killing without authorization and taking the war into his own hands. What could possibly have pushed this great man to the top? Through Willard's long journey through the forest to find his target, he tries, with some success, to understand why. But what will he decide to do when he finds him? Any movie that can start with The Doors' The End is a great movie in my book, especially if it flows with humor. and images shown with music. Apocalypse Now does it perfectly. I can think of nothing better for this, the Vietnam War and the insanity in the minds of the soldiers it has created. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of Vietnam's most daring forests, whose ultimate destination is murder. Through the use of music and score, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence and insanity. A perfect example of how to set humor through music is this movie here. <br /> <br /> A large general cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread through our desire to make bread. I do not like Fishburne, since I discovered he was Cowboy Curtis at PeeWee's theater, my contempt and hatred for that man increased tenfold. I realize the pettiness of it, but I just do not care. We need Gary Oldman sick in it. Brando is excellent as Colonel Kurtz and I can not think of any other actor who could have played the good crazed man and have that presence on screen. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the movie has to be Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore of Robert Duvall. Before that movie, I never imagined Duvall as a cowboy during the war, but honestly it's my favorite of his parts even today. He simply preached his character, who is one of the best in the whole film, like the commander of the Air Cavalry who loves to surf. Maybe a bit exaggerated, but still brilliant. I also love the smell of napalm in the morning. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple and it does not take much intelligence to figure out what's going on. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, pure and simple. But it is the journey of the film that is really the heart and also the terrible situations of the war itself. In the version of Redux we are forced to sit through the French plantation scene and the Playboy Bunny scene, which really adds nothing to the whole picture in addition to making it a longer journey. I do not feel they take anything, it's just a matter of whether you want to watch a three-and-a-half hour movie or the original. Throughout this journey, the film points to the futility and irrelevance of the war for Americans and the enormous effect it has had on the soldiers who fought in it ... in fact, that's the main point. In addition, the troops were not supported by the public and this might well have helped lead a character like Kurtz to go completely crazy. <br /> <br /> A great lover of war movies, this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all of them classics. I sometimes try to compare movies of the same genre, but this has put me in trouble in the past in my reviews, since I had to go back on what I said. All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War ... so to actually say that one is better than the other is rather foolish ... even after having seen more recently AN I think it is A little better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a true classic in any version and worthy of the status it was given. As a fellow reviewer has previously stated, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made.
