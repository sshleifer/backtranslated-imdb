I've been watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and I really have not started to love the show until Season 4 begins. This episode "Hush" was seen by me alone in the dark just after midnight with my windows open and the wind blowing furiously through a storm afterwards. The writers of this episode did an excellent job of scaring me. I was impressed by the whole episode that I just finished two minutes ago. Incredible does not touch the surface of what this episode does with almost no dialogue. If you've never thought about it, at least watch this episode. If that does not impress you, no episode will likely. <br /> <br /> BTW My Heart is still running ...
