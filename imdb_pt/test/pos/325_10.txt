This movie is absolute gold. If you have not seen it, do it. Mani Ratnam outdoes himself once more. This film introduced me to Nandita Das as well, although everyone shines in this film. My only regret is that I never found a copy with lyrics for the lyrics. We are taken from the jungle of northern Sri Lanka to the serene beaches of southern India, as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest for love of the human heart. Beautiful, subtle, witty, with some hidden surprises waiting for the viewer, this movie rises to be seen again and again, and the story within the story, The Umbrella, is done very well, as we watch the scene unfold from of drawings in a book. Lovely. Watch.
