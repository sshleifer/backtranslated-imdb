It's too bad iameracing wants to deny the reality of Faulkner and Clarence Brown's purpose in creating the story and film of "Intruder In The Dust." I suppose the weight of a story of racism is hard for any Southerner to bear and I can understand that. But to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and imprecise. YES (to lend your capitalization), there are many and many places where blacks and whites in the South get along very well. But denying the way blacks were and sometimes are still forced to live, the conditions and injustices they have had to endure are not imaginary. Sometimes black and white people gave themselves because of genuine affection and understanding. Sometimes it was only while the blacks 'knew their place'. The point of making the character of Juano Hernandez (in the film and in the press) a bit prickly, not hot and indistinct, was to emphasize the fact that fanaticism is wrong in itself and human rights are exactly for everyone, regardless of whether we like a particular individual or not. It would be well to fail to deny the existence of racism and the great harm it has inflicted on Americans of all kinds. The fact is that blacks (among others), as a general rule, are not an exception, receive the benefits of the judicial system in the same way as whites. Segregation, discrimination and lynching are historical facts. People like iameracing could claim that these things were not as widespread as some think and would probably love to exonerate their ancestors and heroes from any connection to such behavior. It would be a wonderful thing if the southern ancestors of iameracing (if any) had ever taken part in any of the terrible racist acts that mark the history of this country and hope they did not happen. If that's so much to them, but this fact, if true, does not obliterate the fact that others have. And even if the horrible things that were done to Southern Blacks (and other areas, let's not forget Civil War Disturbances) were so numerous, only a third, would that make them less horrible? The murder of ten children is the hanging of ten men, the sexual assault of ten women is less horrible than the same things happening to a hundred? Iameracing asks us to take the "Mississippi Burning" chip off our shoulders before we see "Intruder In The Dust," well, I ask, did the killings of civil rights activists happen or not? Why should this be forgotten? Forgiven? Perhaps. But to avoid their recurrence, they can not be overlooked or reviewed in small occurrences. The racism that is displayed in "Intruder In The Dust" is displayed there on purpose. It's there to make a point. <br /> <br /> On a historical cinematographic level, it is also ridiculous to distract the racial angle. Any moviegoer who was filmed before the 1960s knows that black actors / characters / extras were usually deliberately escalated. To judge from our film history; wars were always waged by middle-aged white men; There were no blacks in the Wild West; it was possible to walk down a street in a big city and never find a black person; there were no hospital attendants, taxi drivers, clerks, salesmen, etc. Blacks were hardly ever scaled up for a role, unless race was a factor. If Falukner (and Brown) wanted to tell a simple murder story, he probably would not have made Hernandez's character black. <br /> <br /> Racism exists. Probably for different reasons, I'm sure, we both wish this did not happen, but yes. Wanting things to be the way we'd like them to be, they probably can not be helped, but they still do not.
