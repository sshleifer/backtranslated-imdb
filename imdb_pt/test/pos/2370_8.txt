This is a film that must be taken into account. It should not be seen unless you've seen the first two movies, but the kind of person who sees this movie will probably own the box, or at least meet someone who has. And you should not expect Blade Runner; the budget of the movies does not go that far, and it's a much crazier ride. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the film is a science fiction set in the future Yokohama (filmed in Hong Kong, of course) about a society. where it is illegal to breed. Sho Aikawa reruns a similar role as Dead or Alive 2 and Riki Takeuchi is a detective for the birth control police. Takashi Miike is not someone who gives all your reasons to you on a plate, but it can be assumed that the law on procreation (reinforced by giving people the pill) is there because of population, increased life expectancy and so onwards. Curiously, the dialogue in the film is mainly Cantonese, while Sho and Riki (who play their parts, as always, brilliantly) speak Japanese, and some speak English. People criticized English as being wooden, but I did not encounter problems with it. In addition, another person found the themes of homosexuality throughout the film offensive; said that Takashi Miike was anti-homosexual. It may well be (and not all artists have to be left), but I can not see this movie as an insult to homosexuals. It only draws back ancient Greek philosophies when homo or bisexuality was more common. The film contains similar proportions of action-packed moments and poignancy for DoA 2, although in this movie the action is more martial arts-based, and is done in a very good Hong Kong style. Cinematography in the film is very good for the eyes, with symmetrical photos, good control over the colors to give the air a polluted appearance, and it is good to see long uncut photos that are so rare in Hollywood these days. Basically, there is a lot to like in this movie: a good sense of humor, exciting action and some really beautiful moments. It's a great end to the series. You could criticize him for being a little tacky, but is not that part of the charm?
