This movie was great. Something not just for Black History month, but as a reminder of people's kindness and the statement that it really takes a village to raise a child. The performances of S Eptath were excellent. Mos Def and his corner were off the hook. I had to think twice when I saw it was Rosie Perez there. But the supporting cast of actors and actresses made it worth watching. All the different stories they had were incredible. And how the nanny protected Jr and literally everyone who was in his presence. I can really understand that she is the matriarch of that time period, and more so, how she was tired of helping everyone. I can not expect it to come out on DVD. It would be a welcome addition to any movie library.
