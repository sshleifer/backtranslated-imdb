This was an interesting movie ... half-comedy, half-political thriller. It had many good elements, though it was a little predictable. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams stars as Tom Dobbs, a popular comedian with a hit show in which he makes political commentary. Think Daily Show With John Stuart. While recording one of her shows, a woman in the audience says he should run for president. This, followed by some serious jokes, was all that was needed to kick-start and start Dobbs's political career. <br /> <br /> He governs independently and opposes Democrats and Republicans alike. He is direct and honest and becomes more and more popular - but perhaps not popular enough to actually win. He is clearly the weakest in this election. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a corrupt software company has created a program to make voting much quicker and easier for ordinary people - but there is a flaw. The flaw is discovered by a young woman named Elanor (Linnley) who is appeased by the software developer with a lie that he corrected the flaw before the next election. <br /> <br /> Election day arrives and behold Dobbs is declared the winner. (Big surprise!) Elanor knows he's not really the president - he did not legitimately win - She decides to tell the president ... but complications arise. His company even poisoned her to silence her. Plus, she quickly likes Dobbs. <br /> <br /> The plot takes a few twists and turns, before arriving at the slightly predictable conclusion. But it never got boring. Robin was as good as ever, and Christopher Walken often stole the show as Dobbs' manager, who became a political adviser and best friend. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie and it has a good message. I recommend if you are in the mood for dark satire, or something that makes you think. Overall I give it a 7/10.
