I can not say I liked it that much from "The Big Lebowski" or "Raising Arizona", and I felt a little disdainful, but "The Brother" is a nice film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of Coens' animation. , twisted sense of creativity. The DVD edition contains the feature, and I was interested to discover that the Coen are quite simple in their techniques of direction. This surprised me! Of course this movie is not the best example (and I'm just saying this in comparison) and it was not worthy of any Oscar (many think it was stolen), but maybe it depends on the appeal. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed the Coens' previous work, I was never a fan of the Western or The Dukes of Hazzard or anything else they show on TNN every day. I think that's why I do not feel so enthusiastic about checking out this movie, since it revolves around folk from the south. For all those in the South who are reading this, I do not mean to offend your people! I'm sure you feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like "The Bronx Tale." When you live in the city all your life, it's hard to get used to movies of that nature. But all the excuses aside, I found the characters amusing and quirky. I think John Turturro hit the accent perfectly, and seeing the way he talks in real life, I find that incredible. Tim Blake Nelson was good too. Of course, George Clooney - which I assume is not the best in pretending accents, judging by his decision to launch the idea of ​​working with a dialogue coach and developing a New England accent for "The Perfect Storm" - of course it seems a bit miscast and continually struggles with the accent. His performance was good, though. You can also identify Coen goers, such as Holly Hunter (in a short but sweet role) and John Goodman (also onscreen for a short time, but steal every minute of it). <br /> <br /> Although I do not usually know I like country music, I liked the title song "A Man of Constant Sorrow". The DVD also contains the music video for that song. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found the film fun and original, but it does not have the quality that the Coens have shown us in the past. It's a smaller effort, but good. I still suggest you check this out. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (of 10)
