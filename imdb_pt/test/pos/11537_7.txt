This is a case where the script plays with the audience in a way that only serves to extend this story to 90 minutes. The story begins in 1969, where a young girl named Faith (Cameron Diaz) travels to Europe with her boyfriend Wolf (Christopher Eccleston), but she dies in mysterious circumstances. Then, in 1976, Faith's sister, Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) decides to travel to Europe and try to find out what happened to her sister. In France, she looks for Wolf who stayed there and wants him to help her redo the steps her sister took and answer some questions. He is reluctant but decides to travel with her. Along the way, he fills in the gaps of the occurrences and tells Phoebe that Faith has joined the Red Army, which is an extremist group involved in terrorism. Phoebe and Wolf are involved in a novel and this complicates the trip to Portugal, where Faith died. Its various things are wrong with this movie and everything has to do with the script. First, the romance between Wolf and Phoebe is all wrong and does nothing for the story. It sounds completely false and appears as forced. It seems strange that Wolf gets involved in a romance with his dead girlfriend girlfriends. Secondly, Wolf completely knows what happened to Faith, but he just looses little pieces of information every 15 minutes. Wolf looks at Phoebe every 15 minutes and says, "There's something I did not tell you!" Wow, thank you Wolf! If Wolf had cleaned the first time he talked to Phoebe, the movie would have finished in about 30 minutes. Another thing that bothered me was that I do not think this movie recreated the 1960s at all. Diaz wears hippie clothes, but the time period does not seem true. I liked some things like the authentic places where the movie was filmed. It's a very beautiful film and the scenery is beautiful. The performances are good especially by Brewster and Diaz. In addition to "The Fast and the Furious," I had never really seen Brewster in anything. But after watching his performance in this film, I was very impressed. She's very good here and I hope better roles come her way. The script is told in a very planned way and the film is never believable.
