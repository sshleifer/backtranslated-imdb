Well, of course the critics hated that. This is not a movie that is going to be critically acclaimed. But the fact is that it is really very good. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you do not like this Chris Farley physical comedy or David Spade's extremely dry mood, you will not like this. But for the rest of us, the film has many hilarious and, incidentally, quoted sequences, and the plot is not as idiotic as that of "Black Sheep." The parts that are not meant to be funny are actually well done, not what you would expect from such a movie, and the acting is actually very good. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is without question Chris Farley's best movie. I give you an A and I suggest you take a look.
