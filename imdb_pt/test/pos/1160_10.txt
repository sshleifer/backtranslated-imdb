This is a great movie that you will remember for a long time. It is about history, America, the change of times, Teddy Roosevelt, Morocco, a kidnapped American and his sons, and the leader of the Berbers, with the blood of the Prophet in his veins. <br /> <br /> Film is based on a true story - as Jesse James was a banker. An American was kidnapped in Morocco and the Marines headed back to Tripoli to rescue him. So much for this one. You know Hollywood. Sean Connery is the Berber leader and Muslim leader. Candice Bergan is the guy who was kidnapped along with her two children; the son is Rex Harrison's grandson, Simon, no less. John Huston is Secretary of State, with a straight John-Huston style at a state dinner, beware. Brian Kieth It's Teddy Roosevelt, every American, every man, a character who is an interesting commentary as modern as today. <br /> <br /> The variety and beauty of the desert and Morocco are beautifully shown in the cinematography in this movie, which will stay with you, an astonishing and compelling memory. The score is as extensive and exotic as the pictures. <br /> <br /> This is a story about two cultures, both with great ideas and historical past, struggling for the future without an idea about the other. Either way, the struggle comes down to power versus ingenuity. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, there's the little boy - do you remember the little boy? What do you think he thinks?
