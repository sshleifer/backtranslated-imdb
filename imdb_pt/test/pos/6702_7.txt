I finally got Lifeforce on DVD with the widescreen format intact and I threw Henry Mancini's score to the max. After seeing Lifeforce for fifteen years on tape, I must say that the uncut version of the DVD was great and disappointing. Is the American version so * much * better than the (European?) DVD version. The American version of the life force moves much faster (the edition in the DVD version is terrible. It looks like an unfinished cut). And the many scenes not seen in the American version add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact, a "new" moment almost wrecks the entire film, when Caine (Peter firth) meets the male alien in the cathedral. I love this scene in the North American version. On the DVD, the alien talks to Caine and what he says is very hilarious. It is the height of joy: "It will be much less terrifying if you come to me!" the male alien says, in a deep 50s voice. I was shocked when I saw that. It just does not belong to the movie. This scene is pure camp in a super serious movie. I'm glad Hooper (or anyone else) cut that scene when the movie was released in North America. There are several changes made in the US version that make Lifeforce so much better and I wanted the DVD to have the North American version. The editing is crisp and frenetic without being annoying and some points that were already annoying in the North American version are even more tedious in the DVD version because of the added scenes. And the opening credits of the DVD are terrible. Much better in the North American version. More subtle. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. It's basically aliens doing a pit-stop on earth and sucking out as much of Lifeforce as possible. The film has many flat and uninspired sequences (speech, speech, speech), but when the action goes to London, it's fun. The film really shines in these scenes. One can see Hooper finally doing what he is great: chaos, savagery, horror! Lifeforce should have had more scenes of chaos. These are the best apocalyptic scenes ever filmed. It is also the best zombie movie ever. Zombies are hungry (for life force, not meat) and they are crazy, agile and terrifying. Not the slow holes of other zombie movies. In addition, many people criticized the ending, but I love it. It leaves you tall and dry, like one of the victims drained by life force. <br /> <br /> And to think that this movie came out during the cute and cuddly 80's, when people would gather for the E.T or Cocoon or another sweet and boring, feel good science fiction movies. No wonder he bombed because he was far ahead of his time with his super nihilistic point of view! <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, well, not great. The image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras. But it's great to see the movie in the widescreen format. I just hope they release a clean and crisp US version on a DVD, and with comments from Hooper and Dykstra.
