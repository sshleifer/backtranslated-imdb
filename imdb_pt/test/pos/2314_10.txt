As an ex submarine officer (nuclear), I must admit that this is my favorite underwater movie (even surpassing Hunt for Red October). Someone knew something about submarines when they wrote the movie. OK - not realistic - but it's a comedy - and it has all the "inside jokes" of the underwater force. A great cast with stereotyped underwater guys at "Orlando" and our heroes on the diesel boat. Definitely "DBF" by the way = that means diesel boats forever. But they want ten lines to post this - jees is the admiral in charge here? <br /> <br /> Line 10.
