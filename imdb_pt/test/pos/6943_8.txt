Although I lived in Australia in 1975, I moved abroad not long after, fed up with constant industrial turmoil, the general cult of mediocrity - unless you're a sportsman! - and the complacency of so many Australians who chose to ignore the dizzying pace of change taking place in the countries to the north. <br /> <br /> Consequently, I missed The Dismissal, along with many other Australian TV dramas of the 1980s and 1990s, such as the superb Janus and Phoenix series, which I have seen, along with Wildside. <br /> <br /> For me, the filmed story of The Dismissal is fair and as far as I know it needs. However, as for the "outrage" public, shows only one side of the picture, not how the families were divided by the controversy. I know, as my two brothers would not talk to me for months on end. <br /> <br /> But the comment is, in my opinion, very one-sided. The inescapable fact is that, despite the inflamed expressions of anger from a substantial proportion of the community, the Australian electorate chose - and chose decisively - Fraser's favor, as they did again two years later. <br /> <br /> This aside, a docudrama historically accurate and superbly well represented.
