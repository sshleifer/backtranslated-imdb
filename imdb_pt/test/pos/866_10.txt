I honestly do not know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review, as a result, I'm having a hard time describing these short ones. Let's just say there's a fair amount of gay sex, some necrophilia, some incest, a fair amount of masturbation, and several artificial limbs. And I loved every minute of it. <br /> <br /> Not that it's all gross humor. It is not. They get away from fart jokes most of the time, with the exception of an outline titled "Pizza," which they use very well. "They" are 3 / 11s of the short sketch comedy that aired on MTV called The State, David Wain, Michael Showalter and Michael Ian Black. <br /> <br /> The trio goes on adventures, usually throwing themselves away and meeting strange and unusual people, people who are actually more normal than they are. The support cast is fantastic too. Paul Rudd, Julie Bowen, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Sam Rockwell make appearances on various sketches. They also join other former state students such as Joe Lo Truglio and Todd Holoubek. The musical selections are also very well placed. <br /> <br /> I like these drawings over and over again, but they are not for everyone, since they are pretty common most of the time. If you like intelligent humor you are not afraid to push the limits of good taste, then I recommend this. If you liked the Wet Hot American Summer (directed and written by Wain and Showalter) or The State, then you should really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I think currently only can be ordered online. Check out their website and make some sketches to get an idea, if you really want it first, and then find out how to buy the DVD.
