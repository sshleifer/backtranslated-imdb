In the line of fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse. Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this fascinating movie. Malkovich says he's going to kill the president and purposefully calls Eastwood and presses the buttons. He questions Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings a cold but very clever mentality to his character. Whatever he does, he does for a reason, and he is not ashamed to kill. Eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors to catch Malkovich, but no one wants to hear him. The result is a movie that pops with suspense that turns into a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel. Wolfgang Peterson increases the tension and we feel at every turn.
