This show has an incredible plot with good and recognizable actors (such as Boston Legal girl and Boris the Butcher from Snatch). Even the extras and the boy, who I thought of the commercial, may be a weak link, surprised me with his ability. It's just the little things the director needs to adjust. As the guy who does the recap of the last episode at the beginning of each new episode needs to be fired. Having a storyteller tells you what happened to ruin the story. The only other minor problem I have had is that sometimes they take too long to get things done, but not where near, while some shows like Prison Break. Anyone know when they will resume the season?
