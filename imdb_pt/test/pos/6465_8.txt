Although this little film has been lost on the trail of On The Waterfront, Edge Of The City can certainly stand out with the classic star-studded. It's another story about the docks and the code of silence that rules them. <br /> <br /> Alongside the corrupt union that Lee J. Cobb ran on On The Waterfront, Jack Warden is really a small corruption of time. But he's real enough as a gang boss on one of the docks that intimidates the other workers by being helpful with his fists and the bail hook and he gets the rest to repay some of his hard earned money. And it's all the hard-earned money in this job. One guy that Warden can not intimidate is Sidney Poitier, another gang boss, and when he tries to intimidate rookie John Cassavetes, Poitier puts him under his wing. The two develop a lot of friendship and Poitier and his wife Ruby Dee even repair Cassavetes with Kathleen Maguire. Warden is indeed a disgusting creature and it is sad that, out of sheer force of personality and physical dexterity, he almost empties. all others in submission. In that sense, he is tougher than Lee J. Cobb, who had to rely on a printed collection of henchmen to impose his will on On The Waterfront. Edge Of The City marked Martin's directorial debut on the big screen. Ritt, who did a great job with a good cast of New York players and saw in local cinematography. The film's low budget shows, but you're so impressed with the cast that you do not even care. Cassavetes as the loner with a past and the hard and strong Poitier are fine, but my personal favorite in this movie is Ruby Dee. She should have won some prize for her performance, her last scene with Cassavetes is excellent. <br /> Take this one if possible. I wish it were on DVD or VHS.
