I agree that this movie hit its targets perfectly. I saw on Showtime late at night when I was a teenager, and again in college. I thought it was fun. And there are boobs everywhere! It seems that in the late 70's and 80's there were a lot of movies of this type, from heavy movies like Porkys to soft-core "Au Pair Girls"; It's a pity that they seem to have fallen by the wayside in popularity. What made the HOTS great was that, like the previous two movies, it's a lot of fun. HOTS is like a female version of "Animal House," with the girls forming a sort of sisterhood and getting into the campus turmoil. On a side note, whoever designed the girls' clothes "Hooters" certainly must have seen this movie.
