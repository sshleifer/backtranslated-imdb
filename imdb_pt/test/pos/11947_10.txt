"One Crazy Summer" is the funniest, craziest (not necessarily the best) movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Only when one crazy scene is made, another emerges. Never let you rest. Just one thing after another. The soundtrack is great. The songs are right for the scenes. <br /> <br /> It's also a clean movie. Little that is dirty in it. <br /> <br /> Of course, there's the story of the guys you would not trust with your lunch money, taking up a challenge and winning over people with more resources. Who would want to see if they failed? There is a serious side where parents and children do not live according to the dreams of others. One should always have an open mind and weigh all the options. This applies to both parents and children. In "One Crazy Summer," the parents are wrong. This is not always the case.
