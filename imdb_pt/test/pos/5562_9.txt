Having just borrowed my somewhat obsessive brother's One Series DVD collection, I was hoping to get through the first couple of episodes and hand it back. I just found myself screaming on the screen for finishing the first season in a hangar - a mere week later and I've been watching the whole season. Where I found time for this I have no idea. <br /> <br /> This show is great. He does not take himself too seriously, has sympathetic characters who are well represented, and the special effects (ignoring the strange sticky puppet here and there) are "special" enough to give him that polished feel. At first I did not know it was mostly filmed here, and it seemed strange to hear so many Australian accents on a science fiction show - it was so much fun for the main character (John) to land in Sydney half way. first season. <br /> <br /> I believe the greatest strength of this show is the vision that the creators of the show obviously had. They have gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that explain past actions, and continue to bend John's conversations with slang in a fun and non-forced way. Plus, having watched the entire Voyager and Next Gen series, I see minor mistakes - so I was able to maintain a sense of originality throughout the entire first season. I hope the rest is so good. <br /> <br /> Farscape is not like any other Sci-Fi that I have enjoyed in the past. I heard that the fourth season was not as good as the first three, and now I'm pretty upset that they canceled before the 5th. I hope they relive this show - with the same actors in a movie or other series. It would be a shame to leave as many unfinished story lines as I imagine, with a show that had so much reflection, having it deleted without proper warning will leave me feeling stolen. <br /> <br /> go now ... going back to my brother's place to snaffle the second season. <br /> <br /> V.
