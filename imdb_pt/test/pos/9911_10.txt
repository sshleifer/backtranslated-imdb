This may not be the most exciting or incredible episode they've done, but in my opinion, it remains as one of the most original episodes of Star Trek and Sci-Fi. Most of the ideas in the retro Sci-Fi series, especially including Star Trek, have been reused several times, but the other hand remains a triumph at a time. This was one of the episodes that most impressed me in the end. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about this episode is how it managed to create such an exciting and catchy story with so few special effects. Now without criticizing the episode, I must admit that the effects are very old, but again, what can you expect from a 1967 TV show? But still the creature ("Horta") in this episode is basically just a rug with a bit of colored rubber. However, you forget about it after about 1 minute and just start thinking about it as it should be. Also the caves do not look exactly like rock, but again you forget after a few minutes. This episode is a living proof of how good acting and a good story can make you ignore the visual effects. <br /> <br /> The performance of the main cast is, as usual, great. This episode features the series second mind meld by Spock and is one of my favorites. So to say it's simple, Leonard Nimoy is definitely a scene thief here, and his acting is excellent. Not that Kirk or Bones did not have their part in the episode, but Spock is the most intriguing in this. I like the fact that the episode is not about a specific character but evolves around the trio dealing with an alien problem. It's also nice to see an episode that does not just happen on the Enterprise. <br /> <br /> Like most Star Trek episodes, this episode tells us to have an open mind. I will not spoil the story, but evolve around what at first seems like a typical story of monsters. He killed several humans and therefore must be killed. But is that really all there is to it? I can assure you that the explanation in the end will not disappoint you. This is still my favorite episode of Star Trek TOS and I give it a 10/10.
