I was not sure what to expect from "driving lessons" - not knowing if Rupert Grint could have that role, but in the first few minutes I got completely hooked. All the way through, the music, acting and setting were absolutely stunning. Julie Walters, as always, made a superb performance as the eccentric old actress Evie, and Rupert Grint, just as good, made a fantastic performance as the romantic Ben. From the beginning, I was forced into involuntary grunts, giggles, and bursts of joy as Ben freed himself from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, Evie. A very controversial story, probably quite exaggerated, but not least, one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone looking for a good British film and a night to go back and just enjoy themselves.
