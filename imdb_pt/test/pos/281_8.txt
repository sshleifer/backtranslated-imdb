Excellent and moving story of the end of an intimate affair. So again, the point of the movie, to paraphrase another comment, is that every relationship can be unique and intimate. A quality short film that got me busier but that had the power to pull me to the couch and watch, fixed and silent, all the time. Bobby and Tessa are powerfully exciting characters and anyone who has endured a love affair will find this movie a cathartic exercise. In addition, the idea of ​​'movie within a movie' goes very well with this cast and is quite fascinating, albeit in a somewhat melancholy way.
