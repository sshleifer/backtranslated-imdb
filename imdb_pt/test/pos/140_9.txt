The definition of a vampire is an inhuman corpse that was to leave his grave at night to drink the blood of the living. Bakjwi almost blinds this concept to the head except for the clich√© of pointy fangs and bites on the neck. Being an R movie, I knew this would really belong to vampires being vampires. Which means the characters in the movie are going to do what vampires really do without restrictions and for lack of glamorous moments compared to Twilight. Having seen the previous Oldboy of Chan-wook Park, I had very high expectations of Bakjwi. <br /> <br /> I anticipated some strange plot sequences with our anti-hero, known as Priest Sang-hyeon, and I was very impressed with his performance as a holy man who is forced into this dilemma of being human and obey your thirst like a vampire. (SPOILER) After the initial premise that he survives defective blood transfusion, he begins to crave blood and discovers his super strength and ability to fly. Screen captures make their transition phase without overexposure. He begins to drink the blood of the dying and those who wish to be sacrificed for moral reasons. The tragic and dysfunctional love affair that the priest has with the Tae-joo manipulator is very fascinating, as they are interpreted by Kanh-ho's song of the presenter and actress OK-vin Kim. The special effects are properly placed in the background, and although it does not offer anything new in the forms of acrobatics and CGI, it does not impose itself on the premise of the plot directed and developed by the character. The story and plot points are very perverse and grotesque, but very unique in their own Korean style. <br /> <br /> There are not many negatives I can say about Bakjwi. Sometimes I wonder if the transition phase of the priests could have shown more of the priest having an emotional crisis with his transformation, but again that would have made the movie for 3 hours. The movie was long to start. Likewise, vampires really do not have much in expressing emotions to begin with. As mentioned before, this movie is very tragic, so do not expect anything hopeful while watching it. <br /> <br /> Overall, Bakjwi is deliciously dark, morbid and original. I strongly recommend this movie to serious viewers who are beyond the teenage phase of Twilight. This is definitely the Korean response to the Swedish Let The Right One In, which is also a good movie.
