The first time I saw "Alice in Wonderland," an X-rated Musical Comedy, it was in the early '80s at a Movie Theater in New York with some friends. I remember that we really liked it a lot, though we wondered why all the "treats" were covered in various shapes in the form of colored spots and because the film was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next, leaving us guessing .. or what we have just lost. Obviously, it was the edited version (sting), which left me wanting to watch it again soon, but in its original full version. Well, over 20 years have passed, during which I forgot all about this movie and just a few days ago happened by chance a very used copy of VHS (which had seen better times: a bit faded, sound harsh and some flaws), but guess what? It's the original uncut version and this time I really had a ball! Humor, Musical, and Pornography may seem like a strange combination, but in this case it really works, and it's unlikely that the vast majority of boring porn movies invade our screens, this is a really fun and entertaining sexual fantasy that will not disappoint. The direction is intelligent, the fast editing makes the movie fly like a bird, all the familiar characters are adorable or simply funny, all the actors seem to have fun, the songs are captivating (worth mentioning about "growing" sung by Alice at the beginning of the movie and hilarious "What a Cool Girl Like You Doing in a Rider Like This"), the dance numbers are well choreographed and staged (Terry Hall demonstrates that she can also "dance" and dance enthusiastically to her bowels away ... Do not worry, she also does what she was best known for ...), acting, singing, set, costumes are of quality level and then ... there is Kristine "Blue Eyes "DeBell in the first lead role of her career and (oh boy!) She actually has some HC sequences! Personally, I think they are not absolutely unpleasant, on the contrary, they are spontaneous and quite exciting. She is young and (ohhh!) Very pretty; with the help of her new friends in Wonderland, she discovers her body and her sexuality, she sings, dances and ... what do you expect? She is also experiencing sex! The final sequence, when she finally makes love to her boyfriend, is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the film. I think his "physique du role" (his innocent blue eyes and captivating smile) and his acting ability make these explicit sequences more than acceptable and really very enjoyable. There's a lot of sex going on in this Wonderland and everyone seems eager to "get busy" with the first available boy (s) or girl (s), which means a lot of hard-core action to be seen. On the other hand, some close-up photos, clearly "mended", just to make the porn-hounds really happy, are somewhat redundant for my personal taste. In general, however, sexual action is not offensive as it is treated with great humor and blends almost perfectly with music, dance and comedy. If you think you and your partner can deal with sex explicitly, watch together. Take my word, you'll have an hour and a half of really good time (maybe also an extra post-show action ...) This is "Adult Entertainment" so be careful, do not leave this video around or between other kids videos. If your 10 year old can get his hands on it, he can have fun, but you will be forced to provide embarrassing explanations as to why this "Alice" behaves quite differently from the one he described in Lewis Carroll's novel or did he watch . in the Disney video. I bet you will not forget this one-of-a-kind very soon. Too bad they do not do it anymore ...! I give 9 out of 10.
