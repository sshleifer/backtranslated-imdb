An astronaut gets lost in deep space and finds himself traveling through unknown territory aboard a living ship, accompanied by a band of alien bandits. This incredible plot of plotted and entertaining TV comes as a positive birth fantasy. The individual characters, in conflict at the beginning of the series, have to learn how to get along with each other and finally evolve into a powerful group. Most of the action takes place inside Moia's womb, the living spaceship (which even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). Although science fiction stories are generally interested in negative birthdreams (see the "Alien" movies, for example, especially the fourth part "Resurrection"), this is a surprise. Also pleasing is the absence of military hierarchy on board the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human (and alien) body. One of the female characters who is actually a plant experiences 'photogasms' while being exposed to sunlight. The crew still have to go to the bathroom. Would not that be impossible in 'Star Trek'?
