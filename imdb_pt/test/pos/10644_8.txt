I wanted to see this for a while: I never thought I'd be watching in a Trafalgar Square, London, with 15,000 people and all to a new Pet Shop Boys score. <br /> <br /> Quickly, experience this specifically. A new departure from the PSB seemed to suffer from the same problem that the miniaturist Hugo Wolf had when he wrote his opera Der Corregidor: the long structure was a chain of short, that is, songs. The PSB produced a more fluid and integrated score, though it was quite static on its own terms. Nor could they resist music: a definition of the text with captions worked in this regard. A free meditation on the action of the Odessa steps massacre during the action of that sequence itself was, I would say counterproductive. Overall, it was very exciting, which is certainly what Eisenstein was trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> It's a very exciting movie, with spicier editing taking the place of the acceleration of tension or action. In fact, although the film has been beautifully filmed and acted with passion (it has a silent movie melodrama, but not in the Hollywood comic style) it breathes through its careful editing, stimulating specific shots with a sense of the rhythm in which the audience will watch. they also. And there is a huge variety of perspectives too; or he had a lot of cameras or the sequences in the port and the steps took a long time. <br /> <br /> Super movie, which can be evaluated regardless of sound, as this is how the finished product would have been conceived. 8/10
