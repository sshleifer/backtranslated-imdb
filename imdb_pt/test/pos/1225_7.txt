A new guy in an armored car company is convinced to get involved in an armored car assault by his fellow drivers in order to earn some quick cash. The problem is they do not really have much plan and when complications arise, things become deadly. <br /> <br /> The fast-moving action movie popcorn has a lot to do with it. First, the movie has less than 90 minutes, so the movie does not really have the time to get entangled in the plot. It increases everything and goes away. Then the movie has some great action sequences, so that one moves towards the edge of your seat. Finally, the film has a stellar cast that includes Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Lawrence Fishburne. It's a first-rate cast that sells and covers stories coming soon. <br /> <br /> This is not brain surgery, it's a popcorn movie, and at that level, it makes a lot of money. Worth a look.
