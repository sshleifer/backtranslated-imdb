This is the last film by Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in film history. He intended to retire after this movie, so in a way, it's his artistic testament. He died a couple of years after making the film, and although it is said that he intended to re-direct, Destiny decided that this was really the last. And what a movie! <br /> <br /> 'Rouge' the last film in the three colors The French trilogy is actually a very Swiss film. Situated in Geneva, one of the two main characters is a retired Swiss judge, and Durenmatt immediately comes to mind. But there is more Switzerland in the cold atmosphere, in the lack of communication of the characters, in the politeness that surrounds the cruelty of life. Several characters that begin with little relationship will come together in the end in a human and moving end that only a great artist could have staged. <br /> <br /> Little more can be said that it was not said and written a hundred times. Yes, the movie starts slowly, and American-style fans of action movies or melodramas discourage first and get lost as viewers. They deserve it. The movie gains quality as it progresses, and one of the not-so-hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than Hollywood cartoons, action and characters. The quality of the cinema is very original, the image being a 'Study in Red', as the title shows. Acting is fabulous, with Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant - later, which will continue to be the best role of her old age. <br /> <br /> A great movie. Seeing him again probably adds, and I'm happy to have it recorded on tape. 9/10 on my personal scale.
