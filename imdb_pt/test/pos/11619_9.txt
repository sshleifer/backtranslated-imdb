First off - this movie will not be for everyone. There are scenes of extreme graphic violence and "disturbing" images that, by their very nature, will disconnect many potential potential viewers. Obviously, from the comments on this board - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY divided those who saw this. I am among those who liked it a lot for several different reasons. I feel that this was a very ambitious undertaking (and quite competent ...) for a group of young people from 18 to 19 years old with no budget and little experience. I think every aspect of the film - the direction, the acting (although the performances of the character are more compared to the stage or performance of free form because of the nature of the film ...) the production, the FX, the score / sound design - all are far superior to many movies that I have seen that exceed the budget of these children and experience ten times. I honestly was not so impressed with an art-house horror movie since Nacho Cerda's GENESIS ... First, I will not pretend to understand and / or understand everything. of the graphic content in this movie - but knowing that this was not a straightforward narrative type of movie when I got into it, I was not disappointed with how it happened. SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY is 4 relatively short vignettes that all sort of revolve around right brain theory / left brain lust / rage / psychosis vs.. restriction / compassion / "normality". To give a brief synopsis of each "chapter": OVARIAN EYEBALL basically has a naked girl who has an eyeball cut from her abdomen. I'm sure it's symbolic of something - I do not think I was paying much attention at that time and it blows really fast. The next "episode" - HUMAN LARVAE - is a nihilistic, horrifying and genuinely creepy story of a guy who is in love and repelled by his pregnant sister, who gives his growing psychosis that leads to the conclusion of that particular chapter. HUMAN LARVAE is the best of the group in my book and will probably be under your skin. The narrative dialogue of the dead tunic accentuates the growing tension as you know something horrible will happen - but you are not sure what it is. Do yourself a favor and if you're interested in watching this movie - do not do much research on it. Come in with an open mind and an iron stomach and I think you will be pleasantly surprised, especially with this particular episode. <br /> <br /> RENASCER has a lot of people in a field screwing the floor and blowing trees and stuff. . Apparently an "artistic" interpretation of the rape of the land or something along those lines. Not bad, but this one is also very short and I kind of lost the point in that ... <br /> <br /> And the RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM seems to be about religion and religious hypocrisy and also along with HUMAN LARVAE, some of the images / messages "of the whole resource ... OVARIAN EYEBALL is nothing to write about, mainly because of its very short execution time, but it does a decent accompaniment to the insanity that is to come ... and REBIRTH is also kind of short and not so thought-provoking, but HUMAN LARVA (especially) and RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM are so out of fashion and well done that more than make up for other parts. I think the main reason why I enjoyed both of this is that as "shocking", "repulsive", "violent" and "excessive" as it is, is also done very beautifully and you can say that this was a real job. of love from those involved. Nothing about the movie seems cheap or rushed, and even though the content is not completely decipherable, it's undeniably original - and that's what my book says. Not that every "strange art" movie that has an unintelligible plot should be commended for its "originality," but SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY is the kind of movie I think I'll see a few more times in the near future to see what other interpretations I can win with it. Again, this movie is NOT ABSOLUTELY for everyone - with some VERY extreme scenes of blood, murder, rape, incest, sacrilegious images, etc ... which is definitely there to shock the viewer to take a harder look at this movie. I have to say it worked for me, and I am eagerly awaiting the collaboration of Hussain / Bristle, which is rumored to come next. Check this out if you have the stomach for it - 9.5 / 10
