Semper Fi! I saw "The D.I." in 1957. Two and a half years later, I entered the Body. <br /> <br /> The Web and the company did their thing in '57. Boot in 1959 was more like the Boot Camp shown in "Full Metal Jacket" - Yes. A black recruit in my training squad was called "Snowball." I was called "Stick" because I was skinny as a rail. All the recruits had a nickname, some rather vile, that stayed with him through his service in the Corps. Being hit, or hit your butt, when you screwed up everything was SOP. "Fall and give me fifty," you have to be discouraged. Then he became "Let go and give me two hundred!" DIs were a bunch of sadistic bastards, but it was a controlled sadism, and with a prime purpose of keeping the stupid MoFos alive when we got into combat. 200 years of experience were rooted in this "sadism" and everything that D.I. had or said that he had a purpose for his mission. <br /> <br /> Lousy D.I. he growls with dead grunts. A good D.I., though apparently the biggest asshole in the world, keeps them alive. You can not kill the enemy if you're dead. <br /> <br /> In case you do not know, the Marine Corps has a main mission: to kill the enemy. PFD. <br /> <br /> Everything else is pure saw of brave. <br /> <br /> MstGySgt WHT, USMC (ret)
