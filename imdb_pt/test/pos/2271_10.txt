If anyone has any doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber, just look at his new movie, "Everything is Illuminated," which clearly shows a man who is not only one of America's best actors but a new director whose first effort is in fact an inspiration and a harbinger of what comes next. Schreiber adapted Jonathan Safran Foer's novel into a film that will live forever because of the way the director adapted the material. The film clearly exceeded our expectations, since we had no preconceived ideas. <br /> <br /> For those who did not watch the movie, maybe you should stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Jonathan is a collector. Your love for your grandparents is unlimited. He watches while his grandfather dies and his grandmother is on what appears to be his deathbed. In a clear moment, this dying woman gives Jonathan a photo and an amber ornament for his collection. Looking at the photograph, taken long ago, a young couple is seen together. Watching makes Jonathan think that shows the grandfather and his girlfriend, taken in happier times. Watching the snapshot seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to pursue the past of his ancestors in Ukraine. <br /> Jonathan made deals with a travel agency, Heritage Tours, from Odessa for his trip. to Trochenbrod, the mythical place from where his grandfather came from. The agency is treated by an older man who claims to be blind, and his grandson, Alex, a man who loves American pop culture who has captured his imagination as well as his contemporaries in the country. Alex speaks a kind of English that no one speaks and his conversation and translation, for the benefit of Jonathan, are hilarious to our ears for the use of English terms sometimes not heard. The old man insists on taking his dog, Sammy Davis Jr., against the wishes of Jonathan, who does not want to sit beside the animal growling and barking during the trip. <br /> <br /> As they embark on the quest for Trochenbrod, it is evident that their companions, especially the old man, do not know where he is going. At this point, the movie becomes a road movie, when the three characters that cross the country's back roads become better known. When the trio arrives at the sunflower field with the house at the end, it indicates that they have really arrived at the right place. Some places are a clear reminder of the conflicts of the past. <br /> <br /> The older woman, living in the isolated place, is the missing link in history. She is able to put things in the right perspective. But here is where the story changes its emphasis from Jonathan, who has clearly reached the land of his ancestors, the old man. We watch as this older man begins to remember things about himself. This, in turn, changes the dynamics of the film as we discover how Jonathan and his guides were connected all the time. <br /> <br /> Some criticisms in these pages expressed opinions about the accuracy of the story, which after all, is a work of fiction and freedoms were taken. It would have been impossible to make another film, including so much that is contained in the book. The great way to split the movie into different chapters is a clever way of showing the viewer what's about to be seen. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood, a magnificent film actor, does an excellent job by underestimating Jonathan. Mr. Wood makes one of his best appearances in any movie with his interpretation of the main character. The happy cast of Eugene Hutz as Alex, the tour assistant and Ukrainian translator, seems to be an idea made in heaven. Hutz is the best thing in the movie. His arcane use of English gives the film a funny angle that delights the viewer. Boris Leskin as Alex's grandfather and touring car driver makes a valuable contribution to the film as well as Laryssa Lauret, which is seen in the latter part of the film. <br /> <br /> The excellent cinematography of Matthew Libatique brings the splendor of the countryside of the Czech Republic in all its magnificence. The score of Paul Cantelon is heard in the background, adorning the film in a way that adds a wealth to the film. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a triumph for Liev Schreiber, the first director who surely goes far in everything he decides to do next.
