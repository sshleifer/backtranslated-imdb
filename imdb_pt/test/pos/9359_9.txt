A New York Times article in March 1947 described Crossfire as one of the first Hollywood films of the 1940s to "face issues of racial and religious prejudice with outspoken courage than the public used to expect." While the RKO produced Crossfire, Twentieth Century-Fox was doing the Gentleman's Agreement, another story about anti-Semitism. RKO rushed to hit the "Fox" image very "ballyhooed" to the theaters, releasing Crossfire several months before the Gentleman Agreement. In July 1947, the RKO hosted the Crossfire for representatives of various religious groups in Los Angeles. In addition, several surveys, designed to assess the public's prejudices, were conducted before and after the screening of the film. Crossfire received praise and criticism for his portrayal of anti-Semitism in America and was the subject of many editorials. Crossfire received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, but lost to the Gentleman's Agreement. Also nominated for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan), Best Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame), Best Director and Best Screenplay (Adaptation). In September 1947, Crossfire was named Best Social Movie in Cannes. In December 1947, Ebony magazine, an African-American publication, gave the film its annual award for "improving interracial understanding." I loved this movie. If you have the chance to watch, see.
