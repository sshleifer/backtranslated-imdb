Everyone likes the legally created and memorable assault film. Alain Delon provides the anti-hero, Melville provides the cool, and a handful of other great talents (Yves Montand, Gian Maria Volonte and Andre Bourvil, mainly) arrives to add a fresh surrounding film ... <br /> < > ... with very little dialogue. This is great because a certain aspect of the genre tends to be a grand dialogue involving rapid thinking and its various responses. This film, however, could be watched with the sound completely off and not too terribly much would be lost. Not to mention that the sound is bad, oh no, the jazz soundtrack and crisp audio capturing the small movements make the patient deliberation slow and patient of very convincing. <br /> <br /> What is also really cool about this movie is that color cinematography is pretty fantastic. Usually, when it comes to cinematography, black and white films tend to stand out in my mind, but this film has some very strong and beautiful images that make the film a pure visual pleasure. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
