I saw this movie for the first time at a premiere party in the city Fredwalstad, hometown of Zwarts. There, between directors, musicians and other Norwegian celebrities I laughed and laughed ... I just could not stop. If you like a comedy with black humor, sharp lines and excellent acting - this is a movie you have to see! It's like blending "True Romance" with "The Wedding Singer" and adding a hint of "Mad about you" Hilarios! <br /> <br /> 10 Points!
