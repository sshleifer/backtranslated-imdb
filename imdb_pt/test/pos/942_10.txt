The Australian public and the Australian film industry often complain that there are not enough great Australian films or all the same. <br /> <br /> Well, in this case, this movie is not a carbon copy. of other Australian films. It's unique - it will make you laugh out loud, it will make you cry and it will make you feel great about yourself. <br /> <br /> The cast of this movie is superb and the acting is the second to None. The script and the photo (color / light etc) are wonderful. But more important is a great movie. I do not want to talk about the plot, because I think it's always better to watch a movie knowing as little as possible. Suffice it to say that this film will appeal to a wide range of audiences. Take your girlfriend, take your mother, take your friends - for a great night. <br /> <br /> 10/10 !!!!
