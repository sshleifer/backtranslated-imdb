The son of Hercules is seriously injured during a hunt for the lion that goes wrong. Hercules (a solid and engaging performance of burly Reg Park) has to venture into a strange and dangerous alternate dimension ruled by the evil and vengeful Gia, the Goddess of the Earth (a deliciously perverse portrait of Gia Sandri) and fight against various monsters to save the soul of his son. Meanwhile, Gia's equally unpleasant son, Antaius (once a perfect hatred for Giovanni Cianfriglia) poses as Hercules and takes over an entire city as a cruel and ruthless tyrant. Director Maurizo Lucidi tells the surrounding story at a steady pace and keeps a serious tone throughout. This film begins a bit slow but actually begins to cook once Hercules enters the hazy and dangerous underground spiritual world: the highlights include Hercules struggling with a humanoid lizard beast, Hercules rising into a gigantic twisted tree and Hercules being attacked by a bunch of rotting. zombies Better yet, the bizarre world of spirits just smells of scary atmosphere (you have to love that persistent thick fog!). The great physical confrontation between Hercules and Antaius, equally difficult and totally hand in hand. Of course, we also have a large volcanic eruption mondo destructo also. Allvaro Mancori's clear and widescreen cinematography gives the film an impressively expansive sense. Ugo Filippini's robust and exciting punctuation has a beautiful and majestic sweep. Okay, so this movie is an obvious and cheap work that uses copious footage of "Hercules in the Haunted World" and "Hercules and the Captive Women", but it's still an extremely lively and entertaining joke.
