I saw this movie on 3 different occasions. On the first occasion I was impressed by this movie. It appeared as a very kind movie to me. I hated this movie as a sentimental junk in my second exhibit. However, my third exhibit reaffirmed the my belief that it's a good movie. There is a lot of emotional power in this film especially scenes of emotional confrontation between Mr. Kramer and Madame Kramer. There are some scenes in which Meryl Streep seems a cruel person despite the fact that she is a beauty in real life. Dustin Hoffman appears as a lost hero unable to cope with his son's recent custody task. There was even a controversy on the sets of this film. According to the master cameraman Nestor Almendros, there was a shot in which he just escaped from getting hurt as Mr.Kramer's character in order to show the intensity of his anger, decides to break a hard glass.Fortunately, nothing happened to Nestor.Kramer versus Kramer shows the destruction of a familiar structure. It also tells how fa should be maintained if there are children involved.
