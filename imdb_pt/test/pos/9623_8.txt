"Five Fingers of Death" is a 1970s kung fu movie classic. Like the movie that "blew" the HK movie theater to the west, this is a must see for any serious fan of the genre. It's also a very entertaining film, with forceful, uninterrupted action, solid and almost always credible fighting choreographies, plus great exaggerated voiceovers from the '70s ("Oh, I see ... so you want it the hard way !!" Five Fingers "is a tale of eye-to-eye revenge ... and I mean literally, an eye for an eye! It's great to see Lo Lieh as a hero. He played so many great villains later in his career - including Father Mei in the classic FIST OF THE WHITE LOTUS, which was one of the characters that Tarantino used in the creation of Father Mei by KILL BILL. that I wish there was a better quality DVD - mine looks like it was a VHS download. Overall, this is a great movie - do not miss it! Bart Blackstone Film Club - Hollywood, CA
