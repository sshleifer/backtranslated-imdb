Many movies try the ambitious. Few can. This movie is one of them. Although described as a comedy of dark humor, this term seems to limit too much to express the true nature of the story behind Max and Grace. Multi-hyphenation Michael Parness has managed to weave elements of the most absurd comedy with an incredibly real human emotion. A remarkable achievement, to be sure. Although the comedic aspects are certainly present, the heart of the film is in its tracks: David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. The delicate balance of the movie - really crazy versus true love - falls to them and they reach it, transporting it from the opening scene to the aching climax of the heart and to the comforting ending. David Krumholtz, in the title role and as a narrator, anchors the image and does an exceptional job. We see the world through Max's eyes and Krumholtz imbues them with a kind of wonder and hope that no one would expect to be credible coming from a character who had previously attempted suicide. There should be no doubt from this point on that he actually achieved the status of a well-deserved leader after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles. Natasha Lyonne may be a kind of revelation for those who have seen her only in less challenging roles. Grace's role is expansive, demanding that she show great fury and great tenderness - sometimes in seconds of each other. She succeeds in convincing us of Grace's deep despair that is just beneath her alternating torpor and mania. <br /> <br /> This is not one kind of laugh comedy per minute, so do not watch the movie waiting strictly for the beginning mood. finish. Think more drama than comedy. There are some very somber moments, as you would expect, given the subject of suicidal individuals, and some strangely real moments delivered notably by Emma Adele Galvin as Max's sister, Sis. The funniest scenes are those populated by the myriad of actors known in supporting roles. While Lorraine Bracco and David Paymer lend the most surreal aspect to their scenes, the other supporting characters who populate the institution where Max and Grace meet are the real treat. Guillermo Diaz is a flatterer of scenes like the weird and frenetic eccentric, Hector. Ralf Moeller, like Bruno, acts like a straight man, but has his own charm and appeal. Rosanna Arquette inhabits fully the role of Vera with the crass vitriol of a bitter waitress from the truck stop. Even his hard-hearted character eventually melts, as does everyone touched by Max's unconditional love for Grace. <br /> <br /> Love can conquer the question behind the movie and even if the realist says no, movies are about an escape from reality, even if it is only for a few brief hours. I recommend watching this movie as an antidote not just to reality but to the cynicism that says such a love story never happens. Spend a few hours immersed in a world where it can and does wonders in the psyche. <br /> <br /> (Seattle International Film Festival - June 2005)
