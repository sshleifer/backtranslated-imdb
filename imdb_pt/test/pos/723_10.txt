Located mainly on the back streets of Toronto NG is a dark and mysterious journey that takes the viewer to the minds of a young man and woman (Vern and Sarah), each of whom has a fascination with puzzles and a disastrous incident in his past. Perfect dialogues and first-rate casting propel this noirish, discreet quest into the girl's search for the meaning behind the puzzles that appear in her life. Helped by her, anything less enthusiastic, male friend, the two come to the end of their journey, but with a price to be paid. The film never intends to answer all its mysteries, but does an excellent job in exposing several twists
