Mike Nichols' "Charlie Wilson's War" set in the 1980s tells the story of how the title character (played by Tom Hanks) managed to wage a secret war with the Russkies, helping the Afghan forces. Of course we know how well this ended up being done in the long run, but fortunately the film does not cover up the nasty sequels. <br /> <br /> The cast is studded with stars, with Tom Hanks and Julia. Roberts is among Hollywood's most fundable stars. As a bonus, you have the versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman in a characteristically memorable supporting role, for which he received an unwarranted Oscar nomination. I'm not much of a fan of Roberts, but Hanks is always dependable. However, I can not believe him as a womanizer who uses drugs, although the real Charlie Wilson seems as eminently agreeable as Hanks. In addition to the big three, however, it is not worth much comment, even from a recognizable name like Amy Adams. <br /> <br /> The story is engaging and reinforced by a good script by Aaron Sorkin. The verbal interaction between the main characters is excellent and is filled with memorable lines. Later events brought into action by the war are not ignored, although the scenes of regret that honor Wilson seem to me very sincere to achieve the bittersweet sensation that was probably intended. Overall, Nichols' direction is professional and follows the script's action admirably. <br /> <br /> This is a film that, like Charlie Wilson himself, has flaws, but is nonetheless surprisingly pleasing. Certainly recommended to fans of the three stars and to those seeking an engaging political drama with a lightweight feel.
