Like NIGHT STALKER and X-FILES, the show created a fantastic situation and the main characters had to sort it out. Unlike these, the heroes did not have an empty bag at the end. They usually had tangible results. It was also clear that the "good guys" were in a dirty profession, where they occasionally had to pull some nasty things. Imagination, intelligence, performance that is not always taken very seriously ... I miss it. One of the reasons is that I'm hard pressed to think of many shows - BANACEK aside - which did such a good job of taking the viewer and catching his attention right away. The writers stood out in establishing immensely improbable, if not completely impossible, situations to which the characters then had to find an explanation. explanations that often took 90 degrees turn into the clearly unexpected yet, despite all this, still made sense. Also, I agree with another reviewer that the character Anabelle was a little underused, but when she was on the screen, it was not just for eye candy. She was very competent in herself and confronted the two men when she felt she was justifying herself. A rarity in those days. Sullivan? If he was not in the department, he would be working for the KGB or the CIA. He is this kind of coldly efficient and ruthless type. He knows how the world works and realizes what might be needed to get the job done. King? It's clearly a game for him. One in which he stands out and he interprets ideas for the detective / spy novels he writes as his ostensible "real" work. He is probably the most fun to watch of the three, although everyone has their moments and often too. I agree that the eventual spin-off series featuring only his character did not take the interest of the original, however.
