These critics need to find a new job !!! This movie is based on a true story that made history. It illustrates beautifully how, even in the haze of war and tragedy, love can conquer everything. The dazzling Chephallonia of Greece captured my heart and soul as if I were there too. The blue-eyed cage and the lovely cross were amazing! Together, they portray perfectly how a Mediterranean couple can only approach in time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it's mine you should go see it !!!!
