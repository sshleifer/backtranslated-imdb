Set in the 1970s in Los Angeles, Christopher Boyce just dropped out of the seminary and returned home where his father got a job where he monitors intelligence documents. His old friend Daulton Lee is a drug dealer and gets caught up in a set-up and must choose between becoming an agent or facing a long period in prison. When he is on bail, he jumps and goes to Mexico City. Chris offers Lee in a partnership to be his messenger to sell secret documents to the Soviet Union embassy in Mexico City because of the disgrace he feels about US government control over the weaker countries for their own benefit. But over time the two begin to clash with their motivations and find themselves in something greater than originally intended. Director John Schlesinger has produced such films as the respected "Midnight Cowboy," "Marathon Man," "Sunday Bloody Sunday," and "Day of The Locust." While "The Hawk and the Snowman" may not be as loud, there is no doubt that this shadowy espionage drama (inspired by a true incident) is an unfairly overlooked character portrayal. All about it, it is a rather subjugated subject, with no qualities of real greatness reaching a huge mark. The main factor of the film has to be the admirably versatile leadership performances of Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as the two ambitious guys Chris and Daulton. Penn is especially good with his uncomfortable intensity, which works well with Hutton's superb curve. What gets so easy, we watch the situation gradually crumble, as the two amateurs really find themselves out of their league. The highly detailed and symbolic plot (predatory behavior) focuses mainly on the relationship of the couple and the reasoning of their actions, which eventually shows us the ramifications that led to their downfall. The plan opens like a wound to never heal properly due to Daulton's drug addiction, which really causes him to get off the rails and let Chris take all the slack. The searing political aspect is there, but focuses on the themes of idealism (Boyce) and greed (Lee) to show their point of view. Both do not mix and results are displayed. Suspense is justified by its stimulating script and character interaction, then by any visual trick. The action is very small, but there is still a pressure-induced style in the assured and realistically somber Schlesinger direction. The rhythm is most often well treated, although some sequences seem to drown for a long time, but nevertheless, it grabs it as it plays its authentically paranoid tone and slowly turns into an explosive ending. Adeptly fleshed in technical production is an airly harrowing soundtrack and professionally poignant cinematography. The supporting cast is exceptionally good with Pat Hingle, Lori Singer, David Suchet, Boris Leskin, Jerry Hardin and Joyce Van Patten. Also look for Michael Ironside as an FBI agent. <br /> <br /> An excellent spy movie that benefits in large part from the talented leadership performances and by not playing the usual bets. It's more of an emotional ride, then a complex of twists. Recommended.
