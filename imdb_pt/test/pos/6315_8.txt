The Consequences of Love: There's really something special about this movie, but it's very difficult to understand. It's a love story, but it's not one I've seen before. There are several love songs throughout the film. A man loves for a younger woman, a younger man loves for his older brother, mafias love money at all costs, are just a few that intertwine in a story that you guess or do not know where and how it will end. The cast is all superb from Sophia, the provocative waitress, to the straight face of titta, main character of the cinema. With simple but affectionate camera work, he bounced back with an ever-changing soundtrack that blends low-quality hop-trip with lush orchestral pieces. The style of the movie changes beautifully using various styles without ever getting confused. Love has never seemed so diverse and powerful as the tales that tell us rumble to various conclusions. The director married old and new in a rich Italian classic.
