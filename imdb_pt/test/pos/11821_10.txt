I had seen The Cure when I was a child and I loved it then. Now, years later, I got a copy almost by accident and watched it again. Being a kid, you really do not have the ability to acquire things for yourself that you want, which is usually a prerogative of your parents - but when I watched again now I felt sorry that I did not do more to get a copy of that movie at the time, and consequently almost forgot about it to this day. <br /> <br /> This is really a beautiful movie. It tells the story of the unlikely friendship between an unfit and misfit boy - who takes his tips from his horrible and abusive mother - and his neighbor, a slightly younger boy who has AIDS. <br /> <br /> You say. Another one of those "ones". A tear jerker. A bucket movie. A tail of morality. Yeah, I know, I hate that too. Only this is not it. It's one of the few films among the many I've seen that takes a very rare trick: it conveys a truly sad story (and, yes, a tale of morality), but without a single moment when you feel tacky, forced, or in any other way "hollywoody". It shows a REAL relationship between two REAL boys, who interact as REAL children. And through this interaction, the loving and kindly character of the older boy, Eric, begins to shine through his "hardcore" personality, as he takes on a kind of generous care with Dexter, his younger, HIV-positive neighbor. . Together they embark on an adventure to find a cure - which for Erik seems to be around the corner - for all this silly AIDS thing to go away and they can be friends forever. <br /> <br /> Production is top notch. But of course, what really brings this film are the performances of the two protagonists - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. Especially Mazzello, which is simply stunning - it conveys a sense of fragility needed for a sick boy, but at the same time he manages to make Dexter a truly energetic and determined character. He shines in the scene in which the boys confront Pony: his impulse to protect his older friend invades him, prompts him to say what he says - and only then horror is portrayed on his face when he realizes that what he even said it's true: his blood is poison ... Renfro also has his moments, in particular the scenes with his mother: he perfectly portrays how this macho macho street is completely frozen and numb when confronted with his abusive and violent mother, and can not enter into a word to contradict it, for it prohibits his relationship with the sick boy of his fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also makes a memorable performance as Dexter's mother, who becomes, in a sense, a maternal figure for Erik as well. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time when I was in school in the United States. , and I loved - not at all a given about such films. But the children's behavior in this film was so real that I could easily relate to them. Ironically, the teacher who showed us this movie (a wonderful woman, I'm still in touch with her) got into trouble, as some tense parents complained about having the scene where the two boys are looking at a Playboy ... pathetic. Seriously, Americans will never get over this ridiculous phobia, I do not know. There was a hardly distinguishable shot of a playboy cover in the movie and therefore is not shown in schools ... that sad. Kids need to watch this movie. It's more inspiring and educational than all the official specials after class together. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. I know I digress, but still ... The score. It's great. I am a musician and as such I know Dave Grusin from his records: he is a well-known jazz pianist and producer. Until this movie I did not really know that he was also doing movie soundtracks, although when I checked in later I discovered that I had seen without knowing several movies that he worked on. Really, a wonderful job there. <br /> <br /> In all, a solid ten. I would recommend this movie to anyone. And I'm definitely going to see it with my younger siblings - they can watch a movie like this among all the hysteria special effect pattern that they often see.
