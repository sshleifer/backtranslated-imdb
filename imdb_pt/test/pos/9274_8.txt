I was very excited to see a documentary about one of my favorite Italian directors. D'Amato took an interest in everything from Horror, post-apocalyptic to hardcore porn. He has played genius a few times with films such as Buio Omega and Emmanuelle & The Last Cannibals. This documentary is a long and informative guide to the films of D'Amato. He is interviewed with English subtitles scrolling at the bottom of the screen. The excerpts from his films are narrated by a narrator (with English subtitles). The documentary proved extremely interesting when he analyzed the "Emmanuelle In America", often censored. Here D'amato explains in detail the false scenes of "snuff" and recalls some funny stories. In fact, good old Joe is very warm and funny, always with a smile and smoking a cigarette. The only disappointing aspect of this documentary is that he spends little time on the D'Amato horror films, such as Anthropophagus and the brilliant Buyo Omega. She spends a lot of time in erotic cinema and hardly touches post-apocalyptic films. But I can not complain. It's wonderful to see D'Amato get the respect he deserves. Highly recommended for D'Amato fans. May he rest in peace.
