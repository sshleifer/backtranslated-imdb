I can not say what the knowledge of the source for this movie adds, but this is one of my favorite movies by Paul Mazursky (director and co-author). This is a resumption of Shakespeare's "comedy," but totally removed from the stage. Without much text, Mazursky and the star Cassavettes make visual a midlife crisis of passion and purpose. Desperate to re-center, Cassavettes retreats to a remote Greek island - where the locals and the island itself weave a little magic. With Raul Julia especially, Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald, this is an adult fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually beautiful. It is funny. It was not a big blockbuster, but whenever it hits the DVD, it will sell.
