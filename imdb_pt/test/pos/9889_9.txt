This movie is hilarious, brilliant and insightful. While perhaps the story worked well for almost any ethnic group, the inherent Jewish character of the characters gives extra meaning to the generosity of wonderful dialogue. There were so many social issues covered in the plot that, for that alone, would be worth seeing; but the real treasure was in the warm laughter that spread to the appreciative audience. The mix of complex characters with their various strengths and weaknesses play their roles with all the pathetic and moody of the Shakespearean drama that their lives seem to parody. This is a family movie; - about the often fragile, sometimes invisible, connection of various personalities and lifestyles, first between brothers and parents, and inevitably between the large family of friends and even strangers. The technical aspects of the film gave the film a rhythm and development that keep the viewer intrigued until the final scene. Peter Falk is incredible, as always, in his role as patriarch of the Morris Applebaum family. Strong performances from an excellent cast include a surprise guest. Do not miss this movie!
