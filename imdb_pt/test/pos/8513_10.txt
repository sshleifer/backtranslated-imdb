Let me start with the many comments I read here, and say that this film is one of the top five titles, along with Her Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia With Love, License To Kill, and For Your Eyes Only Roger Moore actually played the role of Bond rather than futzing around). Of course, Sean Connery brings it all together - as a co-writer, co-producer and in his best performance since From Russia With Love. He's fit, energetic, and obviously having fun. Her acting is mature, confident and laced with the right amount of humor. This is in stark contrast to his mechanical performance in Thunderball, his sleepwalking through You Only Live Twice, and his joke and barriguda through that drawing known as Diamonds Are Forever! <br /> <br /> This is an imaginative reworking of Thunderball without having the sets and machines crushing the characters and plot. This cast is far superior, too. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings her unique style to the role of Largo without depending on an eye patch, SPECTER ring or a flat uniform. Kim Basinger is athletic and adorable, Barbara Carrera is dynamic and, for once, we have a great Felix Leiter in Bernie Casey. The representations of M and Q are original, and the addition of the Small-Fawcett bumbler is fun without falling into slapstick. <br /> <br /> Director Irvin Kershner makes good use of his locations (the Bahamas and the French Riviera). ) without losing sight of its actors. Although a close inspection reveals some mediocre special effects and lapses of continuity, Kershner keeps the film in good rhythm, unlike Thunderball (which even its director, Terence Young, did not like). Obviously, fans will miss the trademark of the cannons and theme song 007, but they are, after all, owned by Eon Productions. <br /> <br /> Michel LeGrand may not have composed the most memorable track but captures the song. atmosphere of the places without being overly intrusive. Not surprisingly, her best moments are in the South of France, with her French love song (at the health spa) being particularly attractive. And tell me, how many really remember Moonraker's music? I personally prefer to forget Man With the Golden Gun and A View To Kill! <br /> <br /> Eon people can mock this movie if they want. (Yes, Octopussy made more money.) At least Connery's mature 007 did not swing through the jungle with a shout from Tarzan. He did not play with a Bengal tiger, nor did he fight the snake charmers "Indians" with a tennis racket. Despite Eon's desperate efforts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and the late Jack Schwartzman put together a great film, which I think Ian Fleming would have appreciated. <br /> <br /> If, however, you'd rather see James Bond get kicked in the shin by a dwarf, engage in another tiring fight with "Jaws," jump in bed with Grace Jones, or take a chase firefighter slapstick through San Francisco, this is not the movie for you!
