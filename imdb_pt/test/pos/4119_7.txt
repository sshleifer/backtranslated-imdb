George Saunders is a forger who steals a rare copy of Hamlet, killing a guard in the process. Months later, an associate of him is selling fakes of the book for large sums of money. One of the forgeries is sold to a man who works for the Nazis. Not happy to be carried away by the Nazi front insists on getting his money back, at the same time that an investigator working for one of the other fraudulent clients appears. The middle woman in an effort to stay safe begins to play all sides against each other and establishes a meeting in the New York public library between various parties, however, as people begin to die, the library is locked and more murders (and perhaps some rare book theft) seems to be about to happen. Complex mystery of murder is a good little thriller with a great cast (Saunders is accompanied by Richard Denning and a cast of solid support players) If there is a flaw the film is almost too complicated with plots with in plots and all practically by themselves . The layers of robbery, counterfeiting, assassination and intrigue of wartime (this was in 1942) are almost too much for the short runtime of 70 minutes. It's still a nice little movie with a darkness and sense of inescapable disgrace to some of the characters that clearly marks this as one of the first noirs films. Until Denning shows up, we're among some charming thieves we like, maybe even more than the hero, but it's clear that with words and deeds this will not have a completely happy ending, and they know it even if they fight. A good little movie that is worth researching.
