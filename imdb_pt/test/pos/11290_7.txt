Even though it does not really matter to the film, this is a Creation myth. God (a convulsed and bloody figure in a chair) cuts his organs with a razor and dies in His own dirt. Mother Earth rises from her body and impregnates herself with her seed, giving birth to the man. However, it is highly unlikely that you will discover any of this without first reading a synopsis, and this is not especially important for the film you make, as it is more of a surrealistic art image, all black and rendered. White. A sick and somber atmosphere is created with austere photography and minimal sounds (mostly water dripping, groans, scratches, etc.), but each scene is a little too long, just like the movie as a whole. This could have been great as a short film, and God's killing scene was excellent and extremely creepy, especially being the first thing you see, but it's hard to be patient when you're gone for so long and you do not even know the which you are seeing most of the time. <br /> <br /> Still, a good movie for the original style, images, atmosphere and content.
