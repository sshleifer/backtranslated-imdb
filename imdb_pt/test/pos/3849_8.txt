"The Aristocats" is Disney classic at its best. It's not considered the classic Disney alongside the best-known Disney films, but it's a well-made and entertaining movie that certainly deserves to be a Disney classic. "Aristocats" is certainly a treat for kids, because it has all the components for a fun children's movie. I really liked it as a kid. I'm not sure if this movie is a sure treat for adults who could watch Disney classics because of nostalgia, but I still like this movie as a young adult. <br /> <br /> Storywise, "Aristocats" may not be so complex or innovative, but it does not matter. This film was made in the period when the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were the story and the verse, which "Aristocats" certainly shows. The characters make the movie; They are all friendly, fun, have great lines and have a great interaction with each other. The voice actors are also part of making the characters so compelling (Eva Gabor as Duchess, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley and etc). One misconception could have been the dogs Napoleon and Lafayette, since they are suspect and do not have much to do with the real story, but fortunately they are fun and entertaining characters, and the scenes with them are pure gold. <Br/> "Aristocats" is both fun and cute, but it's also a very funny drawing. The style of animation and appearance fits perfectly into the French ambience of the movie (especially the city of Paris looks great). The animation and character design are great. And the songs are really catchy too. My favorite is "Scale and Arpeggios", but the title song is a fluffy song, along with "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and the memorable show-stopper "Everybody Wants To Be A Cat." And George Burns's score is a perfect fit for funny movie and emotional situations. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Aristocats" is in my opinion the best Disney cartoon of the '70s and it's a movie that deserves so much to be seen and remembered. So what are you waiting for? Do yourself a favor and share this Disney classic with your kids. It deserves to be in your memories.
