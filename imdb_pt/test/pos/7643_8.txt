Soon Ike reveals Archie's strong desire to kill his mischievous wife, Divana (Dagmara Dominczyk), an erotic dancer for Carnival. Things soon get complicated when Archie falls in love with Divana and warns her about the scheme. They engage in a very hot topic that leaves little to the viewer's imagination, after which they soon make a plan. Together, they plan to kill Ike, but things do not go as planned. <br /> <br /> I would be lying if I said that this movie did not surprise me. I was personally impressed by how good this movie was. By renting it several years ago, I was expecting another thrill thriller with many of the elements and typical themes that are shown in many such movies these days. In a few minutes I got hooked and I found myself very involved with the world of this film. It's the kind of movie, much like BUFFALO '66, which just sucks and transports you to the style and sense of paranoia. It's a movie that really does it in an impressive way. One thing I particularly enjoyed was how the movie portrayed its characters. The film is not as easy and clear as it may appear in the plot summary. These are characters that you really care about and are fascinated with, including the characters that are supposedly villains. In fact, there are no good or bad guys in this movie. All characters are flawed in ways that are realistic and incredibly realistic. There are not many movies that can accomplish this task as perfectly as this movie, but it's definitely a movie style that I like and want to see more of today's movies. There were some crime movies that were like that back in the early 50's but there has not been one so exciting and unique like this ever since! <br /> <br /> In terms of flaws, I have mostly minor complaints. The movie itself is not exactly original. However, I doubt most people expect it to be original. The editing style of the film can also be annoying for some people as it tends to have an unstable type of camera throughout the shoot. Although I have not bothered with this and really felt that this has been added to the atmosphere, I'm sure most viewers will not be so thrilled about it and maybe think this is generally disappointing. Despite minor flaws, this is one of the most underrated films of the 2000s. It's so refreshing to be lucky and watch an unfamiliar movie that turns out to be good. It looks like this movie was released directly to the video, although this movie is way better than that. If he had been placed in theaters, he would have won no awards and would not have been seen much, but he would have much more recognition than he has today. Acknowledgment that this film deserves. TOUGH LUCK is an amazing, fun and distorted neo-noir thriller with a true sense of class and style juxtaposed and with enough substance to make the average viewer more than simply satisfied.
