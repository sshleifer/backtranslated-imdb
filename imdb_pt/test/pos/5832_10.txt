Oz was the first original television show that HBO put on its channel (in the form of 1 hour) and remains to this day the best ... The story is simple ... Oz is a surreal look at the life of high prisoners of maximum security in Oswald, mainly focusing on "In City". Now there are many things to praise this writing show (which in my opinion was the best on television when this show aired), directing (top notch) acting (best of the best), and the characters ... show literally exploded my socks ... This show was a critically acclaimed gem until The Sopranos bowed, after critics were salivating on this epic tale of confidence and family to realize this compelling drama ... Oz for me is a better show of the that Sopranos in general and it's a shame that I've never won any major Emmy awards ... ================================ =========================================== KUDOS
