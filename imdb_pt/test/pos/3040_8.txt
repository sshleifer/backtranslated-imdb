I just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the film leaves something to be desired, it is a moving and comforting study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and education in a biased South and the creativity of a teacher in connecting with students, despite the different contexts and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to their students and preparing them for all the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, it is a valuable concept that we all need to be reminded of. The discussion on the Vietnam War is true to this day. It is worth taking a look.
