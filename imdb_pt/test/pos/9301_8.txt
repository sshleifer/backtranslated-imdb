The film seemed a bit slow at first. But it picked up speed and went straight to the point. It showed exactly how the government and the scientist defended humanity and the reasons for the gadget. I liked. It's very close to reality like any movie about the atomic bombs that would be released in Japan. I recommended it to friends. I was particularly pleased with Dwight Schultz's acting ability.
