I was annoyed that the award for best makeup academy went to Dick Tracy, a horrible movie with a horrible makeup. The Nightbreed (based on the best novel "Cabal") looks great, the acting is excellent and David Chroneburg makes a truly scary and fantastic antagonist. <br /> <br /> The focus of the plot is Aaron Boone, who has recurrence. nightmares about a society of monsters living under a graveyard. Is he inventing or are they real and calling out for him? His psychologist (Chroneburg) convinces him that he is a murderer, a killer of families. Confused and suicidal, Boone seeks refuge in Midian, but the monsters do not want him in the beginning. He is also followed by his girlfriend, Lori, who refuses to give up on him even after he dies and returns cold and monstrous. <br /> <br /> But Decker will not let Boone continue. He raises the locals in an attack on Midian, like a holy war in the name of the gods led by the devil. Barkers themes of misunderstood monsters may come from their experiences as a male homosexual, but they are always strong and honest. Nightbreed turns the genre into your head. The monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone, but the man is hunting them. <br /> <br /> A cut of more than 20 minutes was originally sent by Barker, but the studio cut him off in this fractured masterpiece. Barker is working hard trying to locate the missing images for a director's release. Until then, this version will have to do.
