It is difficult to put Traffik's devastating beauty into words, in part because I am still struggling to understand it, several hours after my second performance. First, it must be said that Traffik contains some of the most incomparable and unforgettable scenes I have ever seen in a film or television production. The performance is excellent, particularly that of Bill Paterson as British minister struggling with his heroin-addicted daughter and an aid agreement to Pakistan that relies on drug-related issues. Another plot line describes these ground-level drug problems in Pakistan, and revolves around a poppy farmer who suffers from problems and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler. The third main plot involves the prosecution of a Hamburg drug importer and the conflicting efforts of his wife and two German detectives while he is being tried. It is a deep realization that the interplay between these stories seems natural, transcending the forced interweaving of plots often found in Hollywood movies. It is an even greater achievement than a work spread across three countries and a half dozen main characters can be so focused and captivating without having to oversimplify. It is devastating - dark and brutal, but never apathetic. In short, Traffik is a rare film work that deals with challenging subjects with unparalleled compassion and clarity.
