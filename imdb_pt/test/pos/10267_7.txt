As with FOOTPRINTS (1975), I became aware of this by chance: it was mentioned in a review of THE LIBERTINE (1969), which I researched when the film appeared on Italian TV late at night, as if it were in a similar situation. vein; Incidentally, I missed this show of THE LIBERTINE (although I purchased through the same channel later) but I was able to watch the movie through a rental of the DVD R1 dubbed by English during my stay in Hollywood at the end of 2005. / beginning of 2006. In fact, in view of his enthusiastic criticism, I was disappointed with THE LIBERTINE - being very lighthearted for what was essentially a serious subject (the sadomasochistic relationship between a young couple)! To be honest, for the most part, I feared that the frightened woman would follow exactly the same path ... but then was largely redeemed by a perverse (if not rather unpredictable) final turnaround. <br /> <br /> The film concerns the social attitudes of free-thinking and the dazzling creative arts prevailing at that time: an eminent philanthropist (Philippe Leroy) invites a journalist (Dagmar Lassander) into his elegant house by the end of week; however, it turns out that he is a misogynist who distrusts all members of the opposite sex and prefers to dominate them (or even kill them)! So for the first half of the narrative, we see the heroine suffering pain and humiliation in Leroy's hands (including being forced to make love to a mannequin in her own image!) ... until the tables are subtly but not surprisingly, : not only does she emancipate herself from her control, but she teaches that man and woman can coexist harmoniously - except that Lassander also follows her personal agenda! <br /> <br /> The protagonists are perfectly listed, and the film itself is often obscurely comical to those in the mood; moreover, it is greatly stimulated by a typically effervescent score of "Euro-Worship" (from the ever-reliable Stelvio Cipriani) and by the imaginative appearance - even outr√© - (the giant structure representing the lower part of the female form, with a steel trap ). where her sexual organ should be, seems to emanate from Freud: in fact, that object figured prominently in the pictures I had previously seen of THE FURNISH WOMAN ... but she barely registers herself in the film itself!). Other bizarre touches include the absurd radio program "Sexual Aberrations and the Stars," and an idyll in a castle belonging to Leroy's family, with secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarven servant. One of the highlights, then, is the virtually erotic dance of Lassander virtually naked - an episode that really heads the "humanization" of Leroy; Eventually, the two characters have a "showdown" in the last pool - fun set for a Spaghetti Western theme! In the long run, for all its elegance, the film emerges as inferior to Yasuzo Masumura BLIND BEAST's (1969) similar but much more extreme Japanese masterpiece. Finally, it is worth noting that THE WIGHT FOUNDAED was distributed in the US by the company Audubon Films, by filmmaker Radley Metzger; he would even employ his production designer (Enrico Sabbatini) for his own CAMILLE 2000 (1969)! To get to the edition I've seen: in addition to the usual shortcomings in the English dubbing department, the performance here was further hampered by a rather faded look and brief examples of distraction from strange noises on the soundtrack! By the way, there seems to be some confusion as to the running time of the film: its duration given in various sources ranges from 84 to 108 minutes - all I can say, however, is that the copy I own ran for 87 minutes. !
