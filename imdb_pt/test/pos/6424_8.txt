"Footprints (on the Moon)" is almost certainly the strangest, most complicated and most atypical Giallo ever made. It may come as a restraint for some of the fans of the sub genre, but this film lacks many of Giallo's regular marks like bloody knife murders (preferably committed by a masked killer wearing black gloves), snatching sparsely dressed beauties and unpredictable red Herrings However, to make up for all this? and much more ?? "Footprints" benefits from the most indescribably mysterious and uninterrupted atmosphere I have ever experienced in this type of film. The level of mystery in this movie is so loud and unbearable that it literally makes you feel uncomfortable and scared. Like the female lead herself, Alice Cespi, you absolutely have no idea what's going on or why, and that feeling of utter impotence is unquestionably the main strength of the film. As a spectator, you want to help this poor woman understand the things that surpass her, but you just can not. Alice has a successful career as an interpreter, but her quiet, peaceful life is brutally disrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly begins to realize that she has absolutely no memory of the previous three days. She finds a ripped photo of a hotel located on the holiday island Gama and decides to go there to investigate what happened. On the island, several people, including a lonely little girl, seem to recognize Alice, only she used the fake name Nicole, wore a red wig and acted as if she came to the island to hide from unknown danger. Meanwhile, even the poor girl's nights are restless as she dreams of astronauts jumping on the surface of the moon and a mysterious scientist named Dr. Blackman. The plot of "Footprints" is truly bizarre and slowly thoughtful, and particularly the cosmic subplane is really hard to connect with the rest. Alice assumes that it's just images from a science fiction movie that she's seen a long time ago, which seems like a fairly reasonable explanation, but you feel there's a deeper meaning and a real connection to all of the other events. Fans of Italian cinema, driven by tension and style, can not afford to miss this movie, actually. This is the psychological tour-de-force of director Luigi Bazzoni, with incredibly beautiful photography and mind-altering music. Despite the lack of violence (or maybe just because of it), the film is genuinely disturbing and the mental agony that Alice goes through honestly affects the viewer emotionally as well. As unfortunately is often the case in Gialli's cinema, the climax suddenly comes quite abrupt and hardly gives a waterproof explanation of all the difficult events you have just witnessed during the last hour and a half. Still, the content of "Footprints" will keep you thinking long after the movie ends and its powerful impact will only increase. Florinda Bolkan is sublime as the tormented protagonist and receives excellent feedback from the cast of limited support, including young Nicoletta Elmi. The eminent Euro-worshiping star Klaus Kinski also receives the highest award, but his role is merely a major participation. This film is actually much better than the most acclaimed (and much easier available) director of Bazzoni's "The Fifth Cord" Giallo, so here is the hope that "Footprints" will soon also receive a DVD release.
