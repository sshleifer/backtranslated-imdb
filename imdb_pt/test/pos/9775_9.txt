Somehow, CHANGI lost at the AFI Awards for MY BROTHER JACK. The latter, a high-quality adaptation of George Johnston's immortal novel, was excellent - but, in my opinion, not as good as CHANGI. I have heard that many critics have rejected CHANGI for being irrelevant, unimportant, historically inaccurate or even disrespectful. Who and where are these critics? CHANGI is excellent. More than that. Bright. It's not to be a documentary - surely I can forgive the survivors of Changi (or any survivor of a prisoner of war camp) for being disappointed in the production - but for the rest of us, CHANGI represents the remarkable power of friendship in times of extreme adversity. It contains a part of Australian culture that seems to be dwindling as times get easier and less challenging but one we must never forget: Australians were respected around the world after Gallipoli and WW2 for their camaraderie and sense of humor . Classification: 96/100. See also: GALLIPOLI; PARADISE ROAD; THE LAST BULLET; THE SUGAR FACTORY.
