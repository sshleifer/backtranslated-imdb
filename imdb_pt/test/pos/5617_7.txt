A brilliant young man interested in "serious" music (admittedly an endangered race - who plays the violin when no one plays the violin ??) - could find this an interesting fiction about street children and great musical stars. of his generation and the film give him a rare chance on the screen to display his technique. The boys, especially Gene Reynolds, are fine and, after all, the photo is a good example of first-class studio family. but it's a great way for a smart family to spend a rainy afternoon with AMC or Video Store - good luck at Blockbuster !!!
