In a word ... magic. And so incredibly real. Vijay Raaz is so incredibly raw, so incredibly vulnerable, that you just want your characters to succeed, at whatever they do. And he plays Hari Om impeccably - from his absolutely perfect "Bollywood e-shtyle" to his shy and awkward form with a first kiss. He is a truly talented actor and I would not hesitate to see him in anything because he brings everything to life and gives him a soul. Camille Natta is absolutely beautiful. It took some time for me to warm up with her - possibly because she plays the part of an ignorant tourist, but fascinated so well. Her transition really became her and she shaped her role very well. Even the man you love to hate, your boyfriend Benoit, was wonderful, although you never really like him for the scum he plays, Jean-Marie Lamour stages a perfect bitch. The script, so real. I found myself turning to my friend over and over throughout the movie to say, "This is exactly what happens in India! They hit it right!" Very real, very raw. VERY bittersweet, but you certainly leave the theater feeling satisfied. Nitin Sawhney's music is wonderful and blends perfectly with the ever-changing mood. But Vijay Raaz ... I see myself constantly coming back to him because he is what makes this movie. He's the hero, the most charming and unarmed rickshaw driver you'll ever find - he's magic. A lovely, real, sweet, incredibly talented actor that I can not wait to see shine and succeed in Bollywood, Hollywood or anywhere!
