My husband received OBWAT DVD for Christmas and it was the best gift we received! We watch every time we need to laugh and so far we have seen 12 times! The landscape of this movie is beautiful and the music is great! We also buy the soundtrack and play it on our vehicles and at home when you need a pick me up and that is also daily! If anyone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie lovers this movie is it! The characters are hilarious, charming, and their facial expressions are very funny to describe! I've always been a fan of George Clooney, but now I'm also a fan of Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete) and now I'm looking for them in other movies! You have to see this movie !!!
