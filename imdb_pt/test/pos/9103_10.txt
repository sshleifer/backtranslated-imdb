This movie is very silly and very funny. You can not criticize him for taking yourself seriously. If you've heard the previous album or seen the HBO videos from the album, you can imagine the great moment of babbling that this movie tells the fable of how the group Tenacious D came to be formed. <br /> <br /> Full of cameos, not only gives a fictional account of Tenacious D, but also is a summary of the musical history. The humor recalls Something about Mary, for they often "go to places you thought they would not," but do not have the eschatological mood of South Park. This movie contains no nudity except in mooning.
