"Back in the Day" is an interesting but flawed endeavor. Ja Rule plays Reggie Cooper, an honest but sad man, trying to deal with his father's death. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames), who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali), who is the pastor's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime. <br /> <br /> Ja Rule does a competent job like Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone. It brings a lot of energy and threat to the role. Joe Morton as the preacher is his excellent self as always, but he does not do much. The same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as Reggie's father. He needed more time on the screen. I do not want to say this, but Pam Grier is horrible like Mrs. Cooper. She beats all the scenes and brings the movie down. Aunt Carrere and Frank Langella are in it, but they do not do anything substantial for the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end: You must see it for the skillful performances of Ving Rhames and Joe Morton and the harshness of writing and driving.
