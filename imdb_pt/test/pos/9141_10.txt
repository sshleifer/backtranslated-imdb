With a little wine, some friends and good humor, I had a lot of fun watching this movie. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Jilon Ghai (as "Randy"), who was so kicked in his pants! Her scenes with Charity Rahmer ("Michelle") were a lot of fun. I did not want him to come to me, but it was great to see "Randy" try to score with "Michelle" and even better seeing the results! Of course, the girls in the movie are a lot of fun to watch as well. And, a friend of mine showed me the PLAYBOY edition that had Pilar Lastra as the Playmate of the Month. She is definitely a spectator. All in all, this movie fully served its purpose, which was to entertain us in a light and carefree way.
