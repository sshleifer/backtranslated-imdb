Peter Falk shines with Morris Applebaum, 90, the patriarch who has decided it's time to "take a look" after giving a final party. His three children, Lauran San Giacomo, David Paymer and Judge Reinhold, are notified / invited by letter and immediately arrive at their door to deal with their eccentric father. There is a great chemistry father / daughter with Laura San Giacomo, whose character goes through more trial growth. It is a well-rounded example of your dysfunctional family and their memories, pains, growth and ignorance / tolerance of one's life. The musical score is one that you will enjoy and the pamphlets are well timed and hilarious. Although I found the party "Checking Out" a disappointment, the rest of the movie is sure to make you laugh, cry and leave the movies with a smile on your face. Move on "Big Greek Greek Wedding" .... the "Big Fat Jewish Suicide" has arrived.
