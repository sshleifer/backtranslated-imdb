Peter Lorre makes one of his best performances as a Hungarian watchmaker who comes to the United Staes to make a new life for himself and one day bring his girl across the great lake to be with him. Lorre's contagious optimism and luminous perspective emerge very effectively, which makes the performance even better when he has his face horribly burned in a hotel fire, and when no one gives him the opportunity to work, he reluctantly turns to life of crime. Lorre's career as an actor is rarely as apparent as in this film with his jovial, well-educated immigrant, his depressed, melancholy, and disfigured self searching for the truth behind what he believed the United States provided him. hood more than his average, to his understanding relationship with a blind woman with whom he falls in love. The story is very rhythmic, has some interesting twists and gives Lorre many opportunities to shine. Director Robert Florey does quality work behind the lens, and the entire supporting cast helps the film with Evelyn Keyes giving a particularly good turn as the blind girl. I loved the ending - and the truth - that shone to exist in Lorre's character, despite all the negative things that society had done about him. For a small B-frame, The Man Behind the Mask is a good movie for its time.
