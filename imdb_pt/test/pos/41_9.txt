What a wonderful film, full of eccentric and unique characters, beautifully performed by a great cast. The director also did a great job keeping the story together, getting those wonderful performances (not messing with them) and using music (and what a wonderful song it is) with great effect. S. Epatha in the lead role is great. I've always heard that she is a brilliant theater actor, and although I have liked her in Law and Order, it really shows what she can do with a complex and fulfilled role. Macy Gray is fantastic, Mos Def as usual, wonderful. Lou Gossett, great. Jimmy Smits, great, and does not try to focus because he's a star. A real piece of acting ensemble. <br /> <br /> Rent it, have fun, enjoy it and value it. Something special.
