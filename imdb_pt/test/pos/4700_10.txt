"Sister Helen" is an excellent documentary about a rigid, intolerant, foul-mouthed, bitter, oblate (civilian) nun who runs a drunken and doped shelter in a very dilapidated neighborhood in the South Bronx. All but one of the 21 residents are drunk / addicted. Robert, the only representative of the middle class? he had a real job, home and even a BMW? he regrets that she died before he could speak to her. Because? <br /> <br /> Robert, like six of the villagers, was on parole. He complained that Helen was holding a huge stick over him and constantly threatened to hand him over if he did not pull the cow. In an "extras" interview, did he say that Helen ran the center to make up for the deaths of the three men in his life? her husband and her two children. <br /> <br /> The husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at age 55. One boy died of heroin overdose and the other was stabbed to death at age 15. Helen stayed with a daughter, whom she abandoned to run the center. The daughter was not satisfied. She wanted her mother. <br /> <br /> What's fascinating is how little Helen has changed. On the outside, it looks like she made a huge sea change. But after seeing this fascinating and disturbing video a few times - once with the narrating directors - it became clear that Helen replaced 21 male addicts to send around to replace her three dead males. <br/> <br/> Helen admits that she ignored her children and spent every day in bars. But his arrogance, intolerance and sharp tongue did not arise at 56 years. Living with her must have been extremely difficult. Even Robert says he got clean despite Helen. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Helen abusing abusively a man who wants to live in the shelter. Supposedly she's showing off her street knowledge. Again, she publicly lowers Mel, her "assistant" for not taking a shower for a year. Then she shakes her dirty pillowcase in the air. The film is slimy with Helen threatening and humiliating people. His signature song is "My Way". Her favorite phrase is, "I'll be totally honest with you." Often, the people who use these phrases turn out to be the opposite. <br /> <br /> The locals are really down and out. Only Robert has any commercial skills other than pushing a broom. All of them desperately need a roof over their heads, and Helen, since she runs the place alone, has the power to admit or drive out anyone she wants. She does not have administrative advice to respond and does not receive public funding. It's her show. <br /> <br /> Helen believes in approaching cookies for sobriety. She stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone can too. She blames substance abuse on the drug or the drink, not the underlying problems that led men to drink and drug. She is not a therapist, just a landlady who paints her hair, uses a habit and exercises power over her tenants, and stops drinking. <br/> <br/> Helen also dominates her prisoners by demanding urine tests (ureen she calls) on orders. Twice Major, an older, solid, respected long-term resident - whom she trusted - failed the tests. Helen was furious and dumped him. Major held firm and said the results were wrong because he never used heroin. Helen did not relent and failed to consider that a mistake could have been made. This has been especially troubling since she met Major for a long time. However, she cashed his relationship with him, assumed he was a liar, and completely trusted the results. Major eventually discovered that codeine in his cough syrup appeared as an opiate. Helen never publicly apologized, but supposedly made amends with major. Helen also had a bad reputation in her old neighborhood. She tacitly admitted to Robert that she once stayed up late into the night to cut someone's tires. The person deceived her and certainly deserved to have her tires cut off. She was not a nice woman. So, eventually, did she decide that the only way to keep Travis's (her last name) name alive? since the three male Travises died ?? was to start the Travis Center. <br /> <br /> For some of the locals, it was a great deal. They agreed with Helen and in return received a cheap, safe, sober and structured place to live. One of them, however, said he preferred the arrest. Addicts and drunks do not need to be treated like children. Helen employed "old school" techniques that were discredited. However, no one was forced to stay in the center and for some it was definitely a positive experience. The Travis Center is not a treatment center. It is a residence for alcoholics and dopers that what to straighten their lives. <br /> <br /> To receive Sister Helen's full experience, see all the extra interviews, as well as the audio version, in which the two directors share their experiences living with Sister Helen and her guests.
