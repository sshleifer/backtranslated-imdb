Kevin Kline offers a brilliant comedic twist on the 1997 IN & OUT comedy. Kline plays Howard Brackett, a small-town history teacher who sits down to attend Academy Awards this year because one of his former students (Matt Dillon) is a nominee. He is nominated for his performance in a film where he plays a gay soldier and when he wins, he thanks Howard in his speech for inspiring him because Howard is gay. Now this Howard floors because it as no clue why so dude would say that on international television. Howard is even engaged to get married (for Joan Cusack in an Oscar-nominated performance), so he has no idea where Cameron Drake got the idea that he is gay and thinks he has to defend himself for everyone at school, but it is shocked that no one seemed terribly shocked by what Cameron said at the Oscars. Howard has a birthday party where he receives birthday presents like the YENTL soundtrack and ends up explaining to his guests why Barbra Streisand had to do the FUNNY LADY. His parents (Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds) are shocked, but promise to support their son, even if he is gay. He also gets a visit from an outside reporter (Tom Selleck) who wants to do an article about him because he is gay too. The moment when Selleck plants a big kiss on the lips of Kline is a classic. But all these little things have Howard really questioning his sexuality and wondering if he really is gay ... much to the aggravation and frustration of his fiancee, Cusack, who is beyond confused. The scene in which she leaves a bar in her wedding dress and stands in the middle of the street screaming about the lack of single heterosexual men in the world is a classic. But what I like about this movie is the way Kline invests totally on paper and is not afraid to look silly or look gay. There's a fabulous scene, probably the most famous in the movie, where he buys a record, how to be male, and the guy on the record is talking about how real men do not dance and disco music comes on the scene. Let's Survive if memory serves) and the narrator on the disc says that no matter what you do, do not dance, but Howard can not help it and he ends up shaking his whole thing around the room. It's hysterically funny and Kline plays with sincerity and enthusiasm. The movie is not pro or anti gay ... it's just a clever and fun character study about a man trying to figure out exactly who he is. Wonderful movie.
