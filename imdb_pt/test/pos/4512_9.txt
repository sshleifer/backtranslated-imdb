It was fantastic. As a librarian and participant in the Vitality Fund event of the New York Library Association on Thursday night, October 18, I was privileged to see a preview of the new movie, The Kite Runner. The film's release was delayed due to concerns about the welfare of the children involved. Thank you for the NYLA event as planned. <br /> <br /> In relation to the film, I feel it was done with mastery. I've had as much of an impact on me as Stanley Kubrik's Mechanical Orange, though it's much less graphic - MUCH less. There is no comparison between the horrific and shocking violence and rape shown in The Mechanical Orange and the small amount of violence actually shown on Kite Runner; only the subject matter and implications for the human psyche are comparable. (I wrote more details on child rape and rape and how it was treated on my MySpace blog.) My overall impression was that this movie was fantastic; one of the most successful films I have ever seen. The depiction of Afghan boys fluttering their wings captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world. The subject is intensely serious, and the film carries the audience's emotions to the subject without many dissonant "Hollywood touches" that have ruined other films. Although the pomegranate-tipped cart was an obvious symbolism (for me). <br /> <br /> Finally, I must mention the excellence of the soundtrack. The boy's recitation of Rumi's poetry as two main characters are fleeing the country during the Russian invasion - under terrible circumstances - truly showed the power of these poems. I ask anyone who is watching to disregard the captions in this scene as far as you can, and just listen to the beauty of the language. I do not even know what language Amir is quoting, whether his Persian dialect Dari normal is the same as the original Persian dialect of Rumi. Also, note the sound heard every time a line of kite is cut off. I found a deep and distinct sound, though the librarians who were with me noticed nothing. I can not help but wonder if the kites actually make such a sound when they are "cut off", or give a sense of the vibration / sound experienced by the pamphlet during the competition.
