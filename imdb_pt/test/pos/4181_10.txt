This movie begins when it ends and ends when it begins. What's in the middle is a collection of comedy, philosophy, music, comments, comments, mini stories, colors and more. He looks at the world and our lives and tells the story of The Monkees from the point of view of the group members themselves. He also analyzes the television and the cinema and makes a visual commentary. It also shocks, with war scenes and shows how we are just pawns in a great game. That says all this and more, but if you do not look objectively, you will not see much more than joined scenes to join the music. It's the kind of movie that can never be boring because it's done so smart.
