In response to the "state of confusion," the dogs' injuries seem to disappear abruptly, but this may have been just a continuity error. But as for children trying to build a plane with garbage, it's just a simple matter of imagination. These are two very young children who have an extremely active imagination and need to rely on these imaginations to remain exposed to the reality of the level of abuse that occurs in their home with their stepfather. As for the stepfather, it is very interesting that the director has chosen not to show his face. This makes it look more monstrous. If you show his face, then this character becomes a person and not just this "monster" that is terrorizing the childhood of these two innocent children. By showing only the conceptions of their abuse and not focusing on scenes about the abuse itself, children become the main focus of the film. This movie has no loose ends, but works just like the story of a father to his children. It has embelleshments. This is a good American classic.
