I remember reading the original story of Balzac in French college. I remember Ken Nordine, from WGN-TV in Chicago, reading it as one of his nightly shows. <br /> I've always loved the story, but I never believe they could or would make a movie of it. To my surprise, they did and did it VERY well. Few of all of Balzac's stories lend themselves to the drama, which is unfortunate, and-cat that I am, I always expected to be filmed without much Hollywood having sex. This is the closest to the perfect conversion that could be done. <br /> <br /> The theater of the mind is always better than what the eyes can see, but this is as close as I think it can get to letting the imagination of reading know the reality of seeing.
