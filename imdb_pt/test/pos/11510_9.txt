This movie I have seen many times. I read the book, Englar Alheimsins, which was written by Einar Már Guðmundsson, who received the Scandinavian work prize for work. The movie does not start at the same place the book begins. This happens in Reykjavík and the main character, Páll is young and has a good life with his girlfriend. But when she breaks the relationship with him, he begins to have some headaches that make him angry and angry. And soon he begins to have major mental problems and then the film begins. Soon he is put on the Icelandic Mental Hospital called "Kleppur" and there you see some great characters like Viktor, who thinks he is Hitler and Oli, who thinks he writes all the Beatles songs and sends them to them with the mind. carrying Ingvar E Sigurðusson, who plays the main character that Páll does, is so good that it leaves you breathless. Also the music in this movie is crazy about SIGURRÓS and just for the cost of music you should see the movie. Overall, a great movie should be seen.
