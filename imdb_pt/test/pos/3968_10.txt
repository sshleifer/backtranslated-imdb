When I saw this movie, I hoped it was an extravagant American movie made with terrible actors. I was really surprised to find out that I was totally wrong. The film revolves around Bartely or B, who has been rejected by all his faculties - the actor who plays B is very natural and makes his character seem real - and decides to create a school of lies so that his parents stop harassing him . However, many people see your website fake and come together. Feeling his sorrows, B can not reject them to the disgust of his best friend. College is the ideal place with you learning what you want or doing nothing. The school faces opposition from the very faculty that ends up closing it. The movie ends up high and I recommend you to see it. Its got flaws, but it's a good movie feeling happy with some unpredictable twists.
