<br /> <br /> The Philistines must pay attention, especially the Americans! This has all the elements you hate - a languorous approach to cinematic language, a pictorial sense of composition, an intense homoerotic focus on your elegant narrative, a wonderful and unusual use of music, and worse yet, it is based on a story that you I probably hate it too ... If, however, you think the films do not have derivative plots, they are full of action and bad dialogue, they do not need the visual grammar of MTV / TV commercials, so watch. It's one of my favorite films and it may be the most perfectly formed work of Visconti. It's sublime, like Mahler's movement that he uses with insistence throughout the film.
