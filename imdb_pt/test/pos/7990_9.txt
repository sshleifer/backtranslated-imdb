As a child I grew up with the chic 1960's TV series (and no I'm not so old ?? POW!). However, when director Tim Burton brought his new vision to the silver screen, I simply gave it an immediate twinkle and never gave up favoring his installments on the latest additions ('Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'). , that I do not really care. Even if they are going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore Bruce Wayne / Batman psyche even more? but honestly, I do not think there is so much to play. I wanted crazy fun with a dark trace and in my eyes that's what Burton brought, and that's the reason why I can watch them over and over again. <br /> <br /> After impressing the public with Batman 1989, thanks to the Gothic art direction of the time, Jack Nicholson did not present himself as prisoner to the Joker, psychotic and camping. Burton would return 3 years later for the accompaniment and my favorite of the Batman movies so far; 'Batman Returns'. Camp, but well done. In that it would be even more expansive, taller, gloomy and nihilistic and have two villains foes for the price of one. Enter the grotesque penguin (with Danny DeVito magnificently sticking out in a limb) and the ravishing Catwoman (steaming Michelle Pfeiffer who fills suit) coming to ruin the Gotham party. Again, Batman (an appropriately shocking Michael Keaton is equally laudable and looks quite imposing in that bat suit? Look into the eyes) is the bandits' second violin, but I always preferred that sober interpretation of Batman that gave him an eerie, darkly mystical. , but also a psychological complexity that has never felt the need to force food. And Bruce Wayne's turn was well-served as well. Burton's illustratively atmospheric direction opens with his elegant Gothic style embossing a world of filtered carnival comics with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes. The melancholic narrative (in what is probably a little too long) is more symbolic in its progression, instead of showing its spontaneously flamboyant and extravagant pieces and drastically etched art direction, covered with dark reflections and gray / blue neon illumination of a winter scenery. The magnetically flowing camera work rises and Danny Elfman's breathtakingly spacious scale balances the fun with dark touches with a very hypnotic attraction. The rest of the presentations may be overshadowed, but Christopher Walken dumps his teeth in a role of a two-faced man, Max Shreck. Pat Hingle is back but has very little to do since commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough are delightful as Alfred. In solid support, Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens also make an appearance.
