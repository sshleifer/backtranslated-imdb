**** SPOILERS **** Buried beneath a mountain of medical bills and his funeral business not being able to pluck him out from under them Vito Lucia funeral director Tony Lo Bianco came up with a plan to make a load of money with the help of his two bent friends Moon & Bo, Richard Lynch and Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> Vito approaching Buddy Manucci, his childhood friend, Roy Scheider, as a mafia informant to gain Buddy's confidence and get him to tell Vito what's going on in the streets of New York. York in relation to mafia activities. Buddy is a cop who works on a NYPD sub, the Seven Ups, who does things "on the way" to clear the streets of New York from criminals. <br /> <br /> Vito gets information from Buddy and makes it seem to Buddy that he's really giving hints about the mob and what's happening and uses this information to alert his fellow villains, Moon & Bo, the mafiosi take their weekly seizures as well as kidnap the mafia loan sharks and keep them in ransom. <br /> <br /> Everything is going well for Vito & Co. until the crowd decides to retaliate and erroneously pick up beats and kidnappings. a member of Seven-ups Ansel, Ken Kercheval, who worked in disguise, was one of the henchmen who was kidnapping and tearing them up. Later Ansel was accidentally killed by Moon when he blew up the trunk of the car in which Ansel was locked, thinking that there was a suitcase full or redeemed, inside it. <br /> <br /> Fast paced and thrilling film with that brave and dirty picture of New York that was so effective in the movie "The French Connection," which also starred both Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco, who are also in this movie . Incredible car chase that began in downtown Brooklyn and ended up in the jungles of New Jersey about 15 to 20 miles away, with Buddy almost being beheaded for his heroic efforts. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider, who is not a big man, is as tough and effective as any great actor I can think of as Clint Eastwood would have been in the same movie. Scheider reminds me a lot, he still looks a bit like him, former midfielder and middleweight champion Gene Fullmer, who beat the great Sugar Ray Robinson for the middleweight championship in 1957 and acts like him also in the film: durable and durable destructive. <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is very good as Vito, the undertaker, the heel that touches Buddy and the mob to the point of leading Ansel to kill Buddy's partner. Even though he's trash, you can not in any way feel sorry for Vito, since he only wants the money he gets from the mafiosi to pay for the hospital and the medical bills of his sick wife Rose. Even the fact that Ansel was killed because of his actions, Vito never wanted anyone to get hurt, but as they say when you play with fire, you end up being burned. In the end, Vito has a lot to explain to the mobsters who are not so friendly and attentive. <br /> <br /> The movie "The Seven Ups" has the late Bill Hickman doing the dangerous acrobatics with car chases as well as acting in the film. Hickman was also the stuntman in both the big movies that did it driving on the streets of New York and San Francisco's "The French Connection" and "Bullitt" roads and highways.
