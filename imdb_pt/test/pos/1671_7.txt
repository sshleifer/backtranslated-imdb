As far as I'm concerned, this noir film had two totally different things, as opposed to the movie noirs that I'm used to seeing: 1 - the setting is Paris, France; 2 - there is a 28-minute scene without dialogues. <br /> <br /> Both make this movie a bit unique, at least for the noir fans of English-language cinema. In fact, an American, Jules Dussain, filmed the film, so it's not entirely a European film. Initially, I was disappointed after seeing the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored. However, once the silent segment began - the actual assault (you already know what it is about), the movie took on considerably and got better and better. <br /> <br /> In fact, I thought the best part of the story was what happened after the robbery. The best aspect of the whole film was cinematography. That's what makes the drive worth it. It's a great noir photograph and a real travel diary for those of us who have never seen Paris ... and this is Paris in the mid-fifties. There are many streets and rainy and rainy Paris buildings that I find fascinating to see. In fact, there were a lot more of these great films than London in the much better-known movie, The Third Man. <br /> <br /> The main actor here, Jean Servais, I think his name is, is also interesting to see. Someone described his face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton, and that sums it up perfectly. A warning to those who do not expect cursing or nudity in a classic movie. This is France, not the United States, so there's a bit of both here. I appreciate the DVD offering the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version as well.
