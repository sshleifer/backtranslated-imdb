Exclusively for Coop lovers, although Clint Eastwood has a strong and unobtrusive presence, it is a great asset to this very good documentary. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc.). ), as an older man, finally as a man sick and near death. After the "end," I did not have the feeling that I knew the man much better. But I had a great time, reviewing many of the best moments of his films; and my respect for the very talented and great professional actor was multiplied by ten. The film shows, most interestingly, how Cooper's career can be compared to the evolution of US society before and after World War II. Two of the great moments are the time when Cooper has to answer to justice about communism in the world of cinema; and when James Stewart (a great one too) received a prize for Cooper a month before his death. I'm not a weeping pot, but ... it was a close one! Watch if you can: it's worth it. ... If you love Cooper, that's it. Or an older America ...
