To say that I was not expecting much sitting down to watch "The Couch Trip" is a euphemism. I had no idea what it was - I thought it would be a journey into the sexuality field when I heard Chevy Chase playing a man with a condom and the title of the movie involves the word "couch ride", * wink, wink * Then I realized which had something to do with a mental institute and a patient escaping. My expectations diminished even more. <br /> <br /> I was literally waiting for a smile movie - the kind you smile at once and leave feeling a little cheated. And in a way, this is cheap comedy - it does not have the biggest jokes, the plot is ridiculous, but you know what? I had a big stupid grin on my face the whole time I was watching. <br /> <br /> Dan Aykroyd plays John Burns, a patient in a psychiatric hospital who may or may not be really mental. He gives psychiatrist Lawrence Baird (David Clennon) a lot of sadness and misery, which leads us to believe that he is a sane person after all. <br /> <br /> After a small riot at the mental institute Cafeteria, Burns is expecting a baird from Baird in his office when the phone rings. Burns grabs, pretends to be Baird, and discovers that the caller on the other line, Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), wants the real Dr. Baird to fill a radio shrink named George Maitlin (Charles Grodin), who is vacationing with his wife , Vera (Mary Gross). Michaels wants Baird so much that he booked a ticket on a plane. <br /> <br /> Burns runs away from the institute with the help of a receptionist and drives to O'Hare. He takes the note from Dr. Baird, gets on the plane and eventually poses as Dr. Baird. Your show is a phenomenal success. "People love it!" One man says, and the other man responds, "It's because he really cares about them." <br /> <br /> Donald Becker (the late, great Walter Matthau) is a former mental patient who recognizes Burns' clothes to be pants and confining shirts. To keep him quiet, Burns promises Becker a percentage of his income. The secret is kept closed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Maitlin and his wife argue. He flies home to finish his vacation and realizes that the man on his talk show is not actually Dr. Baird, after all, but no one believes him. He gets the real dr. Baird, but unfortunately he lost his identity, so the police consider them sullen and do not listen to their story. <br /> <br /> Let me name just a few of the plot holes. noticed while watching this movie: Burns poses as Dr. Baird, but is never asked for his identity, even when claiming his plane ticket (he was stolen, he says, but they still make sure it is Baird). If Burns Becomes So Famous, How Did The Real Dr. Baird In Chicago Never Hear People Talking About It? The word travels. And finally, why would the police arrest Maitlin and Baird (ie the real Baird) without following their stories? <br /> <br /> To be frankly honest, I could not care less. I entered this movie with a closed mind and this surprised me - I really enjoyed it. It entertained me. His ideas are essentially ridiculous and unrealistic, but Dan Aykroyd makes a truly witty halfback performance that makes "The Couch Trip" a worthwhile trip. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
