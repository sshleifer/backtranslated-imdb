You can not watch this movie for a history lesson. This was the first time I heard of the Ma Barker saga, but I realized almost immediately that the facts were wrong. And with a little research on the internet, I realized I was right, of course. Ma Barker is certainly not the sexy, calculating woman the film portrays her to be, and apparently has not orchestrated all the bank robberies, pranks, and murders that her criminal boys have performed. <br /> <br /> But do not expect a brilliant police drama. The script and acting are adequate, the shootings are excessive and almost unrealistic, and there is a very laughable slow-motion death scene. So why did I give 7 out of 10? <br /> <br /> Because it was so much fun. Shootings are fun to watch, but there are some deeper themes that emerge between them. The film has a strong sense of ego intimidation among the cast of alpha males, each with its own agenda. And I appreciate the minimal use of profanity for the period. The scenarios are great, reproducing a compelling era of the 1930s. So watch this movie as if it were a cult movie, and take the excess blood and cruelty with extremely serious comments from the man of the FBI. who wants to bring down the Barkers at any cost. In other words, do not take it too seriously, just enjoy it. And if you like that, you'll love Serial Mom.
