Hard Justice is a great action movie! The whole movie is nothing more than shooting and fighting! For people who say they do not do shoot ups like they usually do. Well, this one is really hard-core! David Bradley is really good and his character takes a hit in the movie. He is hit by the stick more than a dozen times, is stabbed in the back and stays in coma for three days and then wakes up and fights again, is beaten, recovered and ready for more action! Your character is incredibly tuff! Charles Napier was also very good and he undoubtedly steals the show! Vernen Wells was good! Professor Toru Tanaka had a short and uncredited role in Hard Justice! As for the action, it's really amazing with all the weapons fights and the huge stand off as the scene at the beginning has cars being blown up and getting up in the air! There is so much that happens in the runtime of 95 minutes. For action fans, you'll be delighted with all the fire and fighting power this movie has to offer! Hard Justice is a film that is not easy to locate and if you are in a video store and see it for sale, buy it because this movie is a great guardian and the box is cool! There is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed! See and see if you can find some good deals on Ebay, Half.com, Z-Shops from Amazon.com and market vendors! I strongly recommend that any fan of action movies that loves filming ems movies and fights and has been disappointed with other movies that look like a real non stop action movie but that is not delivered to Hard Justice!
