This is definitely a "must see" movie. The excellent director Alain Chabat (also acting as Ceasar) managed to capture the very essence of the "Adventures of Asterix" (the French comic books on which it is based) and create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy that is also a tribute to the world of animated movies. This movie is so funny, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that it can take two or three sessions before you realize them all, amidst your burst of laughter. The only disadvantage is that a non-French audience (or at least a non-French speaking public) may not receive all the "private jokes". There are so many impossible-to-translate dialogues, so many situations directly related to comics or the French way of life, that fun can be diminished. However, it is still worth seeing the beautiful image, the incredible acrobatics, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting. All the actors are great, but the film would not be the same without Jamel Debouze, Gérard Darmon and Edouard Baer. And, please, NEVER compare this magnificent film with the terrible previous, based on the same comics: "Astérix et Obélix Contre César" and directed by Claude Zidi.
