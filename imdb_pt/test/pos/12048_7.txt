I have seen many Shahrukh movies and this is a very good role for him. He has this versatility, but he remains mostly in positive roles. Like Rahul, he's very dark and disturbing, but I've seen him sympathize with a lot of the movie. If for nothing else, watch this movie for Shahrukh. He plays a very complex and real character very convincingly. The story is very typical and has been made before, but the development of the character is very strong and fun. The opening is a bit confusing, but in the end it does not matter. The songs that I found very pleasant and give an idea of ​​what the characters are thinking. Very clever. I think this movie was really good and I recommend it to all Shahrukh Khan fans. Must see!
