I remember watching this movie when it came out as a tv movie of the week in the early 70's. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen this movie for over 30 years, I remember how it was scary ... her sister's body in the basement, the storm flapping outside, the scary house without electricity and a killer still in place. <br /> <br /> They just do not do tv movies like this anymore. Elizabeth Montgomery was a very underrated actress and I liked her not only in "Betwitched" but in several of her post-Bewitched roles such as this and "The Legend of Lizzie Borden" of 1975. <br /> <br /> I would like someone to come out with a DVD that has several 1970s tv movie of the week on a DVD. Would not it be amazing to watch "When Michael Calls", "Bad Ronald", "Do not be afraid of the dark", "Crowhaven Farm", etc., all on a DVD? I know there's a market for a DVD like that for all of us baby boomers who grew up in the '60s and' 70s. Maybe if we're lucky, someday someone will offer us a DVD with a great selection of t.v. movies like this.
