This movie was suspenseful and fun to watch. Since I'm a fan of this kind of movie, I liked that. The premise is kind of scary, but the fact that I did not rate it as 10 was because the movie was a little overdone in some areas. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Cmon: Could NO ONE identify this girl? I understand the concept of isolating myself, but I find it hard to believe that ANYONE-NOBODY would be able to identify this girl as Angela Bennet. That was over and so was the scene where she walked over to someone's desk and started typing. This was a really good, suspenseful movie and holds your interest. Dennis Miller was great as Allen, REALLY believable, Bullock was good as the reserved and solitary computer worker that all bad guys underestimated. <br /> <br /> I think the PREMISE of the movie was really different - and scary. In these days, who knows what might happen? But some of the top scenes prevented this movie from being a 10.8 out of 10.
