The quintessence "let's get ready for the summer movie". It's dumb, goofy and maybe a dated touch, but my kids just saw it and they laughed as much as I did when I first saw it. In the style of all the "small guys versus the establishment" movies, so yes, the plot is very predictable, but it's hot and funny. And no, it's not Bill Murray in his Bill Murrayest, but he's starting to stretch in what was his first leading role. Strange, however, to see how few of the "young faces" of this film have come to do much more.
