The original The Man Who Knew Too Much brought acclaim from Alfred Hitchcock for the first time outside the UK. Of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that people were amazed that Hitchcock, with such a small budget, compared to Hollywood's lavish products, could deliver so much on screen. The original film was filmed inside a studio. <br /> <br /> For some reason he chose this from all his films to remake, Hitchcock now with an international reputation and a large Hollywood studio behind him (Paramount) decided to see what The man who knew too much would be like with a lavish budget. This is filmed in Marrakesh and London and has two major international box office names. This was the third of four Hitchcock films by James Stewart and his only partnership with Doris Day and his only Hitchcock movie. <br /> <br /> I wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. At first glance she would fit into the profile of the blond ladies Hitchcock preferred. Possibly because his healthy screen image was at odds with the sophistication that Hitchcock also wanted in his blondes. <br /> <br /> Doris does some of her best performances in The Man Who Knew Too Much. Her best scene is when her medical husband, James Stewart, gives her a sedative before telling her that her son was abducted by an English couple who made friends with them in Morocco. Stewart and Day play each other beautifully in this scene. But Doris, especially when he registers four different emotions at the same time. <br /> <br /> Day and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and meet the Frenchman Daniel Gelin and the English couple Bernardas and Brenda DaBanzie. Gelin is stabbed in the back at a market in Marrakesh and whispers a few words to Stewart about a murder at Albert Hall in London. Their son is taken to ensure their silence. <br /> <br /> For once, I can think of a hit song that came out of a Hitchcock movie. Doris actually plays a notable singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother. The song was Que Sera Sera and I remember well at age 9. You could not go anywhere without hearing it in 1956, and even competed with Elvis Presley's rapid growth that year. That Sera Sera won the Academy Award for Best Song by beating titles like True Love of the High Society and the title song of Around the World in 80 Days. It has become the theme song for Doris Day for the rest of her life and still must come back. <br /> <br /> In fact, the music is worked very well in the plot, while Doris sings it at a party at the embassy. in the climax. Instead of doing it with mirrors, Hitchcock filmed the murder scene at the real Albert Hall and as another reviewer said it is not directed, it is choreographed. You will be hanging in your seats during this time. <br /> <br /> This was a remake worth doing.
