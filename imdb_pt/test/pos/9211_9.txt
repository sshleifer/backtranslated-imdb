I just got into show for the first time recently - the 2 hour "kidnapping" program. Do not know why I have not done it before? James Caan is extraordinary and totally believable in the role of chief chief of the 5 * Vegas complex. Frequently, programs like this have one or more members of the group who are completely annoying, or seem to have been chosen because they must be related to the producer or director. <br /> <br /> Certainly not the case with this program. Together with Caan, all the primary and supporting castings are engaging attractive and believable. The guest actors are well chosen. <br /> <br /> The stories I've seen are interesting, and the show also presents a good view of the city. <br /> <br /> This is an entertainment program, and I hope it stays. I do not know how I managed to lose for so long, but I plan TIVO from now on.
