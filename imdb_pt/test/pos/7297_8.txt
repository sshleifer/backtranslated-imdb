I watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week. What is the problem here? People admit that the performances are great - I mean, Lange is stellar! - and that the movie is beautiful but has less than a '6'! I dont understand. Let's go! The writing is not so bad! Having read many Pulitzer-winning novels, and having seen many of the films based on them, I think a better than decent work was done together. I found that reducing all the dialogues in the novel was performed almost perfectly. This story had a considerable amount of dialogue, and the story actually appeared on screen, despite the fact that only a part of it was used. <br /> <br /> ** PART OF THE BOOK SPOILER ** I was, however, somewhat disappointed with Ginny's subplot, which attempts to kill Rose, was omitted. I thought it was one of the most emotionally shocking parts of the book, but it was probably a good bet to leave it out. Greedy film goers rather than avid readers, I think they tend to be less tolerant of the protagonists who do antagonistic things. It can confuse Johnny Lunchpail and Joe Sixpack. <br /> <br /> If you liked the book, you will like the movie. If you hated the book, you probably hate the movie. Rog
