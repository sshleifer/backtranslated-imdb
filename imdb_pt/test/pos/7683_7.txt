I've been waiting 30 years to see this movie. I played the soundtrack album as a teenager and in my 20s. Recently, I located a reasonably priced DVD and watched it this morning. It was in widescreen, probably even in 70mm stereo, the colors were very good, very little faded, certainly not remastered, but I'm very happy with this clean copy. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie. It's very good. I would not say it's great, but there are great scenes in it. Maybe Premminger might not have been the right director for that, but I'll say that. For me, the centerpiece of the movie was the scene of the hurricane. Beautifully staged by the Premminger. <br /> <br /> Actually, I would say that acting scenes are better than the music scenes, not that the musical sequences are bad. Not at all. They did not have ... anything though. Maybe it was the fact that there were no closes and few average shots. It was almost like watching a filming of a stage production. Maybe that was the feeling Premminger was looking for. In the end, it may not have been the right choice, but it will. It's far from a ruined movie. <br /> <br /> That said, not everyone loves the singers on the soundtrack as well. I always had. They are perfect for this movie. I love the singing voices. The actors who sink in the lip are excellent for the most part. I just wanted the songs to be staged with more imagination. The two numbers of Sportin 'Life are good, but the numbers are not even intimate. They just feel ... far away. Despite this, you can not deny the power of music. And in the end, that's what comes loud and clear. Again, maybe what the Premminger was trying to do was stay out of the way of the amazing music he was working on. I believe he got the right idea, but maybe he's gone too far in that direction. <br /> <br /> The acting is great. Top kudos goes to the great Brock Peters, who acts and sings the part of the Crown. He is the evil end. We just want him to leave poor Bess alone, and he does not. Proud, arrogant and nasty as he is, the classic interpretation of Sportin 'Life by Sammy Davis Jr is the devil himself and a charismatic. Arguably the best Davis film. Poor Bess can not deal with two bad men. I'm glad the Hermes Pan gave Davis a number of tap feet to do. <br /> <br /> Dandridge and Poitier, supposedly unimpressed for being in the movie, really are very sweet together. I do not know about chemistry ... there was more chemistry between Dandridge and Peters than between Dandridge and Poitier. Still, it worked well for Dorothy and Sidney. <br /> <br /> Even so, I think both should be proud of the work they did in that movie. They both managed to bring more than a tear to my eyes. His characterizations where very 3D and believable. Sidney Poitier's Porgy, however, seems almost out of place in the line of catfish. I could not help but think that he was Mr. Braithwaite in "To Sir with Love," very polite and well behaved and spoken, fallen on hard times. He probably would not have been my first choice for the role of Porgy, but hey, he was a big star at the time, so why not? Dorothy Bess was as perfect as her Carmen Jones, actually even more vulnerable this time around. Carmen was probably the most flashy part for her to do. <br /> <br /> A very good movie, in fact, are two less sticks than I would call classic. It just does not do the final classic degree. Still, there is no reason on earth why the Gershwin estate decided to keep this beautiful film, even with all its flaws, hidden from the public as they have. Premminger may have made some strange choices as a director, but the film is nothing to be ashamed of and embarrassed by anyone involved with it. It is what it is and there are movies far worse than that, which are embarrassing on DVD and in theaters today. Porgy and Bess are not one of them.
