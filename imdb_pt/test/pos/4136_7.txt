It would be foolish to think that either narrative or documentary is more authentic than the other. Both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality, as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives. As both formats generally leave some issues uncontrollable due to 'subplot complexities' and screen time, this denies viewers the opportunity to open debates and investigate and build the real truth. In addition to the inability of the viewer to evaluate sources (for example, comparisons with written history) and the logic behind the arguments, history can be open to distortion through narratives and documentaries. <br /> <br /> For most people, the documentary can be seen more true as it usually involves the actual testimonies of participants and real life. However, these visual aids are selected and edited to be organized in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to viewers. In The Real Buddy Holly Story, Paul McCartney seeks to establish Buddy Holly as remembered by family and friends and how Buddy influenced the rest of the music world. The testimonies may have been distorted, as the memories may not be accurate and the emotions have evolved to make a Buddy legend. The documentary made corrections to the film version and covered other events such as three members of Crickets and that Buddy's music was heard outside the US at the time (he had to embark on a world tour!). However, it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to Buddy's wife after her death. Criticism and / or negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as producers seek to present a friend the world should have remembered. Eventually, we can not construct the whole truth because we are only restricted to the past 'realities' that the documentary tells us. <br /> <br /> Personally, I prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual images. , which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that time. This gives the audience a more constructive structure in the story, and this leads to a better retention of memory for the audience when it recounts the story. There is also an element of flexibility that allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and opinions on certain subjects. In The Buddy Holly Story, racial issues have been highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these issues in relation to current situations. <br /> <br /> Moviegoers constantly seek to revisit certain emotions by watching a movie and using those emotions. the public may choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wishes to convey. In most stories, people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles, the inspirations, and the way the story ends. Through The Buddy Holly Story, we remember the difficulties Buddy and the Crickets had, as Mary was a source of encouragement, and that Buddy Holly had a great performance until the day he died.
