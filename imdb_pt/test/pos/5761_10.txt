This movie had some really funny moments. The above mentioned feeb sketch for beginners. <br /> <br /> The parties where Rik tries to act with dignity in front of his guests, looking at them through the nose. Very subtly done, especially since the guest was an adulterer with a snail himself. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Rik learns that Ginny has a fiance, "Ahhh. She was tying me all the time, the shameless mutt" with her two eyes of candle. Like she really did like him. But he believed it. That's why it was so funny. Big moment. <br /> <br /> Gino was also excellent. He should have been used more like the bad man. "Where are the whores I asked for!" he bellows. Bright things.
