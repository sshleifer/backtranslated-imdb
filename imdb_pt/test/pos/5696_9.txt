While many people found this movie simply too slow and simplistic, I actually connected with it. There is no plot as such, instead the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people trapped in a tree with a meat eater crocodile lurking somewhere in the water below them. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought the acting was very good, although the roles were demanding at times, and I felt a sense of warmth for the characters. The situation they were in was terrifying and I really felt nervous for them. I found the entire film very stressful because of the sheer helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival. <br /> <br /> The effects of the crocodile were surprisingly well handled by such a low budget film, and believe me, I've seen my fair share of croc crooked movies. The creature moved well and had a real threat and although the audience I was with did not seem very interested in the film as a whole, they still jumped and gasped whenever the crocodile appeared. <br /> <br /> Script-wise, I would have made some changes, particularly in the end, but this was not a big problem. For survival horror fans who slowly burn within the realms of reality, this will be an engaging film, but unfortunately I think for many viewers who are looking for an exciting ride and higher production figures from their cinematic experience, the point will simply be lost.
