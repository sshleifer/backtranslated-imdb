"It all depends on how you look at it? We're halfway to heaven or halfway to hell," says Rev. Harlan in "Northfork." The film of the Polish brothers is ambitious and will make any intelligent spectator sit, as long as they have patience and basic knowledge of Christianity. The layers of entertainment that the film provides take the viewer beyond the surreal and absurd imagery that is obvious to a less obvious socio-political and theological comment that should prompt a relaxed American to reflect on current social values. The film adopts the surreal (coffins that emerge from the depths of artificial lakes to float and disturb living settlers, who almost "crucify" their feet on the wooden floors of their homes, angels who need several glasses to read, etc.) and absurd images (of half animals, half toys that are alive, of bells that make the most delicate of the musical outputs of a harp, a blind angel who continues to write illegible passages, etc.) could make a spectator unfamiliar with the surreal and traditions absurd in literature and in the arts to imagine what the film is unfolding as entertainment. Although European cinema has better credentials in this field, Hollywood actually made such films in the past in "Cat Ballou," Lee Marvin and his horse leaned against the wall for a nap several decades ago. "Northfork," in a scene where citizens left the city in cars, seemed to pay homage to the row of cars in "Citizen Kane" taking Kane and his wife out of Xanadu for a picnic. <br /> <br /> The film is difficult for the uninitiated or the impatient film buffs - the most interesting epilogue (one of the best I can remember) can be heard as a voice at the end of the credits. The directors seem to leave the best moments for those who can keep the film to the end. If you have patience, you will savor the layers of the film - if you swallow or swallow what the polish bothers you, you will lose its many flavors. <br /> <br /> What is the movie about? ? In the most obvious layer, a city is being vacated to make way for a dam and a hydroelectric project. Even cemeteries are being unearthed so that the remains of the dead can be transferred to higher cemeteries. Real estate developers are selling the lakeside properties for 6 people who can dump the residents of the city. Of the 6, only one seems to have a conscience and therefore is able to order chicken broth soup while others may not receive anything served to them. <br /> <br /> In the next layer, you have Christianity and your interaction about the inhabitants of the city. Most are devout Christians, but in many they lurk the instinct to survive at the expense of true Christian principles exemplified in the priest. Many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions. <br /> <br /> In the next layer, you have the world of angels interacting with almost angelic humans and with each other. You realize that the world of the unknown angel who keeps a comic book about Hercules and dreams of a mother, finds one in an androgynous angel called "Flower Hercules". While the filmmaker hints that the flower is an extension of the young angel's delirious imagination, subsequent actions by Flor deny this option. You are indeed in the world of angels - not gods, but the pure in spirit - and therefore not in the world of the living. The camera's softer focus is evident in these photos. <br /> <br /> In another layer, Irwin's toy plane becomes a royal plane taking him and his angels to paradise 1000 miles away from Norfolk. <br /> <br /> Is the final layer social comment? "The country is divided into two types of people: Fords and Chevy type people." Is there a difference? They think they are different, but both are consumerists. <br /> <br /> For religious, the film says, "Pray and you will receive" (words of Father Harlan, quoted by Angel Flower Hercules). For the consumer, the movie says "it's what we do with our wings that separate us" (each of the 6 evictors also has wings - a duck / goose feather tucked into their hat bands, but their actions are different, often far from being angelic) by the different reactions to a scratch in a car). <br /> <br /> The film certainly is not the best American film, but it is definitely a remarkable groundbreaking work - superb visuals, stunning performances (especially Nick Nolte). ), and a loaded script that offers various levels of entertainment to the adult audience.
