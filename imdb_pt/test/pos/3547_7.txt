Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg and John-Luc Goddard - were you expecting a fun movie for the whole family? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they did not follow the mainstream, but created it. For those who complain that they have not adhered to the original opera story - How often does the song in a movie relate directly to what is happening in the movie? It's humor that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these films were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part, they succeed wonderfully. With all these operas, who will like all of them. We could have used more Beverly Sills. <br /> <br /> Finally, what is art (even opera) without some naked women?
