I am a big fan of legendary director Elia Kazan. His films usually deal with people trying to overcome their weaknesses. Be obsessive love in 'Splendor In the Grass, Poverty in' A Tree Grows in Brooklyn 'or Racism in' Gentlemen's Agreement '. While looking for other films made by Kazan, I came across a movie based on an Arthur Miller novel. The film called "Focus" stars William H. Macy (who is one of my favorite actors) and Laura Dern. It deals with anti-Semitism in a very realistic way. <br /> <br /> Macy's character seems to go along with the fanatics in his neighborhood and his work, even affecting him personally. That's the key here ... the reason he acted was not because he knew he was wrong and he wanted to take a stand, he acted because now he was considered a stranger, and he began to experience the same look, the same comments. and the same brutally that Mr. Finklestein (David Pamyers) tried. <br /> <br /> The film is very well written and well represented. Meat Loaf does an incredible job of throwing a bag of dirt! The performances of Macy and Dern are excellent! It is easier in life to move on rather than go against it. Sometimes, for people to take action, things have to impact their lives, or the lives of their loved ones ... Only then will some find their moral compass.
