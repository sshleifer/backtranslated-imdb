I'm not going to lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying that the sun is hot, but it is not true. And if you've seen the previous films by cult director Richard Kelly, "Donnie Darko" and "Southland Tales," you know it means something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour in the movie, about half of the audience had left. In the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what the heck they had just seen. I, at least, could understand only about 40% of what I saw on the screen, and even then it can only be called interpretation. So why did I give this movie seven generous stars? Because, for example, we have some spectacular performances (Marsden is great and Langella returns as a frightening family character), and more importantly two, because it is totally original and Richard Kelly, undoubtedly one of the bravest living directors, uses his creative vision to tell a story that dares to be different. Frankly, it's the ONLY way - only through Kelly's unique style, that story can be told the way it's intended. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you are not willing to seriously think of a smart movie (and even then everything can be nothing), stay away from this. But if you want to see a deep, rich, complex, and thought-provoking piece about spirituality, existentialism, and predictability of human nature, see that. Be prepared for long discussions with your partner however. <br /> <br /> * Note: If by chance you read this review, took my recommendation, actually saw the movie and still believe that you lost 2 hours of your life, I would be happy to share my views on all the meaning and plot of the film. See, that's why I enjoyed it so much - it promotes discussion! As difficult as it may be, I will try to summarize, paraphrasing a rather depressing quotation from Langella's character, who explains the meaning of the simple box to an employee: "Your house is a box you live in. The car you drove to work is a box, on wheels When you come home from work you sit in front of a box with moving images You watch until the mind and the soul rot and the box that is your body deteriorates, when finally you are placed in the last box ... to rest under the soil and the earth.
