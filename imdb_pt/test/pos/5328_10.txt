I was looking at the external comments (Ebert, etc) for this movie and they were all pretty negative. However, after reading many of them, I noticed that they all made the same point. Critics were upset because the film revolves around what appears to be a senseless murder of an autistic child. Of course, this is a disturbing image. Critics like Ebert want a traditional detective story that uncovers why the murder happened and blamed the guilty. They want the guilt to be thrown and settled. Well, this status quo theme is like what the movie is parodying. Like society, critics wanted a very quick resolution so they could move on to the next tragic opera. Maybe there is not a simple question to be answered here? There is much more to what has happened then what is on the surface. The film does not seek to rationalize what happens, but to understand why. What bothers me so much about these empty ratings is that all they observe in performance is Spacey and Cheadle, which were great (and usually are). But there are other great performances at work here, plus the two current Hollywood icons. Gosling gives an incredible performance that really only someone of his extreme talent could offer. Somehow, Gosling is able to make the killer of an autistic child sympathetic. That annoys many, I'm sure. However, if someone watches the movie, they see what motivates Leeland, it's wrong, but it's not bad. Malone is also at the top of his game as another young and confused character. Basically, the death of the child in this film is not the main theme of the film. The main theme is life itself and how people deal with it, the ups and downs, and how they sometimes try to help others cope with their lives (which does not seem to work very well). There is much good and evil in this world and how we deal with each of them has a direct impact on how much better and worse it will happen and sometimes a confused attempt to do good can lead to more bad things. I think this is one of the most memorable movies at some point and it has an ending that is as touching as anything in recent movie history. I strongly believe that people should see this movie with an open mind.
