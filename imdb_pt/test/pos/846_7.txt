Believe me, I wanted this series to work, but Kevin Kilner's early departure caused a major blow to death after the first season. Robert Leeshock was simply not right for the role and Jane Heitmeyer did an admirable job as a leader, but the series was very confusing and confusing at the time. I do not know what happened in the fifth season, what a mess. Sometimes it's time to drop the red cloak and stick the sword in the bull, if you know what I mean. The only consistent line that joined the series were the incredible performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in a peaceful, ideal conflict. If it were not for their well-written talents and dialogues, they would have been two weird bald boys in a B-movie series. If only this series could have ended in Season 4 and be picked out later, SyFy ...
