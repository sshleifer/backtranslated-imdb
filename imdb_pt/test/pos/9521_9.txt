Beginning with a "My Name is Joe" as a scene in Alcoholics Anonymous, from a spiral of infidelity, double standards and clandestine affairs. but what do you expect from a family of lawyers? A genuinely funny movie, with some of the most outrageous characters since The Birdcage, plot and subframe are intertwined with surreal scenes of decadent Parisian life (always at a wedding reception in the bathroom where the brides grandmother and his crazed girlfriend are smoking drugs and counting blue jokes? No, me too!) leading to a final scene of almost arcadic symbolism. <br /> <br /> Excellent.
