Five young men ignore ranger George Kennedy's warnings and walk into Oregon's misty mountains, where they are hunted down and massacred by a pair of huge, deformed, bred twins . With only two remaining, Warren and his girl Connie, they resort to their animal instincts to stay alive. The film ends with Connie pushing half of her arm down one of the killers' throats, choking him to death. A very powerful, yet overrated, horror film that makes effective use of lighting, sound, and photography, makes it stand a little above the usual Friday cash-in. Gregg Henry, this beautiful companion to director SQUIRM (1976) by director Jeff Lieberman and BLUE SUNSHINE (1977) is not to be missed.
