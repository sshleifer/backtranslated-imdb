I read a lot of comments on Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of critics calling this the typical "friend" movie. De Niro is not friends with Murphy during most of the film. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with someone. <br /> <br /> Murphy really shines in this. He is back doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants to be an actor and enjoys being on the reality show. De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the whole thing is stupid. I thought they both had great chemistry and they were a perfect choice for the cast. Rene Russo is also great as a TV producer. Of course, she loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard (along with Murhpy) to make DeNiro go too. <br /> <br /> Many critics commented on the hilarious scene with William Shatner, reprizing his role as TJ. Hooker to train Murhpy and De Niro as "acting" as cops. But, my favorite scene involves Murphy in the "confessional" hoping to get a Wesly Snipes-Like cop instead of De Niro. Dude, this was hilarious! Comedies usually depend on your personal tastes. Of course you could make holes in the plot, most of the time you can with a comedy. I was excited to see the pair of Murphy and De Niro ... I think I brought the best in Murphy, which was cool to see him at the top of his game again. I can only imagine that it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro. Rating 8 out of 10 Stars.
