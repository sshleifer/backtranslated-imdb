Epic early film, directed by D.W. Griffith Mae Marsh, his little sister and their dogs are orphans - they must go live with an uncle. On board his coach are the young couple Lillian Gish and Robert Harron, celebrating the birth of their first child. The coach arrives at Elderbush Gluch. Marsh's uncle tells her that she can not keep the dogs and they are expelled. There are Indians (Native Americans) nearby; and, the Indians like to eat dog meat (no kidding?). These Indians are hungry! Lionel Barrymore is in solidarity with Mrs. Marsh, wishing to help her recover the runaway dogs. In rescuing the offspring, an Indian is shot - resulting in a confrontation "Cowboys vs. Indians." <br /> <br /> This "saga of the American West" is certainly an important film; however, Griffith's trusted artists begin to exaggerate their hands, and the story is very artificial. Many of the Griffith elements are in place - some good and some bad. "The Battle of Elderbush Gluch" predicts the epic "Birth of a Nation". The Battle of Elderbush Gulch (3/28/14) D.W. Griffith ~ Mae Marsh, Robert Harron, Lillian Gish
