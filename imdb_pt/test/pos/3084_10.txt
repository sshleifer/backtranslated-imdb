Cary Elwes has to say that it puts a better performance than Costner did on RHPOT, but anyway. <br /> <br /> I have to say this movie, it just makes me laugh a lot, especially because the actors really seem to be doing it and you sit there and think 'what the hell they are', but one Way very, very, very good. The random bursts of music were brilliant and good, and the musical score I really enjoyed. so in your roles <br /> <br /> 10/10 of me defiantly <br /> <br /> 'Because unlike some other Robin Hoods. I can speak with an English accent'
