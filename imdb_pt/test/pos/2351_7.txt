"Hollywood Cavalcade" is a slightly entertaining 1939 film starring two characters from 20th Century Fox's list, Don Ameche and Alice Faye, and containing a few jokes. The film concerns a kind of Max Sennett, Michael Connors (Ameche), who brings an actress to Hollywood, Molly Adair (Faye) and makes her a great silent comedian, eventually leading her to more dramatic roles. He becomes extremely successful with her as his star. Obsessed with his work, he is absolutely shocked when she and her leader (Alan Curtis) have fled and are married. He is so shocked, he leaves her. She and her husband leave and continue to be more and more popular, while the Connors studio starts to lose money at an alarming rate. Before you know it, it's over. Molly wants to help and asks Connors to direct her next movie. <br /> <br /> There are many Keystone Kop scenes, which is quite funny, and some fantastic antics from Buster Keaton, which is wonderful. The film also features a scene from "The Jazz Singer," when talkies take over. The joke, of course, has to do with Rin Tin-Tin, whom Zanuck used to write. In one scene, Rinny's coach puts him as a potential contractor for the Connors studio. Connors throws the two out of his office. A few scenes later, Rin-Tin-Tin is shown as box office number 1. The role of the famous German shepherd in this film is played by Rin Tin-Tin Jr., having his father died in the arms of Jean Harlow in 1932, a month before his 14th birthday. Luck smiled at him even in the end. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye is very pretty and does a good job, just like Ameche, which turns into an energetic performance. J. Edward Bromberg and Stuart Erwin provide very good support. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not quite sure what it is - history, comedy, romance or drama. However, "Hollywood Cavalcade" is still quite watchable.
