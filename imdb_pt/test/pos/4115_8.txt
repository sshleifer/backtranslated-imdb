I really liked this movie, it definitely keeps you at the tip of your seat. It was very well run. I think it was important that they show the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. How this movie needed to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person. <br /> <br /> I agree with another critic who was sickly love, not true love. He did not have to go very far as a murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was barren and decided to adopt a baby together. Some comments say she was naive, I think she was when it came to adoption, however the best actors on all sides. Great movie to watch !!
