The masterpiece of the silent film Battleship Potemkin (1925) was commissioned by the Soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 1905 revolt and to establish the event as a heroic harbinger of the October Revolution of 1917. Ironically, film director Sergei Eisenstein , was one of the first and most influential advocates of a formalist approach to film art. Subsequently, Eisenstein's formalism and suspicious policies would cause numerous conflicts with government agencies that insist on "socialist realism." Influenced by Russian film theorist Lev Kuleshov, and by him for the Intolerance of DW Griffith (smuggled to Russia in 1919), Eisenstein constructed his films from a "collision" of rapidly edited images, a montage of shots varied in length , movement and content. , lighting and camera angle. Undoubtedly the most memorable illustration of Eisenstein's stylistic approach - and probably the most quoted and studied sequence in the history of world cinema - is the sequence of "Odessa Steps" in Potemkin. In Structure Potemkin is a "five reeler" divided into five narrative parts, an organization clearly derived from the five-act arrangement of Western drama. In "Men and Maggots," Eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and discontent of the sailors of the battleship working class as the situation inevitably turns into riot. Even before the sailors and their upper-class officers / masters are presented visually, Eisenstein establishes revolutionary conditions symbolically by the collision-editing of waves that break violently and menacingly at sea. Ship on board we witness unsanitary conditions and stocking. Eisenstein emphasizes the dehumanization of the sailors with shots of arbitrary moorings, hard work, and - most memorably - the meat infested with larvae intended for the evening meal. The ship's myopic doctor is carried forward by the other officers to declare the flesh perfectly fit to be served with the dark soup, boiling like the rage of the sailors. According to Marxist maxims, the church also fails with men, and we see one of them breaking a plaque with the words of the Lord's Prayer from two different camera angles (perhaps the first deliberate "leap" in movie history ). Identified by inter-titles as "Drama in the Quarterdeck" and "An Appeal of the Dead," Potemkin's second and third parts portray the royal riot and funeral on the land of its leader and first hero of the revolution. Vakulinchuk. United by Vakulinchuk's appeal to the fraternity, the initial mutineers are accompanied by the whole crew in an attack on the officers. A chaotic scene arises whose violent passion is well served by Eisenstein's editing techniques. The officers' quarters are trampled underfoot, and the symbols of their privileges are destroyed. The ship's doctor is thrown into the sea, accompanied by dramatic cross-passages to the flesh full of larvae and their metonymic glasses hanging from the rigging. Tragically, Vakolinchuk's death is the price paid for the revolt (no omelette without breaking eggs) and he is placed with dignity on an Odessa pier. Hundreds of ordinary citizens of Odessa meet with the sailors to honor him and promise "Death to the oppressors." Shots of clenching and closing fists signal the birth of revolutionary consciousness. <br /> <br /> The complex and unforgettable sequence of Odessa Steps is the fourth act of the film. It starts with uplifting music and a series of close-ups and medium plans on the exultant faces of various people on the beach and selected objects (umbrella, sunglasses, baby stroller). Suddenly (as a title card exclaims in huge letters) the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps. Here Eisenstein releases the full force of the collision edition as nearly a hundred shots are pooled to counter the chaos in panic and the victimization of the citizens with the relentless attack of the soldiers leading the citizens to the flying horses and flying sabers of the Cossacks waiting below . The mise-en-scene is framed by a statue of Caesar at the top of the stairs and a church in the background, symbolic metonymies for the oppressive institutions of Russia: the Czarist monarchy and the Orthodox Christian Church. <br /> <br /> Scores the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children. In the first, a mother and a boy who were presented among the cheerful faces of the crowd are among the first victims of the massacre. The boy is shot, but the mother continues to run until the close-ups of his face convey his horrified gaze to the son's fallen body being trampled by the crowd. With a very slow pace of editing, the camera follows the mother while carrying the lifeless body of her son up the stairs to confront the soldiers (shown only in a diagonal shadow line). They summarily kill her. After this lull, the carnage continues for a further dozen cuts until a second mother is hit in the stomach (Mother Russia's uterus?) As she tries to protect her baby in her carriage. In a famous scene imitated in The Untouchables, the carriage slips incongruously down the stairs. Horrified faces of heaped citizens observe slow progress until their destruction. When the carriage reaches the bottom, there is a cut in a Cossack wielding a sword and a classic effect of Kuleshov suggests what we do not really see: the massacre of that innocent pure and symbolic. The final series of shots in the Odessa sequence is three stone lions, one at rest, one sitting and one roaring. The issue animates them in a visual metaphor of the people's angry anger. <br /> <br /> In some anticlimax, the fifth act takes us back to the warship as the mutinous sailors flee on the high seas and await a meeting with other ships of the fleet. They and the spectator expect a retribution, but when the meeting takes place, no shot is fired, and instead all the sailors wave and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of camaraderie. Eisenstein was rewriting the story at this time since the revolution was not successfully launched for another twelve years. But despite this, the battleship Potemkin is one of the seminal works of the silent-film era, and retains extraordinary cinematic power.
