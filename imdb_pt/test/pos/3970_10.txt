Accepted is one of the best teen comedies I have seen in a long time. He has an original screenplay, talented cast and offers an hour and a half of sheer pure fun. <br /> <br /> Tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby "B" Gains (Justin Long), who is not accepted in any of the collages in which he applied, so as to avoid the disappointment of his parents , it creates a fictitious collage. In an attempt to completely fool his parents, he creates a fake website and turns a former psychiatric hospital into a school. All goes well until many other "accepted" students appear at your doorstep. Now he and his friend have to discover this collage thing not only for themselves, but for others as well. <br /> <br /> Justin Long as a leading man is absolutely brilliant, his character is as natural as he can be and the supporting acts are remarkable - Jonah Hill as Sherman Schrader, Columbus Short as Hands, Mary Thayer as Rory, Adam Herschman as Glen and Lewis Black as Uncle Ben. <br /> <br /> Humor is fresh and simple and, most importantly funny, from the beginning until after the credits. The plot unfolds so easy that by the time you stop laughing at the last joke you start laughing at the next one. Along with all the fun, the film brings a subject very common to our attention, that is, the education of the collage. If usually the students in the film are united against the government of the school, in this case they are united by the mutual desire to go to school and learn. <br /> <br /> However, the movie does not mark all other schools as wrong, it just shows that there is another way. You what they say "If there is a will, there is a way." And sometimes children know better what they need than their parents. This film is a little must-see story about the great opportunities in life wrapped up in the best possible format.
