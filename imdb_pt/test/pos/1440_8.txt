From the crash of the opening theme, "The Man with the Golden Arm" is the classic entertainment of the 1950s. With no subtleties here, Frank arrives from prison with a monkey on his back and heads straight to the old neighborhood where the old bastards still lurk. This is a tale of your dark ride with all your emotional baggage intact. The performances are a bit ripe, but that's part of the fun of watching. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are unforgettable and almost steal the show. This and "The Manchurian candidate" are the two greatest films of the Council President, in my humble opinion. Do not miss any of them.
