I saw the short titled "The Reader" recently and discovered that the film was well planned and executed. I really felt for both the characters that Morgan Hallett and Elizabeth Franz portrayed in this movie. Elizabeth was able to show great reach with her blind character and left me feeling emotionally connected. Morgan managed to convince me that she was totally committed to keeping "Sissy" or Franz protected from the pain of losing her sister who lived in Copenhagen. The great thing about the film was in the short term and budget of only ten thousand dollars, Duncan Rodgers was able to make a very well done film that kept the viewer's interest. Rodgers has a great view of the actor's ability and conveys great camera angles to showcase his talent. I always feel that if a director can make a great movie on a small budget then what he can do with a much bigger movie. Great job Duncan !!
