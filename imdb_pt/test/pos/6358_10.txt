I was very impressed with this movie from the newcomer Dir./Ergitor Jos√© Reyes. The cast was excellent. "Jorge Cordoba" performed a powerful and shocking performance as the main character of "Rafa". It's inspiring to watch independent films with that level of talent. <br /> <br /> It takes talent, courage and determination to get out and make a quality movie. <br /> <br /> I admire anyone who can take an idea from concept to conception and go the mile. <br /> <br /> It's easy for people to judge young filmmakers more severely, but I applaud "Jose Reyes" and the talented cast for their successful efforts.
