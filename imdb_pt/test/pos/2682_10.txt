I can not believe how many excellent actors can be at a show. It's the realism and the good acting that makes it look real. This has to be the best comedy ever created until today and I love Seinfeld and Everyone Loves Ramond. It's just fabulous and it looks like everyone in my family agrees. This is not an isolated opinion of mine. The whole world seems to talk about different incidents and they try to reenact them. My hat for the crew. Some shows have an actor who does the whole show. This plot comedy has a killing (8) of them. That's what makes it so incredible. Some people pray for health, wealth, or fame. I pray the show never ends. Sicerely John. LKHUBBLE2@talkamerica.net
