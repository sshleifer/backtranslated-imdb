I watch tons of movies and had no idea it would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (although I think Nirvana is overrated). It seemed like a lot of fun, but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches such as books (Kubrick's book among others), movie posters, etc. I like it when I see a director take his time and put his heart into a movie. And you can really feel it in this. There are tons of scenes and moments that I love, I'm trying to think now of some other movies that are so and I would say the only thing I can think of are Cameron Crowe's movies. It takes little moments and makes them stand out and special. The soundtrack is amazing and every song works perfectly with the scenes and feel of the movie. This film is amazingly filmed and the editing is excellent. I could actually keep talking about the movie. I can not recommend this really enough. If you want a fun story with great melodies from a director who has clearly put your heart into your work, then watch this.
