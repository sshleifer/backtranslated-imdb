Mel Brooks is a great writer, director and actor, but from time to time even he may have a klinker. The beginning of this begins almost basically only by finding one character after another. You have Cary Elwes, who is charming and talented but can not do comedy. His expressions on the camera show that even he does not believe in the inanities of the script. Richard Lewis seems bored and distracted throughout without much to do and Amy Yasbeck is stuck in high school acting mode. Dave Chapelle shows wide range of comedy assaulting and hamming to the camera and Mark Blankfield is mostly smothered in the role of the blind man, but he still manages to show wide range of comedy. Eric Allen Kramer does not have much to do, but the few scenes he has are obligatory. The best roles are those of Roger Rees, Tracy Ullman, Megan Cavanaugh and Brooks when he appears. Don DeLuise has a funny way like Don Mafia employing a Clint Eastwood look-alike, but on the down side, some jokes are not very funny, while some of the funniest ones seem stolen from Mel's other films.
