Motorama viewers should have been interested in other desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (more or less in the desert). He also models a bit of the bizarre humor (and especially the eccentric character trail) from the comedy of the writer Joseph Minion, 'After Hours'. In a sort of desert fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10-year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang and flees from his parents grossly neglecting. It begins as a journey through salvation (which is apparent in the scenes with John Diehl), but once he becomes addicted to a scratch card game called Motorama, he becomes easily tainted by temptation and loses his childish innocence. He travels from a wacky fictional state to another way to get Motorama cards from participating gas stations, just enough so he can spell out the MOTORAMA award word and be eligible for the $ 500 million cash prize. Along the way, he is involved with dozens of strange characters such as Flea, who plays a very muscular waiter, Meatloaf, who plays a crazy motorcyclist, and Mary Woronov and Sandy Baron (a regular of Seinfeld ) as two violent hijackers. <br /> <br /> The relaunch of the DVD can be very misleading, as well as previous attempts to sell this movie to the market without cult first with taglines comparing it to Home Alone and Thelma & Louise. The younger one calling it a love story with the slogan implying that the film is about Jordan Michael Christopher on an adventure to meet the girl of his dreams ... which, despite the size of his photo on the cover of the DVD, is actually just about a 1 second cameo by Drew Barrymore as the fantasy girl that Gus dreams of. Why did not they just market for what it was? I thought it may seem totally bizarre at first glance, in fact it's a well-designed narrative. <br /> <br /> Motorama is great stuff for fans of strange b-grade comedies. This was a rather interesting story, and particularly because of the strength of its leading actor - Jordan Michael Christopher (who unfortunately has some other screen savers credits) - and the clever metaphor inherent in the plot. I hope your re-release on DVD is easier for cult fans.
