Sixth (and last) movie in the boxset. Well, it looks like I saved the best for last. Ghoulies IV. I originally did a review for this in February but decided to make a new one. The Ghoulies series is pretty cool. I know there are some people who do not like them, and that's fine. This is my favorite in the series. Yeah, I know the real Ghoulies do not show up and they're replaced by two costumed guys, one of them being Tony Cox from Bad Santa. Now, in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Jonathan Graves, the main character in the first film, being played once again by Peter Liapis, who is now a police officer in Los Angeles. past of the occultism behind him. During the first part of the film, we find Alexandra (played by the very hot Stacie Randall) communicating with a demon from the beyond called Faust, which is the black side of Jonathan. Faust asks Alexandra for a red jewel and something goes wrong, thus freeing the Ghoulies from beyond. <br /> <br /> I think Jim Wynorski did a good job with the direction. And the music of Chuck Cirino is also funny. (SPOILER AHEAD) At the end of this movie, the Ghoulies say there will be a Ghoulies IV, Part 2, or Ghoulies V. I still hope the sequel will be made and I particularly hope Jim Wynorski re-directs. I agree with GimboTheGhoulies about this.
