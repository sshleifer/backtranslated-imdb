You're right! Bobby was Mike's imaginary friend throughout the movie, even at the beginning, when he was on his way to California. His mother knew Bobby and did not discourage Mike to lean on Bobby, since imaginary friends are common with small children. <br /> <br /> That's why both of you have stomach pains at the same time. That's why the boys were so close. <br /> <br /> In the end, Mike was letting Bobby go. The "king" was arrested. Mike could go on without Bobby. That's also why Mike's mom did not seem upset when Mike got the postcard (Mike had written and mailed) from Bobby's West Texas tourist parade and other postcards from around the world. You noticed that Mike's mother turned the first card and looked at the stamp. What a great mother doing the best she could in the late 60s. <br /> <br /> A 9 out of 10 for me. Brought back memories ...
