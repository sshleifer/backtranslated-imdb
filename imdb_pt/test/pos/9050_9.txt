Although dated, "Inki and the Minah Bird" is, in my opinion, a nice and charming cartoon. The work of art is not extraordinary, but it is good enough. This cartoon has no dialogs, just sounds and music, but this combination works great. The drawing itself is good, funny, old-fashioned, creative, fun and fun. <br /> <br /> This cartoon also makes the difference, because it focuses on only three characters: Inki (the little girl), the Minah Bird. (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion that wants to have both Inki and Minah for breakfast - so he chases them for most of the cartoon. <br /> <br /> In fact I find this lion very handsome, hilarious and cool. I really like this lion. That poor lion is so foolish and forgiven that you have to feel sorry for him. To me, the real enemy is the Minah Bird, not the lion. At one point, the lion almost eats - too bad he can not swallow it because it deserved to be eaten. <br /> <br /> Back to this animated short, there is not a single dull or boring moment. At least for me. The only part that I think is stupid is the end because the bird has a big fight with the lion, steals his teeth and puts them in himself. Also, I have nothing of importance to criticize about this, other than the fact that steak should definitely have gone to the lion and not the bird. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is very overlooked. and understated little gem that definitely should get more credit.
