I noticed that the official criticism of IMDb refers to Leland as a sociopath. I believe that this diagnosis is manifestly and profoundly incorrect. <br /> <br /> This is a film about sadness, and about the ability of a particular teenager to see sadness in everyday life as he waits around every corner. , before the unfolding of the lives it impacts. A sociopath is a person who can not empathize with others and who, although he understands the difference between right and wrong, does not care about this difference. A sociopath is a subject who stands at the center of this subject's universe, with complete disregard for the impact that the subject's actions have on those around him. One defining characteristic of a sociopath is that a true sociopath does not have the ability to feel empathy - lack the ability to feel what others feel, and does not correlate changes in the mood of others as a result of the actions of that sociopath with those actions. A sociopath CAN NOT feel the pain of others, or understand that the pain of others is the result of the sociopath's own actions. A sociopath is a person who is not fully formed. A vital piece is lacking in the psychological and emotional composition of a true sociopath, making the sociopath immune to "speech therapy" and other modes of treatment involving human interaction and the exploration of personal feelings. Sociopathy is devastating even when the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment designed to contain the damage that the sociopath can cause to others. Many sociopaths run more or less normally and never raise a spot on the radar of the criminal justice system, although they tend to leave emotional traces on their trails. <br /> <br /> Leland Fitzgerald is not a sociopath. He is a person who is blessed (or cursed) with the ability to predict what he considers the consequences and inevitable results of human interactions. Leland literally sees the sadness written in the eyes and faces of the people around him as he slowly assimilates and internalizes the philosophy that life is about loss, and that people slowly succumb to the inevitable and inexorable fact that for lack of a metaphor better, fall apart. People who fall in love and who kiss and hug today become "pathetic" old couples. The electricity in the eyes of Leland's "mother" (a wealthy New York socialite who loves Leland and invites him to the house she shares with her family when she arrives in New York, alone and determined to stay in town at 12 she disappears when she explains to him, on the last of her visits to New York, that she learned that her husband was cheating on her all the time, that she divorced, that having a broken heart is over, and that this loss is an inevitable part of growth. His eyes still reflect the light, but the electricity that once illuminated them has disappeared. This scene - this explanation is coming late - is crucial to understanding why Leland commits a seemingly savage and senseless crime (killing the retarded younger brother of his ex-girlfriend). Leland knows what is to come to this little boy - a life of unattainable goals, of being taught only words that signify danger, of never knowing the love of another human being, of never feeling such love and of never connecting with another person. More than any other character in this film, this little boy personifies everything Leland considers inevitable and horrifying about the world. Leland's act - killing this little boy - is, for Leland, an act of mercy, committed because that was the only thing he COULD do in a world where actions can not change results. While a true sociopath knows that actions can change results but do not care about the harm inflicted on others by such actions, Leland cares. What most people see as a barbaric and horrifying act is, in Leland's eyes, the only decent thing he can do to ease the suffering of just one person. <br /> <br /> It would be comforting to be able to present this as an explanation of Leland's actions-comforting but incomplete. For in the end, "blame" for Leland's actions is elsewhere. As is often the case, there are no easy explanations and there is no balm to apply to the indignant soul. Why has Leland not learned something that even the most pessimistic people generally recognize - that sometimes - sometimes - people remain passionate, and that relationships succeed, and that even the saddest lives are transformed? For Leland, there is no middle ground, no inner center to which he can retreat and regroup. There is only pain and sorrow. One is tempted to blame his arrogant and completely unpleasant father - the brilliant writer (played by Kevin Spacey) - for not being present at critical moments during Leland's development, but given the wickedness of man, this may have been a blessing. In the end, this spectator was moved by a tremendous sense of sadness. Why was Leland condemned to see the world through a veil of pessimism and depression? There is a maturity in Leland's character - gift, for example, when he repeatedly insists that no one was to blame for his girlfriend breaking up with him - which is both stoic and moving. Stoic, to the extent that it is absolutely genuine, despite the heated denunciations of Leland's teacher. But desolate, because it is born not so much of understanding as of despair. Leland's indifference to his fate is merely a reflection of the absolute certainty of his belief that nothing really matters. Nothing he does can change his destiny. <br /> <br /> This is not sociopathy on display. That is, if anything, its polar opposite ......
