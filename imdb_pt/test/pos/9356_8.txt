A man by the name of Joseph Samuels is found brutally murdered in his apartment. It seems Samuels was visited by a group of drunken soldiers the night before, and with one of them apparently missing, the evidence surely implicates the missing soldier. But as Detective Finlay deepens the case, he discovers they may be barking at the wrong tree, and that this crime is dealing with something desperately sad and vile, anti-Semitism. Crossfire was born from the novel written by Richard Brooks, adapted by John Paxton and directed by the astutely excellent Edward Dmtryk, Crossfire {originally titled Cradle of Fear} is a tense and exciting portrait that boldly tackles anti-Semitism . Producers were forced to soften the story of the original source, the novel is about homosexual hatred as opposed to anti-Semitism, which remains, largely due to RKO boss Dore Schary and producer Adrian Scott, it's kind of discomfort that drips with the Noirish style. <br /> <br /> The cast has three Bob's, Young, Mitchum and Ryan, with Gloria Grahame, Noir's darling, adding the emotional female heart. Thomas is only third ranked, is the photo of Robert Ryan all the way, his portrait as the conniving Montgomery bullying is from the top draw and shows perfectly the talent he had in abundance. Ryan had good reason to give Montgomery some of his best work, as he had served in the Navy with Richard Brooks himself, both discussing the possibility that if the novel was turned into a movie, Ryan wanted to come in and play. Montgomery, so was born the genesis of Ryan 's career as weasel types!. Gloria Grahame also makes a wonderful and sincere turnaround, which is all the more remarkable since she was being plagued by her abusive husband back then. Stanley Clements was known to be violent towards her and her constant presence around the set bothered the others in the cast, but Grahame, probably channeling the emotion of real life, became the character of Gina and glowed very bright. Both Bob Mitchum and Bob Young come out with flying colors too, to really seal the deal on what a cleverly represented image in Crossfire really is. Tho Crossfire was released before the other 1947 anti-Semitic film, Gentleman Accord, and grossing more than a million and a quarter dollars at the box office, some of its thunder was stolen by the Oscar-winning photo from Fox Studio. Best Supporting Actress {Ryan}, Best Supporting Actress {Grahame}, Best Director and Best Screenplay, did not win anything, but critics at the time hailed it as a brilliant change in American cinema, and today it is high , proud and dark as a daring and excellent job. 8.5 / 10
