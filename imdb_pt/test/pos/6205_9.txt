This is an extremely engaging series that is well framed and portrays a sensitive subject with great splendor. We followed Michael Ealy as FBI undercover agent Darwyn, ready to infiltrate a terrorist cell led by Farik (Oder Fehr). The series is very well written, and has enough twists to keep you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for what to happen next. <br /> <br /> Michael Ealy is, by definition, one of the best actors I've ever seen. seen portraying an undercover agent. Cold icey on the outside but still a good human underneath trying his best to keep his head floating on a highly emotional roller coaster that the FBI did board. Oder Fehr, on the other hand, comes out of a guy who could practically fit into any social scene. Large and strong, but capable of disappearing into the gray mass if necessary. Highly authoritarian and extremely cunning. The way the two communicate on the screen is nothing short of spectacular. <br /> <br /> The way the story unfolds, and the level of detail that the script provides, makes the whole story extremely credible, and also very faithful to life. I guess. It is of such magnitude that you get the feeling of being insecure, not knowing what can happen in real life. We read about terror every day, and here we are given a good bustle in an underworld that most of us know very little about. <br /> <br /> It's a series that you'll definitely come back for more, sitting there on the edge of your seat just waiting for the episode next week. It's a sure winner in my eyes, and I have no problem claiming that this series is on my all-time list.
