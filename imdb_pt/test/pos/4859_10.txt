This movie is a success. There are some from time to time that make me think deeply and bother me a lot. I could see myself in the same situation - passively allowing things to happen around me, not advocating the right and decent thing, just trying to avoid problems. How often do we avoid making waves or stretching our necks? How often does our inaction tolerate the deeds of others? We would never join them, we tell ourselves, we recognize that what they are doing is bad, but do we do anything about it? <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macey) is a discreet and nerdy office worker who paid for his home in Brooklyn, NY in the last days of World War II. He rarely gets involved in what is happening around him, never gets married, rarely socializes, just works and cares for his invalid mother. Then a series of events in his small "white" neighborhood took him from his complacent shell to a whirlwind of events. It begins when he witnesses from the window of his room the rape of a Puerto Rican girl by the son of his neighbor. Soon after he gets glasses because of poor vision. As he is now more able to see, he becomes less able to deal with the circumstances of his life. The only bright spot is a new love in his life, and he marries, hoping to continue in his normalcy. So the virulent anti-Semitism on that street catches him, despite his credentials as a Presbyterian WASP. As things get more uncontrolled, he finds he needs to make an important decision - does he take a stand or just walk away? <br /> <br /> I can not as anyone can see this movie without being affected and have to think a lot about themselves and what they really stand for. Post-war anti-Semitism is the scene here, but there is injustice at all times and in all places. It is for the individual to decide where he is.
