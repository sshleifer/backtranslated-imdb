I at least was very eager to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Although I knew it would be another kind of Nerdy-Revenge-style movie, I was still impressed. There is a lot of truth in the fact of this type of learning and I believe very strongly that it should be allowed in a "new style of schooling". <br /> <br /> Conventional teaching methods do not always teach students. what they need to know or should know or want to know. <br /> <br /> This approach to teaching should be most sought after in real academic courses. <br /> <br /> Although there were still plenty of party scenes, obviously they had to be played there - for Hollywood to do a comedy about college ... even though we all know that life is not really like that. <br /> <br /> An unbelievable touch, still funny and with a killer ending. <br /> <br /> Incredible ending. Crucial to the whole story and very surprising. <br /> <br /> Without the final scene, the movie would have been so good. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie and did not need to have excessive amounts of profanity or nudity or gross jokes for it to be good. <br /> <br /> Great staff and cast, history and even the generic typecasting of the obligatory "members of the Hampton fraternity" was well made. American pie 1, 2 3 and American wedding or whatever clone does fazers do not measure up to this in 1/3. Much better than most comedies about college in the first year without humiliating stupid jokes to make someone vomit. <br /> <br /> I liked it, even if it was simple ... it was interesting and even had heart ... my only regret for watching this movie is that it was not anymore.
