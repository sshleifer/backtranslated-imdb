An extremely gentle re-reading of Shakespeare's play (and much more evident than the Forbidden Planet). Cassavetes is always a joy to watch, and even more so with Gena Rowlands sharing the spotlight. His opinion of Prospero's role is well suited to the kind of omniscient and slippery expression he brings to history. This especially comes to light in a scene in which, when identifying his wife and his lover in a boat, it evokes a storm (accompanied in the soundtrack by an appropriate selection of "Go" of Stomu Yamashta). This is just one of the moments throughout the film, where the line between reality and fantasy becomes very cloudy, and the viewer gets the feeling that magic is more possible than can be believed. Add to that an excellent performance by Raul Julia, plus a good job by Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the film becomes a pleasure to occupy the space behind your eyes.
