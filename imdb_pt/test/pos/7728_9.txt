There are several ways to misinterpret this movie and some of them have been shown in some of the previous comments. This is a film to be analyzed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore should not be compared to Carmen's opera, book or other films seen previously. It just stands and I must say that Carmen does very well. It is a mistake to compare because this is the first step in denying the films the chance to be creative, autonomous works of art. Vicente Aranda is a master of the atmosphere and the direction of art, the costumes and photography are extremely well placed to achieve a pleasant aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is. <br /> <br /> And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish clichés in the film. Well, historically the film is extremely well researched and you can see the results of that work very seriously in every scene. It is not just a precise picture of the "black Spain" of knife and espadrille that Goya portrayed so vividly, but also of that part of the story seen by an alien fascinated with the folkloric side of that society. Honestly, anyone who does not want to see any cliché about Spain should not buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in this case these clichés are presented before they become one and the way to see them is to get rid of our own prejudices. <br /> <br /> Another important requirement to understand this film correctly is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to criticize the performance of any actor for not having understood their lines. If everyone else is in the audience, the problem is probably somewhere else. Paz Vega has an immaculate diction with his Andalusian accent and everything she says is understandable and credible. His Argentine partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, also gives a convincing portrait of the Basque officer who became a "bandolero", and his accent is very well learned. <br /> <br /> No less important is having a minimally open approach to the material. To say that Paz Vega is "horrible" suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. We already had in Spain a critic in one of the most prestigious newspapers that used to recommend us photos that he found homosexualally waking up, without mentioning it explicitly. And this was not entirely fair to the rest of us, especially to those who had not detected that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers did not necessarily need to take care of. I'm not suggesting that the reviewer had the same motivation, but the expectations must have been different, like those between us who went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role, because that's what we have. Paz Vega IS Carmen, and excellent, in the film by Vicente Aranda.
