What a tribute to your father! He set out on a quest to learn more about a man he knew little of, and at the end of the journey, I believe Nathaniel Kahn is pleased with what he has learned and personally felt. The film is 5 years under construction, and a quarter century after his death, Louis I. Kahn's total commitment to his work - a strong consistent desire to build buildings that are meaningful to humanity and timeless to the whole world, with insight his life is proudly portrayed by his son Nathaniel in the documentary "My Architect: The Journey of a Child". <br /> <br /> The film is by no means an anthology of Louis's work. There are plenty of books and archived materials that have records of Louis Kahn's designs and buildings. This documentary works as a mystery, scriptwriter, director and co-producer Nathaniel Kahn was looking for the man he met briefly as his father. <br /> <br /> The film is in chapters. In "Heading West," we are at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. It's a sight that's worth contemplating - Kahn's integral concept of building and environment, optimizing the light for scientists at work is incredible. From a former colleague who worked with Lou for 35 years, we hear about his meticulous attention to detail, and also how he can be undisciplined - he certainly did not measure words in his criticism. One memorable scene is when the camera opens and we see Nathaniel skating in the area of ​​the Salk Institute square - a tiny figure, like a child playing happily in the bowl of his father's hands. <br /> <br /> The "Immigrant" segment got us to meet Anne Tyng, the architect who worked in collaboration with "Lou" and also gave her a daughter, Alex. Now, at age 80, Tyng's return with Nathaniel's film crew to the Bath House project in Trenton, New Jersey, was nostalgic. In "Go to Sea," we see the Barge for American Wind Symphony Orchestra - all made of steel, and meeting Robert Boudreau, who was surprised at Nathaniel when he finally said that he was the son of "Lou". Boudreau was touched, he said he had seen Nathaniel when he was six, with his mother (Harriet Pattison), and he should not tell anyone that Lou had a child. It was an exciting gathering moment. Like his father "The Nomad," Nathaniel traveled to Jerusalem and learned of the synagogue project that his father started, but did not notice. He visited the wailing wall, and as his yarmulke continued to fall, his head gave me the feeling that he did not have to be 'totally' Jewish to be his father's son. We continue to sit down with her two half-sisters in the "Family Matters" segment. We also heard him talking to his mother in Maine and, talking to the people in the previous office in his father's office, we learned how his father worked intensely and practically lived there, sleeping on a rug on the office floor, weekends, and everything . "The end of the journey" took us to Ahmedabad, India, at the Indian Institute of Management. Talk to the architect B.V. Doshe was a revelation. In the end, Nathaniel met a very lively Louis Kahn, his father - his spirits live within him. This documentary is very painful for me. I was teary-eyed most of the time - it was very touching and I admired the man, the architect and his son, and the women in his life, as well as his famous works and buildings. Louis I. Kahn wanted to give his love to the "whole world" by juggling work and three families (you can tell he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration). Like Shamsul Wares, the architect of the Bangladesh Capital complex (which turned 9 years after Lou's death), so poignant: Louis Kahn gave much to the people of Bangladesh, spending time in Bangladesh, understanding the culture of place and people. - in addition to giving them democracy through what he achieved, and for such a dedicated man, usually the people close to him, he often missed seeing. It seems that the price of being great comes with unavoidable personal sacrifices. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of King Vidor's "The Fountainhead" in 1949 (a good dramatic story in B & W with music by Max Steiner) based on the novel by Ayn Rand with Gary Cooper as the architect inflexible woman who stands out for her own ideals, and Patricia Neal as the supportive woman in her life. <br /> <br />
