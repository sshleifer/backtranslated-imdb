With "Batman Returns", Tim Burton succumbed to an important priority in American cinema: follow a blockbuster. Three years after the most successful film of the year, "Batman" (1989), here comes the hero of Gotham City again for the pleasure of many viewers. Like its predecessor, "Batman Returns" had a huge commercial success. Tim Burton made Batman come back again, because it is believe that the latter's victory in his enemy, the Joker did little to improve the image of Gotham City. In fact, violence and corruption still exist and here the second word is synthesized by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and Penguin (Danny De Vito). These two thugs who are eager to take control of Gotham City will make life difficult for Batman. Your task will be more difficult with the appearance of Catwoman ... <br /> <br /> Tim Burton still delivered a lot of work on the set and it seems that he tried to rectify the flaws of the first film. That means the director has given way to sequences that are better mastered than in the first Batman. But he did not neglect the psychology of his main characters for all this. If in the 1989 movie, Burton focused on the psychology of Bruce Wayne / Batman, here is the penguin that obviously interested him. The director tried to make him, very well interpreted by De Vito an ambiguous character. On the one hand, he is full of evil intentions (quoted earlier), but on the other hand, he is looking for his past and would like to be considered as a real man. <br /> <br /> "Batman Returns" also appears as crazier than its predecessor, especially with the cast. I think of Mich√®le Pfeiffer, who offers a bold and powerful performance as Catwoman. Also, as I write this review, I remember that a new version of Catwoman is currently in the movies. But given the negative reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!), It is certain that your interpreter Halle Berry should be insignificant alongside Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this movie is one of the best sequences of 1992. and allows to develop the peculiar style of Tim Burton. We also find his taste for the strange and the gothic. As for the other adaptations of Batman to the screen, you can skip them. "Batman Forever" (1995) and "Batman and Robin" (1997) are not good. I heard that Christopher Nolan was filming the beginning of Batman's story and that it would be released next year. Will it coincide with the works of Tim Burton?
