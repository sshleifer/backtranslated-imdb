This movie was great. He had a "really cool" outbreak. In addition, there have been some very dramatic (dramatic) scenes that may make it inappropriate for younger viewers under the age of 6. <br /> <br /> For a movie under the radar, the acting was quite enjoyable, and landed in our family room for an almost perfect landing. It caught the attention of our entire family and we were kind of sad to see it stop. <br /> <br /> This movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day, but was given a somewhat more believable scenario. The dream scenes were a distraction at first, but they did much to establish the plot. The jokes and hi-jinx were also a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> We hope you like it as much as we do.
