I took this film a week after Ichikawa Kon's death - I suppose if there is a way to mark the death of a great director, is to raise a glass of wine for him while watching one of his greatest films. Ichikawa had one of the best careers of Japanese cinema, but as he never had a different style or theme, he often seems to be ignored compared to his contemporaries like Ozu and Kurosawa (he was a little younger than them, but not much). He is one of those directors who defies the author's theories - it is likely that his wife (who wrote the screenplay for this and many of her films) was as responsible for the quality of the films as he was. But at his best, he was as good as any Japanese filmmaker at the time. In particular, he possessed great technical skills, allowing him to tell complex stories in an accessible manner. But in terms of theme, this film could hardly be simpler - war is hell. No, actually, it's a real hell. <br /> <br /> Fire on the Plain does not follow the normal rules of the war genre. There is no real beginning - we begin with the miserable Tamura, who is a regular private (although it is implied that he is more considerate and polite than most others) at one stage shows that he understands English, but he closes when others ask how he knows it) is sent to the hospital, since his unit is already in a terrible state. The soldiers are defeated and starve. They are no longer an army, just a group of refugees - hunted by locals and practically ignored by Americans, who have bigger fish to fry. Hunger and despair are driving the soldiers to the limit and beyond madness. <br /> <br /> In typical Ichikawa style, not everything is gloomy - it's strangely funny in some places (a very dark mood, of course). /> <br /> The high points of this film for me are the excellent performances of the leads and vivid photography. The characters, in all their humanity, but also their complete loss of humanity, are all too credible. This is a rare movie - it will refuse to fade from your head, even if you want to forget it.
