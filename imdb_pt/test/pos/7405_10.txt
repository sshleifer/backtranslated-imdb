I had never heard of Silverwing before so I saw it on Toon Disney and instantly loved it! I also think it's not just for kids, and that people of all ages will enjoy it. It has a great plot, great effect and cool characters. I will always love the show, and I heard it will soon come on DVD all over the world, and I will succeed! I have not read any of the books, but I intend to. The show deserves 10 out of 10, and I hope the books are as good as it gets. Well, that's all I have to say. But I still have 2 lines that I have to fill, so ... who do you think is the coolest character? Mine is Shade, and my second favorite is Marina.
