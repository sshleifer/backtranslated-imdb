There is no denying it. Sci-fi on TV is difficult. There are so many problems that gender brings with it. Such as the need for a good budget, solid writing, decent acting. Maybe the budget and script writing are the departments where I feel most of the attempts have failed. So, "Surface" is successful? Not completely, but more than most. <br /> <br /> As I see it, a good science fiction show does not need a lot of CGI to work, nor does it need a lot of money. What it needs is the ability to create a feeling greater than life. The feeling that there is more than it seems, something that makes me curious and willing to try to find out how it will end. Adding the pieces of the puzzle and sometimes saying "Aha!" is what makes or breaks a show like this. <br /> <br /> "Surface" had some flaws. First, the basic premise is not as exciting as it might have been, nor is the revealed story as exciting (or daring) as I had hoped at the beginning. Also, the TV feel is very present most of the time. All the way from the crap CGI (which ranges from decent to awful) to fairly variable quality in the acting department. It also seems, at times, a bit family-oriented as it sometimes takes the edge and becomes almost cutesy. But beyond these faults, it is a pleasant spectacle. Maybe not as spectacular as some of the other science fiction shows out there. But it manages to keep me interested throughout the season and also offers some good cliffhangers between the shows. The end for me is not so attractive. I do not like shows that end without ending so to speak, leaving the story without solution. It is especially unfortunate in this case since the show seems to be canceled after the first season (it is still undecided). <br /> <br /> HBO is for me the point of reference for the quality of television. His series has the best actors, the best production values ​​and, most of all, the most solid writing. This is not HBO quality, but it is good for what it is. Good enough to want another season without a doubt.
