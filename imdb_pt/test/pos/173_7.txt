An absolute 80 year old scare classic. This is not like any other, because it puts young psychotics, bulging eyes and wide eyes, willing to kill all the adults of the city. Bud of ONLY ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS (80's gold again) plays one of the kid-killers and he's paired with one of the little girls that Jake Blues tries to buy at BLUES BROTHERS. There's a third blond boy, but he keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason. The violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly horrible at the points. The demonic gang of smiling children, though somewhat possessed of extra-planetary means, bears little resemblance to the Sons of the Damned, who never thought of using pistols, beasts, and shovels to kill those pesky adults. Julie Brown (not in the center of Julie Brown - the other) shows her bookcase, like three times, while she dances in her bedroom. This movie is a rarity I can not believe I missed growing up in the 80's. This would be my absolute favorite movie as a child if I had seen it. Where's the sequel that the ending asks? This movie is simply amazing. Look at all costs.
