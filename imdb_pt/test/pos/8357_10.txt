Hilarious movie, I had so much fun watching it. The star (Cuneyt Arkin, sometimes credited as Steve Arkin) is a popular actor from Turkey. He has played in many hardcore roles, epic swords movies and novels. It was fun to see him with an international cast and a pair of really ugly gloves. If I remember correctly, it was also nicknamed in English, which made things even funnier. (sort of like watching John Wayne speak Turkish).
