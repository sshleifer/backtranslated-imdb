This movie was a lot better than I expected. After a few Will Smith movies that were not as good as me, Robot, he came back to be nice and fun in this movie. Smith plays, Hitch, a dating doctor. Most of the film revolves around him teaching Albert to be himself and get a date with Allegra Cole, a famous and rich celebrity with whom he works. Albert is a klutz and goof and always stumble on his feet or not. All Hitch does is teach him to act more cool and not get so nervous around Allegra. <br /> <br /> Throughout all this, Hitch meets Sara, a gossip columnist who says goodbye to men. Hitch enchants her, so of course they leave. But, Hitch can teach other guys to make the girl fall in love with them, he does not believe in love. He has never had a girl since he was dropped off in college. But he likes Sara, so he keeps going after her. Sara's friend is hurt by the face whom she thinks went to the doctor's date. So, Sara traces the doctor, just to learn his Hitch. So, of course, she thinks he's a pig. So it's up to explain to Sara and Allegra what he does, so they both end up forgiving. <br /> <br /> FIND VERDICT: Well, there are some laughs and it's fun. I recommend.
