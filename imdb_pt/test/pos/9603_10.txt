.... could it be that ITV did not want to release this absolute classic because it would show their current series of Mike Bassett for what it is? In discussing Mike Bassett with a few co-workers, I mentioned the Bostock's Cup as a much superior offer and was surprised to find that I seem to be the only person in my office who actually saw it. This may not be right for a movie that has to be the funniest thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, ITV does not have the biggest recent record of comedy production, so you'd think they'd have the chance to at least repeat something that's genuinely funny. Maybe if this could be combined with a lucrative phone competition where we think the bus driver will be next, then they might be interested. <br /> <br /> Come on ITV, there are still some of us out there who would like to watch original, quality comedy / drama. Do the decent thing. Repeat it and remove it on DVD.
