Although I agree that this was a 1950s comedy, I do not think it was "typical". Firstly, Donna Reed was a strong woman, unlike ordinary mothers of the 1950s. She advocated the value and equality of women (remember the episode where the TV broadcaster says "just a housewife") and Donna argues that all women represent and represent, especially those who do not work outside the home? And when women rebelled against something from the series, it was not trivial ... it was always something to show that women have the right to be treated with the same respect as men. Remember, Donna Reed was married to the producer of the show, so she was much more interested in making her a more powerful character. <br /> <br /> The children were intelligent, but not precocious. They were normal kids. And they could act. Another thing that made Donna Reed Show stand out was not just kids looking like their parents but you can feel the chemistry between all the actors in the real life situation that then came out in the characters. Shelly Fabares and Paul Peterson often write and comment that they were treated as the children of Donna Reed and Carl Betz, and that the adults fiercely protected the child actors and treated them accordingly. Donna and Alex also had some sexual chemistry that was not seen in the other family's shows. And the characters could be flawed and important, and yet accepted by flaws and mistakes. These were not super-parents who did nothing wrong and had no emotional ups and downs. They were normal people acting like normal people. <br /> <br /> Women's rights, drug abuse, child abuse, single parents, poverty, children in need of good health care but can not afford ... all have been shown in this show. Innovative for the season. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed's show did not last for eight years without a reason. And that could have lasted, were it not for Tony Owens and Donna Reed getting divorced. <br /> <br /> This program is highly underrated and should be shown so that other generations can appreciate the quality. <br /> <br /> In summary, I agree with the original author who obviously cares about the show, but I think the Donna Reed show has a lot more to offer than casual entertainment.
