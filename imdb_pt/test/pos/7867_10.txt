A clever psychosexual drama about a wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood) who seeks refuge in an isolated confederate school for young women during the Civil War. Slowly, Eastwood begins to seduce all the girls in sight, until the tables are turned and he becomes the haunted in a disturbing final of gothic tone. Never was a movie so deliciously erotic, but disturbingly macabre at the same time. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the best time of Eastwood (fans of "Dirty Harry" will be surprised), while the rest the cast gives uniformly superb performances. Try watching the movie on video, as television prints often erase crucial flashback scenes between Geraldine Page and Patrick Culliton.
