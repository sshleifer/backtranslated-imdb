This is really the only chance to see the magic of James Joyce's writing brought to life. His novels are all infallible (in any real sense) and this is the only long story he wrote. It was John Huston's last film and it only hit the screen after he died, and it's easy to see his touch of grandeur. The Dead is poetic in his approach to the screen, telling us more about Ireland than any modern movie about the IRA and "problems" could hope to tell us. I hope more people watch this movie and experience the best of John Huston and James Joyce, and maybe visit this story in their local bookstore (and find out that this is probably the biggest tale ever published).
