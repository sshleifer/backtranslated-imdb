What a great movie! Unfortunately, in 1947, the script of the film could not have followed the book from which it was adapted, but the murder of a homosexual would have been too hot to deal with at that time. <br /> <br /> I thought all the performances were great, as well as the script, the direction, the brilliant black and white atmosphere of cinematography, music and cinema noir. <br /> <br /> I understand that in 1947 the film could not portray racism against blacks or prejudices. against homosexuals. (Robert Young's account of the prejudice against his grandfather, who was Irish and who endured this racism 100 years ago, was rather idiotic, but times dictated that the film avoid further examination of racism.) <br /> < I have a remark and a question to ask the viewer: 1. Did you notice that Robert Young did not point his gun when he shot and killed Robert Ryan, who was running fast in the dark and Young shot from an upstairs window to the dark without pointing? 2. If Robert Young's grandfather was killed 100 years ago in 1847 (the film was made in 1947) and Young was 40 years old, the timeline would not be logical. If his grandfather had been killed 50 years ago, the deadline would be realistic.
