I just saw this at the Philadelphia Film Festival. It was the most wonderful film - the best I've seen in a long time. Isa's seductive character is an open, exploring and (as commented in the movie) person full of love - portrayed with sincerity by the beautiful Camille Natta. The music that accompanies it is soothing and transportable, a balm to the soul. <br /> <br /> Each character seems to be in conflict in some way - and their interactions (w / conflicts) contribute to a great story. The short story told by A.K. Hangal as the Old Man was magically done - I wanted him to go on and on. <br /> <br /> That Hari seemed to remember his "place" everywhere, added power to the story - a refreshing change in the bubble Many stories of many modern writers. <br /> <br /> Everyone and everyone, an excellent movie. Go and see.
