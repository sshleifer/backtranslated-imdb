I found it really shocking at first to see William Shakespeare's masterpiece of love reworked into a bloody, violent and sensuous film adaptation. But after watching it once, it grows when you watch it for the second and third time, when you see the shock and start enjoying the movie on its own merits - solid acting, good dialogue, good sequencing and choreography, no soundtrack very bad and some of the effects (special) that happen. Oh, and also the ending. What a revolt!
