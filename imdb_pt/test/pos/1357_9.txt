This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro is working in an animation studio, which is quite interesting if you do not know anything about the way the anime studios were shot. In addition to episode 3, this was probably the least daring, but had a nice girl interest, as well as a surprise meeting of others in previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode is that it seems a bit too short but at the same time this may have been just because it was the only original script for the show that was not based on one of the manga chapters. but it turned out well, leaving us with the beautiful feeling that Kentaro is permanently at 25 years of studying. Definitely watch the rest of the series until the end, you can buy the entire series for $ 17, you can watch in up to two and a half hours, or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes of free time (which I do if I have a break for lunch at school.) good series, check it out.
