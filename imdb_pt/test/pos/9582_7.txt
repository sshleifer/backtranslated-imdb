Long before Terri Schiavo brought the issue of life as a "vegetable" into the public eye, "A Day in the Death of Joe Egg" dealt with it. Alan Bates plays Bri, a teacher whose daughter is almost completely tiger. He and his wife Sheila (Janet Suzman) try all kinds of black humor to try to get on with their lives, but they can not escape the facts. At one point, they still consider euthanasia. The question that surrounds them and their friends is: what will be of this situation? With this film, Alan Bates continued his sequence of really good films, preceded by "Zorba, the Greek", "The King of Hearts" and "The Fixer". We can safely say that he will miss it very much.
