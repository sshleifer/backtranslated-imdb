As I said in the title of this review, It hurts me to say this, but "hitch" reaches the apogee of what Hollywood Romantic Comedies can hope to aspire to. I have been a critic of the genre and is eponymous for as long as I remember myself, but on an almost tragic note, "Hitch" made me spend somewhere in the neighborhood of two hours of my life with a ridiculous smile stamped on my face. <br /> <br /> This movie may be misogynist and smug sometimes, but it still has a certain humor about it, whose subtlety can only be described as British. This is a wonderful Hollywood attempt to make (or remake, if appropriate ...) a movie that appeals to all our desires for a Romantic Comedy that makes us think and laugh simultaneously. I reluctantly and evasively give this movie a 9 out of 10 ... Something you'll hardly see me do for a romantic comedy in the near future, at least so, I hope.
