If you love the book, like me, stop watching the video after Jean and Joe meet in Australia. Up to that point, it's a faithful version of the book and the visuals are great. 10 out of 10 to that point and I enjoyed it many times. After that, the story is seriously rearranged and revised in a way that actually destroys the main part of the book, ie how Jean creates a town like Alice (Springs). In the beginning, the big change is to make Strachan a 40-something bachelor instead of a seventy-year-old widower. This distorts this love story especially when there are also small changes that contribute to make it more selfish and miserly like: in the book he suggests to Joe on the ship he can find more than one letter waiting for him. Australia, but in the video he does not give Joe any clue as to whereabouts or Jean's intentions. The last hour of the 5-hour video renders and manipulates the last third of the book. I do not see any reason for them to have quarreled between Joe and Jean - this is completely out of character and seems to be just an Australian attraction in Pommies by telling them what to do. So they bring Strachan to the wedding (instead of about three years later) - and he read the toast !! - very strange, especially in the context of the relationship between Jean and Noel as a cast in the video. The whole wedding scene is the invention of the writers. These abominations occupy time in the last hour, which was no longer enough time to do justice to the fascinating story of how Jean recreates Willstown as a place where she and Joe can be happy.
