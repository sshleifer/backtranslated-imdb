This English School's comic clowns classic is and has been one of the great classics of the house of art. Then the art house disappeared with the arrival of the videos. And so has the audience of this film. The loss is not for the houses of art or for this great movie. The loss is for those who will never have a real opportunity to see this memorable cinematic work filled with laughter. But I'm preaching to converts, it's not me. Who else would look for this movie?
