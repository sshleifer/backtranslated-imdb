'Hitch' is a good surprise: a romantic comedy that really has romance and comedy. Most romantic comedies range from mediocre to horrible because they are not funny or romantic. 'Hitch' takes actors like Will Smith, Kevin James and Eva Mendes to a fun, light-hearted journey that really made me laugh, and yes, a little "aww, how sweet!". <br /> <br /> Meet Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), also known as Hitch. He is a self-proclaimed "date doctor"; he helps hopeless guys like Albert (Kevin James) to beat guys like Allegra (Amber Valletta). Unfortunately, Hitch has to deal with Sarah (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist committed to breaking the Doctor date ... 'Hitch' is actually very funny, and even makes the standard slapstick scenes work simply because the cast is so energetic and clearly amused. I have to wonder why Will Smith did not make movies like that. His fast and fast delivery is perfect for this genre, and his chemistry with Mendes and James is wonderful. James is a real discovery; I've never seen his show 'The King of Queens', but he's funny and sincere, and he proves once again that white, fat men can not dance to hip-hop (Smith's responses to his attempts are hilarious). Mendes is hot and bouncy (not like that, geez) as the perfect combination of Smith, and Amber Valletta is sweet as Allegra. <br /> <br /> 'Hitch' is not perfect; is a little too long, and things get very "dramatic" near the end (although this is redeemed by the happy ending full of funny dancing). But it's a great update of the romantic comedies that continue to fill the theaters.
