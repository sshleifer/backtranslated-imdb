I had heard about "games" and "Dungeons and Dragons" before, but I knew it might be like what I saw in "Gamers: Dorkness Rising". These guys are so funny and fun to watch. Especially the guy who plays the "bard" or "minstrel" or whatever, he has a knack for physical comedy and timing. There's a lot of humor and background energy in some of the scenes that make you think that at least part of it was improvised there on set. The special effects needed to be worked on a bit, but I saw it at a convention last year and that's one of the things they said they were going to rework and improve, so it's probably wicked now!
