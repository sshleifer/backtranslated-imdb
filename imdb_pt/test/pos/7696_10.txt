"Porgy and Bess" is an excellent production of George Gershwin's masterpiece. It is made with good taste in soft colors. The voices are excellent. Although Sidney Portier's voice is nicknamed for his singing part, it gives a very touching performance. There is a remarkable performance of Sammy Davis Jr. as Sportin Life. There is still no DVD available for viewing, and this piece begs for one. All the smart movie goers who appreciated it in 1959 will appreciate the launch of this masterpiece in the new medium. The screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that rivals all other musicals, including the excellent ones by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Be sure to ask for a video provider. Like Walt Disney's "Songs of the South," it may be the racial tone assumption that is blocking the commercialization of this movie.
