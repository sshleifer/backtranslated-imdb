I was not even born when this series was released in the USA. It took about a decade before British TV networks got hold of it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was lucky enough to see the first episode, in which The Lone Ranger was a member of a group that was ambushed and shot down. TLR was the only survivor. Though severely wounded, he was saved by a passing Indian named Fool. I believe he wore a mask to hide his true identity for fear of reprisal. But instead, it has become even more recognizable. I do not know if he used it in his sleep. <br /> <br /> This was the staple of Saturday's tea. The trumpet clarinets at William Tell's opening meant a run to the television, food still in hand. Although very quickly it became hokum repetitive and predictable. No one ever unmasked him. No one has ever punched, no one has ever shot him. He was a little too good, and just a little too much in his dress for most kids. Poor Tonto, on the other hand, became his Aunt Sally. He was always being beaten, tied up, kidnapped, and other things. <br /> <br /> And what did he call The Lone Ranger? "King Savvy" was the general consensus in which I lived. It seemed to imply "the great know-it-all" in Indian speech. But it sounds like something else, as if Mr. Silverheels had a speech defect. 'Kemosabe'; what the hell is this? A later, less well-marketed duo called The Rider Range and Dick West ended up winning my vote. This included a bare-faced Jock Mahoney who was thoroughly beaten in each episode and was totally less camped, less super and more believable. <br /> <br /> Still; I still can not hear the opening of William Tell without waiting for the hoof gallop and a healthy Hi-Oh Silver. <br /> <br /> Devine daftness.
