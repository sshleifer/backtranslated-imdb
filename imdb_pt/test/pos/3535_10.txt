I saw the Messiah: - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programs I've ever seen. It was one of those programs that you think, oh, no, I can not watch the rest of it, but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who did it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely incredible actor, to be able to switch between two totally different characters, one of whom is evil, the nasty person who did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton the cop. To be able to do this, well, I certainly would not be able to do that, well, not without breaking anyway. I really love and care for Jamie Draven with all my heart and I will always, until the end of time, I think Jamie is the sweetest, most cute and sexy guy in the world. I absolutely love Jamie in Ultimate Force also because he looks damn sexy on the blacks he wore. I love Jamie Love Paula Draven <br /> -X-
