One has to take Martin & Lewis as a pinch of salt and pepper. Why does Martin stand up to Lewis? So again, why do all the women in this movie like Jerry? Because he is innocently nice! Martin sings some good songs (lip-sync'd at least once) and Jerry manages to kiss more girls than in all the other films together. I usually think I can get a lot of Jerry's antics before they become aggravating. BUT .... in this movie, notice when Jerry gets trapped in a submerged Navy submarine! GREAT! Buster Keaton should be proud. I give the movie a 7.
