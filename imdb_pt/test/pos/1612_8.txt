Thomas Mann's controversial novel is the basis for the movie "Death in Venice." Although in the book, the hero is an author, in the film director Luchino Visconti, who also wrote the script, turns him into a composer. As such, the author / composer, Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde) on the verge of mental exhaustion is a burnt artisan. After a long and successful career, he now seeks the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life. He decides to go on vacation to Venice, where he hopes to rejuvenate his diminishing ambition. However, while staying at the picturesque seaside resort, it catches the eye of a handsome young teenager, Tadzio (Björn Andrésen), who watches him with curious interest and is immediately injured by him. Although Gustav is captivated by the wonderful youth, he must, however, find some private time away from the boy's housekeeper (Nora Ricci), having to deal with an invading plague that seems to have infested the city. The dialogue of the film, as well as the novel, remains subtle, as well as the brief encounters between the boy and the artist. In the end. the public, unlike the book, is hampered by insinuations and imaginative flights of fancy. He never gave his novel, substance or opportunity and if it were not for the brief resolution of the book, the film allows only the possibility of "what if". However, one may sympathize with the hero and wish him a moment of peace to obtain that which is forbidden, indescribable, but definitely criticized by curious eyes. Great story and a Bogarde classic. ****
