I do not know what exactly it is, but the film is happily on my shelf without thinking of leaving me ... Fulci created one of the most ridiculous, bizarre, infested cheez and very special movies I've seen. I do not know what else to say about it, but I love this movie !!! The Tartar steak scene is absolutely noisy, and the whole fiasco of the Nazi orgy is strangely hilarious ... I'm not sure what Fulci was trying to do, but someone has heard that based on this film, Fulci accused Wes Craven of tearing Did he go with "Scream"? "Cat in the Brain" is a must for lovers of bad movies everywhere ... Yes, I will definitely say it's not a "good" movie, but I guarantee certain scenes will stay in your mind forever! This is an exercise in madness, people ... I think if I were a "serious" critic I would give a 3, but for sheer fun (again I can not really explain my feelings) I would give a 7 .... Really I ended up with the movie ...
