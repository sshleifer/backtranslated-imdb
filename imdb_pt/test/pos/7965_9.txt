I was very happy and at the same time quite surprised with other positive comments written by non-Koreans below. This movie is surprisingly heartshaking, and shows a very sad but hot 'vision for life' that is typical for Korean people. I thought other strangers would not understand this delicate feeling and would underestimate this quiet film as a boring movie, but I was wrong. The attraction of this film can be hard to avoid for strangers as well. (Even without caption ...) <br /> <br /> I would like to mention a few points that others have lost. Of course, this movie portrays the love between a man and a woman. However, the theme is far beyond that. In fact, it is about time, the value of remembrance, and death. In this film, the focus is not on the "love affair" between two people. As some have pointed out, they do not kiss, they do not hug, even without holding hands. So love itself is not completed (either positively or negatively) in the film. Instead, what haunts Jungwon (lead actor) is his impending death. He is running out of time, he can not hold it, leaving some behind, including his father and of course Darim (a machine gun). So the problem is how he can face death and leave something valuable in his short life, not how he can make love to Darim. <br /> <br /> This kind of theme sounds very familiar to us. There are many films about patients with incurable diseases, such as "Love Story." However, what makes this film excellent is the way Jungwon handles his death. He is a loser but has tried to do his best while he is alive, SILENT. He does not tell anyone around him about his death. He hides something in his mind, but without anger, hatred, revenge. He just tried to do the best while he was alive. This limited communication and obedience to fate is the mindset typical of Koreans and the point most Western people do not understand or, at best, misinterpret. <br /> <br /> This theme is very effectively expressed by the director of this film (surprisingly, his debut). Some say he is heavily influenced by Japanese director Ozu Yasujiro, who directed Tokyo Story. In fact, I remember reading in a magazine that the director himself admitted to being influenced by Ozu. I do not have this knowledge to analyze his style compared to Ozu's, but they have some in common and others do not. Low angle and static camera, especially remind us the Ozu style. But in terms of theme again, this Korean director seems to have a slightly warmer and hopeful vision. <br /> <br /> It is expressed concisely with the last picture of Jungwon. Very well done and really painful scene, I guess. In fact, the director first got the idea of ​​this movie when he attended the funeral of a famous Korean folk singer who died young of mysterious suicide. They say he saw the picture of the singer at the funeral and thought of a movie about death and remembrance. (And possibly hopefully the remnants, I guess ...) <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has a deep interest in cinematographic art as well as in Korean culture. This film, in my opinion, can be rivaled with other films like the history of Tokyo and a kind of American beauty. It's great if there is no language barrier. The DVD version will be released in February, so it can be a little help for foreigners with English subtitles.
