Ignore the comment before mine. The show is comic genius, the most underrated show ever. 3 reasons why. Reason 1, the flashbacks are hilarious, who cares if they have absolutely nothing to do with the story, they make me laugh so much it hurts and is not that the idea of ​​a good comedy program? People who think this is not funny have no sense of humor. Who cares if they are random, it's a t.v. show, you can do what ever you want with it and people say it is not realistic, nor is it a cartoon, its animation. Reason 2, the jokes are just generally hilarious, Seth McFarlane and the other writers are soooooooooooo funny, everything from Star Wars references to make fun of celebrities, I love them all. And Reason 3, the story lines are simply brilliant and funny, they set up all the jokes with their crazy nature and wackiness, just even funnier. <br /> <br /> I caught this late night on BBC2 and it never came back, I have all 7 seasons, plus the kind of movie thing (Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story), I have several T-shirts, posters and my collection is still growing. I've never had a collection of any TV shows before, but this was so funny that I just had to get everything. <br /> <br /> Just watch Season 3 and trust me you'll be hooked to life, the funniest show ever created and I hope this never ends!
