Not many people seem to know about this movie. Which is too bad because I think it's very good. Of course it's a bit tacky at times and may have a predictable plot. But the presentation of the film is very well done. I think the cast is good with friendly actors / characters. Tom Selleck does a good job playing a baseball player (think ... not too exaggerated, I suppose) and Ken Takakura (of Black Rain) plays the boss (the coach of the Japanese baseball team). Not much to complain about. It's just a light and happy comedy, and I recommend it.
