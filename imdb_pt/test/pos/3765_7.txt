It took me a while to find this movie, since I still do not have it on DVD (and my VCR is not worth being connected again). I think all referencing to the use of drugs is too much for some people. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie very seriously is just retarded. It is a parody of slap in the vein of "Airplane". I must say that when I watched on Showtime or the Spotlight growing up in the 80's, I was much more into humor than I am now. But it's definitely worth watching just to see what they (the filmmakers) managed to get away with before the hypocritical Just Say No unleashed their propaganda. sing ... "We're all junkies" hahaha It's a silly movie worth the $ 10 I paid from Ebay to get on DVD, do not even think about comparing it to the original - that's just stupid. What are you tall?
