Kate Gulden, played by one of the most nominated actresses of the last decade of this century, and also one of the most talented actresses Meryl Streep (Out of Africa). She is wonderful is every part that she plays. The Yale graduate is the pride and joy of American cinema. Kate's health is deteriorating and her husband, George, role well developed by the brilliant actor and also Oscar winner William Hurt (Smoke, Kiss of the Spider Woman) has difficulty with the deterioration of the health of his only true thing and search the help of his daughter. The poor daughter, Ellen Gulden, Renee Zellweger (Jerry Maguire) has long expected of her. Without breaks! The story has a very realistic view of the parents' illness. In this film the only daughter has to put her life on hold to take care of the needs of others. There is always one in each family that faces this kind of responsibility. Ellen is furious with the beginning of the film, but over time, she ends up understanding her mother's dedication to her family life. She even asks her mother: How do you do his, every day, inside and outside and nobody notices? It's what women do, much of what I call invisible work. In addition, we clean, repair, repair, extend, celebrate, are best friends, are confident, loving, educators, disciplinarians, sensitive. Some of us, like the two women in this movie, have the perfect education, are the psychological pillar for the whole family, and they also do all this invisible work! This is Kate Ellen and many women in our society. Many of us have passed through this stage of life when our parents grow old and die. I was there. They were only too young. I gave my parents my thanks, but I never understood them as well as when I had to play their roles and had to walk in their shoes. This film mirrors the reality of life. Maybe it's sad, but that's how life is sometimes. George, a Harvard professor, is a complicated person who seems to think his work is more important than everyone else, and has a very "master / servant" mentality toward the women in his life. He is not strong enough to deal with. If you want to see a good performance and the reality of life, do not miss this movie. Favorite Scenes: The restaurant comes to Kate, violins and everything. The making of a broken porcelain table. That I so symbolic! We are all broken ships! Favorite Quotes: George: "It's just going up, you realize it's really going down hill". George "You have an education at Harvard, but where is your heart?" <br /> <br />
