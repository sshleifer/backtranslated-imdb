This review is long overdue, as I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the biggest movie ever made. I'll put this gem in any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing or any other aspect of cinema. Is it practically perfect in all of them? a true masterpiece in a sea of ​​false masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The structure of this film is easily the best built in film history. I can think of no other movie where something of vital importance happens every two minutes. Literally, Ji-woon Kim seems to have made a movie that practically insults the viewer to dissect it at the most detailed levels. A seemingly insignificant object can be shown? a shelf of dresses, two diaries, a drop of blood emanating from a crack in the floor, a bottle of pills, etc.? but after meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more? a clue that helps to give meaning to this particular scene (or perhaps to the film in its entirety), which almost always contributes to instigating reflection on the psychological concepts that hide in the background until the spectator's intelligence stimulates them to arrive at front. Such an event may occur a handful of times during any other film, but in A Tale of Two Sisters such events occur so quickly and relentlessly that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual alert state so as not to miss something important. In other words, the content level of this movie is enough to easily fill a dozen other movies. How can someone in their right mind ask for more of a movie than that? It is simply the highest and most superlative form of cinema imaginable. The most quoted critic of A Tale of Two Sisters is well summed up by Zaphod B Goode, who falsely claims that history is incoherent, unresolved confusion that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence, because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions. He postulated that Ji-woon Kim made a dozen possible explanations and left it at that. In reality, however, nothing could be further from the truth. A Tale of Two Sisters provides a series of objectively incontestable facts that help the viewer identify the EXACT occurrences of each scene in the film. If our good friend Zaphod was paying attention, would he have noticed ?? for example ?? the series of obvious flashbacks that provide enough factual information to make sense of the movie. These flashbacks convincingly contradict Zaphod's statement of complete subjectivity. The objective elements of A Tale of Two Sisters are so obvious to anyone who is willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to expose even the slightest effort them. Can Ji-woon Kim really be criticized for the impatience of viewers who do not have the desire to understand his film? I think not. <br /> <br /> Please note that I will not insult the intelligence of critics like Zaphod who can not "catch" A Tale of Two Sisters because it really has nothing to do with the lack of intelligence as much as the lack of persistence. The film unfolds so effectively that the only possible explanation for the confusion is the lack of effort on the part of the viewer. Yes, this movie requires a fairly significant amount of puzzle resolution, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful image. You just have to put them together. Remember, the script was written by someone with the picture already in mind? he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully all the time to provide a magnificent brain-exercise it? When complete ?? gives a final form of satisfaction and a state of reverence. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. There are movies that seem to start with an incomplete image and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design. Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001) are perfect examples of this. A tale of two sisters is not. It is ironic that Zaphod claims that Darko was more masterfully constructed than The Tale of Two Sisters, especially considering that Darko not only provides almost no objective fact, but also an end that is the cliché deus ex machina par excellence that can be discarded in the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence. I'm ashamed to mention the two films in the same sentence, but the contrast is important. Although it surprises me that Zaphod cites a movie that collapses when exposed to the slightest intellectual effort, as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible through a significant application of intellectual effort. He apparently likes his "smart" movies in the shallowest way possible. This is evident when he asks 17 consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself. Just read the topics of Opiemar in the Forum of Two Sisters Forum Discussion. Anyone who carefully reads these topics and even claims the lack of an objective solution to this movie may well stop watching intelligent movies altogether because the answers are so damn obvious. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say more, but I've reached my 1,000-word limit. Everything that was said here had to be said. So let it be said now!
