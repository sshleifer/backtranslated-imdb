In 1965, producer Kevin McLory - who owns a part of Bond's film rights association with EON Productions (Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli) for making "Thunderball", the fourth film of the franchise 007. The star is Sean Connery , of course. <br /> <br /> In 1982, McLory wins a legal battle and can produce an independent Bond movie. "Never Say Never Again" (NSNA) is one of two "unofficial" 007 movies made out of EON (the other is the 1967 comedy "Casino Royale"). NSNA is a remake of "Thunderball" and stars the original Bond, Sean Connery, who returns to the role after many years of absence. <br /> <br /> The film is released a few months after "Octopussy" with Roger Moore. , the 13th episode of the EON series. At the time, the press called it the "Bond War" ... Both films were a big hit in 1983, even though "Octopussy" made more money at the box office. <br /> <br /> NSNA is a luxury movie. made by excellent technicians - director Irvin Kershner, who led "The Empire Strikes Back," Douglas Slocombe, director of photography for "Hunters of the Lost Ark" - and screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr. - who wrote "The Three Days of the Condor "Among others ... <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent with Connery, a then relatively unknown Kim Basinger, Barbara Carrera, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Edward Fox ... <br /> < Although everything the film remains to be lower than the original "Thunderball". There are many fundamental ingredients missing to be a true James Bond film: there is no traditional gun-barrel sequence, there is no "James Bond theme", M and Q are not interpreted by traditional actors ... It is a copyright : EON is only allowed to use these elements. In short, the NSNA does not have the classic cinematic atmosphere 007. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is exciting and enjoyable. Brandauer is a very good villain and the women (Basinger and Carrera) are sexy and beautiful. But the main highlight is Sean Connery! He is once again marvelous in the role, he is older, but looks more fit and handsome than in "Diamonds are Forever," his last performance as the British super-spy before NSNA.
