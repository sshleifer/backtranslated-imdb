Jack Black and Kyle Gass team up to promote their band Tenacious D in this classic Rock called Tenacious D in The Pick Of Destiny. Jack Black and Kyle Gass invent their own Rock Opera ... it was like a rock 'n' roll opera. Some of the more distorted events occurred in that movie ... the big foot part ... the mushroom part ... and in the end when they made the stone against the Devil. A classic formed in Tenacious D .... one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The last things I saw in the theater were idiots ... but this movie rocks. It really made me laugh a lot. The whole base is Jack Black runs to find his rock partner in Los Angeles. His partner is Kyle Gass and a man who has always been bald. They work together to find that magical choice that can make the most terrible musician play a lot. They finally make it to the Rock 'n' Roll Museum and steal the pick. Along the way, they meet The Stranger, played by Tim Robbins. They arrive at the club to win the prize when the owner picks up the choice and all the time he is the devil and he fights against D in a Rock Off. D does not win, but the Devil's horn falls, sending him back to hell. So live the D time !!!!!!!!!!
