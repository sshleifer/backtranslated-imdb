"The Couch Trip" is one of those silly comedies that emerged in the 1980s. In that case, Dan Aykroyd plays a mental patient who presents himself as a psychiatrist and goes to Beverly Hills to replace Charles Grodin. Most of the film's humor comes from its satirical look at Beverly Hills and the empty lives of the people there (a woman has a power struggle with her maid). <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie you watch to have a good time. Do not expect any kind of religious experience. But you'll probably laugh a lot at how the people of Beverly Hills boast their wealth. Also starring Walter Matthau, Donna Dixon, Arye Gross and Victoria Jackson (from "UHF").
