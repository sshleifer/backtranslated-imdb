This is one of several maritime periods of the time, which has the additional (though not unique) distinction of a female Buccaneer at its center. At first, both protagonists - Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan - may seem unfounded, but they grow well in their roles, thanks to the talented players (Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice) who support them. Marshall, velvety voice, is characteristic as the obligatory philosophical philosophy of a doctor, and Gomez is adequately greater than the life of Blackbeard The Pirate. <br /> <br /> The cast is completed by Debra Paget as Jourdan's wife, who incurs the jealousy of the fury of the main character, in which Jourdan instills the first pains of love (which, however, does not spare him occasional whipping or sword-wounding); in fact, the film was the second exotic team of Jourdan and Paget in a year, following the BIRD OF PARADISE of Delmer Daves. The direct result of this unexpected slowing of Anne's character is the fact that she had disagreed with the Blackbeard crew and its unlikely culminating sacrifice to save the lives of the lost Jourdan, Paget, and Marshall. While the film is not a particularly notable example of its kind, Jacques Tourneur's energetic direction and Franz Waxman's grand score ensure an above-average effort that moves at a fast pace; indeed, Tourneur had already done service in the genre with Burt Lancaster's superior vehicle, THE FLAME AND THE ARROW (1950). As usual, with vintage Technicolor productions, cinematography gives the film a sumptuousness that is invigorating. By the way, different duration times are given for this movie (81 or 87 minutes) and for the record, the version I watched was the shortest.
