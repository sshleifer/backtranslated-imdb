The evil Professor Moriarty plot to gain control of SHERLOCK HOLMES and the SECRET WEAPONS that could win the war by the Nazis. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce return to the screens as the beloved detective of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. comrade, Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson, in this fun little mystery. Universal's studios did not lose money either with extravagant production values ​​or a sensible script, knowing that their two stars would be all the attraction an audience would need. In fact, Rathbone, like the brain ego, and Bruce, as idiotic id, seem to really become the characters they are creating, happily keeping their faces firm as they engage in the most complete absurdity. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hoey makes his first appearance as the stubborn Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard; In partnership with Bruce, these two good-hearted but pedantic fellows actually succeed in saving Holmes's intellectually superior life twice. Lionel Atwill, a sinister master who deserves more recognition for his talent, does a great job as Moriarty, making the evil rogue an enemy worthy of Holmes' steel, savoring scenes in which he manages to inflict torture and pain. William Post Jr. and Kaaren Verne interpret the Swiss scientist and his girlfriend, who are at the center of the mystery, but do not have much to do. Sweet Mary Gordon makes a symbolic appearance as Holmes's owner, Mrs. Hudson. <br /> <br /> Rathbone peppered his already classic interpretation of Holmes by appearing disguised three times throughout the story, revealing to the viewer that the great detective was a bit tormenting at heart. <br /> <br /> This film - which is loosely based on elements in Sir Arthur's The Dancing Men and The Empty House tales - followed SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE VOICE OF TERROR (1942) and preceded SHERLOCK HOLMES in WASHINGTON (1943).
