Certainly the best film directed by Claude Lelouch after "L'aventure c'est l'aventure". The inspiration of the life of Jacques Brel is really present. Richard Anconina and Jean-Paul Belmondo have played an incredible duo and are great at psychological discovery of the two characters who are playing.
