In the future, a heterogeneous group of people sleeping aboard a commercial spacecraft is forced to improvise their survival when the spacecraft crashes on a remote, barren planet. They already have a problem where one of the passengers is the intense criminal Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel, in his first top-billed role); however, they are soon preyed upon by a strange predator species that thrives in the dark - and a rare solar eclipse is about to occur. While the script for this film is ultimately on the routine side, it is decently acted and is especially well done technically. Place of work, photography and design (production as well as creature design) are all very impressive. It's not the most original or stimulating science fiction / horror ever made, far from it, but still offers good entertainment. Diesel is particularly good at getting under the skin of his intimidating character. It's not totally predictable, however, and gets a few points to have a more politically correct ending than most of its kind. <br /> <br /> Filmed in a desolate area in Coober Pedy, Queensland, Australia. <br /> <br /> A kind of sequel is in progress. <br /> <br /> 7/10
