It took me about a year after watching this movie to write about it. Lord knows I wanted to, after witnessing this I knew I saw something I had not seen before, but I was not sure why. Now, after reflecting for a long time I know, it is these characters that until now I still can not stop thinking. <br /> <br /> Distant, brief and slow, tells the story of a relative (Yusuf) who comes from the countryside to live briefly with a good to make photographer (Mahmut) in the city in the hope of finding employment. However, it is clear that after Yusuf hypothesizes the idea of ​​being a sailor and his job prospects, he is really looking for something more, some kind of purpose in his life. <br /> <br /> They are taken through a seasonal environment that are filmed exquisitely. The context in which they take place makes the scenes more powerful in two in particular when a girl Yusuf comes following suddenly finds her significant other, and the look on Yusuf's face as he looks at a fish basket and the shot and the light that reflects on his tortured face. This scene itself has to be one of the most beautifully shot pieces I've witnessed, I do not know how long. <br /> <br /> In the end, Mahmut also has his own demons, but ends up confronting his relative. that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave, in a scene that is very simple but has the feeling of a real heartbreak. <br /> <br /> What the viewer gets is a lot of reflection and reflection for these two people that everyone can see a piece of themselves in. You should not be delayed by the pace of this movie is really worth every second of taking the breath. <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10.
