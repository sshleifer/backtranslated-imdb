I used this film in my college ethics courses for over 10 years (also Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors" - another fantastic, multi-level ethical study). <br /> <br /> It's fiction. I do not focus much on the unrealistic features of "Strangers" because all fiction films are obviously false on many levels. I love the movie as a welsh comedy, told with such beauty, with many ironic twists and visual pleasures - even if it's "unbelievable." The story is told so well that I do not even think about criticizing its plausibility (although I must confess that tennis match seems the weakest part for me - a lot of Hollywood fluff and real tennis competition). Some problems presented in the film promise a realistic moral education and an ethical discussion: 1. Ethical Passivity: Some weaknesses of the Guy character are planned by Hitchcock. A primary ethical perception of the film is the danger of the inability to articulate one's moral positions. Guy can not effectively block Bruno's crazy proposals in the beginning. An interesting question is why and how does Guy behave passively, ineffectively? One possible answer is your depression because of your intense and complicated divorce process. <br /> <br /> 2. Bad communication: Guy commits another flaw in the beginning: on the train, to escape quickly, he agrees that Bruno's ideas are good. But Guy's literal meaning is opposite to his sarcastic and inflected meaning. Bruno takes the literal meaning as an agreement for the cross-murders. Guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement. To some extent, near the beginning, Bruno may be partially pretending that an agreement was made to lure Guy further into a network of complicity. Bruno is manipulating Guy; Guy's linguistic ambiguity on the train gives Bruno the chance to put an ethical "stranglehold" on Guy. Bruno manipulating Guy can also take on other meanings. . . . <br /> <br /> 3. Secrecy: Some speculated on a sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno. It seems at first ridiculous, especially since Guy seems obviously heterosexual in his relationships with Miriam and Anne. However, remember that Guy is also ineffective with both women. Guy appears (stereotypically - he remembers 1951) effeminate, especially in relation to Bruno. The guy, the strong athlete, is weak inside. Bruno is also in conflict (playing "against himself"), appearing facially and physically strong at first, but exhibiting some "effeminate" traits (Bruno's fashion and work, his emotional kiss on Guy in different situations; his loving mother Bruno kissing and desperately stroking his mother's hand, and other subtler gay stereotypes that contain an enigmatic meaning from Hitchcock's point of view). I would like to hear Hitchcock clarify its meanings here. <br /> <br /> 4. Dishonesty and distrust: Guy makes some colossal mistakes in hiding truths about Bruno from family and police. Guy does not fully understand that admitting faults quickly can be better than a cover-up or a delay in confession. Again, Guy is moved by passivity, insecurity, fear - and perhaps by self-hatred that is closer to Bruno's self-loathing than we care to see or admit. Both Guy and Bruno have their own parables of impotence. <br /> <br /> 5. Lack of evidence: Guy feels a problem in gathering the evidence to absolve himself. While going quickly to the police would solve a huge problem, Guy is imprisoned with his own doubts and insecurities: the absence of desired alibis; the inability of the alcoholic teacher to testify on behalf of Guy; the obsessive need to appear politically untouched; and other personality factors that make Guy feel helpless. He's just as dysfunctional as Bruno-it's just not as dangerous (but someone could partially blame Guy's murder for Miriam). <br /> <br /> 6. Sickness and Mental Disorder: An interesting question is how legally responsible is Bruno for the murders? The most ethically incompetent Bruno is like a sick sociopath, the most guilty Guy can be like someone healthy who has failed to get up and act morally to prevent the crimes. Guy's failure is like a man who does not call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide and death sets in. It can be argued that more than one crime is committed and that Guy is an emotionally affected accomplice. <br /> <br /> These and many other features of the film make "Strangers on a Train" a moral piece, a diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections.
