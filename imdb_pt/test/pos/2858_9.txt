I'm not sure why I chose a loan from Mom to "Nurse Betty". I guess just because I heard a little of that movie. But I'm glad I did. "Nurse Betty" is an original and clever film that has humor and a darker side. <br /> <br /> This was one of Renee's first major before becoming major in Hollywood. I can see why she's an incredible actress. The scene where she finally notices what happened and she's on the set of her favorite soap opera, you can see pain, confusion, fear and embarrassment on her face. Just to let you in the movie, she plays Betty. A shy and insecure woman defending her abusive husband, she is a waitress and is passionate about soap operas, especially one in which a certain cute doctor, Dr. Dave Revell. When she sees the murder of her husband accidentally in a separate room, the murders she perceives are two clients she had, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. She then just loses her mind and leaves the town after talking to the police and says she needs to find her ex-fiance, Dr. Dave Revell. So she travels across the country to California to meet Dr. Revell and wants a job as a nurse to work with Dave, she's seen the show so many times, somehow she's just amazing at being a nurse when she saves a woman's brother . Although everyone says she's delusional, she just looks at them like they're crazy. When she meets the actor who plays Dave Revell, George (her real name) thinks she's just a crazy fan trying to get on the show. She just looks at him in confusion and believes that he and she belong together. <br /> <br /> Renee was great, she was so believable in losing her mind in the movie. She's come a long way, and whether you want to admit it or not, she's lovely and a great actress. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays one of the killers, Charlie, who is their father. . He is so charmed and in love with Betty and while chasing her across the country, he becomes almost in love with Betty to the point that he almost falls in love with her. He and his son Wesley must find Betty when they find out she was there at the crime scene and could reveal their identities. When Charlie sees Betty and finally catches her, she has scars at first, but she calms down and they know they have a real connection. It was a beautifully played scene, my opinion is that Morgan gave a stronger performance. He is great. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly decent performance by Chris Rock, son Wesley. He is so "gun", he just did the job in a hurry and take care of business. I loved his comedy performance in the end where he and the gang he is holding hostage are just watching the novel together. Classic. "Nurse Betty" is a great movie that I recommend for a good laugh and only in a small honest movie that I think anyone could enjoy. <br /> <br /> 9/10
