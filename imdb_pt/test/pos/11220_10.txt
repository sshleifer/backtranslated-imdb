I loved the movie "Northfork". I did not know anything about the movie before I watched it. Therefore, I had no influence or external information to guide me in what I was seeing unfold on the screen. In retrospect, I would advise anyone interested in the film to watch it if it were for no other reason than the quality actors who appear in it. Do not read anything about the plot, plot or evaluation of the film. In fact, stop reading anything else in my comments, although I believe they are general and do not spoil the movie for you, I do not want to lower the value of the movie for you. Find your own path of meaning in this movie or it is diminished in its potential. <br /> <br /> In general, I found the 3 benign strangers in intriguing Northfolk. As the movie unfolds, they may qualify as three amusing fugitives from a psychiatric hospital or the dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish boy or three "sent" angels to find the "lost angel." The sick and perhaps dying boy works to persuade the three "outsiders" to abandon the search for the lost angel, to become their guardians (mother and father), and to take him safely away from Northfork less than 1000 miles). He even declares that he is the lost angel to try to manipulate them all to be their guardians. Only one of the three respond positively to the boy. The other two have no real enthusiasm or passion for this involvement. <br /> <br /> The priest who cares for the sick boy demonstrates deep concern for people and a deep conviction about his faith. It transcends the desolation and emptiness of Northfork and his people; he is the light of goodness and hope for both Northfork and the moviegoer. <br /> <br /> Near the climax of the movie, the boy and the new guardian travel the earth to a field where an airplane waits. They embark to find the other two strangers also on the plane; in fact, one is the pilot. The engines start and the plane takes off. <br /> <br /> Who are the 3 strangers? If only a stranger was interested in helping the boy why all three were on the plane? Where does the plane go? Did the other two find the "Lost Angel"? Is there a lost angel and if so who? Who are the six men dressed as funeral directors? If all this is just the feverish dream of a sick boy, as one of the three strangers ends up approaching one of the men dressed as a funeral parlor when he jumps and knocks his head (neither the boy nor the strangers had any contact with these men ). One or two sentences written under the title telling people what this movie is is a tragic mistake (this is not a spoiler, it's just a statement about advertising). So if you have not seen the movie, Northfork, the above questions show just a few of the interesting and fun forks in the way of thinking when you see the movie Northfork. If you've read the movie's plot summary before watching it before, maybe you should look at some of the questions above and see them again ... I know I will. <br /> <br /> Terry
