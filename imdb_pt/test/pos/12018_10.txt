This is one of those movies that, for whatever reason, just clicked with me. Everything is right. Eric Roberts laconic, good researcher, his voiceover narration, the winding plot, Dan Hedaya and Denis Lipscomb have given good roles, scenarios, paintings in the scenes of the artists studios, the final credit sequence and the haunting theme song that perfectly encapsulates the climate of the whole film. If I have any reservations, it's Beverly D'Angelo as the femme fatale, but she plays her final scenes beautifully. I think director Matthew Chapman was trying some kind of 'Chinatown' for the whole thing. Did not work. But as a murder mystery is a gem.
