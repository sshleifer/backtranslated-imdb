Much happier and less bound and defined than previous efforts by Gene Saks Barefoot in the Park (67) and The Odd Couple (68), Cactus Flower is not a work of art, but compared to most of the 1960s farces such as The Apartment, How to Murder Your Wife, Goodbye Charlie, A Guide to Moreno Man, Divorce, American Style, Any Wednesday, Kiss Me Stupid, Boys at Night, is a masterpiece. Director Saks and writer I.A.L. Diamond has effectively "given up" Abe Burrows' Broadway success, and the film benefits greatly from filming in New York and from excellent performances by Ingrid Bergman and Goldie Hawn. Bergman is charming, looks great and shows a talent for comedy. Hawn in his Oscar-winning role has never been better or more attractive. Matthau is well, although it is hard to believe that Hawn's character was so in love with him. And in retrospect, Hawn's suicide attempt at the beginning of the film is unbelievable and unbelievable. However, the film has a plausible farce montage, and once it starts, it generates laughter. Rick Lenz, Jack Weston, Eve Bruce and Vito Scotti offer good support. The movie is enjoyable and fun, and Hawn and Bergman take care of you.
