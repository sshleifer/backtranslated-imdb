"Christmas in Connecticut" is an absolute must-see for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, the forerunner of Martha Stewart, is a columnist for magazines and the ne plus ultra housewife - the perfect wife, mother and domestic goddess. The only thing is that it is not any of those things - a total false. Unfortunately for her, she is about to be discovered. His publisher, Alexander Yardley (a brilliant comic book twist of Sydney Greenstreet), has the brilliant idea of ​​inviting a famous war hero to Elizabeth's "perfect farm" for the Christmas holiday. Only thing, there is no farm, "perfect" or not. The comedy involves how Elizabeth is keeping her true identity confidential so she does not lose her job. Elizabeth's colleague, John, has a farm in Connecticut, which solves this problem. However, he wants to marry Liz, but she does not want to marry him. He offers his marriage even though he knows she does not feel the same about him as he does about her. He makes the offer anyway, and assures her that he is willing to wait. And here Barbara Stanwyck, like Liz, offers one of the most devastating assumptions I've ever heard. With perfect innocence, she replies, "Could you wait so long?" OUCH! In addition, the scenes between Una O'Conner and S.Z. Sakall is hilarious. They do not seem to like each other (though one suspects they really like it). They are rivals in the home and S.Z. Sakall's mutilated English is matched by Nora's strangled pronunciation of his name ("Mr. Basternook"). "My name is FELIX!" It's amazing how Christmas and these black and white movies are. Great character work by all involved. Do not miss this!
