Heath Ledgers acting in this movie really bothers me, but overall it's a great watch. Bryan Brown is great when I usually do not like him, but then his whole gang is a great job. Jimmy is an unfortunate wannabe gangster who can not do anything right (SPOILERS: loses money with pandos, ackos and almost ends up with a bank robbery) but still comes out on top. <br /> <br /> I did not know what the two kids were there in the beginning, but they put together some stories together. <br /> <br /> All right, a piece of Australian cinema 9/10
