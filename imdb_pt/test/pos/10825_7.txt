An interesting couple of stories, this little film manages to bring together seemingly different characters and stories in the background of World War II and manages to unite them without losing the public. I was impressed by the depth portrayed by the different characters and also how much I really felt that understood them and their motivations, even if the time spent in the development of each character was very limited. The excellent acting skills of the individuals involved with this picture are easily observed. A fun and stylized film with a series of comedic moments and more shaking events in the head. <br /> <br /> 7/10
