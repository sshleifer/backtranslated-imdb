As it was selected during the Quinzaine des réalisateurs, in this year 2002, Catherine Breillat is masterfully divided in half of her autobiographical film, where her main actress, Anne Parillaud, admirably embodies the film director of "Intimate Scenes". . <br /> <br /> This is a actors' good manners comedy. Realization of? Movie genre? Pornography or exhibitionism? Sex Is Comedy is a postmodern movie, with its screenplay based on a movie within the film. As an implosive story of a minimalist love scene, the film is built with a constant solidarity of forms and spirit, in which Breillat continues to break down and analyze the taboos. Using visual codes and a certain sense of the formula, Catherine Breillat implements her clinical analysis of sexuality as an isolated problem out of society to be communicated through the door of the heart. So, Grégoire Colin (Good Work, Nénette et Boni, Claire Denis, The Dream of the Angels, Eric Zonca) in the role of Actor and Roxanne Mesquida (The Fat Girl, Catherine Breillat, Marie of Bay of Angels, Manuel Prada), the actress, are actors that she invents, she clarifies in an interview. Breillat watches the man in front of him, a chaste man. So Breillat films shame and sexual mutilation, but also a great hope, a disturbing dimension of ecstasy, a nudity of feelings, half of exhibitionism, playing to be one to be one. The director is finally expected to lead the actors to express their feelings, their body and their soul. So disposed, faced with the problem of the "who am I" order, Breillat's actors put forth an inorganic vitality to merge into their work in progress. But for what is an incredible form of exorcism, for an actor, Breillat raises many questions. While enduring great suffering, the actors seem to be the ones who seek this loving transportation to be part of the eternity of their work. The Art of Breillat is a researcher, to know how to undertake a dialogue to push the limits of intimate scenes. Join the makeup, prosthetics in the erection and unions are not without remembering that photos and scenes of Jan Steen and Rembrandt could be in the anecdotal and diary of the characters on a film set. While moral categories disappear from the backdrop of Sex Is Comedy, Breillat manages to reveal the actors' loving power of imitation in a landscape of formidable and dramatic humanity.
