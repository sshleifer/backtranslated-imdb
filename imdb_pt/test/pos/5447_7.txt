Leno talks through his catch phrases. This spoils the joke, for those who have not yet discovered. Your show is performed in a micro-sized studio for a reason, or two reasons - the small amount of laughter will be magnified, and few want to see it. The set of Letterman is the opposite - Ed Sullivan would be proud and the balcony would always be full. <br /> <br /> NBC, tacky NBC, will never succeed. The megalomaniacal enterprise of founder David Sarnoff remains all about money. At least CBS has a bit of familiarity. <br /> <br /> Leno collects cars, or is stamps, while Letterman runs cars. The difference is informative. <br /> <br /> When I was talking, I used to ask other people to send me an email if Leno _ever_ said something funny. I never received a single email. Letterman has a great timing. He can also reuse the dullest joke in such a way that it becomes one of the funniest things of the show that night. <br /> <br /> Letterman has built other careers. Paul is now well known and respected in his own musical right. Even the other members of Paul's band get recognition and career augmentation. Biff Henderson has become a name the United States knows. Even business on the same block as the Ed Sullivan Theater gets a boost. What has Leno done for someone else? Personally, I'm glad Dave moved in and Leno did the Carson show. I've never watched NBC shows before and I had no reason to. <br /> <br /> The Ten More list is an American icon. So does Letterman. Leno is the dream of a caricaturist, nothing more.
