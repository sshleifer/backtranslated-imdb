I must say that I am an avid fan of horror films, and today I am not tired of foreign horror. Since US terror really depends a lot on blood. <br /> <br /> This movie is fantastic. This film reminded me a lot of M. Night's SIXTEEN. The way the film was directed was great. The director took his time to set it all up. It took about 40 minutes to put the movie into a horror movie. I thought the movie was just a drama. This movie just accumulates and the reward is not too much. <br /> <br /> I've never done this before, but this is the main reason why I liked the movie ... I actually screamed out loud because a scene just scared me ... which is kind of pathetic. .. but for a movie to do that, it's great.
