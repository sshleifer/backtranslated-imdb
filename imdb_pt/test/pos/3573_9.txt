I really went to see this movie with low expectations, since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And surprisingly I found it really original. I have already commented on other Colombian films, and I agree that Colombian films tend to have a similar scheme, and they always try to refer to average ordinary people, especially trying to make jokes with the continuous curse. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people talk. The plot and tempo are brilliant, and could be extrapolated to any country in the world. The performance was great, and the script is for me one of the best ever produced on Colombian soil. I think anyone around the world can have a good hour and a half of entertainment, with a beautifully directed black comedy of bluff humor. I remembered movies like snatch and others of the type. I recommend it and hope it is seen by more people, since Colombian films seem to have started to be more internationally focused since last year.
