This is a love story against the backdrop of television news. The three main stars, William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks, create a love triangle while working in the Washington department of a TV network. <br /> <br /> Tom Grunick (Hurt) is the handsome reporter who is being prepared to be a star.Jane (Hunter) is the producer who acknowledges that Tom does not have the intellectual seriousness to be a real journalist, but falls in love with him anyway. Aaron Altman (Brooks) is the man who shares his beliefs in journalistic standards is also the man who really loves her. Holly Hunter was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, but lost to Cher (Moonstruck!) She was robbed! This is the Hunter movie. Her character Jane is intelligent, relentless and totally motivated. She is also hilarious and neurotic. His performance is perfect. Just watch her face as she watches the tape of Tom's interview with a rape victim. The scales literally fall from your eyes. <br /> <br /> Wiliam Hurt's performance is less showy. He plays a man who is well aware that he is a hymn and a scam but is smart enough to know that his rise will be facilitated by people like Jane. He gives few tips from a man who is extremely calculating. <br /> <br /> The film comments on celebrity, journalism, integrity and commercial pressures on the news in a medium that is focused on the bottom line. He predicted that the news would be stupid, that standards would be slowly reduced due to commercial pressures. <br /> <br /> Think about it: this movie was released before the end of the Cold War and before the emergence of reality TV. However, he foresaw the dumbing down of the news. Paris Hilton's release from prison was treated as great news! To see how prophetic this movie is, just watch the evening news and watch the scenery, the graphics, and the presenters. Tom Grunick and his clones are well and truly alive!
