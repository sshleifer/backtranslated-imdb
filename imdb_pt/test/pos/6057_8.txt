I was a Marine at Camp Pendleton when D.I. (1st Marine Division, 11th Marine Regiment, 3rd Battalion, I-Drum). I still remember being in line with a bunch of other Marines to see the movie at the "Star" theater in Oceanside, California. <br /> <br /> We did not remotely expect the movie to portray everything we experienced in training. but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was. The idea of ​​using real Marines in the movie was a great idea (I believe they were all real Drill instructors as well). As good an actor as Jack Webb was, he simply could not "call cadence" like a true Marine instructor. <br /> <br /> We all laughed when the "problematic" rookie's mother came to the military camp. to speak with the captain. Never in a million years would that have happened, but this is Hollywood, and we do not let this episode keep us from enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> I went by the camp at the MCRD in San Diego during the summer. of 1956, and at that time there were practically no limits on what DIs could do to you. The Ribbon Creek event at Parris Island had not yet affected the boot camp, at least not at MCRD - San Diego. <br /> <br /> I agree with what many of the other reviewers commented on on Sgt. Moore's "rigidity" around his girlfriend. I believe this was just Webb's acting style, and although they could have deleted that part of the film, it did not do much harm to production. <br /> <br /> A little note, the character (uncredited) of "Pvt. Rodriguez" was played by one of my drill instructors, the sergeant. Peter J. O'Neill. Sgt. O'Neill used to tell us that someday he wanted to be an actor. We secretly laughed at this, but he surprised us all. He was a great instructor, and I thought he did well in his small part. Besides, he really liked throwing knives. He often demonstrated his ability to us that summer at camp. I often wonder if he's still alive.
