Situated in Venice mainly on the Lido, Visconti's "Death in Venice" is a triumph of cinema combining the excellence of the characterization of Dirk Bogarde and specialized photography of the resort area in all its various moods every day. For those who love Venice, this is a movie to love. <br /> <br /> Mahler's music often heard throughout the film heightens the drama. The climate you create is not always happy. But then what else would you expect with such a title? <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the movie. Fairly sparse indeed. It is mainly background noise and conversation and laughter among hotel guests. The intriguing part is to interpret the exchange of looks between Gustav von Aschenbach, a renowned composer and a thin teenager Tadzio who is seen from time to time by the tables in the hotel dining room, on the beach and in strange and unexpected places. around Venice. They seem to shyly acknowledge the presence of each other at first with a little more than the suggestion of a smile, but then with a strong and fascinating and urgent look. Each viewer will have their own interpretation. The composer lost his own child. Is this behavior an expression of yearning for the child he loved? Is it perhaps a sexual attraction for this frail young man with his stunned, half-feminine look? Could he be discovering some new inspiration for an unspoken musical piece? Who knows? From beginning to end, this film captures the true spirit of nineteenth-century Venice. The elegance of the ladies, the sun loungers on the sand, the children playing in their swimsuits from neck to knee, the brightness of the sunset and a general feeling of satisfaction with the world. While some may think the rhythm is a little slow at times, the film has a generally gentle quality but with a latent indecision between two repressed humans. Be prepared for a sad and beautiful ending.
