I was looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago, and I was not disappointed. I will not bother to summarize the story, as everyone has, but I will say it was just plain fun everywhere. The performances were great as were the music, and the main characters were nice. <br /> <br /> My only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely missing; the film ended very abruptly - in fact, the writing became quite loose in the second half, as if the writers were not sure what to do with the plot. Because the plot was not as important as music and action, it did not really affect the entertainment value of the movie, so that's not as big a complaint as it sounds. <br /> <br /> (2) This is really confusing, but the song the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated back to 1985 when the movie was recorded. The INXS Devil Inside was from 1987 and Are You Ready from AC / DC was from 1990, among other mistakes. This bothers me a bit, since they obviously did a good job, they were able to check the copyright date of those songs to make sure they were 1985 or before. Again, no big deal. <br /> <br /> Oh, I thought of something else that was strange. The members of the Steel Dragon band should be British, but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy guitarist Zakk Wylde played band members, and each had some American accent. That was kind of lazy too, but it was still cool to see musicians playing musicians, so I'll forgive that too. <br /> <br /> I probably could understand all day, but I do not want to give the impression that this was not a super fun movie. I'll probably buy the DVD when I leave, and I'll certainly buy the soundtrack CD simply for the six songs of Steel Dragon (some of which were sung by the Steelheart band singer if you remember them!). The highlight of the film was possibly a big outtake, where Mark Wahlberg is playing a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays "Good Vibrations" by Marky Mark and Funky Bunch. The surprised look on Mark's face is invaluable. Classic rock and roll flick! Score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment
