The Dirty War is absolutely one of the best political, government and well-written TV Drama in 25 years. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb, the writing is spectacular. <br /> <br /> Dirty war reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a nuclear, biological and radiological terrorist attack here on American soil. <br /> <br /> The Dirty War should be turned into a great movie - it's so good! I recommend this great drama to all who wish to know the truth. <br /> <br /> This TV drama reveals how the British Intelligence (MI5 and MI6) attempts to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims - because of England's involvement in the Iraq War. <br /> <br /> The scenes from different parts of London, England, are also spectacular. <br /> <br /> The Dirty War is a must see !!!
