Dark and gloomy ensembles, thrilling music that cuts his spin like a knife, a perfect cast of Broadway's greatest hits, Hearn and Lansbury. This is an exciting theater perfectly transferred to the small screen. Sondheim is the most talented composer of our time and Todd is his masterpiece, from the Brechtian opening ballad to the sombre and humorous Final Act I - "A Little Priest," where Lovett and Todd fantasize about the victims who will end up in their meat pies this game never ceases to excite, excite and satisfy. Betsy Joslyn also stands out as Johanna, even her, since the plays seem a little crazy. Edmund Lyndeck performs a bravado performance as the corrupt judge who covets Joslyn and is the subject of Todd's revenge. Lansbury and Hearn run the show as only two great actors / stars can do. Other musical highlights include Todd's worst pies in London, "Leuven" and Act II, "GOD IS GOOD," and that's a title to describe that production!
