While the film has its flaws, it brings to light some of the problems that come with life in a country that has no democracy. This makes you empathize with the people under such a government and makes you want to learn more about their lives, their struggles and a potential leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. It makes us wonder why our government will interfere in places which are not desired but ignores those who ask for our help.
