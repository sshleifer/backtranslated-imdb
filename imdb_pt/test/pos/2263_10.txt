I saw this movie for the first time on an Alaska Airlines flight, and since then I have seen it twice more. It's simply - and it's simply - one of the best movies in years. I found myself enjoying myself after the first time I watched, but a little clouded over what had happened. After seeing him again a few weeks later, things began to fall into place. It was not confusing, just deep. In fact, the depth of the film may not be appreciated for a long time. For example, it occurred to me only after my third appearance that Sammy Davis Jr Jr (grandpa's dog) is more than a pet - maybe she is the replacement for her late wife. Witness how fiercely he protects you. There is plenty of symbolism, and none of it is sentimental or indulgent, just real. The adventure of your journey keeps the story line in perpetual motion, and even when they arrive, you're not sure if it's really the destination. As the film continues, so does the adventure and I realized that fate was just a starting point. The soundtrack is fun, the scenery appealing - and both decidedly eastern. I could go on talking about the deeper meanings of the movie, but I'm not sure I've discovered all the nuances yet. Besides, it's more fun to do it alone. As much as any movie can be, "Everything is lit" proved to be like a good wine that sweetens over time. I recommend seeing it - twice.
