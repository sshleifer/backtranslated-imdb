The talents of Abbott and Costello shine in the blissfully childish version of "Jack and the Beanstalk." The use of sepia tone and color, music and choreography, music and dance, the crossing of players from one role to another, as well as several other aspects of this excellent film, make obvious the techniques and styles used by "The Wizard of Oz" is being played with here. And that works well for our intrepid pair. There are certain other things involved that make this movie a treat for me ... Buddy Baer, ​​Uncle Max's Baer Jr. "The Beverly Hillbillies", looks like a cop and giant. Pat Costello, Lou's brother, was involved in writing the screenplay. These things help make this movie fun. However, it has its downside. I think the choreography is poorly done. But cute melodies and accompanying vocals help to cut down on sloppy dance numbers. Some of the players, the couple in love (prince and princess) to be precise, are not very good in their craft. But these things are a small price to pay for a completely enjoyable walk through the yellow brick ... er, I mean ... go up the beanstalk.
