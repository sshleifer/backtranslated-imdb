This movie promises a lot, but offers little. The basic problem has to do with the inclusion of Charlotte Gainsbourg's character in this film. Immigrants from Sicily did not need an Anglo-Redhead at all - the film may have needed it, but new citizens certainly did not need it. In my opinion, the decision to include it destroys the continuity of the film. This is particularly troubling as it seems to not only diminish the characters in the film, but also the very history of immigration. The immigrants themselves were heroic figures, fully capable of getting along without having to satisfy what I believed to be a veiled image of the "white man's burden." I wonder if anyone is going to make a film of Irish immigrants, which will include a Sicilian woman as the main character. The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of the cinema - acting, production sets, dialogue, art, film continuity, plot and character development - on a scale of high from 10 to excellent, 5 to medium and 1 to help needs . Both the continuity of the film and the plot rate are less than 1. The continuity, as discussed above, is further degraded by the surrealist ending. Is a film of such important historical importance worth more than a conclusion reminiscent of Marc Chagall? The plot is simple enough, until it seems to get tangled up in the old country for too long, too little time on the ship, and too much emphasis in the end. The character's acting and development are medium-sized, as all the characters are fixed throughout the film, and the inclusion of perfect Anglo-Saxon English almost turns the film into a satire. Where's Groucho when you need him? The sets of production, the dialogue and the art are very good, each with a note 10. The sets in Sicily, the ship and Ellis Island are as good as can be found. Dialogue is wonderful and ethical singing is superb. I agree with Scorsese that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure. It should be noted that immigrants speak of "America", not the "United States" - the ideal versus the political reality. There are many fine art scenes, with dreams of America, gold coins raining and giant veggies among the best. The average index of the left elbow is 5.25, increased to 7.0 when equated with the IMDb scale. Another notion seems to go through the experience of Ellis Island: the tribulations of the lost immigrants were exhausting, and later in 2006, we only had to pay a coyote or boat owner and infiltrate the county in the dark of night, without questions! The film is worth seeing, but it seems that what you see is problematic.
