Jamie Foxx was the epitome of Ray Charles. After a few moments, you stop watching a movie and see a biography played by the great man himself. Ray Charles was really a music genius and the film was excellent. No one will ever or ever write, play or record music like this musical giant. When he passed the flesh, the world lost one of its greatest American heroes. As for the film, the fact that Jamie Foxx received a bag of classical music for college and could play as Ray was an advantage to the director. What could be better than that? You do not have to have a "double" piano and try to split the screen from another person's hands to Jamie's face. It worked beautifully. I loved the fact that I also realized how difficult Ray was. He was not always a good man. You also did not cheer for him. He was a drug addict, a womanizer, and sometimes just a hardheaded man. But I think that's what made him so cool, so I can not blame him for that. I choose Jamie for Best Actor!
