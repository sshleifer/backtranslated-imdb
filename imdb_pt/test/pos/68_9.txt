Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson were great in this movie / musical. Mrs. Andrews's opening song, "Whistling Away the Dark," will always be on the back roads of my mind. The plot during World War I is large and full of suspense. If you are a romantic, you will love this movie. This is a movie that I always like to see again and again.
