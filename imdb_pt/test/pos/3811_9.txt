Little Gus is a delinquent of ten years. He flees from his parents and decides to go on a road trip. Reaching the petal is a bit difficult for him, so he creates a device to help him. Your goal is to win a lottery type card game called Motorama. He has to find all eight letters to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. The dark laughter follows when it becomes the journey of hell. He stumbles upon some demented Lynch characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant who puts his photo on a kite in the hope that God will see it. Later Gus gets a tattoo and an eye patch for the injured eye. He becomes one of the most rebellious 10-year-old boys you can witness on the screen. This is not a kid movie! Look for cameos by Jack Nance, Flea and Drew Berrymore. Be warned, though Drew is on the cover, she only appears in the movie in a dream sequence for a few seconds. Also, the movie gets confused at the end of David Lynch's territory, you may want to watch it a few times. "Motorama" was written by Joseph Minion, best known for his screenplays of "After Hours" and "Vampire's Kiss". So enjoy this fun surreal fun trip!
