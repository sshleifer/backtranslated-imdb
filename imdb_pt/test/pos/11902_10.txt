I was fortunate to attend a 'El Padrino' test show a few months ago in Santa Monica. I was impressed. You do not see movies like that anymore. In Scosese's vein, Chapa deftly recounts the tragic story of Kilo as he maneuvers the streets of Los Angeles to rise above the ranks to become a smuggler. The characters are complex and conflicted. Emotions are real. The action is fast and furious. The acrobatics are expansive. And Tilly is HOT. She has not looked so good since her 'Bound' days. I would recommend this to anyone. It's a fantastic tribute to the epic action movies of the late 80's and early 90's. And for all the pessimists out there? watch again; You obviously had your eyes closed for the first time. Congratulations to everyone involved in the film. I'm counting the days until the sequel is released. Does anyone have a date on this?
