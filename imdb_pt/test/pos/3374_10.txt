I honestly would give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked on 10 to try to compensate for the 5 pages of stupid, unwarranted 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all the acting is good to very good (even Mrs. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual smiling role here, but plays well). Scenarios are perfect and cinematography is consistently appropriate. creepy It's a good piece of morality and there's no reason to explain the origin of the supernatural god / being / alien / whatever is "commanding the show," so I'm glad the film did not try. It is really irrelevant to the story, which is relatively long, but quite convincing and summed up satisfactorily in the end. <br /> <br /> Before you decide that this movie is terrible (or really, anything below ~ 7.5) read some of the dozens of 1-star ratings that hated misspellings, lack of punctuation, and use of letters capital letters. and youth criticism. Maybe the trailer was misleading or something - I did not see it - but some of these reviewers were apparently waiting for Terminator 4 or Saw 5 (one reviewer actually compared this movie to Saw!) As totally inappropriate and unrelated! > Seriously, most of these comments are read as comments on the tube - according to these "critics", this film is very confusing but predictable too, there is not enough action but there is a lot going on, too smart, but too stupid. explains much still leaves much unexplained ... oh - and apparently is a "waist (sic) of time". Consider the quality and source of the revisions before you take them to the heart. I'm afraid that these 1-star children could not understand the phrase "coefficient of altruism" and were therefore totally unable to understand the film's premise (though they claimed they "understood" before explaining how confusing it was!) that these two words mean you will not have trouble understanding (and enjoying) this movie. <br /> <br /> I really wish there was a reviewer reputation system here, so I could be sure to ignore the rating of everyone who gave it. movie 1 star forever. <br /> <br /> See for yourself and enjoy the good presentation of an interesting couple doing an interesting moral "test" and facing the consequences. It's a good time, in my opinion.
