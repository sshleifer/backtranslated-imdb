A very credible and disturbing film portraying the effects of war on the general public, shame gives us a chilling understanding of Ingmar Bergman's beliefs. The absence of color and sound (as in a soundtrack) helps give the film a more realistic feel. There is no soft or hard lighting or a variety of camera angles to give the story a charming or dramatic effect. Everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality. Sometimes the plot was confusing, but perhaps to give an idea of ​​the mood of the characters? as they also now know what is happening or why. The simplicity of the film made it a bit annoying, but I could understand how the director is trying not to glamorize the story and the points. He described the events and hard and disturbing effects of war. At first, the characters were introduced and shown as content with lighter settings and taken very long and long. When the war suddenly struck them, they were much darker and quieter with less intimate shots. Bergman did a good job of allowing us to be consumed by the war itself and presenting an image of it so adequately matched to the war. Although the plot itself was not very impressive, the content of the film was.
