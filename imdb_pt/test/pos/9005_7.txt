As a former Highland Rugby (HR) player, I feel I can answer some of the questions and confusions that have been put forward. I think I can also offer some tips on the club and background stories. Oh, and this is going to be a long post, I can already tell. <br /> <br /> First, people who said that the movie does not really show rugby, has a valid point. The movie is full of problems, people in the wrong places and more. If you want to know how a real rugby game is, you will not have the best idea of ​​this movie. But the thing is, anything less than actually sitting and watching a prominent reel or jumping into a game alone will not be satisfactory. It's Hollywood, not ESPN! Really, how many sports movies really make you feel like you're in the game? Not many that I saw. I think it's important to keep in mind that the film is about rugby players, much more than about rugby. <br /> <br /> Next, Haka is VERY part of Highland Rugby. It's not something they simply played in the movie. To be honest, I do not know how tradition started, but Highland emulates the All Blacks in many ways. The uniform is based on the All Blacks as well. The film did not do a good job of explaining Haka's origins, and to be honest, I do not think that's right. But I can tell you that every member of the team knows exactly where it comes from and what it means. As for the person from China (?) Who said that only a Maori can perform a Haka, I suggest they take a look at the All Blacks and tell if they think they are all Maori. Believe it or not, Utah has a large Polynesian community, and a good many of them like and play rugby for local teams. I'm part Hawaiian. Whenever possible, the Haka is led by a Maori. The team does not do this because they think they are Maoris, they do it because of some of the problems shown in the movie. The concept of unity and "those who have gone before" is a big part of the HR culture, and the message behind Haka for anyone familiar with it supports those values. It is a corner of a boss who thought he would die (Ka Mate), and those around him supported him by saying that he would live (Ka Ora) and boost him. It is not appropriate for me to say how appropriate it is for a bunch of white boys, but that is the ideology behind it and why it is done. "Kia Kaha" is also a well-used team motto, even if the actors have a hard time saying it. <br /> <br /> Also, for people who questioned the ability to play Highland Rugby, I would just remind you that you were not really watching Highland play in this movie. Many of the extras were former Highland players and other teams, but the main characters were all actors. Believe it or not, Highland is indeed very good at what he does and very well respected in the international community. Granted, some years produce better times than others (that's what you'd expect from any sports team), but you do not earn HR's record of victories just fine. The year after my graduation, (1998) Highland was one of 12 teams to be invited to the World Schools Rugby Championship in Zimbabwe. Teams were handpicked from around the world and represented the best of high school rugby talent at the time. Highland obviously did not win first place (New Zealand did this), but they managed to stay in third place in the tournament, defeating the Tonga national champions in their last match. And while American rugby never reaches the level of talent that New Zealand or South Africa have, the third place in the world is also nothing to worry about. Highland also has a tradition of touring New Zealand every few years, and usually returns with more wins than losses. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters portrayed in this movie are based on real people and real stories. I watched this movie with my brothers, who also played in Highland, and between the four of us, we were sure that we would be able to identify almost all the main characters. No one knew a white Rasta. Of course, since it was not a documentary, Hollywood took some liberties, but to tell the truth, not as much as one might think. The film was really very accurate in showing the daily practices of 2 ½ hours, as well as the mandatory personal training for running and bodybuilding. Sometimes he was really running until you vomited. He also showed the service and other staff activities (such as the chuck-a-rama buffet) that were part of the staff. <br /> <br /> And finally the movie, in my opinion (obviously very biased). it was a very good movie. And I think the reason for that is that I watched it as an inspiring sports movie. I do not think it would be a pure rugby movie or a drama awarded by the academy. It was just an uplifting movie about a rugby team, complete with morale, encouragement and a good dose of jokes thrown in for entertainment. I hope I have addressed some of the problems people have had with the film, and I hope you can now take advantage of it for what it was. <br /> <br /> Kia Kaha
