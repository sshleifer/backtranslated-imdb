I have to say that this movie is absolutely amazing. I do not understand why this has such a low rating. It has romance, music, darkness and vampires. Also Stuart Townsend did a great job of being Lestat, the acting was great. Besides, I'm not usually into this song, sometimes good. But I have to say in this movie that the song fits perfectly. If you like dark movies about vampires, this is definitely for you or even if you do not have a love story for it. But all I can say is one word: Incredible! My rating is challenging: 10 out of 10. Anyway, I seriously suggest you watch. I remember not seeing this for years, I watched it again a year ago, and I'm addicted to it again. I laughed a lot. Great movie!!!
