In fact, the nature of the whole series is irrepressibly funny! But it's not always funny ... there are moments of extreme poignancy as the deeper aspects of human emotion are touched. <br /> <br /> Again and again, the series discusses the frailties of human nature and the long life, or in this eternal case, struggle to overcome them. Monkey is intelligent and stupid at the same time, his arrogance and confidence in his own martial abilities lead him to problems in almost every episode. The pig is just gross. Sandy has a philosophical mindset. He has many of the most witty lines. <br /> <br /> The English translation is a delight. "Ignorance can always be improved," says Sandy in his casual manner, "but you can not do anything to help stupidity!" "Who are you?" the group of travelers is requested. "We are three kings from the East," says Monkey. <br /> <br /> This is not just for kids, it's a magic joke for anyone who can suspend reality
