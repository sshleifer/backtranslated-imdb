I saw this for the first time in the 70s on TV and admired its production values, which were high technology for the time. The remastered video is rich and colorful, much more intense than 35mm TV prints. This movie deserves more attention: it paved the way for UFO, Space: 1999 and even Star Wars with its detailed miniatures and cleverly designed gadgets. Of course, the story of an alternative Earth antimatter planet has been recycled a hundred times since Star Trek, but the beauty of this film is its self-conscious European design style: from space engines Rolls Royce to Euro Sec. Letterhead, JFSS or Dopplegangers, as it was called in Europe, is pleasing to the imaginary vision of Europe in space in the shadow of the Superpowers. Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's ambitious epic gets a little boring when the American astronaut finally realizes he's in the land of the dopplegangers, and everything is literally on the slope after the poetically graceful bus embarkation sequence. A mediocre story is aided by a grand and lyrical classic soundtrack of the late great Barry Gray, John Williams of Great Britain.
