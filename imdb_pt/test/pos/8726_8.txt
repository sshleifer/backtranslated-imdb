Goldie Hawn, in 1969, was best known for doing comedy shows on television - in particular, ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN, where she was the laughing blonde girl. She made films before CACTUS FLOWER, the most notable being a feature film by Walt Disney, THE ONE AND ONLY GENUINE, ORIGINAL FAMILY BAND. But CACTUS FLOWER got its character from LAUGH-IN, and (because of a good script by IAL Diamond - Billy Wilder's second partner - based on a piece by Abe Burrows) she was able to develop the character of television so that a real performance was polished. As a result, Ms Hawn won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1969, and her career has taken off for future hits like PRIVATE BENJAMIN and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Although other LAUGH-IN stars have done well on television (Henry Gibson has a recurring role as BOSTON LEGAL judge), only Goldie was able to have a career as a movie star bonifide. <br /> <br /> Goldie's personality would show a naivet√© that would be embarrassing. Occasionally, she would notice it, and she laughed out loud, but sometimes she just did not see the mistake (example: Goldie is introduced to variety presenter Gary Moore from 1950 and is told: "Goldie, this is Mr. Gary Moore. "She shakes his hand and says (to her confusion)," I've always wanted to meet Mr. John Gary Moore! "). But as Toni Simmons is very different. She is desperately in love with Dr. Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), a successful dentist who can never marry her. Julian told her that his wife (with whom he had two children and a daughter) will never give him a divorce. So at the beginning of the movie, Toni tries to commit suicide by gas from her stove. But she is rescued by her neighbor, Igor Sullivan (Rick Lenz), a battling playwright, who invades his apartment and turns off the gas. <br /> <br /> Toni is resigned to living, but she sent a suicide note to Julian. Igor tries to deliver a message to ignore the note, but Julian's receptionist / nurse / assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (Ingrid Bergman) will not stop Julian's work schedule to get the phone to him when Igor calls. Instead, Julian finds the letter and the races at Toni's apartment, only to find her alive. When Igor supports her story that she has tried to kill herself, Julian realizes the depth of her love and decides that he should marry such a woman. Unfortunately, Toni swallowed Julian's lies and believes in his wife and children. You see, Julian has no wife and children. Since Toni is a firm believer she can not marry a man who would lie to her Julian is stuck on a tree limb fading. Julian comes to solve it, causing Stephanie to pretend she is Mrs. Winston Stephanie opposes it at first, but alone, on her first free Saturday, she confronts Toni in the store. on which Toni is. They talk, and Toni notices all the strengths of character and personality of Stephanie (and as Stephanie has her two nephews with her, Toni thinks they are Julian's children). Toni tells Julian that they have to see who the man Stephanie is going to marry. Thus, the lie begins to spiral to Julian, Stephanie and Toni. Soon, a lover is given to Stephanie in the form of Julian's friend and the patient who is interning Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston). Greenfield is so despicable (Stephanie hates him) that Toni thinks he's unworthy of Stephanie. <br /> <br /> And so it goes, with a complication (the most caused by the well-intentioned, misinformed Toni) following another to completion. The script is full of first-line situations and phrases of effect (example: Julian rewards Stephanie for lying about marriage, buys two records from Toni's store. He gives Toni a stolen mart, but she decides to send it to Stephanie. With Julian's card, Stephanie is very happy to receive the marten, but she does not say a word about the nature of the gift she received - when she thanks Matthau, he says the thought that she would like Horowitz - namely, Vladomir Horowitz. thinks Horowitz is the furrier's name!). Bergman must have enjoyed filming, since several scenes show that the earth's glare was a trademark for her in later films to the 1940s. But there was also the resemblance to the success of her comedy of 1958, or INDISCREET. There, Cary Grant lied to make sure the duo focused on the romance of their novel without having to think about marriage. When Grant's lie is revealed to Bergman, she decides to lie to convince Grant that she was making him a horn. Here, instead of being the passive lover believing that Matthau is telling the truth, Bergman carefully tries to get Matthau out of his mess for little white lies, only to find that one leads to another to complicate everyone's life. Bergman is seen as a good woman who becomes part of the problem despite trying to be part of the solution. <br /> <br /> All leaders have a good performance, particularly Bergman, with all commercial effectiveness at first, but gradually recovering it. sexuality. Matthau is delightful as a man who finds a useful lie is an impediment that can not be left aside. The supporting cast, especially Weston as Harvey, and Vito Scotti as the UN ambassador who really has horny for Bergman. It was a clever comedy, and a great way for Goldie Hawn's career to progress.
