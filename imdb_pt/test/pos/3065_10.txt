Like all other Mel Brooks comedies, Men in Tights is hilarious. But seeing this as an outrageous comedy, I think many fail to realize that the reason the film is so funny is that the characters themselves are so well interpreted. Elwes is the ex-British nobleman of spoken speech, Lewis is an eternally irritated king (I hope it is worth all the NOOOOOOIIIISE!), DeLuise is a FANTASTIC godfather, Roger Rees is a worried and cynical sheriff .... The actors and Actresses are so faithful to their parts that the jokes flow with ease. Yes, we've seen this kind of comedy before, but the only comedy to achieve a better character development, in my opinion, is The Big Lebowski. Very, very funny.
