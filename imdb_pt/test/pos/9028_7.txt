This is not a serious movie, and it's not meant to be, but it's not as bad as some of your reviews, it's title, and the first ten minutes lead you to wait. <br /> <br /> The plot is very silly, but it adds to the joyful fun and excitement that goes through the movie. The characters are touched with sympathy, and although they engage in a typical teen angst, they generally avoid the unhealthy sentimentality usually found in this film genre. <br /> <br /> Unusual in London, friendly with the geeks, this is worth watching if it's on; if you want some ironic nonsense, and do not mind suspending your disbelief.
