<br /> <br /> This movie has really awesome action scenes. Humor and action are well mixed, although the intensity of the film does not hold out until the end. The last scene is a slight anti-climax in terms of action quality and surprising explosion of the scenes that preceded it. The humor does not seem to be as ridiculously clumsy as in many other Hong Kong movies, and this film is of a totally different class from the more American action comedies of recent years. Lau Ching-Wan acts as a typical and intuitive police hero who mocks at the invalid orders of incompetent police superiors. The film's dialectic is built upon the coolness and superhuman cruelty of the drug gang, humiliating the police force while providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with a variety of machine guns. Leaving many corpses in his wake. Yu Rong-Guang is especially impressive as a super cool and ruthless gangster in this action from Woo, where the tough guys are really tough.
