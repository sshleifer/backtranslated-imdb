Sublime - perfect - profound - a true lesson about the idealized meaning of life. We get fully involved in the lifetimes of Martina and Phillipa and Babette. Their yearnings, desires, resonant sacrifices long after the movie is over. Seeing this years ago - as he was gaining a notoriety in the audacity of his subject - half of the movie being a single dinner - the audience was "oohing and aahing" as some of the courses took their toll <Playing in glorious fashion, laughing at the reaction of the when they were totally seduced by the gustatory pleasures introduced by Babette, and were totally taken aback by the turn of events at the end of the film. Afterwards, watching the movie years after my own twists and turns, I realized how deep the film is. In this vision, the tears flowed freely. The film's meditation on the passage of time and the way it uses a seemingly simple story to comment on life, love, art, and generosity is really something to love.
