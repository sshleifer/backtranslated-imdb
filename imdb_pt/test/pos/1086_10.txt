This is by far one of the best movies that India has ever done. The following are the highlights of the film ... Wonderful direction, cinematography and editing, the editing is very smooth and the changeover time is excellent. <br /> <br /> Film shows the life of Bombay Police and their difficulties, never gets annoying or nice. <br /> <br /> Incredible minds acting for lead actor Nana Patekar. One can certainly expect him to be nominated for the Best Actor Award for Academy Awards. <br /> <br /> Controlled violence. Violence is controlled and the film does not become a bloody mess. <br /> <br /> No stupid music like the usual Indian movies. <br /> <br />
