I finally saw the real reason why Peter Boyle became famous. It was not being the monster in "Young Frankenstein" or being grumpy Frank Barone in "Everybody Loves Raymond". For younger people who only know about TV, try the movie, that makes Frank look like a saint. "Joe" is Boyle in his role as best actor and, as someone mentioned, probably gave the inspiration for "Archie Bunker" in "All In The Family". I think Boyle even went back to "Joe" to play Frank. (I say this because I noticed that the hold of both "Joe" and Frank Barone are alike.) <br /> <br /> I did not know anything about this movie when I checked out of the library, I just met Boyle and Susan Sarandon was featured. Yes, Susan looks great here and, to a young actress, a great starter role. A young hippie wants to be, who escapes from his parents home and lives with, the last one lost in a drug-induced hippie drug, who also sells as much as he buys. <br /> After an almost fatal overdose With many pills, she is hospitalized while her parents get their things, her mother does not go to the smelly apartment but her father. While the father gathers his things, the boyfriend comes home and the two exchange words and then the father does what we later hear Joe say he would like to do with a hippie. <br /> <br /> Joe is filming his Talk about how he hates different cultures / races, hippies and a list of other people. When he says, "I'd really like to kill one of them," the father (trying to look like he's joking) says, "I just did." Joe almost buys, but then it's funny. Later, when the police are in place and the story is in the paper, Joe realizes, he was not joking. Instead of preaching the rich guy for money through blackmail, he actually kind of blackmails him. Just wanting him and his wife to "meet" him and his wife. Long story short his association is strange, but after Sarandon learns what his father did, the fund is at risk of falling out. <br /> <br /> As all this unfolds in the end you will have to watch for yourself. Although you are over 35, the end is something you do not expect. Unless you've seen the movie before, of course. Again, I recommend it mainly to those who have not seen it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars for Boyle not only playing someone completely opposite to his nature, but for what he will show others that he was more than just a TV and movie comedy actor. (END)
