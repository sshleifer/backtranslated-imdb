My criterion for measuring the ability to watch a movie is if I get angry. If I start to change my position and notice that my butt is sore, the film is too long. This movie did not even come close to being boring. Predictable in parts, of course, but never boring. <br /> <br /> All other military branches had love notes written on them and saw their recruitment levels go up, why not the Coast Guard, too? They are definitely underestimated until the day your boat sinks. <br /> <br /> The movie was fun and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as the aged man who does not know when to stop. However, I was very impressed with Ashton Kutcher's performance. I've never liked him, never watched any of his TV shows and I've always considered him immature ... well, punk. In this movie, he does a great job! He is well on the way to having leadership status. I think the film we were shown must have been a preliminary cut or something, because about 2/3 of the way, the film material got too grainy, the sound level dropped and the microphones were seen falling all over. Also on display were representatives of the film, looking for feedback from the audience - particularly about the parts of the movie that we did not like. <br /> <br /> ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER: The feedback I've given to a few lines in the beginning. Kevin Costner comes home to see his wife, Sela Ward, packing up and leaving. He says, "Maybe I should be the one to leave." And she replies, "No, you do not know where anything is in this house; I should be the one to go." That does not make sense: if she knows the layout so well, Costner is right, he * must * be the one to leave.
