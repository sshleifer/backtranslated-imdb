I read "Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl" when I was in high school, and found myself completely absorbed in her story, and also in the Broadway play of her life in the Secret Annex. <br /> <br /> However, I'm a bit perplexed about how people perceived your diary and her as a person, seeing you as a little saint or taking a message of hope to the world. I do not think that was the original intent of his diary. She wrote mostly to herself, despite having made some strict rewrites before the occupants of the Secret Annex were betrayed, with the intention of being published one day. <br /> <br /> But I never saw her as a saint or as a messenger of hope ... but as a very talented writer who could express her thoughts very well and very entertaining in a diary. No doubt she was a very engaging writer and possessed an extraordinary talent to express herself fully with words. You really know her well through your diary. But the importance of his diary lies in the fact that it is a testament and an important historical document of proof that the Holocaust happened. <br /> <br /> It also brought the tragedy of the Holocaust closer to home. lose someone with whom we could put a face and personality known at such a young age ... literally having her young life torn from her and the other occupants who were murdered in the Holocaust. It is a fierce indictment of the systematic Nazi murder of more than 6 million Jews, and this should not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> But it's sad to me that your diary is being misinterpreted as anything beyond that. When I look for hope, I have the Bible ... the world's first most read non-fiction book. God's Words in the Bible are eternal ... but Ana's diary is a diary of a young woman under extraordinary circumstances, and that's it. She is not someone to be worshiped or idolized because she was a common girl with many defects, who possessed an incredible talent as a writer, and who died at the age of fifteen years of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. She was a victim of the Holocaust, and as this excellent documentary witnessed so vividly, she was Hitler's most famous victim. <br /> <br /> Beyond the history of Anne Frank ... the stories of family and friends and the survivors of the Holocaust were captivating, vivid and powerful. I especially enjoyed the testimony of Miep Gies and I admire that she is still strong and alive today. The testimony of Hannah Goslar was also very interesting. And I also enjoyed listening to Otto Frank. But I also agree that the young woman's moving image with dark hair and large, familiar eyes at the end was particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> Another thing about the Holocaust that I kind of disagree with the documentary is that I do not believe it's just a matter of discrimination, but something deeper and deeper, and that was just an act of pure evil. Pure evil. Nothing but pure evil. <br /> <br /> Excellent documentary of Anne Frank and the Holocaust that must be observed.
