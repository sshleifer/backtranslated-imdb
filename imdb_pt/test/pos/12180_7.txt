In Queen of The Damned, Akasha (Aaliyah) was sexier and had a greater and demanding presence, she just caught her attention and attention. now the movie had flaws, like the failure to explain Akasha's past. What I also did not like was that the film did not really explain or show more than the relationship between Lestat and Akasha was or was how the role of Akasha (Aaliyah) was somewhat limited in the film and she did not. appear until the 2nd half of the movie and then on top of that, death (Akasha) came 2 quickly. But I liked how Akasha fought back when the ancients tried to kill her because in the book the last fight between Akasha and The ancients were rather boring (they killed Akasha in 2 seconds). Akasha's head was wiped out in 1 second and Lestat became the biggest punk in the world. <br /> Aaliyah played very well with Akasha and Stuart was perfect as Lestat, they could not have chosen Akasha or Lestat better. "REST IN PEACE AALIYAH"
