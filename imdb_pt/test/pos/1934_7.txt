One of the last films directed by Lionel Barrymore, "Ten Cents a Dance", starring Barbara Stanwyck as the dance girl "Barbara" in his sixth role. Stanwyck looks pretty "little window" in this, and opens with her being chewed by the dance hall manager. Then comes the rich guy Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez) who wants to get her off the ground. (Cortez and Stanwyck made three films together in the 1930s.) So she meets Eddie, who is very different from the dashing Carlton. The writer, Jo Swerling, had worked on some bigwigs (it's a wonderful life, guys and dolls and took it with the wind), so I was surprised that the characters and script were so common. The story begins to get more interesting midway, and is VERY similar to "The Bride Walks Out" of 1936, also starring Stanwyck .... T.B.W.O. is much smarter, but also tame, due to the Hays code attack ...
