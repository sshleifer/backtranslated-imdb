I saw this performance on TV and recorded it. My daughter played it over and over again. I borrowed at work and everyone just loved it. It's just brilliant physical comedy. Bill made an appearance here in California, (he was working and living in New York) and performed Regard of Flight on stage. I was able to take my daughter and her girlfriend to see this brilliant performance. <br /> <br /> Bill received a federal donation and my daughter wrote him a congratulatory letter and Bill was kind enough to write him down and put a picture. <br /> <br /> People ask me, and I can not decide if he's a comedian, actor or clown. In fact he is all three. I really wanted this to be on DVD, my tape is lost.
