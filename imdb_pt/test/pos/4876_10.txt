I also attended the RI International Horror Film Festival and I can easily see why this movie won the best of the show. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST is a crazy joke of Horror, Comedy and beautiful scenery. A tale in the past of strange events. An increasingly widespread disease, with an overwhelmingly annoying side effect of exploding people's heads, brings a young apprentice teacher; Stefan, to investigate. Throughout his travels, he decides to briefly deviate and once again ask the hand of love from his long time in marriage, only to once again be sent to his extremely stubborn father? Along the way "out of town" he stumbles upon a sick girl on the road and hands her to Dr. Maitland, (brilliantly played by Vincent Price as an actor: Edward X Young.) Who fills Stefan in the Evil one foot. Only Dr. is insulted for calling the teacher and only receiving a boy in training. Nevertheless, Stefan ends up being much more than an ordinary spectator. Horror Icon; Tom Savini portrays the greatest religious torment; Come on, John. Scream Queen; Ingrid Pitt comes out of retirement to give a stellar performance as Anna. Many handsome and talented supporting actors kept the story together and helped move it effectively to climax. <br /> <br /> The Black Religion and the top, but fun and sometimes very original, bloody scenes play heavily in this movie. Film of homage to the hammer. This stylish movie goes back and forth between flashbacks, surreal worlds, dreams and the reality of the character. <br /> <br /> Horror and Gore aside; This is also a very funny movie! The comedy, the humor of the cheek and the cheek and the dark comedy raise their heads in the dark plot. As others have stated; This really is like three great movies in one. Very fun and original.
