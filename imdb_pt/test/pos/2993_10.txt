Well, what you know, I was painting my house today and a song from Elton John came on the radio, which immediately took me back to that movie I saw in 1971. There's so much time and so far. Ten years later, I took a ride through the interior of France, and I would definitely like to see Michelle. The movie is probably not very sophisticated by today's standards, but it's worth it, but it looked pretty cheeky back then. A few years later, a sequel was made with Michelle living on a grand ascent in Paris and Paul coming back to meet her, as well as the life they had changed, the film was very sad. The original was still fabulous, and if you can get a copy, rent it, remember to take it and treat it kindly. I note that Americans can be quite modest, so note, it contains possibly disturbing scenes and themes for Middle America.
