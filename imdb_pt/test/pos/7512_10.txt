This is one of the biggest movies ever made. Brilliant acting by George C. Scott and Diane Riggs. This movie is disturbing and extremely deep. Do not kid yourself believing this is just a comedy. It's a brilliant satire on the medical profession. It is not a beautiful image. Healthy patients are killed by incompetent surgeons, who spend all their time making money out of the hospital. And yet, you really do believe this is a hospital. The producers were very careful to include real medical terminology and actual medical cases. This movie really reveals how difficult it is to run a hospital, and how things were already bad in 1971. I loved this movie. P.S. - I noticed that the incompetent surgeon and wheel salesman played the role of head of the company at LA Law. The young doctor touched Lou Grant. I also noticed that the record nurse has appeared since in Becker and other shows.
