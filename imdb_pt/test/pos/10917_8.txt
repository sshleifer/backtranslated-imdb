I've seen it again after not seeing it since it first came out (in '97), and it still made me laugh out loud. It's cleverly written, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are both perfect in their roles, and if you can look at Bob Newhart in this movie and not laugh, you're more man than me. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the scenes in which Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, where Kevin Kline listens to the tape "How to be a Man", and post-wedding scenes (almost) with Joan Cusack are three of the funniest scenes in Any Movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the last scene is an excuse for a happy ending, but ... few movies are perfect.
