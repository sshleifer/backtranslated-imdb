This film, with just two characters, takes you closer to these two people, the interrogator and the prisoner, than most movies take you to any character, though well crafted. <br /> <br /> The sheer confusion, terror, and pain that the character of Madeleine Stowe suffers is deeply disturbing, as is the sadistic and charming interrogator of Alan Rickman. <br /> <br /> This movie is very possible, and reaches a shocking climax, the effect of the film as a whole You are sitting quietly in the end. It will haunt you for a long time.
