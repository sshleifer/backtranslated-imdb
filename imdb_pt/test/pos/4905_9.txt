"Four Daughters" begins as another clone of "Little Women" melodrama. A single father with four eligible daughters with musical talent has his hands full trying to keep them in line and guide them in their courtship rituals. What revolves around the movie is the sudden appearance of a new Hollywood star, some critics say the first anti-hero long before James Dean grace the big screen. From the moment the dark and mysterious figure of Mickey Borden (John Garfield) appears at the gate of Ann Lemp (Priscilla Lane) splashing self-pity and philosophy in the rest of the cast, "Four Daughters" becomes much more than a girl Despite of Garfield being the main reason to watch "Four Daughters", there are other flashes of brilliance to take advantage of. Hungarian director Michael Curtiz, later responsible for jewels such as "Casablanca" and "Mildred Pierce", points to certain images with his camera (aided by the director of photography Ernest Haller of fame "Rebel Without a Cause") that persists in the minds of viewers, for example, the raucous gate that Ann's first suitor, Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), swings so merrily becomes symbolic of mood swings and affection for those who use it. <br /> <br /> That Garfield offers outstanding performance is obvious, but the rest of the cast remains with him most of the way. Underestimated Jeffrey Lynn plays his part to perfection, as the neglected pretender whose love for his beloved Ann never fails even when she is with another man. Claude Rains, somewhat abused as the father of the four young women in adulthood, gives a beautiful picture of a set on the head of a passionate family that gets lost in the confusion. The three Lane Sisters, already famous for their musical abilities, become talented actresses, interpreting their parts well. A number of supporting actors, including Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, May Robson and Eddie Acuff, make it all believable. <br /> <br /> How opposites attract is part of the trick to touch the fast imagination of the viewer. Ann is the eternal optimist, even when she and Mickey are discouraged. She always looks on the bright side and, like so many people caught in the pliers of the Great Depression in those days, she saw prosperity just around the corner. Mickey recites a whole list of bad things that happened to him seeking companionship in his misery of Ann, which Ann refuses to do. Mickey hopes to come out with a lightning bolt, hitting him dead as he turns the corner of life. Mickey has few talents as a composer; Ann has the talent to spare as a singer and musician. Ann is great in beauty; Mickey is great in personality in a distorted way. And the differences continue and continue. How all this is reconciled in the end is an important part of the movie, not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Watch "Four Daughters" for John Garfield make a movie starring debut. The only time he was better came seven years later when he again hypnotized moviegoers with one of the best performances of all time, as Frank Chambers in "The Postman Always Plays Twice," alongside the equally charismatic Lana Turner. But also watch "Four Daughters" to pick up important elements that can be lost if too much concentration is put on the star of the show.
