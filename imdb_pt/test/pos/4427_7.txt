Video Vault By Shawn K. Inlow <br /> <br /> My Architect: The Journey of a Child 2003 - Nathaniel Kahn Not rated: 116 minutes Vault rating: 7 <br /> <br /> What a thing to be without a father . "My architect: The journey of a son" follows Philadelphia filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn as he desperately searches for the answers of his father, the renowned architect Louis I. Kahn, who died 30 years ago. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn died at a train station in 1974 and left behind more than one family. The funeral, when the filmmaker was only a boy, was, let us say, an unpleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> We find that Nathaniel only knew his father in passing, from his sporadic visits with his mother, whom, they tell us, he loved deeply. This film is about a boy looking for his father and maybe himself, visiting his work, as if the magnificent structures kept some secret. <br /> <br /> To be sure, Louis Kahn was a talented architect, but "architect" is a cool word. The man was a large-scale sculptor who spoke of his craft in terms of silence and art. Among his notable works, lovingly explored in the film, are the Salk Institute (1965), The Kimball Art Museum (1972) and the monumental Capitol Complex in Bangladesh (1983). Part of the film in which Nathaniel first visits Dhaka, Bangladesh, finds the job, but not the man. <br /> <br /> The film benefits greatly from having too many man-made footage while working in New York. and as a professor at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania. Many of Khan's contemporaries and collaborators also help shape the filmmaker's ghost-father. <br /> <br /> Even so, the viewer does not seem to reach a particularly satisfying place. The answers that Nathaniel Khan is looking for seem empty. Not good enough. <br /> <br /> In scenes where the director meets with his half-sisters, both from different mothers, one can feel the tensions of the years, the scorns and sorrows. You can expect them to explode in anger, but only the camera saves them from hostilities. Each of these children visibly lost something. <br /> <br /> It may be noted that Khan, who looked like a driven perfectionist, never got rich. Instead, he became remarkable. It was as if he sacrificed his family for his art. This is an incredibly sad and great thing. <br /> <br /> 28 April 2005
