Do you like "Dead Man do not wear Plaid"? What about "Top Secret" and "A Chorus Line"? Well Müllers Büro is a fantastic Melange of all three, as unlikely as it may seem. Very funny "tongue in cheek" Movie Noir hommage with awesome songs and great dance. You have to have some weird humor for this movie, but it's really worth seeing it. I voted a nine, If the end were a little more logical, it would have reached ten. That's how good this movie is.
