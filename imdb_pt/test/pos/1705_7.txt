I have mixed emotions about this movie, especially in relation to its precursor, "An American Werewolf In London". That movie had funny moments, it was still more a tale of terror than anything else. This updated version, now set in Paris, does not have this "edge" at all and is simply not in the same class .... but there are some good things for him that the first movie did not have and overall it's still fun to watch. So, "puritanical werewolves" apart, most of whom think that this film is pure junk compared to the London version, I'll still give decent notes, since I do not care what others think. I liked it, although I agree that "London" is better and I prefer that version as well. <br /> <br /> The first 30-40 minutes of this movie are strictly played for laughter, including a hysterical scene with a "balloon" in a restaurant. Also presents the female protagonist played by Julie Delpy. I do not see enough of this actress. She does not seem to make as many movies, or less than I listen here in America. This French actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the movie earned points by having her in it, and she looks great. <br /> <br /> When the horror starts, it can get scary and the special effects are good. . I also liked the lack of profanity in this movie, unlike the first one: no f-words and no Lord's name in vain - amazing! <br /> <br /> However, there are many sexual observations and there is a scene with a guy getting no bar tied to a cross that was blasphemy to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal that is not appealing to a middle-aged guy like me either. This movie is much more geared toward people in their 20s if it helps anyone. <br /> <br /> It's fun ... just do not expect it to match the first movie.
