Iron Eagle has always been one of my favorite movies a long time ago. It looks like Topgun, but with a different plot and (many people will disagree with me here), in my opinion, it's better than Topgun. <br /> <br /> This film has incredible scenes of dogfighting when the fighters are buzzing. through the air. He also has the song "One Vision" from Queen playing in the background, which in my opinion is a fantastic song. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the Iron Eagle was very good, but the sequences were rubbish. <Br/> <br />
