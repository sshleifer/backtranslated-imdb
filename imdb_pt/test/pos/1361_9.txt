Golden Boy is, in my opinion, one of the long-sleeved / lost longings of all time. A sexy comedy about a young man searching to find his nitch in life and he stumbles on all sorts of odd jobs that somehow has this pretty sexy girl who finally falls in love with him but he does not really noticing it! It is truly something that you can easily lose if you name it, but once you see it ... it will fall to the comedy / foolishness that lies inside. Truly a crime that produced only 6 OVA episodes and pilot film were made. However, being unique as it is. I'm surprised you survived to produce many. If you want a good laugh, with high quality anime that is (100% free of computer graphics), check out this anime. Boy who someday can save the world ... or maybe not.
