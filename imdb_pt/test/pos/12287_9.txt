I do not want to ruin the movie for anyone, but that mimics the reality of life in many ways, and if you're really honest with yourself, you'll agree to it according to at least some of the scenes. The acting is not only believable, but convincing in a way that endorses the characters. Besides, it's funny, without trying too hard. <br /> <br /> And, yes, I do believe that a sequence is justified here. Watch the movie, you'll understand why. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, especially if you like movies that have a real message.
