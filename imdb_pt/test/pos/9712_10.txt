The sequel is exactly what you expect it to be. And it's good enough that everyone who wants to watch it should make you happy. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that will win an Oscar. But it takes what made the Jackass TV show and the original film a hit, and that increases a little. It's funnier, more brutal and more disgusting than the original. And I loved every minute of it. <br /> <br /> The original has had some notorious maneuvers, and there is at least one trick by which this movie will be remembered. You will shudder, shrink, look away and laugh very, very strong. <br /> <br /> In any case, you probably do not need to read this review, or any others, to know if you will like this movie. , unless you've never heard of Jackass.
