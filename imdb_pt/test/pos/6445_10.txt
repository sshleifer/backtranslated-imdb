I saw this movie as a kid and I fell in love with it. It has a sweet and sensitive story. Something that children can appreciate. I loved as much as a child I had to meet for my daughter. It's definitely a movie I watch with kids. It reminds me a lot of the story of a Disney character like Pete's Dragon and Mary Poppins. Both because of the live action and cartoon features, but on its premise. It is also a good story to show the children that if they tell the truth, they can be trusted and the adults will hear them. I think all kids should see and have fun. It's a break from the bad taste movies that many children watch these days. It has all the lovely qualities that many of today's movies do not have.
