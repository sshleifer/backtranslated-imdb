This is an excellent film, full of complexity, themes and great dialogue. The characters are well-designed, with Phil the greatest loser of all time. <br /> <br /> Adam Haddrick's character is the crudest thing I've seen on the screen since Alec Guinness played Adolf Hitler in 'Hitler: The Last.' Ten days. <br /> <br /> I just wanted everyone to get away with it. But without paying too much attention, there are some situations that you just can not lie about.
