This trash version of `Romeo and Juliet 'passes in Manhattan these days. Romeo (Will Keenan) is a member of the Quebeka family and violent, and Juliet (Jane Jensen) is a sexy girl (with beautiful legs and breasts) and bisexual of the Capulet family. The eschatological situations that this romantic couple will face are very entertaining. Despite being a cult movie (even exhibited at the Rio de Janeiro Festival), it is not recommended for all audiences. If the viewer is a fan of previous Peter Jackson films ('Braindead', 'Bad Taste'), 'Toxic Avenger', 'Body Melt' and another garbage film, he will surely love this movie. Otherwise he will hate it. Since I belong to the first group, my vote is eight. <br /> <br />
