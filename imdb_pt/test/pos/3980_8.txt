This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a bit sexy without having all the women in the cast showing off their breasts, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' on each line. I have seen Justin Long appear in many movies in the last few years, I figured with the right paper he could leave. (The Mac commercials do not stand up.) This movie can put you on a fast track to list A. The rest of the cast also did their job perfectly, this is a great little movie with a good message. (But you do not have to buy the message for fun.) Lewis Black is, as always, hilarious, and Blake Lively is a new beauty. <br /> <br /> Take a few hours and see this movie, they will not have been wasted.
