I did a screening of "SISTER HELEN" at the Sundance Film Festival and did not know what to expect. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by the people in this documentary. Sister Helen is an incredible character !!! The filmmakers captured the essence of Sister Helen's incredible soul and led me to an unknown world. I was completely satisfied with the journey and was completely taken aback by the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie speaks for those who want a second chance in life.
