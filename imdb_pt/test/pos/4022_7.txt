Brown returned to his role from the previous year (in "Slaughter") for this follow-up film. In the original, he had avenged the death of his parents by eliminating a large mafia organization in Mexico. Here, he is the one to be pursued (retaliated against) by a money launderer portrayed by McMahon. When the first assassination attempt fails, Brown is back in action, kicking the gangster's ass all over the place as he tries to protect his new girlfriend, Hendry. Although the original film has generally been a better and more coherent film, it offers all aspects of exploitation in much heavier doses, making it more enjoyable for fans of the genre. In addition to a rather sad opening on horseback and an absolutely deadly car ride down the city street at night, this movie clips together at a very fast pace. Every few minutes, one or more of the following appears: drug use, sex, nudity, shooting, murder, or some other action. Brown is his usual, dependable and amiable self, aided by his incredible physical presence, who goes a long way to covering up any rigidity in his acting. McMahon is a riot! With sunglasses and hair cut in half (!), He is shown distributing orders to his gang of bandits and is listened to making love in love with his furry fool. Seeing Johnny Carson's companion in a role like this is a perverse emotion. Stroud makes an impression as a man of intense and racist success, while Peters adds only a touch of class as a police detective who calls for Brown's help. Unfortunately, no mention is made of Brown's original helpers, Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown now has a girlfriend (Hendry) who is quite nice, but without the voluptuousness and personality that Stevens had before. Williams makes a scandalous turn as a pimp who apparently can pick any girl from a bar and make her an instant member of his harem. The cinematographic and general direction is less polished than the first film, but this one has an impulse and a sense of danger that exceeds the sensation of the original. The film spends a lot of time in the sewer of organized crime, drugs, prostitution, and other addictions, but it maintains interest in the creativity of its action scenes and the now surprising lack of political correctness. A strange note: A key support player in the first movie was shown being shot to death, but appears here in a different role.
