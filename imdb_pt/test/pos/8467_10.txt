This movie is a mysterious but interesting movie. I'll tell you why it's eery later in this review. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting because it was the first film to contain sound. No, it may not be a one-hour, forty-two-minute movie, no, it may not contain great action scenes, but it's still a wonderful movie for me. This triggered a whole revolution, if you will, of sound films. This may be a little strange to see, knowing that everyone in this movie is dead, I can hear the voice of a man at the beginning who is no longer on earth visible, and that the sound is broken and broken. > <br /> I recommend this video for everyone to watch. This created movies as we know them today!
