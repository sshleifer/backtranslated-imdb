There are many people in this forum who have obviously missed the subtle wit of this series. <br /> <br /> This show is great because it's a hilarious parody of yourself. Guys who are self-proclaimed stallions have a fair chance to convince us of their seduction skills until they "hit the field" just to expose their complete lack of "game" on national TV? It's absolutely hilarious and the guys who are really skilled are extremely enticing to watch as they effortlessly seduce the pretentious women who frequent these trendy nightclubs! <br /> <br /> Celebrate the charisma once deserved and mocks douchebags when deserved. Either way, it's always fun because, unlike other dating shows, it perfectly captures the ineptitude and authentic excitement of a "pickup truck." I highly recommend this show to anyone with a sense of humor.
