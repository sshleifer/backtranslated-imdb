I am very happy that I do not live in a small American city. Because whenever they show me a small town in the United States, it is filled with all sorts of monsters, among them flesh-hungry zombies, evil aliens and sinister ghosts are more harmless. In this film, a former doctor, who has just given time for his wife's accidental death in a car accident, directs his steps to the nearest town - he must never have seen in his life a movement about small towns - be purgatories. And, of course, as soon as he gets there, all hell will break loose. He meets a blonde girl who, of all creatures, most resembles a cow, both in facial expressions and brain functioning, and at the same time falls in love with her. But there is a minuscule disadvantage, she is already married to a very small drug dealer who in one minute cries woefully not dead. To know what came out of all this, you should watch the movie for yourself. I'll just tell you that it's somewhat reminiscent of U Turn by Oliver Stone, but it's a way down on all the artistic properties.
