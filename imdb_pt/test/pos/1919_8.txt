This is an excellent documentary on a story I had not heard of before. The first non-stop solo race in the world took place in 1968-69 and involved a handful of riders. It is a truly fascinating story about man against nature and man against himself. The story centers on Donald Crowhurst, the tragic figure in this story. The film elegantly combines interviews with filming that were filmed by the sailors themselves on board their boats. The story is very suspenseful and sad as we learn the details behind the story of Donald Crowhurst. This is one of the best documentaries of recent years. She has real human emotion as men face this almost impossible task of navigating the world without stopping on their own.
