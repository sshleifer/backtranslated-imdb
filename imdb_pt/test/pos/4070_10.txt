That's exactly what I expected from that. Relaxing, humorous and fun. The couple of actors was amazing, as was the selection of scenes. I personally recommend this. It is the kind of film that can be seen by the whole family at the same time without anyone feeling uncomfortable or bored. This cute movie will make you smile and laugh too. And the action scenes are tasty. Classics of modern American comedy. And very well done.
