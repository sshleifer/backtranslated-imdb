This movie is simply beautiful. It's as funny as hell and as old as the hills. The acting is superb and it's fascinating to see postwar Britain and how we behaved in those days. This seems to have been a pre-runner for the St. Trinians films (given the connections of Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford - there is also a young George Cole there who appeared in many St. Trinians films) but I do not understand the connection. It was shown on BBC4 recently after a biography of St. Trinians creator Ronald Searle, however I missed enough of the biography to lose connection to this movie. Anyway, a great movie by itself and something that should be preserved for all time!
