Another great Hollywood Golden Age musical! I liked this movie story about a trio of friends who are artists in a small nightclub that is far from Broadway and all its brilliance. Although not the big time, they are very satisfied with their lives and with the small club in which they act. Gene Kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of his dancers, Rita Hayworth, who gets some attention when given the opportunity to be on a magazine cover. The problem begins for Gene Kelly as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town. Phil Silvers plays one of three friends and does a good job. Of course there is music and dancing. A dance performance by Gene Kelly stands out. He is walking down the street alone at night and sees his reflection in the shop window. His reflection soon begins to dance along with him in the streets, great cinematography. Do not miss out on this great entertainment.
