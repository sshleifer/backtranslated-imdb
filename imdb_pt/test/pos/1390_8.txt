1891: Stalwart, a morally honest physician, Lieutenant Claude de Ross (solid Claudio Cassinelli) and several other shipwreck survivors disembark on a remote tropical island that is ruled by the ruthless and sadistic Edmund Rackham (superbly thrown by the deliciously viscous fist of Richard Johnson), who lives on the island with Amanda Martin (a successful performance of the sweeping Barbara Bach) and her dishonest biologist, Professor Ernest Martin (a fine portrait of Joseph Cotten). In addition, Ross discovers that Professor Martin has control over a dangerous breed of beasts being exploited as slave labor by Rackham. Director / co-writer Sergio Martino reports lively and absorbing story at a steady pace, offers a tantalizing evocation of the exuberant and remote tropical setting, does a specialized job of creating and maintaining a spooky and mysterious atmosphere in the third creepy opening, even more things with a nice line in the dry mood, and enacts the stimulating action-packed climax with considerable ease. Although the central premise is obviously inspired by "The Island of Dr. Moreau," the story, however, receives a great deal of freshness and intrigue because of Martino's ingenious fusion of elements as diverse as Voodoo, the lost city of Atlantis. Mondo's destructive climatic volcanic eruption, buried treasure, unscrupulous genetic experiments, and even some exciting harsh fights between Ross and Rackham during the exciting conclusion of a completely dynamic, imaginative and often immensely fun whole. The sound that plays in the rugged cast qualifies as another substantial advantage: Cassinelli makes a nice hero, Johnson teaches his succulent villain with throbbing haughtiness, Bach ranks as an attractive maid in distress, and counts on favorable contributions. Beryl Cunningham as the sinister voodoo priestess Shakira, Franco Iavarone as the superstitious Jose, and Roberto Posse as the moody Peter. The sumptuous widescreen cinematography of Giancarlo Fernando offers a wealth of stunning visuals, while Luciano Michelini's pulsating tribal punctuation hits the hot spot. Amphibian humanoid creatures are also very ugly. An extremely entertaining film.
