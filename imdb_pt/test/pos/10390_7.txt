Even if the story is light, the film flows so beautifully and its look is so peaceful and poetic that it could almost carry the whole film. <br /> <br /> The film consists of four interconnected stories, all about different aspects of attraction. between man and / or woman and how often it is ethereal. Your true desire seems to always be something that they can not hold, it will flow like a handful of sand. <br /> <br /> I thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the woman was most unattainable, the more the man wanted her. It parallels your deep love for God, which is infinitely out of reach but never closer to your heart. <br /> <br /> A very good movie. 7/10
