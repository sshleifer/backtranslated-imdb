With a movie starring The Twins, Ekin Cheng and Edison Chen, no one should expect a movie masterpiece. What you get, however, is a fun movie that is easy for the eyes and the brain. There are a lot of Hollywood-style vampires (there are no Chinese leeches here), pretty girls, beautiful heroes, and occasionally very funny moments. And Jackie Chan. <br /> <br /> Of course, kung-fu depends a lot on wired and CGI work. Of course, the script recalls Blade. And sure enough, the whole case is instantly forgettable. <br /> <br /> But for a truly cinematic piece, it would be hard to find something better.
