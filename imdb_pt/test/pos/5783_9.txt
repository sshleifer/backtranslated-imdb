The End of the Suburb, as it should appeal to citizens in general and to mass consumers, will likely become a status of cultural reform. The film uses super-cynical analyzes of authors, politicians, and social philosophers about the paradox created by suburban life-especially in the postwar era. <br /> <br /> What we have created in America is a place with "none of the amenities of country life and none of the conveniences of urban urban life." This is the recipe prescribed for the suburb, and the film's focus is on the unique idea of ​​"Oil." Basically, in the more general sense, that the world is near or in full production of oil, and when we realize this in full, major changes in lifestyle will be in force either by our interest or forced violently by us for a quality of even living the slum dwellers of Calcutta could not describe to us. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, the end of Suburbia will suck the viewer flush into his gut, creating a sickening feeling. This is about to happen. It is a dark vision of our inherent way of life. Ambivalence is particularly at every relevant critical analysis of the film. I foresee many unprepared viewers slandering the film as smugly liberal propaganda - like a movie by Michale Moore. What they do not consider is that such a reaction is too normal when such a message is so incredibly difficult for the vast majority of the masses to live. <br /> <br /> This is the truth, and as a How do you study Urban Planning, I can tell you that it is better to prepare now, because the small chance we have to maintain the quality of life in this decreasing reservoir of resources is disappearing faster than a race of people afflicted by the Black Death.
