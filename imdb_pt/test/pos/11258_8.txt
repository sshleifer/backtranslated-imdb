I was not planning to watch wasted when I saw MTV's preview, but as I had nothing better to do or watch on a Sunday night I watched. Wasted was not Requiem for a Dream, but it was a very good movie considering it was made by MTV. One thing that drew me to see that it was Summer Pheonix, the sister of the late and wonderful River Pheonix, watched. I suppose the talent runs in the Pheonix family because she was good and so is Jaquien, although Niether is the River. Nick Stahl also gives an excellent performance as a drug addict athlete. There is not much more to say about waste. It was a dark and depressing dark look in the lives of three small city junkies. I recommend it to anyone who likes the subject. 8/10
