One of the best occult-oriented horror films of the seventies. It's brave, exciting, scary, surreal here and there and at times even very clever, which can not be said about many of those films. I can not help but see some poignant symbolic and metaphorical points in the society of the seventies and generation of things from the time in which this film was made. The screenwriter is obviously cooking while also presenting some old "crypt" scenes. With a job well done by a creative director, the result is fun and thought-provoking. The simple but effective ending shows especially how these things are handled properly by those who can. The excellent cast was virtually unknown to me except LQ Jones as the moody but funny sheriff and Strother Martin as the city doctor. Martin, not surprisingly, always steals the movie. With that voice and ability, he's one of the biggest moviegoers, for me anyway. What an actor! <br /> <br /> So, it's a bit of a mystery to me because this movie did not get much recognition. I think it would deserve an almost equal place in the canon of occult horror alongside Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. A hell of a movie!
