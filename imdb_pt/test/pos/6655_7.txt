I got into this movie thinking that I would not like it, but hoping to be surprised, but this, like the movie, turned out to be bleak and hopeless. But do not get me wrong, Minghella offers a great epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to accept this adventure and accept what it is exactly, they will not be disappointed and will be one of the best films of the year in their opinion. The acting is of high quality and will probably leave with a trinity of Oscar nominations for Law, Kidman and Zellweger, although the few Portman scenes may be the most powerful in the film. The sites are beautiful and Minghella has an eye for a good shot. <br /> <br /> However, for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure rather than go willingly may leave disappointed mostly due to Minghella and his adaptation. The film is so gloomy that it makes for what I consider to be an epic punching bag, which is a movie that tries to hit hard with emotion, but does so so extreme and so often that during the movie I did not have the movie . time to invest emotionally, or not recovered from a previous blow, and has become unreal and therefore very difficult to really care, not to mention predictable. Overall, Cold Mountain almost made me too exhausted to even think about the positives of the movie, since all I remember is death, which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters.
