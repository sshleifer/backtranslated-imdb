Could not. <br /> <br /> From the cutting-edge dialogue to super-special effects, this film was a joy to contemplate. The immediate feeling of Antarctic bitterness, affinity with the characters built on the basic level before the actual action heats up and the cunning final combine to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable films in the world. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>> Who can forget the perfectly timed dialogue and the chilling special effects? Special effects that are far more impressive than the computer generated images we can see today. I have at least discovered that some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film are how we were introduced slowly to each member of the team, and how they all had some distinct character traits. This was not just a bloody-come-slasher-nonsense horror movie. This movie had feelings. Emotion. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend this movie highly enough. I still have to see anything in your class that comes close to matching, let alone improving, the almost perfect acting and time used in this cunning polymeric talent of cinema.
