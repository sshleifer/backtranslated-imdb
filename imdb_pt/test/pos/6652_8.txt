It's been some time since I've seen Cold Mountain, I know I enjoyed it immensely. Although this occurs during the last days of the American Civil War, it is not really a war movie. It's more of a novel / drama. And it works. Mostly because of the performances. I do not usually like Nicole Kidman, but I liked it here. I thought she was very convincing in her role. I liked Rene Zelwegger, too, that I do not usually be a Judge Law It's good, as usual. In the support cast, there are some great supporting presentations, also too numerous. There are also some breathtaking scenarios in the film. And there are also lots of really cool musical pieces. the story is sad and tinged with tragedy, but it is a well-made and well-told story. For me, Cold Mountain is an 8/10
