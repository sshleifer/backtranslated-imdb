I'm originally from Brazil ... the sad thing about this movie was the exploration that was done for that kid. They told his life story and he never got a "penny" from that movie. Fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through this lifestyle in Brazil. Sad ... but this is the world we live in. It is about making money not saving lives. The question is: Where is Fernando today? Most likely ... dead. We tend to want to live in this "Disney fantasy full of bubbled life". When someone comes to the plate to help ... comes the higher power and says, "What do I get out of it? Where's my cut?" I want people's conscience to speak!
