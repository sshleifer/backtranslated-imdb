I spent many years studying all the great directors, like Kurosawa, Lean, Fulci, Lenzi, Deodato, Peckinpah, Kubrick and I admire them a lot. My favorite movie is Once Upon a Time in America. <br /> <br /> I've only recently become a D'Amato fan, and while he was not a master of horror, his films were extreme whether they were soft core, hardcore or extreme. <br /> <br /> Porno The Holocaust is now one of my favorite movies, the way your photograph is brilliant and the music is captivating. Joe D'Amato was not a master of terror, he is not Fulci or Bava, but as he was a master of erotic literature, no other director could film erotic movies like him, he never tried to do movies out of the genre. <br /> <br /> Live Joe D'Aamto-Master of Porn and Erotica!
