I turned to this movie in the middle of the night and almost jumped to the right. It was only because there was nothing more in it that I decided to watch. In the end, I thought it was great. <br /> <br /> An interesting storyline, good characters, a clever script and brilliant direction makes it a great movie to sit and watch. This was, in fact, the first I had heard of this movie, but I would have been happy to have paid to see it in the movies. <br /> <br /> My IMDB rating: 8 out of 10 <br />
