A fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit confusing and the acting of those who dub the voices is almost universally bad, but the premise is engaging, the fighting scenes are quick and flashy and the movie is often entertaining. It's a pity that the story is so destroyed. There are some places where I had no idea what happened, it was almost as if five minutes had just been cut and you were suddenly in the next scene without knowing how you got there. The film is bad at explaining things and some things do not make much sense, but the film moves with ease and its shortcomings are hardly recorded. Not a great movie, but definitely fun.
