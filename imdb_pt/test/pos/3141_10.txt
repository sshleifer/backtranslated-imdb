One of the most poetic narrative films of all time, WAGONMASTER is still a difficult film to enjoy immediately. I love this movie, but I recommend seeing some of John Ford's other westerns before taking a look at this. The first time I saw this I was 18 and I had not seen many other Westerners, and I hated it. I thought it was incredibly annoying. I kept waiting for something to happen. It took several years for me to love this picture. First, I fell in love with Westerns in general - the traditions, characters, landscapes, ways of speaking, etc. - and this made me realize when I saw WAGONMASTER again that a lot is happening after all. <br /> <br /> I was also simply a more experienced viewer at that time and I learned to appreciate the visual narrative and to hear what each image was telling me. WAGONMASTER is a very visual film of one of the most visual directors working near the pinnacle of his career. <br /> <br /> The film is a celebration of a lifestyle, and its subject is more emotional and inward than other Ford westerns. In fact, this is not as accurate as saying that, on the contrary, it has much less external action than other Westerners. (The other westerns have outside action and inner thrill.) It beautifully puts its Mormon pioneers in the context of nature. There are many pictures of animals and children - not for any superficial narrative purpose, but to illustrate this idea. That's why the movie can be called a poem. It is not about superficial history (which almost does not exist) almost as much as about an emotional idea, and it can understand this idea through composition, editing, sound and music. In fact, it can be argued that this is a purest way of making films, because the images directly express the film's emotional idea, rather than having to first serve a "story." <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance and allow it to exist on its own terms, not the terms of other westerns or other movies.
