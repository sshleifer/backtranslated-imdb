The film starts with a promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows down considerably. Billie "Buckwheat" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his first scenes. When he is left behind in the boat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly painful. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected, the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another touching moment. As another reviewer mentioned, I was also worried about the big dog choking on chicken bones! Since Spanky and Buckwheat are at Marshall Valiant's house, Spanky tends to interact primarily with adults and the chemistry of children is essentially lost. The Old South / Huck Finn scenario really does not do much about the plot, except allowing the kids to stay out of the house. Ralph Morgan is the most engaging adult, but the other roles do not really have much substance for them. Louise Beavers manages some funny moments with a Yankee soldier at the end. <br /> <br /> The villains are not very villains and the lovers are not intense enough. However, I think it's worth seeing if you're an enthusiast of our gang, if for no other reason than the odd curiosity of the whole play. I give seven stars because despite not being a great movie, it kept me busy all the time and curious to know what would happen next.
