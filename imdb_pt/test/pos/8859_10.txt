John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original, giving him the utmost respect he could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to keep the paranoid core of John W Campbell Jr.'s tale. The secret to the success of this version is the unbearable tension that accumulates as the group of men suspect each other, the tension of literally waiting to be taken in takes on a tightening of fear. Carpenter manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery needed to keep the movie going in the right direction. Whether it's a horrible scene or a "what's in the shadow" sequence, the movie for me is a perfect fusion of horror and science fiction. The dialogue is perfect for a group of men who try to keep him under duress, and Carpenter's punctuation is a wonderful and astounding wrist-beat that still brings the sense of disgrace and paranoia spreading through the film. The cast is superb, a solid set of actors led by Carpenter, favored by Kurt Russell, while the effects used give the right amount of impact needed. But above all, it is the end that is the crowning glory, an end that does not yield to the norm and is unbelievably fit for what happened before, lets wait and see what actually happens, 10/10.
