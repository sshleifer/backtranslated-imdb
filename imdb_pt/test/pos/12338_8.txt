Since Jason and his gang got hold of horror movies around 1980, most of all horror movies involved a group of hormone-laden teenagers being cut into pieces with a focus on cut and not suspense. <br /> <br /> This little movie is different. Made in the early '80s, it does what every good horror movie must do - bring your worst fears to life while you sit knowing these horrors are coming. So you make those horrors boil, just do not make it a lesson about the biology of the massacre. <br /> <br /> The story shows Meg Tilly long before she had a short life, fame beginning with "The Big Chill" and then back to obscurity in the early 1990s. Meg plays a rejected adolescent who is dying of willingness to enter into the good graces of some classic girls. They say she can be part of her small group if she stays the night in a crypt. The evil girls intend to scare her and make her leave the crypt, giving them a double reward - further tormenting the rejected girl and having an excuse to reject her. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the famous occultist Karl Rhamarevich died. Bizarre death shortly after claiming to have discovered a way to return from the grave and, upon returning, command great magical powers. Her daughter does not believe this at first, but she hears a tape about her father's experiments, which includes the successful animation of small dead animals and their plans to leave the grave with the power to animate a larger game and extract more power of these animations. She also discovers that she may have inherited the power of her father and may be the only person who can stop him if he really rises from the dead. I think you know where this story is going, so I'll stop here. Did I mention that the magician was buried in the same crypt that the character of Meg Tilly is spending the night? <br /> <br /> I'll mention that the commercial DVD that contains this movie seems a little run down compared to what you'd expect from a movie that was made recently. I saw it on TV in the mid 80's and I remember it looked better than that. The problem is that the original negative of the movie was never found, so the DVD had to be created from an impression. This means that it comes complete with dirt and scratches. <br /> <br /> This is worth checking out for any horror fan. It was an independently made movie and an example of the kind of unusual thing you could find on TV in the early hours until the infomercial turned that schedule into a vast wasteland around 1986. Only TCM Underground broadcasts this type of movie .
