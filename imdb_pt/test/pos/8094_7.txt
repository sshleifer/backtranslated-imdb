Written, produced and directed by Charlie Chaplin, it is the anti-Nazi propaganda piece of the great actor, stomping Adolf Hitler. Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, the dictator of Tomania, as well as a Jewish barber who is Hynckel's Spitting Image. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen Hitler's newsreels will recognize the odd resemblance of the caricature. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie began slowly, with a typical chaplin focused on the adventures of the Jewish barber in World War One. Having never seen this before, I must confess that after the first 20 minutes I was imagining the reason for all this fuss. But the film takes a breath fast. There are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of the "Hynckel-ism" to make the point of propaganda. The film's climax is a brilliant anti-Nazi speech given by Chaplin at the end of the film. As good as Chaplin is in this movie, I thought the whole thing was stolen by Jack. Oakie, playing the dictator of "Bacteria" - "Benzino Napaloni". Our first look at Oakie shows how well he studied his subject - he had Mussolini's arrogant posture. The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni negotiate about the fate of "Osterlich" left me in stitches. <br /> <br /> This was a very good movie, and worth watching.
