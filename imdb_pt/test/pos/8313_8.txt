Tomorrow is another day is not the sequel gone with the wind, but a story of lovers-on-the-lam and surprisingly alert and moving as well. For a supposed hacked relegated to B-less features like The Devil, Felix Feist proves to be able to fill his work with unexpected and inventive details. Steve Cochran leaves the prison after 18 years for killing his brutal father when he was only 13, and now he is still a hesitant and clumsy teenager operating within the heavy frame of a man. Lonely, he visits a 10-cent dance palace and falls in love with Ruth Roman. But the sudden shooting of her police boyfriend makes the ill-fated couple fall on the road, ending up, like the Joads, in a California migrant workers camp. <br /> <br /> Roman is the revelation; in his best known role as Farley Granger's Bride in Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train, she was poorly and underutilized. Here she modulates persuasively from a blonde taxi-dancer to sacrifice her wife and future mother (and a brunette, on top of it). Cochran is almost as good as, disconcerting the suspicion of a wounded child and the explosive reactions of a sub-socialized man. And the final, though not convincing, is welcome. Along with they live at night and Crazy Gun, tomorrow is another day exhibits a redemptive sweetness and warmth that belies their pedigree movie noir.
