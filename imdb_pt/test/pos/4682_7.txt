My reaction to this remake of "The Italian Job" is probably hopelessly confused with the events that occurred in my life when I saw it; This is the first movie I saw after having just gotten a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for recycling. The money was still tight, but I no longer had to choose between watching a movie in theaters and paying bills (or having lunch), and the sense of relief and gratitude I felt at the time was enormous. As a result, my enjoyment of "Italian labor" was probably disproportionate to its real value. <br /> <br /> Still, I got used to DVD a few weeks ago and watched it again, and I still enjoyed it immensely. I've never seen the original (though I've heard it's an absolute classic), but its modern counterpart is eminently watchable if you have a taste for modern production values ​​applied to plot and themes from old movies. <br /> <br /> What initially led me to this film was the soundtrack - the IMO Don Davis writes some of the most flexible, textured and enjoyable soundtracks in the world. IJ opens with a cunning, witty and pulsing arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonicas, brush work and quiet moments - it conquered me completely from the initial seconds. And the whole movie is like that - I have not heard that kind of soundtrack music playing since Stewart Copeland left the police and started making soundtracks for movies like "Rumble Fish." There are at least a dozen reasons irresistibly marked here, along with some remakes of pop songs that range from "all right" to "inspired." For people whose soundtrack matters, this movie is a delight. For the film: I can take or drop Mark Wahlberg, but he's right here as the protagonist, and the film does not ask him to do anything he can not do well. He's the weaker "main" actor in the movie, but that's because the rest of the supporting cast is so strong, especially Donald Sutherland in part. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron have turned into solid, fat-free performances. Norton seems to be mostly calling him (there are rumors he did not really want to be in the movie), but he's still natural, even with a power of 1/2. My complaint with the cast and acting is with the character "Wrench," who appears to be a male model pretending to be an actor. His part seems to be getting into the movie, and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast (though you may blame it a bit for the size of the part and the nature of the character who "walks later"). If I were a cynical guy, would I ask who the actor slept with to be put into that film in such a supernumerary role? No, never happen ... <br /> <br /> Production figures, camera work, acrobatics, plotting ... everything works very well and Gray and his production team pull things together perfectly (with the exception of the " Key "character, see above). <br /> <br /> The dialogue has a light and pleasant touch that rewards your indulgence, and there are several major and minor satisfactory payments along the way. (My favorite moment - when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he just lost the element of surprise.) Wahlberg passes Norton's cold cock with his right hand and then asks him, "Were you surprised?" Hmmm , maybe you had to be there ...) <br /> <br /> Of course the film requires a certain level of "disbelief suspension" to work, but if you just relax and move on (and not think a lot on the subject, mechanics of breaking a safe underwater, or the likelihood of someone being able to hack and successfully manipulate LA traffic through a laptop, etc.), you will have a fun ride. <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job": It's a light summer fluff, but it's very good for what it is, and it does not try to be anything else. Not good enough for an "8", but I would give it a "7.5".
