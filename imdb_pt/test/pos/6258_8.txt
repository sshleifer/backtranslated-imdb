This little movie is reminiscent of several other films, but manages to maintain its own style and humor. "Troll" and "Do not be afraid of the dark" come to mind. The suspense builders were good, and just crossed the line from G to PG. I especially liked the non-clich√© choices with the parents; in other films, I could predict the dialogue verbatim, but the writing in this film made better selections. If you want a movie that is not surly but gives some chills, this is a great choice.
