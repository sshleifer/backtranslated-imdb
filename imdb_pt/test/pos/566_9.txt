with this, I carry the same obscure weaknesses that all of us, unfortunately, have: lying, deceiving, laziness, the list goes on. <br /> <br /> However, as an American, I was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist today. the police force as it is reflected with the horrible detective and police of the Duval County Sheriff Department with the murder of a white tourist and a young black of 15 years accused. I shook my head, ashamed that the detectives had been protected from their abusive work, while the life of a young man depended on the balance of justice. <br /> <br /> However, there is also a history of hope with our judicial system and how poorly paid public defenders wielded their weapons (the pretense of irony) and forced the truth of the detectives. I wanted to fly to Florida and tell anyone with influence what great public defender they have in Duval County; these lawyers care about the "little" man and, more importantly, about justice. <br /> <br /> The other story is about faith and family. Compliments to the accused's family and their strong Christian beliefs (submit any dedicated religion) and wonderful family values. I hope they win the lawsuit against the Duval County Sheriff's Department. <br /> <br /> Bravo for justice !!! Bravo to the face !!!
