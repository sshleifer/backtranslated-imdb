Marigold is by far the best "odd" take on Bollywood I've ever seen. (I did not grow up with Bollywood, but I've seen a few hundred of them now.) I'd say it leaves Gurinder Chadha, Mira Nair and even Merchant and Ivory (from Bombay Talkie) almost in the dust. Willard Carroll, the director, really loves Bollywood, and he has the self-confidence to let us know him - there's humor, but no bow, ironic detachment, no "of course I do not really mean it." As Jerry Lee Lewis would say, he "understands", and so he can let us have too - the joy of a cinematic Bollywood experience, along with touches that are provided by a Westerner who enters the role of storyteller. It's a story about a caustic, bitchy, beautiful American movie actress B (she's only been in feature-length films like Fatal Attraction 3) found in a Bollywood movie other than the one in which she went to India to be in (Kama Sutra 3 folded her stalls while she was on the way, apparently because her producers are now in prison). Salman Khan, a real-life Bollywood meg-star, is the dance master of the delightful written-on-the-fly movie in which she was drawn ("Is this before or after I went blind?"), And through of the sweetness of her moderately psychically gifted character, she learns more than how to find her inner ecstatic dancing ability. <br /> <br /> The strong start gives you both Bollywood - a super-energetic troupe of dancers in front of the Taj Mahal (both funny, a familiar to the Western viewer as well as providing the high-velocity musical thrill that we love it in a movie in Hindi), and Salman on screen from the start - not Bollywood waits 20 minutes for the hero. He has an Indian costume embellished with fringes of Western movies in the style of Kit Carson (all in white). The character of Ali Larter's actress is pleasing to the Western viewer - she is blonde, which is "traditional" to a "white" person in a Bollywood movie, and cast visually understandable - but she is a sturdy girl, not the ethereal kind of blonde who is usually introduced to us, and she is a total bitch more or less three-dimensional, taking a profane and abusive attitude. cell phone conversations with a US boyfriend and agent. <br /> <br /> We also have scenes of women who are having problems with each other going out to a bar to deal with them - the ability of people not to talk and having emotional conversations is traditional in Hindi movies, but rarely we see a lot of anything going on between women (apart from the discussion between mother and daughter about the groom's choice for his daughter), let alone "strangers" - unrelated people - let alone bar-going. So the spirit is the same, the details are new, and I was completely delighted with it. <br /> <br /> I only saw it once, in a previous presentation, with the presence of the director, a great speaker and questioner. respondent - he and Salman became "good friends" in doing so, he loves India, he has plans to make a film of the Wizard of Oz in India. I can not get too deep into the songs when I see them only once, except to say that I liked them all. They range from a happy parody of Bollywood's number in the movie within the movie - women's costumes, with Leghorn hats and shell-studded bodices (it's a beach scene) in fluttering dresses - are worth the price of a ticket. Alone - for a beautiful romantic song reflective of many scenes in a saddest and most serious part of the film. <br /> <br /> Mix of Hindi and English in music, and it works. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan gets a lot of credit for my openness to unusual projects - this and Jaan-and-Mann - and a good judgment on which ones to include. Carroll said he was full of suggestions and ideas along the way, and totally fine (ie not narcissistic at all) whether Carroll accepted or rejected - clearly just a professional who loves being involved and collaborating.
