I was very lucky to see this movie as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival in 2005, a few days ago. I must admit that I am very partial with films that focus on human relationships and especially those that focus on the tragic side of life. I also love most of the Scandinavian film offerings, there is often a particular quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn. The character building in this film is extraordinary in its detail and depth. This is despite the fact that we find a large number of characters, all with very personal situations and personal places in their community. The audience at the end of the performance was very quiet and thoughtful. I'm still playing some of these scenes in my mind and I'm still struck by the power and importance of them.
