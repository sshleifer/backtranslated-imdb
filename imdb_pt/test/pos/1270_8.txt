Christopher Nolan's first film is a "budget-less" black-and-white film about an unemployed writer who starts following strangers, which in turn leads to robbery as well as violence. It's very good. <br /> <br /> As in his last film Memento he does not present the story in a linear way. Instead, it bounces a bit, so you end up being sucked in to try to put it all together, and the seemingly random early shots take on importance as the movie progresses. This style also means that the twists are much more effective. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing if you have the chance (especially if you like your later work and / or Film Noir)
