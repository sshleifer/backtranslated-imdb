"The Missing Star," which competed for the Golden Lion at the 2006 Venice Film Festival, is a film that, when one thinks, the first adjective that comes to mind is: intense. Intense glares, intense sequences, the intensity of this film captures the viewer from the first scenes in the ironworks in Italy (I could not recognize the city, maybe Genoa or even Naples), although the pace is quite slow. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Buonavolont√†, the male protagonist, and with him, the whole public, sees a China completely different from what a common Westerner imagines: a horrible building with about 800 flat owners inside, skyscrapers, desolation, haze, scrapers and cranes everywhere but also the beauty of the Yangtze River Kiang, which will soon become a large lake because of the controversial dike that will clean many cities. China is a country under construction, but under all these colossal public works, there is still poverty, backwardness and unjust laws. <br /> <br /> We can relate more easily to this story because Gianni Amelio, the specialist director, chose two phenomenal tracks: Sergio Castellitto, a well-known actor in Italy, and the Chinese Surprise Tai Ling, an unknown girl who gives an interpretation as intense as that of Castellitto. <br /> <br /> The movie is not perfect, there are some flaws here and there, but that does not mean it's a mediocre movie. Try to see this.
