Excellent multi-level exercise: <br /> <br /> - showing the spirit of colonialism not yet over in France <br /> <br /> - more generally the boring mentality of superiority of all Western peoples <br /> <br /> <br /> - a renewal of the espionage and suspense movies: OSS 117 is uneducated and stupid! <br /> <br /> The good idea is that despite all these messages, it's a funny movie, lots of jokes and gags, very light and bright. <br /> <br /> Special mention for Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing. Would you like to know how it will be enjoyed in the US? <br /> <br /> It seems to be a hit in France, so probably an upcoming release will come.
