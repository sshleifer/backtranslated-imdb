On a scale of 1 to 10 "Suicidal Sweetheart", I received 11 from myself and everyone else on this display. The image was incredibly funny. I said to my wife "It is obvious that this man walks on water, but through a bed of fire, that is a little too much." This is one of the best combinations of comedy, satire and uses of insinuations I have seen since Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein." I can not believe this photo has not been chosen by a large studio. <br /> <br /> This audience of the "Film Festival" was sophisticated and managed to capture all comic, visual, spoken or implied insinuations. The characters are real and the combination of a great script and a great cast was obvious. Max and Grace are real people with real issues that are treated regardless of the chances of success. It keeps you smiling while you're serious and laughing with all the indirectly brilliantly built humor in this production. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a "must see."
