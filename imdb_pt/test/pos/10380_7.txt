NVA combines eastalgia humor, military comedy and teen movie. Although it is, in a way, typically sentimental as a German film, I think it's a great and very funny movie. You will not only laugh at the NVA, but you will also have a bit of a perception in the East German military of the late 1980s and how young recruits, as well as professional soldiers, experienced the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Democratic Party German. Republic. <br /> <br /> You will like the NVA if you liked the Sonnenallee (another film directed by Leander Hau√ümann), but not necessarily if you liked the Good Bye Lenin that is much more serious and less obviously funny. <br /> <br /> Acting is acceptable. But look at former boy band Kim Frank who has only two facial expressions: natural and shocked with saucer eyes!
