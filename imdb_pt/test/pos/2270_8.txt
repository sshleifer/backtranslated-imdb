Actor-turned-director Liev Schreiber (The Sum of All Fears) makes an above average screen version of the novel, Everything Is Illuminated, by author Jonathan Safran Foer. This tale of travel and self-discovery is highlighted by performances of strong set and sharp direction with a plot that enriches and illuminates the soul. <br /> Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who saw his grandfather, Safran, dies. Jonathan has the peculiar habit of picking up small objects and small souvenirs from life and sealing them in plastic bags to display them on his wall. Safran gives Jonathan an old photo showing a young Safran alongside a beautiful girl who saved her life many years ago. Thus, Jonathan begins a long journey to locate this mysterious woman in Ukraine, not knowing if she is still alive. He asks for the help of a young and daring tour guide named Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his grandfather (Boris Leskin) to take him to his goal. At first, the journey reaches dead ends and false leads, but as the group approaches the target, the men find themselves amidst the ruins of a dark chapter of history, with memories of war and past ghosts of a non-existent city. There, they find their respective destinies and they will be changed forever by what they learn. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have been directed by someone who knew how to get the most out of their actors. Sometimes the film is spoken in Russian and looks like a foreign film. The title itself is a game of self-discovery. This is a thoughtful walk of a man in his past, and his past ironically involves his companions; Jonathan's obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather as well. It is a long-term tale of attachment and the guilt that must be borne throughout life. At the end of the film, all these characters experienced life-altering events that will permanently entwine their lives. This proves that memories can be powerful in traumatizing and also purifying the soul. It's also about someone's legacy and how others see an event or a person in the past. Alex finally sees his grandfather in a completely different light. Even our perception of these individuals will have changed at the end of the film, which is a tribute to a story that is well told. <br /> <br /> The story is deceptively simple. It works as a road trip movie (as The Straight Story) combined with an interesting mystery story. It really involves many layers of emotions and subplots that go from the past to the present. The ending is a bit surreal with your déjà vu feeling. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood (Sin City) has chosen a wide variety of roles from his plunge into the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Here he does a good job with what is essentially a minimalist paper with little to show. Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin do better than Alex and his grandfather, respectively. Even the grandfather's dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (that's right) is funny as a fiercely loyal fellow. <br /> <br /> Paul Cantelon's score is a compliment to the film's thoughtful nature. Editing is effective, because the images of the past and the present are linked and transposed effortlessly. The cinematography of Matthew Libatique (Gothika, Requiem for a Dream) is suitably glaring and lifeless, with some stunning images of the war and its aftermath. <br /> <br /> The coincidences that come up during the last half of the movie are good drama, but are a bit overlapping. We never completely understand the whole background story of Alex's grandfather and what his motivations are. Likewise, Jonathan's empty stares and the lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a peculiar man. Sometimes the film seems a little depressing and depressing as more horrible revelations are exposed. But these are minor criticisms of what is a good, introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of recall and closure. Schreiber not only directed, but adapted the script to that meritorious slice of history, is a tribute to his talents and promising potential in the future.
