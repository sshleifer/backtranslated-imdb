Dracula (John Carradine) visits Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), who believes that everything can be cured by science. He wants Edelamn to cure his vampirism, "Edelman agrees. Then Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) appears looking for a cure to turn into a werewolf. Frankenstein's monster is discovered too, but it does nothing. <br /> <br /> Very ambitious plot for a Universal horror movie of the 1940s. Trying to heal monsters for science is, in fact, an interesting idea. Also this movie has beautiful scenarios (LOVE the castle for the doctor lives), tons of atmosphere, is very well directed (great use of shadows) and has very good special effects. <br /> <br /> The acting is all good except for Carradine - he tries, but I could never accept him as Dracula. Also Lionel Atwill appears playing (as always) the chief of police. This is almost forgotten and ridiculed as a stupid movie, but I think it's very good. It's also the last time the Universal monsters were taken seriously - the next film was in 1948 in "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein". It's a great movie, but the accent is more in the comedy. <br /> <br /> The only real flaw here is that there is a lot of plot for 67 minutes and some gaps in logic: Why does Dracula try to bite the adorable Miliza (Martha O'Driscoll) when he is being healed? And why (and how) does the doctor take Frankenstin to his castle? Still these are minor complaints. Recommended.
