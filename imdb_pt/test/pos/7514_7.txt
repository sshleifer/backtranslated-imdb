I may never have to go to this hospital [or hospice, if I want to be politically correct] [which butt coined this asinine phrase, anyway?], For anything other than instructions on how to get out of the city. George C. did a masterful job playing the burned out, worked cynic who came to the conclusion that his life was a waste, but is unable to change his environment or conditions, even when given a golden opportunity [which probably was not as golden anyways]. I got several laughs from this brutally black comedy, yet at the same time it was sober and often chilled to the marrow because I fear this atmosphere permeates most healing homes even as I write.
