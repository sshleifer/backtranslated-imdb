Where this film is true to Burroughs' vision, it is excellent; where he departs from Burroughs, is superb. It is a family tale, looking for a father for a real and emotional orphan. Lambert speaks of one of the most distressed lines in the entire cinema. "He was my father!" is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the most cynical critic. It's not a perfect movie - the notorious excess of dubbing McDowell's voice by Glenn Close is inconceivable and only explicable in terms of a very British mistake - but an excellent masterpiece if false and a noble farewell to Sir Ralph Richardson.
