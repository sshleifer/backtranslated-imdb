It's a sad state in corporate Hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking the routes you see in movies from day one. I literally had no idea how this movie was going to end because he went to the left when I expected him to do it right, zigzagging when I expected a zag, etc. This could easily be unraveled into generic or depressing suspense thriller White Trash Drama, but it remained a whole stroke of its to the end. It's a sad story, though. Not because of what happens to Alice, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her down this path. <br /> <br /> The plot has a quiet dignity that is normally reserved for the theater, but the rhythm could use some squeezing. Anyway, it's a very good movie, and for some reason I suspect the sour grapes of those who marked this low.
