This movie is funny and sad enough I think it's kind of true. If you love Office Space, then you'll love this movie because it's another Mike Judge hit, but it's nothing like Office Space. I told everyone to see this movie. I only wish it had been in more theaters, so I would have gotten the recognition I deserved. I love this movie and would love to see more of Mike Judge. Luke Wilson is also what makes this movie what it is. I'm so happy that I will not be alive in the year 2505, because if this movie is true, we're all in a lot of trouble. I just hope that more people see this movie because I know they too will fall in love with it.
