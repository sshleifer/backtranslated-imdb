From a perspective that it is possible to make films that do not offend people with strong moral values, this is definitely worth it. This is the second consecutive Bruce Willis movie that can tell its story without nudity, without humor, profanity or gratuitous violence. (I mean, of course, the Sixth Sense.) Both films are involved on more than one level. This is suitable for children too, although, as others have pointed out, it is not a children's film. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed that the time travel device that runs this plot is never explained except that we know that Russell himself starts him as a 70-year-old. Besides, why does his dying mother need to go to school to pick him up when he wins the fight? Why, if, as his older self says, he has to fight with this child again and again in the next few years, his mother does not have to come and always get him and why he does not learn to kick the process. I also found the score quite annoying and not always appropriate for the action on stage. <br /> <br /> Good use of the red plane as a metaphor, however.
