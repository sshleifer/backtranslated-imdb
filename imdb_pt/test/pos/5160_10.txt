I did not really see this coming. Roy Andersson had pointed me out, I'm the perfect sucker for a static camera (live King Borowczyk!) And I was laughing hysterically for the first fifteen minutes of the movie, he hit me between the eyes. You have to be a brilliant man to make self-pity hilarious. Andersson reminds me of the third companion in the Pequod in Moby Dick, Flask, a man who has spent his entire life to be a joke that the good Lord himself is throwing at us. And the web of selfishness in this movie is truly hilarious. <br /> <br /> The level of satire is high, you have a dreamer of self-pity cheated on the cruelty of the world and then totally ignores a spiritual self-reflection screaming in agony. The depths of selfishness are probed. I never really thought it would be possible to go beyond Bergman's "The Silence" in this regard. However, the grotesque self-esteem and self-esteem, by all the characters in this film, is impressive. We are shown an existence where the untalented and the idle rail against a world they believe to be unfair to them, they really are legends in their own living rooms. Humans in this film make self-deception and self-deception a great art form! <br /> <br /> Only one woman in the movie seems to have some kind of understanding of what's going on. An old woman who refuses to leave a chapel, kneeling praying for the forgiveness of all mankind, her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world I have ever heard. She reveals through her prayers that what is wrong with the world is not to be mended by mere repairing, there are not just a few flaws, there is an abyss of corruption that can only be fixed by immolation, and day of judgment. Watching this movie puts me in the mind of a naked monk, was at the waist in a cold river at midnight screaming a thousand kyries for the sins of mankind. Another great joke is that it is clear that her prayers are futile and, in fact, she is preventing everyone from returning home at the time of closing. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for the presumptuous, no one is spared, no idol is left on the altar, no group of humans is harangued to the glory of another group. There has never been a more transcendent and extraordinarily beautiful sum of our sins. It's a movie for the end of the world, it's the big joke, the big hideous joke of human life! <br /> <br /> From the catalog of images it is very difficult to choose a favorite, I hit my thigh and almost fell from my chair in the movies, screaming of laughter when a man tried to pull the towel under a set service. I'm not going to ruin what happens, but the suspense builds up and something really unexpected happens. It's probably the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie theater. I'm pretty reserved and I just could not control myself: that's the measure of the grandeur of this movie. <br /> <br /> The shooting of "You, the Live" is impeccably formalistic. We are shown the palette of an artist, grimy browns, yellows, ashes and celestial blue, animated by the clash of luminous bronze textures. There's never a tone out of place, it's like an hour and a half of Whistler's symphonic melody. The obsession he must have put into putting this color scheme in place is extraordinary. And no shot is wasted, as with all great movies, there is not an inch of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Maybe the best movie I've ever seen.
