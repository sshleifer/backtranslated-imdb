This is a well-crafted piece from everyone's favorite thriller. As usual, the technical elements, such as camera work and lighting, are remarkable (especially for movie time). I did not find the first part of the film very exciting, but the latter certainly made up for one exciting scene after another. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like about this movie was Farley Granger's choice for the role of Guy Haines. Somehow, I did not find it very believable. On the other hand, Robert Walker shines like sinister 'bandit' Bruno Anthony. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend this.
