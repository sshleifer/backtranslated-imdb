Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) is just wasting time getting a job. His real ambition is to marry Eddie and have a baby. <br /> <br /> April (Diane Baker) is too innocent to be like this for too long and falls in love too easily, a dangerous combination. <br /> <br /> Greg (Suzy Parker) is an entrepreneur and wants to be an actress. <br /> <br /> All three are doomed to drama in The Best of Everything, a 1959 novel / play / sometimes solid movie that is aging every second. <br /> <br /> The ferocious world of brochure publishing is not as commonplace as "Doll's Valley," but not as vanilla as "Three Coins at the Fountain." <br /> <br /> The men in the mix - Brian Aherne, Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan and Robert Evans - are slippery, well dressed and not good most of the time. Aherne is the resident sex offender - will pinch anything that walks and makes unwanted down payments right and left. Your character is offensive as hell, but is not played seriously. Harassment had not yet been discovered, I think. Boyd works there too, although you never really see him doing anything. He is too busy being older, wiser and more drunk. Evans is overseas just so Diane Baker can suffer in style - he is a rich kid who has put her in "trouble", so instead of marrying her as promised, he will take her to an "operation." <br /> <br /> Jourdan is a director who mistakenly has an affair with Parker. They share a no-holds-barred fighting scene in a movie like this, but the scene was ruined by Parker's story. She ends up almost chasing him, and she really did not deserve such a bad fate despite her poor acting. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford breathes fire as Amanda Farrow, the resident "witch" who is automatically rude and disdainful of any of her legions of secretaries. Well, they're younger, are not they? Is not that reason enough to hate a person? Caroline does not think so, since she admirably admires Miss Farrow every chance she has. Crawford can only get loose once when she tells her married boyfriend "you can your rabbit-faced wife can go to hell" and hit the phone. You can never see the poor soul that dares to cross it. <br /> <br /> Martha Hyer's "plot", so to speak, is extremely weak, and she is painfully over-the-top as a single mother. Short of using a huge "W" (for "prostitute") in her cardigan, she walks around like a pathetic mess for most of the time on the screen. Even worse, she is not given the courtesy of having everything "tied up", one way or another, in the end. It does not matter much, but still ... <br /> <br /> It is painfully obvious that all this happened in a totally different world. People were kinder to each other and work was not a hitch, but something exciting, for a girl out of NYC. <br /> <br /> A barely convincing drunken scene aside, Hope Lange helps to seem reasonably real. Caroline, who at least has more than one side to her character. <br /> <br /> I admire that women are seen having an opinion, a chance and a choice. Not that he is not wrapped in a beautiful bow, but he makes some points for equality. In 1959, this was probably noteworthy and possibly controversial. 7/10
