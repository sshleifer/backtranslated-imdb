It's hard to know what to do with this strange Australian crime film - on the one hand, it's a nice little movie with a great sense of humor; but on the other hand, it is only a certain thing that guarantees that the film never exceeds its limit that keeps it trapped within the merely "interesting" territory. That said, Two Hands is a well-planned film that perfectly blends several stories at the same time, allowing for several small climaxes throughout the film, which in turn helps prevent the movie from becoming boring. The absurdity of events, the thick Australian accents and the bizarre set of characters help ensure that the film is fun as well. The plot follows the story of a young doorman who thinks he's going to bigger things after taking a job from the local boss. He does not; the job only puts him in trouble when he likes to swim and stupidly leaves ten thousand on the beach, which is promptly stolen by a couple of boys who spend the time of their lives in a shopping spree. However, not everything is rosy for our hero; who should find the money or face the consequences ... <br /> <br /> The film is composed of a cast of unknowns; at least it was in 1999, as today Heath Ledger is kind of a name. It does not impress much here, however, as its performance is mainly of the variety of a note and it does not make a very convincing advantage. It fits into the film in which he is Australian and looks naive; but besides, he's not the best leader I've ever seen in a movie. If you ask me, Bryan Brown gave the best performance here. He may not have much time on the screen, but he steals all the scenes in which he is and it is he who gives the film much of its humor. It has nothing to do with the best sequel, however, which happens in the form of the probably most hilarious bank robbery ever captured on film. Overall, I can recommend this movie to people who like quirky police movies; as strangeness is abundant, and the way events take a turn for the bizarre is agreeable; but if you're not a fan of that kind of movie, I can not say that the Two Hands will float on your boat. You do not need to see it, but if it's your thing and you get the chance to see it ... you probably will not regret it completely.
