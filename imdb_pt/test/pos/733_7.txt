This movie, also known as "do not look in the basement", is actually not bad. It's a movie little known even to horror fans, but I found this movie very entertaining. Do not get me wrong, it certainly is not without your problems, but I think more people should take a look. The story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly attractive to me. I thought the acting, which seemed forced at first, somehow improved with the progress of the movie. It seems the actors really took over their roles. There are some good, colorful characters, including a guy who thinks he's still a soldier, one who thinks he's a judge, an adult with a child's brain, and an attractive girl who craves so much for the attention she leaves her clothes when someone's approaching her. The title "Do not look in the basement" has as much relevance to the story as "the last house on the left" is in the film. If you like scary movie characters in a mental ward like me, check this out.
