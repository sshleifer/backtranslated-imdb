As I recall, my family made a point of staying home the night that "Nichols" was going on (Mondays? Tuesdays? NBC?). It was an excellent vehicle for James Garner, very well written, great cast. His character is very much like the "Support Your Site ..." movies: A retired player with a mysterious past settles in town and has adventures every week. In fact, it seemed pretty obvious that it was the same character. It was just lovely of a TV show. A sleeper, like "My World And Welcome To It", which may have been your contemporary - I forgot. I wish these shows are made available on DVD. It was Just Good TV. Maybe "Briscoe County Jr." come close, but only by a mile.
