Having seen most of the previous Coen Brothers films, I expected something different and a bit out of the center. OBWAT is certainly such things, but it also has a heart as big as ... well ... as big as the Mississippi. It is one of the most clearly pleasing films that has emerged in recent times, clever, well-crafted, clever and superbly represented. <br /> <br /> The characters are delivered in their myriad of shadows by a group of wonderful actors. George Clooney conquered me completely with his visual and character Clark Gable. Having only seen him in Three Kings and his fine participation in the Red Line, I am now a fan. More comedy, please, George. <br /> <br /> John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson help expertly, especially Nelson. If ever "The Simpsons" is turned into a film, it must be natural to interpret Cletus as the fallen chin. I do not think there is a performance that is not excellent from the whole cast. My special favorite is Stephen Root as the blind Radio Station Man. Great old music, a clooney jiggy dance I'm trying to learn, and a sense of depression in the southern US. Sepia photography makes this the best film I've seen so far in this century. The only downside to the movie is that it almost sent me off buying the soundtrack, the DVD and a DVD player to play it .... it's SO good! <br /> <br />
