I'm not usually into dark / psychological type thriller stuff. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing job. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are actually very complex and compelling. Rose interprets the complexities and changes of a psychologically disturbed woman quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed by the sophisticated way in which energy exchange problems were dealt with. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving three rooms to "get tea" and felt compelled to take a shower. The story was thrilling, but we were clearly unable to handle all the energy in one single shot. (He dives into the dingy, gloomy side of people, but does not let him there). I thought about the characters and meanings deeper for a long time. I highly recommend this. Still be prepared for an experience that you may not be expecting.
