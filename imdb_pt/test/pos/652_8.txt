A notoriously big failure when released. This Robert Altman-inspired comedy has some wonderful moments and an occasionally inspired cast. Although it remains long and completely misses the focus, there are moments funny enough to keep a curious viewer watching until the end. If you are a fan of actors and actresses, it will be a pleasure for you; you'll recognize so many little-known artists throughout this movie (you may not know their names but you know their faces), even the boy from A Christmas Story appears in a small part. Rent if Netflix, if you read this, I bet you will have fun.
