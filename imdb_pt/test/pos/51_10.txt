This was absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances from a wonderful cast of A-List that will take you from smiles to laughter to tears and back. <br /> <br /> I could not stop caring about the characters. Mrs. Merkerson will surprise you, as will the young man who plays the young leader. <br /> <br /> I also thought the design of the setting was high quality. The spectator is actually placed within each epoch as it is presented. <br /> <br /> The music is a blast too. Nice selections to represent humor, time and place. The man with the blind blues is stereotyped, but he offers great songs. <br /> <br /> This is a great story that will survive many repeated views. Take the time to watch!
