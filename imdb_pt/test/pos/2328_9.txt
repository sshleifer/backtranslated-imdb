It's not the best storyline in the world, but the comedy in this movie rules. Kelsey Grammar is wonderful in this movie. Another funny face is Rob Schneider, who will make you break with your segments with Ken Hudson Campbell, who plays Buckman. Lauren Holly plays probably the most serious character in the cast as Lt. Lake. Bruce Dern is a great actor in this film, probably playing the most serious character in the film. The actor that I liked the most was Toby Huss as Nitro, all the electric shots that his character makes in the movie are hilarious. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit uneven, about Lieutenant Commander Tom Dodge, who for years has wanted to command his own sub. When he finally gets the chance, instead of a new submarine, he gets a rusty WWII Diesel Sub, the Stingray. His crew is no better, misfits of the US Navy. He is then placed in a series of war games, which shows how an old diesel engine can handle the current Nuclear Navy. Things still do not improve when he learns that his diving officer is actually a female officer, to see how women behave in real subs. To get the commanding position he wants, he has to win the War Games, and blow up a fictional ship. <br /> <br /> The movie shows very well, actually I laughed non-stop when I saw this movie in theaters. I loved it when they were silent and Buckman farts, and everyone's reaction to the smell is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Overall, 9 out of 10, this movie is simply fun to watch, it's good to have a movie like that, I hate movies that try to be 100% serious.
