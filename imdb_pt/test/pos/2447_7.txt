This movie was well done. It covers the difficulties a Vietnam veteran is facing to deal with the horrors of war. Unfortunately, writers have chosen to focus on a veterinarian involved in an act of atrocity. I was in Vietnam and only once have I heard of such an act from someone who witnessed it. The offender was indicted and sentenced to many years in Leavenworth. <br /> <br /> The notion that only vets involved in atrocities have had emotional problems is a disservice to all who served. All the soldiers I knew personally or knew by word of mouth were honorable soldiers who respected even the enemy and believed they were there to stop the spread of communism. The biggest problem was coming home to find that many Americans were opposed to war. This is what made many veterans feel that they had participated in something less than honorable. Not the way they served. <br /> <br /> The ending showed the father acting more like a belligerent bully than a loving and caring father. For that I gave him a total of 7 out of 10. If the end allowed a degree of acceptance, I could have rated as 9. The most decent men will come home from war with guilt and emotional scars. They need acceptance and understanding to overcome this. I pray that the public will better understand our current veterans than it was in the Vietnam era.
