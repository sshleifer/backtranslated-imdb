I usually give horror movies around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror movie I have ever seen ... Even better than the Amityville Horror. <br /> <br /> Paris Hilton was very good at it and I must say that she has a good future ahead of her. His death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just tell her how she dies ... <br /> <br /> She picks up a giant pole between her eyes and they close-ups and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was as good as the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had long hair). Usually he plays a bad cop or soldier, but he did very well on it. <br /> <br /> Eliza Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray also acted very well as Carly and Nick Jones. Nick was in the limelight in the first half of the movie, so Eliza stole him back in pain in the second half, like cutting his finger, plucking his lips after they were glued, and punching Bo's face in the face. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give this movie an 8/10. Horror movie fans should see this.
