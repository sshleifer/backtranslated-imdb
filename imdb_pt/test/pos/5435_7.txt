Robin Williams shows off his stand-up talent and boosts his status as a comedian in this film of "What's Wrong with American Politics and How Hollywood Can Try to Influence without Boring People." Of course, Hollywood uses movies with hidden or not-so-hidden calendars. I think this movie is for people who like standing discussion and politics. And the trailers in this movie went to everyone just to make sure that as many people as possible can see it. Everyone knows that Hollywood is more liberal / democrat than bush & co so they have to make these movies from time to time ... but this one might be too obvious, at least I thought so, for making any real change. <br /> </ p> <p> Still, great issues and new and up-to-date political speeches ... I liked it and, thanks to the ratings on the weblog, I was positively surprised when I left the theater and, yes, I laughed a lot. Sometimes you just have to let go and forget all seriousness ... watch this movie if you like good and clever posture or politics and you will not be offended by the various references of how things are not good right now. Rent it if it does not suit you.
