I've been feeling a bit disappointed with Tarantino since the death proof. But I insist that it was only a little because I can appreciate the amount of work in producing a tribute to people. Inglorious Basterds definitely propelled Tarantino to the top of my universe. This movie can be summarized (albeit inappropriately) in one word: "RAW". <br /> <br /> There is an intense emotion in every scene. Revenge and justice seem to be the main themes. From the beginning of the film, one feels compassion for the victims of the Nazis and is placed in the fictional dimension of Tarantino of the historical context of World War II. <br /> <br /> The characters are unpredictable, fun, scary, brutal, sexy and other adjectives that I'm sure are escaping from my mind and that are so appropriate and positive. I will not go into an appreciation of each character, but the other comments made by other users sum up the appreciation of the various performances. <br /> <br /> The dialogue evolved from Tarantino's classic provocative "bad ass" style, as seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. One can feel in the dialogues that Tarantino is making references more open to other films. In fact, many dialogues were almost lessons in the cinema for the public, the scenario occurs partly in the debut of a film; a reference to a movie is close at each corner. <br /> <br /> It is good to see that each language presented (German, French and English) is equally and naturally employed. I speak fluent French and English, and I am often disappointed in how English-speaking characters in French films do badly and how French / English characters in English / American movies do badly. Incredibly, Tarantino managed to get his actors to perform a natural and graceful performance of their actors. This helps to put the audience in the context of the historical context. Indeed ; soldiers, spies and civilians rarely understood soldiers / spies / civilians from other countries. <br /> <br /> The visuals / photography are beautiful, with scenarios conveying convincingly a World War II Europe from the 1940s. The clothes are perfect and violence orgasm / realistically transmitted. No punch is retained and the Nazis are often shown being tortured. This makes the movie not open to all audiences; graphic violence can shock the most sensitive people. <br /> <br /> volumes can be written about this movie. But the film is so good, that during the premiere of Inglorious Basterds in North America at the Fantasy Festival in Montreal, I had to pee, but I refused to miss any scenes. I hope the image conveys how strong I feel about this movie, and I'm a public hard to please.
