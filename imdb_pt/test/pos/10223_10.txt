This is Clive Barker's masterpiece, in my opinion. The film has a great plot and some amazing compositions and effects. The only thing I would love to see happen is a sequel. The film was created for a sequel and, with the improved technology, the second movie could be incredible. David Cronenberg should appear in a sequel, as well as Craig Sheffer. But this particular movie was a great original idea, creative and fun and I was able to watch it several times. Cronenberg was perfect in this film and Sheffer added an interesting spice to the film.
