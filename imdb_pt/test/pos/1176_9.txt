I was totally surprised at how good this movie really is because when I first saw it I was just slightly amused! I must say, however, that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor did not receive a bigger and better role! He was a huge talent. <br /> <br /> There is great chemistry among all the members of the main cast and Matthau has never been more funny. <br /> <br /> I am tremendously happy that this photo was made because we see the team of Lemmon and Matthau one last time; in a vehicle that puts his talent to great use. Brent Spiner proves that "Data" from Star Trek the Next Geeration is not the only good character he can play. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple, but the comedy and the characters work very well and I laughed heartily throughout this film and I strongly recommend it.
