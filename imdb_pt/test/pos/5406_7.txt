Another slice of darkness and denial hidden beneath the surface of the American suburb, Imaginary Heroes chronicles the life of the Travis family, all recovering after the suicide of their eldest son. <br /> <br /> The duo at the center of the film are mother and son Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) and Tim (Emile Hirsch), both acting in different ways as a result of death. While Tim tries prescription drugs and his own sexuality, Sandy regresses to his former self, smoking marijuana and accepting an ancient act of infidelity. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sandy and Tim is well explored, especially when references are made to both being excluded from their own family: Sandy due to his case and Tim, initially, due to being always in the shadow of his older brother more successful. Much less time is allowed for Sandy's husband, Ben (Jeff Daniels), who, in a devastating description of denial, orders Sandy to make a plate of additional food for her dead son and place him in his old place at the dinner. Michelle Williams' older sister, Penny, is underwritten and can be easily removed from the film. Imaginary Heroes does not explore its many subplots as much as individual stories deserve, while some of the film's dark comedy does not translate as well as screenwriter / director Dan Harris may have liked. And the depiction of a disturbed family dynamic is not portrayed as strongly as the many other films with similar ideas. But despite some problems, Weaver's and Hirsch's central performances are impressive, and easily bring the film to its conclusion with success. <br /> <br /> Rating: B-
