All trials and tribulations make a film without budget from the mouth of those involved. You feel all the sweat, courage, determination, and dedication Stuie put into this love work and the frustration of hanging on after all his work. The clips of interviews with all involved provide a great fluent narrative and convey the almost anarchic attitude that led to the movie "Waldo" and later to the documentary. Stuie and company deserve all the brains in the world not to give up when things get tough and get "The Texas Tale of Treason" so we can see what it's like for the beginning filmmaker on the street!
