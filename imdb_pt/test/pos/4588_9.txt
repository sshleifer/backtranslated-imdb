Mike Judge's Idiocracy is an interesting film, and that his fans will undoubtedly crawl and see. Before I start the review, I'd start by saying that if you get the chance to see it definitely worth watching, and it's not the easiest movie in the world to track. Let's start with the premise - Luke Wilson is the soldier Joe Bauers, an Army Librarian considered to have absolutely no outstanding attributes or glaring flaws, making him entirely average in all respects. This, coupled with the fact that he has no living relatives, makes him a leading candidate for an experimental cryogenic procedure. Also frozen with Joe is a prostitute named Rita, who was involved in the project by Upgrayedd, her abusive pimp. Unfortunately, a few days after they are frozen, the secret project is abandoned, and they are forgotten. <br /> <br /> They wake up in 2505, and discover this with the doldrums of society following the tendencies of. In recent times, everyone on Earth is only slightly smarter than a chimpanzee. The way Joe Bauers talks about "every man" is seen as "fuck" as much as someone who speaks as Shakespeare ridiculed now, and a former professional fighter is the president of the United States (in fact, this is probably not so absurd) . really). The best show on TV is called "Ow! My Balls!", Which admittedly sounds great, and not only is everything spelled wrong, but it seems like the signs seem to have run out of space for the text, leaving them together. It's a funny premise for the movies, but this is the problem - Beyond the initial premise, not so much in the movie is really funny. What I mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind for having read the premise of the movie are probably as funny as the movie itself. Obviously not terrible, but it probably could have been funnier. <br /> <br /> There are a few winners in the script, like Starbucks who now offers "happy endings," and people who put their blind faith into the universally misunderstood deception. "electrolytes," but they are very few and far between, so unless you go laughing hysterically every time one of the idiots of the future sheds a phrase with open mouth and profanity with little or no logic and / or intelligence. can be very well spaced. <br /> <br /> It's unfair that everyone is comparing with Office Space, because it's a very different film, but as a film, regardless of what came before, Idiocracy is a funny concept that will probably make you laugh a lot more opening 15 to 20 minutes than in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I give 5 out of 10 because it's nice, but do not do enough to lift it up the middle of the road.
