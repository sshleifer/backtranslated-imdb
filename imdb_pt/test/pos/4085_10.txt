I usually do not like this kind of movie, but I was working from home and wanted something to watch half the way while I was doing it. I was so entertained that I gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I'm sure they do not usually cry over this kind of show, but I was crying in the end. Lots of emotional nuance. Great performance and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors in the world, and the guy who played Luke was also very good. Highly recommended.
