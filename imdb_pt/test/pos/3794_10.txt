The few comments I could find online from Barnens 5 really do not do it justice. I read all of them before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already passed, so I could not cancel. I'm very happy now that I could not. It's an extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> I will not give a plot synopsis because other reviewers have already done this. But I will say that I do not understand the comments that it is bleak, shocking, strange, clinical, depressing or pornographic. It's certainly very unusual, which I think might make it seem strange to some people, but the other reviews should reflect the reviewers' own problems, because I did not see any of that in the movie I just watched. I do not feel attracted to boys, so nudity does not look like anything pornographic to me - it's just a kid trying to figure out who he is, with no help from the irresponsible adults in his life. And it's Sweden, not Utah, so topless women are no big deal. <br /> <br /> But what surprised me the most was how positive the movie is in its depiction of this lost and brave boy who makes a kind of Odyssey all sorts of strange experiences, looking - and finally finding it same. It's fascinating, totally original and deeply satisfying. <br /> <br /> It does not surprise me that Barnens has won three major Guldbagge awards, such as best picture, directing and actor, but I am absolutely amazed that the actor who won was not Tomas Fryk, the boy whose fearless performance as Reine should be one of the most notable ever filmed, but Ingvar Hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of Stig, the despicable boyfriend of Reine's mother. I do not understand any of this, but that does not change the fact that this is a great movie.
