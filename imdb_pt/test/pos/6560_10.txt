I am a freak of the horror movie, and this has to be one of the most phenomenal horror movies I have ever seen. The plot is totally original (who else would think of a city that is totally obsessed with a certain symbol to the point of death and insanity?), Special effects are incredible and cinematography could not be better. Some may find this disturbing, but that does not mean it's a bad movie. Also makes a good point. The symbol of the spiral is somewhat omnipresent. The spiral notebook, spiral shells, spirals on cakes. Of all the ways they could have used (square, triangle, trapeze, rectangle) this was one of the best choices. If you can find this movie, definitely see. It is certainly unique and unforgettable.
