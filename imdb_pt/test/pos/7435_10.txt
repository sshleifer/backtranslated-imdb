I really love this movie !!! I have not done Final Fantasy VII yet, but I still love the movie, it's very funny and I love the work the dubbing actors did. The visuals are SO fantastic and all the lines are so well made. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have a very good imagination, so I was able to fill most of the gaps that the film presented, and I suggest you watch it twice because so many things "suddenly "make sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, (this is very funny) you should watch with the subtitles because what they say and what the subscribers say are sometimes completely different. It's actually very funny, but sometimes it helps you understand what they say best. <br /> Watch !!! Marnie love
