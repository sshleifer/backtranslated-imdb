Great music, great dancing, a sexy star (Swayze) and real sexual desire shown by a female character (a very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters who are motivated mainly by lust and it is a good change. I also think the film captures very well what it's like to be a teenager dealing with class issues and having ideals suddenly coming up against reality. Of course he's sentimental at times - after all, it's a musical movie - but, in short, it's a real treat - a fun and politically savvy novel. This movie also has one of my favorite movie lines of all time: "I loaded the watermelon."
