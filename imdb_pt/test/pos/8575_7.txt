I wanted to love this movie. Everything seemed to be in place for a nice film, if not groundbreaking. It was set in the south of France, well-regarded and well-known actors led the cast, and I really admired the vibrant African outfits, proverbs and music. Despite all this, I did not like it. Movies should convey their meaning at first screening, but "Secret Laughter" does not do that. Nimi and Matthew, played by Long and Firth (both have played before and should have known better), radiate as much heat as passion as dry fish. I deliberately used "dry fish" because it was one of the few - very few - strong lines and moments scattered throughout the film. Another winner was when Nimi catches Matthew snooping around his apartment. He finds a book of hers with his first name written on it and says, "His name is Nimi, I never knew." So he insists that she call him by his name. I watched the scene intently as Matthew asked Nimi repeatedly to "say my name," realizing that until that moment, they always called each other by their last names. I thought this was a turning point for the movie, and hoped it would get better. This did not happened. Why do Nimi and Matthew always seem to be ten steps away, even in that "say my name" scene? What does Matthew like about Nimi besides his obvious beauty? And why would a sensible woman like Nimi fall in love with a comic book writer who considers her marriage something he can put on hold when a beautiful exotic "adventure" comes along? And I'd like to add that it was a bit difficult for me to get behind a novel based on adultery. Yes, Jenny is a cruel harpy, but if I were in her place, but I would probably combine her Cruella tactics to prevent my husband from moving away. Believe. The story suggests Nimi's painful past, but never fully explores it. Some critics say that Firth seemed a little strange here, and I agree. For God's sake, the actor summoned more palpable desire and passion than the snobby Mr. Darcy of the early 19th century (and while wearing those horrible pants)! As for Long, who shone in "Love Jones," there were times when she seemed to focus more on her accent than interpreting her character. Even then, there were many times ?? the scene 'say my name' between them? when she was in full control and came across very well. However, 'Secret Laughter' is not without its redeeming qualities, and I have discovered that it has grown in me with more visions. Nene was well portrayed as supportive and well-meaning, even if she did not fully understand Matthew's attraction to Nimi. I just loved it when Nene confronted Mama Fola in those scenes of mourning proverbs. My husband liked it, and usually he is the first to sigh and play insults on the screen if he does not like what is happening. He even laughed at the scene when Sammy asked Matthew some very candid questions about sex. So you have it. 'Secret Laughter' was good enough to entertain a grumpy man declared as my husband, but an avid spectator as I will need more than one audience to appreciate what the director and writer were trying to convey.
