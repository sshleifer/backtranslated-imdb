Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those movies that I grew up listening to, however, a copy could never be obtained so far. I watched this movie on DVD and thought it was a charming and charming movie with wonderful animation, a good storyline and great music. If this movie was made by Disney, then the movie would be considered a classic, however, as it was done by a little-known movie studio that is far away, the movie escaped the cracks. <br /> <br /> The film was made by Max Fleischer studios in Miami, Florida, and was released by Paramount Pictures. The film was due to be released on December 7, 1941, the date of the Pearl Harbor bombing. Although that probably hurt the release of the film, the film has been shown in some movie theaters for up to a year, as evidenced by some research. The film was called a family favorite by most major American newspapers. The film continued to be reissued approximately every year, usually on holidays such as Easter, at least in large cities. In the mid-1950s, this film was re-released with a new name "Hoppity Goes to Town," in honor of the film's protagonist. The film is a piece of real time, capturing a slice of Americana as it was in the 30's and 40's. The animation is great, and many of the characters are very cute. The animation of the humans in the film is through the process of the rotoscope, which means that the actors were filmed and then the images were drawn by the animators, giving the movement a very real appearance. <br /> <br /> The Fleishcher studios were one. from various animation studios doing cartoons in the 1930s and '40s. While some of Fleischer's characters like Betty Boop, Popeye and Superman's drawings are better known, the studio's work is more or less forgotten. <br /> <br /> Almost as a whole, the work of the Fleischer studios is in the public domain. All Superman cartoons are in the public domain, but all of the "Color Classics" series are in the public domain, and the movie "Gulliver's Travels" is also in the public domain. This movie never seems to have been released in the US on VHS or DVD, but was released in Europe. However, some looking on the internet can quickly produce a copy. I recommend the search.
