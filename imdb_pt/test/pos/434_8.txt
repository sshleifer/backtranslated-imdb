Like classic Hollywood musicals, the plot is just an excuse. A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by Ã‰dith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 minute plus cancan finale. The dance in the movie is not at all like what is usually going on in the cancan. <br /> <br /> Some may oppose Technicolor costumes and bright lighting, but it gives you a clear view of some great costumes and scenarios. <br /> <br /> Consider Jean Renoir's love letter to the Paris he grew up in. Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who do not like their movies serious or who just like their Hollywood productions. <br />
