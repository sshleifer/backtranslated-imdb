I played Sam (the doorman, Lou's companion) in the movie "Dead Rail", which later aired as "Alien Express". And I have to say that on my part I really enjoyed watching this movie. As a hard-working actor, this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, gave me great scenes to include in my roll, and allowed me to work in a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) were very kind, giving me the opportunity to participate in the production. I have made many friends (Lou, Todd, Steven) and I consider myself very happy to have been able to work with these incredibly talented people. There was not a day I passed without laughing. The real tragedy is not so much the special effects, is that every person who watched this movie could not see what happened behind the scenes and all the talent that really happened. Craftsmen building the set, prop masters, gaffers, costumes, makeup artists, screen supervisors, director of photography, production assistants, extras, crafts services, producers, director and actors. It is a fact that Sci fi did not spend a terrible amount of money on the movie (2 million). But there was a long time, energy and human power that was instilled in him. I see the film now as a production that brought together many talented people for a fun project that was filmed uncomplicated in less than two months. It was a magnificent cast and team and I'm so happy to get away from it! On an additional note to those of you who do not know Lou Diamond Phillips, Todd Bridges and Steven Brand. They are fantastic people who are incredibly funny. I'm still working on my impression of Deniro and can not thank him enough for introducing me to "Midnight Run". Todd, every time I hear a song from Elvis, I can not forget the story you told me about hanging out with him at his house for dinner. "Can you please pass me the participants?" (IM a huge Elvis fan!) Steven, "Mr. Brand!" You are a true gentleman and all the encouragement and advice I have received from you will always be appreciated. I miss you and I hope you are well. Thanks for the good memories, stories, jokes and friendship. Ah and miss Utah says hi! wink wink <br /> <br />
