This movie makes me laugh even thinking about it. such a clever comedy! very precise but easy. the cast can not be better. all the actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play exactly the best, and there are no stupid laughs or screams throughout the movie. layers and the progress of the story work seamlessly together and the rhythm flows smoothly. the greatest of all is when the People's Village YMCA is inserted, brings out the importance of Indian status, which was briefly explained earlier in the film, which makes the climax more intelligent and funny among many comedies. I give a ten, especially often the comedies are so underrated.
