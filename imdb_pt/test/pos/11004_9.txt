This is a beautifully filmed film that questions the future of all indigenous peoples, especially the nomads of the tribe. Focusing on the Saltmen of Tibet, the film moves in pace that may leave some Western viewers uncomfortable. For some people, life continues at the same pace as thousands of years ago. This film follows a group of tribes in their annual two-month quest to get salt. His tribe lives their lives in a traditional way (slowly by modern standards) and always taking into consideration their many gods. This is a remarkable film, which will preserve a part of what can, unfortunately, become history. It's worth the time. Do not be in a hurry when you see him.
