too bad they showed palm trees that could not be more inaccurate for Connecticut in October ... this was filmed in New Zealand ... This case of Martha Moxley had been 'cold' for 20-25 years ... her family worked hard to keep him alive and when Mark Fuhrman decided that he did not want to be remembered just for his involvement in the Nicole Simpson affair .... which could have been damaging to his reputation (if he had not already) ... Anyway, he followed on front as the police tried to get enough information to write a book. ... with the use of flashbacks we can see the relationships that Martha formed .... Unaccompanied boys maturing without a mother around to help and a father who was always arrested ... The fact that they portray the real Martha as if she were a movie star ... she was a pretty sweet girl of the sort next door. Other than that, the other characters were really great, especially Jon Foster and Toby Moore, who played Michael Skakel and Tommy Skakel, respectively. They were good too, customers had to keep everything in the 70's and go back to the 90's .... He kept my interest even when I found out about Skakel's face. ..
