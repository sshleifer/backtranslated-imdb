This show is the only great thing that has come out of America since The Simpsons. Not only do you have thousands of new ideas, but it's really controversial (see the Jewish joke, Season 1, Episode 1) and you're not afraid to "tag" people. However, Fox's great minds have canceled it along with Greg the Bunny and Futurama, so be sure to buy the Season 1 box while you still can. It will be the best money you have ever spent. It's definitely a show that gets better the more you watch, since at first the constant flashbacks can get a little annoying and do not always seem to fit right into the story. However, after a few episodes, you realize how brilliant it is and compares to any other show currently on the air right now.
