1983 was "the battle of the ties". That year, Roger Moore and Sean Connery starred in two independent James Bond movies, the first one (Octopussy) was produced by the Bond movie's "official" producers, while the latter (Never Say Never Again) was produced "unofficially" by a group . led by Kevin McClory, who held the film's rights to Thunderball. Surprisingly, it's the "unofficial" movie that is best despite the obvious flaw and the fact that Never Say Never Again is a remake of Thunderball. <br /> <br /> Never say never has the distinction of flaunting one of the best cast ever assembled for a Bond movie. It all starts with Sean Connery, returning to Bond for the first time since 1971, Diamonds Are Forever. Connery may be older than he was then, but he looks better here, so he did in Diamonds Are Forever. The Never Say Never Again link is the elegant and dangerous shark of Dr. No or From Russia With Love, just a few years older. The delivery of a liner and Connery's dialogue is as dead as it ever was. The only disadvantage of Connery's age is his credibility, especially when it comes to the women in the film. Let's face it, even Connery, despite being at the top of the physical form, looks as strange as Moore when he's in bed at half his age. However, despite this credibility issue, Never Say Never Again shows Connery in one of his best Bond performances and a definite improvement in his two previous Bond performances. Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of her first film roles. Bassinger plays the part with considerable confidence for a newcomer relative and she makes the character believable. Bassinger stands against his co-stars and has considerable chemistry with them as well. In fact, she may well overshadow her play of Thunderball, played by Claudine Auger. <br /> <br /> Then there is the villain Maximilian Largo played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer's Largo is all that a villain in the James Bond movie should be: gentle, charming, evil and above all believable anyway. Brandauer plays the realistic role and opts not to fall into the trap where many other Bond villains have fallen over the top. Brandauer plays Largo with a silent threat and unseen charisma in many of the opponents of 007. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast also extends to the supporting cast. BÃ¡rbara Carrera is an excellent executive in Fatima Blush and the screen lights up when she appears. Max Von Sydow a beautiful appearance like Blofeld, although his appearance is more like a special participation. Rowan Atkinson makes an appearance as Bond's awkward contact, which makes some of the best scenes in the film. All in all, the highlight of the support cast comes from the team of MI6 from M of Edward Fox, which does a great contrast with Bernard Lee, Pamela Salem, who makes Moneypenny and the cake cherry with the wonderful Q from Alec McCowen . has a couple of flaws in the form of Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter and Gavin O'Herlihy as Jack Petachi, who seem to lack credibility in their respective roles. Otherwise, this film bears one of the best casting ever assembled for a James Bond movie. <br /> <br /> On top of an excellent cast, the film has several other essential ingredients. From the opening of the Central American sequence to the fight in Shrublands to underwater sequences and the pursuit of motorcycles, this is a film in which the action sequences are not only great but also serve the conspiracy most of the time. The film also features good special effects in terms of cruise missile models, explosions and everything we expect from a James Bond movie. Irvin Kershner, fresh from The Empire Strikes Back, brings a strong sense of direction to the film, especially in such sequences as the nuclear warhead substation and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is far from perfect. Never Say Never Again is easily one of Bond's oldest films, with heavy use of sand videogames in the 1980s. Although the technology date any movie after some time, the heavy reliance on this film, especially in the sequestration of the cruise and following the Domination, makes the film look incredibly dated more than a quarter of a century after its release. The script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the fact that it's a remake of Thunderball. <br /> <br /> Still for its predictability, the screenplay of Never Say Never Again is very good. The script has good dialogue scenes, not a single worthy charm (how many scripts of the Roger Moore era can you say about it?), Some funny situations, and it's still watchable and tense most of the time. Once you look back, it's a remake, there are many good things in the movie script. <br /> <br /> Music is, in fact, the biggest weakness of the movie. Due to the "unofficial" status of the movie, the James Bond Theme could not be used. That said, it could have shown to the right composer that a Bond score without it could work. Unfortunately, Michael Legrand's score is far from adequate. Legrand's score is totally out of place in a Bond movie and there are only one or two places where it really works. To make matters worse, the film also has one of the worst all-time title sequences in a James Bond movie. <br /> <br /> Despite being very old-fashioned, somewhat predictable and having a bad note, Never Say Never Again is still a good Bond movie. With one of the best cast of any Bond film, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction and some wonderful dialogue, this film proves that "unofficial" is not a bad thing. In fact, it is better that Octopussy and the winner of the "battle of titles".
