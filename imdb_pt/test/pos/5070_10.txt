The Extraordinary Rendition is a frightening practice surprisingly allowed under Clinton, which allows the US government to apprehend and suspect, apparently for whatever reason, of being a terrorist against the United States. This is a delicate issue, especially after 9/11, because advocates of the practice always criticize the opposition for holding back the vital US power that it must effectively combat terror. Fanatical supporters will label the opposition as terrorists in themselves. <br /> <br /> But, like a recent movie that lent a similar level of humanity to the death penalty, The Life of David Gale, Rendition shows us a story of misuse of extraordinary renditions, or at least ease with which can be exploited and falsely applied. The story involves Anwar El-Abrahimi, an American-born American chemical engineer who is stuck on his way back to America to give a talk in Egypt. The reason is that he telephoned a known terrorist. No proof is given (or required) that it was Anwar who made the phone calls, that his phone was never stolen. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Anwar's extremely pregnant wife, Isabella, is back in the States trying frantically to find her husband, who boarded a plane to Chicago, but apparently never left. The fragile explanation that he has never been there evaporates when she learns that he made a purchase on board using his credit card. Lately I have been researching the modern history of China, particularly the astonishingly selfish and brutal dictatorship created by Mao Tse-tung, and it is a little more frightening to see the similarities between extraordinary extradition and some of the brutal tactics of fear of Mao, including his public executions (which the people were forced to watch), and extensive use of torture specifically used to extract "confessions." <br /> <br /> It is very disturbing to note that Mao specifically did these things to create an environment of fear in order to achieve the obedience of the Chinese people. To say that the Bush administration has not created an atmosphere of fear and continues to encourage it for all it's worth would be naive to the extreme, and although extraordinary extradition has not been created under Bush, of course this does more harm than good. good. <br /> <br /> In addition to the thickness of the film, Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), who works behind a desk of the CIA and has little field experience, until his boss is murdered and suddenly he finds himself supervising the torture. of a man he quickly comes to doubt has something to reveal. The daughter of Fatima (Freeman's boss) also plays a key role, as does a senatorial advisor played by Peter Sarsgaard, who may have the most satisfying role in the film. Meryl Streep is also suitably cool and clinical as a cold senator with a dogmatic need support and delivery practice. As a political thriller, the film is incredibly well-crafted and rhythmic. But the scariest thing is that it's all real. The purpose of the movie is to get people to really think about things done on behalf of America, especially when they claim to be done to avoid those same things. Conducting terror in the name of the prevention of terror will not bring us any sympathy or extract confessions through brutal torture, which is the most basic form of criminal investigation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we are gradually moving in that direction, doing these things more than less. The frightening question is what will be the event that will happen sometime in the future to convince us to stop and move to the other side, toward civilization and peace, or will we just continue toward a military dictatorship until finally there?
