I watched this on Sky TV late at night, as I'm a vampire fan. I must admit I kind of hoped it was a B movie disaster, but I was pleasantly wrong. <br /> <br /> The subspecies is about a vampire family. When a Vampire Lord dies, his two sons, the beautiful and noble Stefan, and his brother, the evil Radu, start a war with each other for the birthright, the Bloodstone. The bloodstone is a type of holy grail for vampires and bleeds the blood of the saints, which gives the vampire who drinks a supreme High. <br /> <br /> The Bloodstone fight takes an unexpected turn when 3 college students show up on the Brothers' territory on a school trip and Stefan has to protect them from their brother Lusts. <br /> <br /> As I said, I got into this movie not expecting much, but it was one of the best low budget movies I've ever seen. The sets and locations (Romania I think, it's been a while since I've seen it) are really cool and the soundtrack made the movie justice. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was adequate, but Anders Hove as the villainous radu who steals the film (and all subsequent sequels). Hove's performance as the twisted vampire is really breathtaking and takes a leap in the movie just as well, for good d @ mn good!
