After watching the movie a few times, I found so many subtle touches and emotions in the dialogue. Jing Ke, the Killer has become one of the movie's favorite characters of all time. This good Chinese actor says more with his eyes and his economy of words and movements, so any American big screen actor today. Qin, the Emperor, is brilliant in leading the public to believe in the goodness of his heart, only to unleash the most cruel acts against the people around him. The promises he makes with an incredible passion and broken with an evil fist. Gong Li, as in almost every movie I've ever seen, is simply fantastic. Your onscreen domain is so gracefully and emotionally charged. <br /> <br /> If you do not know, I loved this movie. <br /> <br />
