It seems that we should recognize Scandinavian cinema by more than merely the 1995 Dogma movement, so elaborated by the Dane all those years ago. Den Brysomme Mannen, or The Bothersome Man in English, is a surrealistic and deeply thought-out film, but deeply entertaining and rich in content both on the surface and under the surface. Just as a film, it's a blunt comedy about society and attitudes in the postmodern world we live in; a world that, judging by Bothersome Man, hit the regions of Norway and the like. But along with this black comedy, it seems that the film delves a little further and raises questions, at least for me, of metaphorical religious spaces and our human instinct to want to discover the truth among so many materials in our world that may seem strange to us. <br /> <br /> This was, in fact, a fantastic introduction to contemporary Norwegian cinema for me. The film fits very much into this category of European art cannon, with its deep themes and ambiguity enveloped atmosphere, keeping an open end and not so much a narrative as a procession of events that can mean one thing or another. So many times we've seen movies that use The Bothersome Man set and it's often turned into a predictable routine that revolves around a detective story or a chase story or something to that effect, but this film allows for its setting and situation to act as a mere backdrop for its protagonist, named Andreas (Fausa Aurvaag), to explore who he is; where it is and what are the possible mysteries behind that site. <br /> <br /> The scenario I'm talking about involves the hero arriving in a place with no prior memory or what happened before that. I will jump right in and say that, in my opinion, he is dead and has been sent to some kind of purgatory, just like all the inhabitants of the city. Everyone in the town with whom Andreas mixes are the same age; same mentality and attitude, suggesting that most of them fall victim to their own suicide and were sent to a purgatory devoid of any emotion, feeling, color or most important, pain. <br /> <br /> When we first see Andreas, he gets off a bus that he later discovers is mysterious in his abilities, and approaches a gas station in the middle of nowhere. He is disheveled and has a huge beard, but soon he will be the opposite, wearing a suit and tie; clean and shaven face and a house of his own, with a new work in which the film makes one of the best transformations between the rural and the urban that I have seen. But the new job, like the new city, is uncomfortable; you can take breaks whenever you want; Bosses are extraordinarily kind and there seems to be no excitement or reaction to anything. These ideas are best put into a movie when Andreas, still a relative newcomer to the city, is crying and is clearly affected by a movie on display, but everyone watches with rock style. There is also the initial example of when a man jumped out of a window and got impaled on some points, but everyone walks without making noise. <br /> <br /> To support my idea of ​​all who are already dead and the city acting as a kind of purgatory, death and damage in general are impossible. There is a particularly nasty scene involving an electronic paper guillotine and someone's thumb, but everyone's reaction to the event is of stone and grows back in an hour. Likewise, an attempted suicide involving trains later comes to nothing, and instead we get the point of view on what it's like to be dragged along tube rails with the invulnerability of your side. The city functions as a barrier, a painless society in which the masochistic need to self-assault is impossible; a place where sexual intercourse can occur and disruptions equally, but both in emotionless and non-passionate circumstances; a place where people can attempt suicide, but it is impossible to actually die. The city adopts these powers because the damage has already been done in "real life" and therefore the movie says that you can not kill yourself twice, in fact you can not feel pain or emotion in an afterlife of purgatory. <br /> <br /> But the best part of the movie is the one that surprises you. Judging by the final five minutes of the film and the parallel story involving some songs from another man's home, it seems that there is a fine line between the spaces that the movie calls "heaven" and "hell." Are we able to see these spaces only very, very briefly? so briefly that they consist of a single shot. The 'sky' is a colorful kitchen with music and children playing: it offers life, hope, emotion and happiness, while hell is a snowy place that haunts you thanks to its impossible to build and mysterious cut point. The introduction of these two spaces at the end of the film suddenly informs him of the reality Andreas and co. faced: purgatory and everything that came with it, the afterlife just was not ready for Andreas and his free, adventurous mind? and see where the thinkers end.
