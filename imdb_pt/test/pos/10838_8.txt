This drama apparently caused a commotion six years ago, when it debuted on television - not having a lot of TV news, went unnoticed; but after seeing it, it does not surprise me that it has caused a stir. Not particularly because of the content (although it's a little more "unusual" than the usual TV material) - it has more to do with the reactionary media in this country. Anyway, this three part series is based on a book by Sarah Waters and puts her main focus on lesbians - although the plot also has room to explore some other "obscure" sides of sexuality. Our main character is an oyster girl named Nan (short for Nancy) of Winchester. She is charmed by the female and male actress, Kitty Butler, after seeing her at a theater show and soon begins to watch all of her shows - eventually catching the attention of the artist and becoming her decorator. It's not long before Kitty gets the chance to play on the big stage in London and become a good friend of Nan, she invites her for the ride. The act increases when Nan goes on stage as well and the pair becomes a stage duo ... but Kitty breaks Nan's heart, leading her to an odyssey in London's miserable womb. <br /> <br /> I must admit that my DVD collection contains no shortage of despicable and sordid movies, so there was nothing that would suffice to shock me. Although I'm a little tired, I must say I'm still surprised at anyone who says that this movie went too far; of course there's some lesbian sex and stuff, but it's never exploited or overused and the movie really could not have been made without it. The main focus is always on history; and the story is very well done. The film has almost three hours in total, but if something is not long enough to convey everything. Sarah Waters is obviously an inventive writer, and the film remains interesting for the duration. The performance is solid as you would expect, but I must admit that I found the lead actress Rachael Stirling embarrassed and difficult to start at the beginning; although it grows in its role as the film progresses. The performance is a bit problematic and the director Geoffrey Sax is a bit too confusing for my taste. The story also gets a bit puzzled in the end, which is a shame, because this movie is stronger during the dark moments (episode 2 is the high point of three for me). There's really no set point for the movie - or at least not one I could see. This is not important to me; however, as Tipping the Velvet tells a good story and more than surpassed my expectations. Worth checking out for people who like this sort of thing.
