Probably the best comedy in a long time. keeps you laughing without stopping! the acting is good and there are lots of hilarious appearances, like Ben even more like the guy from the guitar shop. The plot was not as good as I'd hoped, but the comedy made up for it. I can only hope for a cause of sequel, it seems they can still do much more. Even if it was 1 hour and 40 minutes I still wanted more in the end :) there is also a scene after the credits which is really one of my favorite parts of the movie! I suggest this to anyone who likes a good comedy and definitely suggest it to fans of The D or Jack Black. You should buy the album too, the songs are so captivating and hilarious, the song on it is Top Notch as well.
