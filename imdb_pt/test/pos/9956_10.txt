never having actually seen anything for this beloved of luvvies, let alone a venice merchant production, I can not comment on how faithful he is to the previous adaptations of the game, so I'll treat him as just another movie that tries to be more of which novocaine for the eye MoV is an instantly exciting movie about a young lover bassanio (fiennes) and his friend merchant antton (irons) and a shylock jew money lender (pacino) <br /> Bassiano is broken and needs money to conquer the lovely portia (collins), he goes to his friend Antonio, who sypathises with his friends situation, then lends some money away shylock <br /> <br /> now antonio not as Jews in general and shylock in particular and bitter and twisted shylock of the abuse he suffered from anttonio in particular and Christians in general agree to lend money to Antonio with the proviso that if antonio did not pay the loan <br /> <br /> The film is breathtaking and is represented in a way to force you to think about what each line means, what causes the viewer to get insight into the characters and their motivations <br /> <br /> seems to me to be a movie about the choices that shylock makes, and how to make wrong choices leads to the ruin of the shylocks <br /> <br /> shylock moment demands his pound of flesh that he is condemned, to the rest of the world is against him and connivance to bring his fall <br /> <br /> this disturbed me a lot , usually in a movie when a victim has a chance of revenge against those who harmed him or the victim can or makes the villain see the error of his ways leading to a big hug <br /> <br /> not on MoV the victim quickly becomes seen as the villain and is stripped of his fortune and faith <br /> <br /> this film is a powerful portrait and subtle of casual anti-Semitism that shows how a whole society can turn into a minority and make it look like the victim is really the offender <br /> <br /> I was impressed with this movie 10/10
