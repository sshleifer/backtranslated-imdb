Yes, I know, Roscoe Arbuckle did not like being called 'Fatty', but I could not resist the joke. <br /> <br /> This is a good Lloyd Hamilton short of his peak period, directed by Roscoe. The two work together with many good jokes and Roscoe's usual attention to the details of filming the photo in an interesting way. Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses a pair of long tracking shots and some cool camera tricks to tell his story and to show Ham as a good actor as well as a talented comedian. <br /> <br /> This story plays with some interesting themes, such as Lloyd's classic, MOVE ALONG: here's about the perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make about them. Or you can choose to ignore these problems and laugh out of your head.
