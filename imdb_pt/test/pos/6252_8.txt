Do not you just hate slashers that never seem to start? Sometimes it takes an entire hour of red herring before any real action happens. "Tourist Trap" is not so! If it's typically a horrible scam you want ... it's typically horrible, you'll do it! So much and constantly from start to finish! This movie contains what is probably the greatest opening sequence in the 80s horror movie when a teenager stumbles on an abandoned house and beaten by a frightening collection of wax statues. Four other lambs arrive at the house and find a totally insane maniac who looks a bit like a mixture of Leatherface (from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and one of those wacky sculptors from old wax museum films. "Tourist Trap" is an exciting horror entertainment with genuine suspense, gruesome images, extreme strangeness, morbid humor and great makeup effects. The twists are not always original and the acting is pretty bad, but seriously, who cares? The fast pace and killer icon made this "Tourist Trap" win a spot among my 5 favorite slashers. A bit surprising is the total lack of nudity, however. What a pity, because all the girls seem sweeping and after only 10 minutes, the obligatory line "Who needs swimwear?" It is spoken.
