Robert Montgomery and Robert Young stand out as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in Italy during the First World War. The dialogue is a lot of fun, and Jimmy Durante is hilarious as the ship's cook, "Ptomaine." The character of Walter Huston is inspiring as the captain of the submarine, a stellar example of officer and gentleman. One of the most interesting aspects of this film was the level of technology displayed in the battle scenes. I was struck by the similarity of World War I technology with the technology exhibited 25 years later in World War II. Basic human nature was portrayed as very similar to modern times, and far from the conservatism I thought existed in the so-called "innocent" past. Overall, I felt the cast, characters, action scenes and vision of the story portrayed in this film were top notch.
