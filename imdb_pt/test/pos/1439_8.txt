A dark and painful look at the dangers of drug addiction, Sinatra is wonderful in this movie. Just watching her frantic twisting and screaming and destructive rage near the end of the movie is enough to make someone think twice before trying heroin; maybe they should show this to the children in health class instead of the stupid stupid we are forced to endure year after year. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a man who is simply trying to make a clean, new life after being in prison, trying to get rid of his drug addiction and his job of playing cards in illegal gambling operations , which is pulled down, dragged into the mud by the evils of human nature. He is being taken advantage of by his employers, drug dealers and even his enigmatic, cunning and stupid wife. <br /> <br /> Even if you did not like the movie itself, it's worth just watching the soundtrack. It's all heavy, swinging jazz with big sections of drums and brass. This, with its groovy but somewhat sinister sound, helps set the mood along with the drug dealers and snaky smiling cards that always seem to hover like vultures around Frankie Machine. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to anyone - especially if you like noir movies, zoot, fedoras or jazz suits.
