Hilary, clean, carefree and worthy of a quote. What else can you ask for in a movie? This is my number one favorite movie of all time. Since I was a little girl, I dreamed of having a blue van with flames and an observation bubble. <br /> <br /> The cliche characters in ridiculous situations are what make this movie great fun. The wonderful comedic chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) makes up most of my favorite parts of the film. And who did not love Flynch's hopeless embarrassment? Do not forget the pranks of the airport of Leon's friends, dressed as Hari Krishnas: dancing, singing and playing the tambourine - unbeatable! The tracks are cool, the locations are classic and the plot is timeless. <br /> <br /> A word to the wise, if you did not watch this movie when you were little, it probably will not win place in your heart today. But even so, take a chance, you may find that "no matter what you say, no matter what you do, you have to play."
