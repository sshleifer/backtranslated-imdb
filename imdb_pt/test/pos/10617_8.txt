"The piano teacher" is all about the character of Huppert; a middle-aged classical piano instructor with a stoic facade behind which hides a powerfully compelling aberrant personality. Unsatisfactory as a story, but intriguing as a character study, the film follows Huppert's character through the term of his distressed relationship with a student who presents superb performances in the process. Not for everyone, "The Piano Teacher" will play better in foreign films and character-driven dramas that deal with bleak issues. (AN-)
