Unfortunately, this original mix of action and laughter is kept among film fans, who rot in Columbia's coffers for eternity. A pity as it may be Jack Starrett's strongest movie and features a witty screenplay of a young Terrence Malick and completely performed performances by his two leaders Stacey Keach and Frederic Forrest who turn to life for crime so they can get the money to open a seafood restaurant. Many prominent scenes include interrogation by bathtub and electric razor, and an intense shootout in an abandoned building when it is being knocked over by a demolition ball!
