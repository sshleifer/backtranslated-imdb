Totally different, with loads of euphemism and black comedy, this is a movie that few can see, but those who do remember it. This movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way. What is it about? Strangeness, I believe. Probably even for the viewer, but I discovered that this movie tries to say something about the coolness and emptiness behind all the design furniture and perfect facades. I do not know if I'm right. But this movie really caught me. Look. I really hope the team behind this movie make more movies, and that they continue to do this on their own, some kind of weird style. And I forgot: Casting here is superb, with Trond Fausa Aurv√•g being perfect in the role of Inconvenient Man, who does not understand where he is, what he's doing and why. The recognition of not understanding the purpose of life (in the city) is what bothers you. All others do as they are told and pretend (?) To be happy. This movie is a good and funny commentary on life in 2006.
