Ok, this may not be the most sophisticated movie you'll see. In fact, there is a bit of "sophistication" in it. It's childish, adolescent, harmless, idiot ... And totally hilarious. Basically, Richie and Eddie run the worst hotel in Britain. Give some ridiculous antics to the guests as they hit each other, try to get the rent money from the only resident who is foolish enough to stay, drink all night with the boys of the mill next door ... And fall into lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press. Try it if you are a fan of Rik and Ade and their work. If you're not ... Do not start the movie. That simple. <br /> <br /> * I'm not being thick, this is a word of another of Rik's fabulous travels in the movie world ^ _ ^
