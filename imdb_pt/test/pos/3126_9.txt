Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Photos from Argosy / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> John Ford brings stock company to the Utah desert to film a western and comes with this classic smaller. Without John Wayne, no anti-hero conflicts, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a jewel of an image. <br /> <br /> This piece will ensemble stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They are horse dealers who enter the city to do some business, just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the way out. The group is about to embark on a journey to their own settlement, but they know that the odds and difficult terrain are against them. So they hire Travis and Sandy as wagon masters for the trip. Along the way they run and take with them a medicine peddler and his two cohorts (Alan Mowbray as doctor, recalling his appearance in My Darling Clementine and Joanne Dru as his "daughter"). The tension is added when Clegg's murderous gang arrives at the wagon. And there's also an atypical meeting (for Hollywood) with the Navajo. <br /> <br /> Most of history and humor is driven by the clash of ideals / cultures; first between Travis and Sandy and the Mormons, between Ward Bond himself (he is constantly trying to suppress his will to curse and be a reformed man), between the doctor and his ladies and the Mormons, between the coach and the lawless, and finally, all and the Navajo. There is also a classic Ford scene of a turbulent dance that expresses one of its signature themes of civilization reaching the border. <br /> <br /> Again, there is no Duke here, but I found Ben Johnson, especially the young ones. Ben Johnson, to have an engaging presence on screen. He comes with his own past, with that accent and also when you see him doing all the acrobatics of himself. He is great here in one of his first credited appearances. Harry Carey Jr., despite being out there for a few years, is still pretty raw sometimes, but he's nice. Ward Bond is his wonderful, stormy self. I found Joanne Dru to be a bummer in everything I see in her, but here she is mercifully discreet. Other well-known faces include Jane Darwell, Francis Ford and Hank Worden, playing "dumb" as he goes on The Searchers a few years later. No more fun here. <br /> <br /> There are some absolutely spectacular b & w photographs from frequent Ford collaborator Bert Glennon. Not only is there a typical lesson on landscapes and horizons, but some have flourished in a handful of scenes with shadow and light (sun). The soundtrack features the legendary country music group, The Sons of the Pioneers. You can not get more cowboy than that. <br /> <br /> *** Â½ of 4
