Newly pregnant, Knight loses her husband for non-specific reasons, apparently related to herself. On the road, she becomes embroiled in Caan, a former football star with brain problems, and Duvall, an eccentric but abusive cop. The kind of movie that could only have been generated in the 60's. It pays to look at its non-formulaic plot and for the first performances of future stars. <br /> <br /> Disappointing resolution does not take away much of the rest of the film, which shows an interesting slice of life.
