I saw it last night and I voted for an "8". Since then it has grown on me and I would give a "9". <br /> <br /> The film has (at first) a seemingly slightly disconnected facade between the first and second half. The first half is a comedy and there is little hint of the unpleasant truths of eras, life, wars, religious intolerance that will be revealed in the second half. Although at first it may be a bit disconcerting, because it is an unfamiliar narrative sequence, in the reflection works. <br /> <br /> The performance was good (Hultz, in the role of Alex the interpreter, was especially great). <br /> <br /> I have looked at most of the other "User Comments" and saw that some who have read the book are satisfied with the movie, while some are not. Both feelings, of course, are valid. <br /> <br /> For me, a retired family therapist and a worldwide believer, the film was relevant on two different levels. The first, as history, has given a powerful reminder of how polarizations happen - demonizing and trying to exterminate anyone with a system of moral values ​​different from ours. The second was that by demonstrating the first, it also revealed something in common to each one of us, ALL of our families - that each of us must return to our roots to understand ourselves more completely. TS Eliot expressed this exquisitely in the room of his "Four Quartets" when he said: - "We will not end the exploration" // And the end of all our exploration // It will be to arrive where we started // And to know the place for the first time. " <br /> <br /> Jonathan makes a rewarding journey that any of us would find fantastically enlightening - to explore and discover our roots; what the people were going through then, who they were - really! - before, when and during the first few years before and after birth? Etc. So the film initially gives us the impression of a comedy, so it changes to give us a lesson in history and human shortcomings, but through it all it also gives us - subliminally - a message about each one of us. All of us would be abundantly rewarded to go back and understand where we started.
