Having seen the original when I was 13 (and yes, I was stupid enough to watch it while I was babysitting!), I was excited to see this remake. <br /> <br /> Camilla Bell did a great job as Jill Johnson. . And the fact that a teenage horror film could be made in the year 2006 without tremendous vulgarity and blood, made the film even stronger. I had fun trying not to chew my nails! <br /> <br /> This movie will not win anyone's Oscar, but it's fun and it's worth the matinee ticket I bought to see it. I think girls around the world should watch the original and the remake ... and then decide never to take it anymore. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that I'm glad I'm too old to babysit! There is just something about being in a dark and scary home with sleeping kids that makes this movie classic. No blood, no blood ... just good psychological fun! WINNER!
