This movie is about three teenagers who have been best friends for a longer time, and go on the most confusing ride of their lives. When Heroin becomes the drug of choice in your town, these three teenagers get caught up in it all. This movie portrays heroin addiction very well and is something you can not stop watching. MTV has never been the best at making movies, but it has a lot of good content not to watch it. I liked this movie, at first I thought it would be the worst movie I've ever seen, but as it was, it got better, and I could not get away.
