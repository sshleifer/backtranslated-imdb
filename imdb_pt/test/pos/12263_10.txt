I say, unfortunately, because if you see this movie now, you realize just how low our media sank - all the warning signs are in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, I think the last great James Brooks movie, but others may disagree. He has rich characters (which are convincing as well), great performances, great compositions, and although the song got a little tacky, I even liked that. <br /> <br /> William Hurt has never been better. Holly Hunter is awesome. And Albert Brooks walks away with all the scenes in which he is in this triangle of people who are beautifully attractive and attractive and have made the whole film rise above its vital and important topic of the News, and how it is slowly being compromised in our nation. Watch this with the NETWORK for a truly fun and scary evening.
