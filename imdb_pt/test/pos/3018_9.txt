When I saw this movie for the first time, I was surprised and a bit shocked by the vibe of the story. It's a very artistic drama with incredible special effects, spectacular acting, not to mention a great job in the makeup department. Jennifer Lopez drew from past roles that she dug in her career with this film, portraying a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of engineers to enter the minds of comatose patients to treat them. Vincent D'onofrio played incredibly well. His portrayal of a sadistic serial killer was perfect for a T. The pure emotion conveyed by his performance is impressive. Vince Vaughn is not my favorite, but still performed exceptionally well. Symbolism and art were intriguing and exciting, sometimes surprising and sometimes shocking. Overall, I say this is a wonderful movie with excellent acting and beautiful works of art.
