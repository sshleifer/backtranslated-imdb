There are so many positive comments in Return to Me that my opinion is not necessary to encourage you to watch this movie. However, I feel the need to express my admiration for this unique film. Bonnie Hunt proved that she is not only an exceptional actress but also a wonderful director and screenwriter. This movie has it all and is full of humanity, tenderness, sense of humor ... Do not miss it, do not wait any longer. And he does not pay any attention to poor criticism. Some viewers forget that this type of film needs to be watched with the heart, not just with the eyes. If some viewers prefer Notting Hill or You've Have Mail, that's their mistake. For me, Return to Me is a real gem, an unforgettable movie.
