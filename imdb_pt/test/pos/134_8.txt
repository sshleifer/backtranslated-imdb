(This was edited into space) <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park's new movie is a complex movie that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror film, the central character is a vampire, the movie actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analogue of viral invasion of a body), romance and a few other things as well. It's a film that has almost too much in mind. The film has its own subjects and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case "Thérèse Raquin" by Emile Zola. It's a strange mixture that does not always gel, but nevertheless has incredible power. Here are almost 24 hours since I saw the movie at Lincoln Center (with a post-movie discussion by the director) and I think my cage is getting more and more hectic. It is not so much what happens is uncomfortable, it is more than its far-reaching story and its themes play many bells in retrospect. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film has a dear priest deciding that the best way to help humanity volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease. Infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies, but because of a vampire blood transfusion (not explained) he actually survives. Acclaimed as a miracle worker, the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick. Unfortunately not everything is ok. The priest discovers that he needs blood to survive. He also discovers that he has all the typical problems of a vampire, and it is not possible for him to leave during the day. Things get even more complicated when he meets up with a childhood friend and his family. The priest, some of his animal passions awakened, is taken with his friend's wife. From there everything goes to the side. <br /> <br /> An ever-changing film, this is a story that revolves in a variety of genres because it tells the very human story of a man who thinks his life has been radically altered. by a chance event and discovers that he is no longer who he thought he was. It's a movie that you have to stay to the end because the movie is always evolving into something else. It's also a movie that has a lot in mind and the themes with which it plays are constantly being explored in various ways. <br /> <br /> The film is quite successful, and people will probably, write books discussing the film. <br /> <br /> The two strongest parts of the film are its vampire elements and its romance. The vampire part of the tale is brilliant. There is something about laying down the ground rules and the nature of "affliction" that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside. Sitting at the theater last night, I was surprised at how well it worked. I think the fact that he played more or less straight is what is so tremendous. Here's a vampire who just wants to have a normal life. It is contrasted with what happens next, makes it clear that living a human existence of hunting really will not work. It's not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys, but something different. Personally, I think the film changes the playing field of a funky idea or dreams of something more real and tangible. (The sequence in which powers come in is pretty cool.) The novel is also beautifully treated. Of course the sex scenes are smoky and well made, but it's the other things, the looks, the conversation, the out-of-sex gestures that make it special. I love the look, the silent stares as the forbidden couple looks hungry on each other and unable to act, the disappointment and broken heart of betrayal, both real and suspicious, and mad passion for the possible consummation. This is one of the great screen novels of all time. Perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love (and lust). If you have ever loved deeply, I think you will find some part of your ear on the screen, I know I did. The statement "I just wanted to spend eternity with you" has a sad pungency for it. It is both a statement of intent and depth of emotion. The tragic romance will break your heart. <br /> <br /> I will not lie to you and say that the movie is perfect and great. It's not as good as the plays are and almost all of them are great (especially the actors that I've unfairly failed to remember) the whole does not always come together. The various genres, thematic elements and tones occasionally rival each other. Often I wanted to know where the movie was going. I stayed there even though the movie seemed to wander aimlessly. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie. I loved the pieces more than the movie as a whole. It's been dripping in my head ever since I've seen it, and I'm guessing it's going to do it for a few more days. Kind or love is irrelevant, since this is a film that really should be seen, since there is so much going on that will provide you enough material to think and talk for days afterwards. One of the meatiest and most stuffed movies of the year.
