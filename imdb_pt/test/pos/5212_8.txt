This is a movie that I keep coming back for a variety of reasons. As proof of the common soldier's suffering on the Eastern Front in World War II, he is powerful. There are a number of very powerful scenes in the film that help capture the horror of war, such as tank battle, for example. Also, from what I can see the experiences documented in the film are generally "true" - if you read A. Beevor's book "Stalingrad," you will know what I mean. The film is also successful in that it does not allow the character or plot to dominate it - it is simply a survival tale, which attempts to portray the battle mainly from the point of view of the common (German) soldier. I read somewhere that the original script had to be tempered, which did not surprise me at all - if they really tried to show what the battle was like, it would be almost impossible to be sure. Even so, there are still some difficult times to watch - this was done before Soldier Ryan, but it's possibly harder in some places. Just a word of caution - do not buy the dubbed version in English, it's horrible and spoils the movie - try to get a copy in the original (German) version with English subtitles, it's much more powerful. You may need to purchase a Region 1 DVD from the movie in this case, as I did.
