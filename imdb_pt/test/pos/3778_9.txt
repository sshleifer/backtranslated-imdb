This movie was one of three that were later combined by Chapin in a compilation that was released in theaters in the late 1950s under the title "The Chaplin Review." <br /> <br /> This was a strange movie in some ways, because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his films emphasized peace and brotherhood. This film, by contrast, is a propaganda comedy designed to bolster US efforts in World War One. It's really strange to see Charlie as the "super soldier" who alone catches 13 Germans casually and coldly films several Germans in a few seconds as a sniper and then goes after the enemy lines to try to capture Kaiser himself! Truly, this was a great departure for the Little Tramp, although it was both very fun and funny at the same time. The film is exceptionally well paced, well done and I'm sure it did a lot to reinforce home support for our troops (shame it was such a useless and expensive war).
