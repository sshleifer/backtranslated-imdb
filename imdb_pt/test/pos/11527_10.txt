I must admit that this is one of the unpublished films of Cameron Diaz and I was also surprised that she played an important role, but she was not the leader. I was very moved by this because I can actually identify the pain of losing a loved one as I experienced it closely. Both Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were very good in their portrayal of the protagonist Phoebe and I should also turn it over to cast people to find two actresses who look so much alike that I actually thought they were sisters (in real life). This is one of those movies that Cameron made to act and not to the billing of the stars. She looked like the part of the beautiful, rebellious hippie who wants to change the world, though sometimes she appears as a rebel without a cause. Coming from a dysfunctional family where her only source of strength is her older sister, Faith, the girl Phoebe is understandably very upset when the faith departs for Europe. As she grows up, she goes off in search of her sister and gradually becomes disillusioned with the truth about her sister and falls in love with her sister's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Great history and equally excellent rental around Europe. I'll watch it again.
