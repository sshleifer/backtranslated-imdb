This movie is a masterpiece. It was exciting from start to finish. The story of screenwriter and director Paul Thomas Anderson about a porn star is told with style, grace, humor and even pungency. The actors and characters they play are all top-notch, including Mark Wahlberg in the lead, who is a solid actor and can take a movie. Burt Reynolds gives perhaps his best performance as director of porn that discovers Wahlberg. The film recreates the late 1970s and early 1980s with absolute precision, from the disco scene that begins the film to Don Johnson's "Miami Vice" Wahlberg outfit that he uses in the final scene. Most filmgoers watching this movie no doubt compare it to PULP FICTION, but it really does have a lot more in common with the Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese movies. The film is a triumph in style. The first opening screening that begins the film is as impressive as those of THE PLAYER and ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS. The Dylan Tichenor edition is simply phenomenal. I could not believe the issue did not get an Oscar nomination (GOOD WILL HUNT was a better edited movie ?!). The best scene in the movie has to be the one with the fireworks. I had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense. When I saw the film a second time, I had exactly the same reaction to the scene. Unfortunately, it may not have the same impact on TV as it does on a stereo with a good stereo. It's a shame that a lot of people have not watched this movie during their theatrical performance, because that's the best way to watch it. The widescreen use by Anderson will suffer on TV (so grab the DVD or a letterbox tape). It's amazing how easy Anderson makes it all look like, because this is just his second movie. Music, scenery, fantasies, photography, unusual characters, sex, violence, happiness and hurt are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with the movies.
