I just saw this movie on Showtime in the early hours of the night. I was seeing the beginning with one eye open, but instead of falling asleep, I got involved in this cunning and bitter film of a movie. It was very believable and engaging. I could have done without much swearing (as in all of David Mamet's films I see), but I really enjoyed the experience. I know teens swear, but I do not need to hear it. Anyway, the story had some interesting surprises that I will not reveal, but if you get the chance to watch this movie on Showtime, I think you'll like it as much as I do.
