A woman and her aunt go to Scotland to locate their evasive fiance. This is a very slandered movie because of its outcome, but up to that point, it's interesting, well-meaning, mysterious and beautifully designed (by William Cameron Menzies, developed for 3-D projection). Veronica Hurst is captivating and kind, a British sort of Marilyn Monroe, still in love with Richard Carlson, who hides a family secret in his imposing castle; there are even bats in the belfry! He moves slowly until the last extraordinary move, when Hurst and his aunt (Katherine Emery, also the narrator) escape from the castle at night to venture into the maze and find what they are looking for in their center. As a child, I always remembered this sequence - there is nothing more frightening (or claustrophobic) than not finding the way out of a maze of hedges 3 meters high. Of course, the two women separate, setting the stage for the suspense surrounding with horrible music. The end result is slightly disappointing, since Carlson's epilogue at the end makes some sense to all events, even provoking sympathy. Worth seeing.
