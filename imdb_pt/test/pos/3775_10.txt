I saw this movie for the first time in the early 80's and we used to have it in betamax. As we all know, betamax was the 8-trak tape path, sigh, really had good image quality as well. Anyway, I'm glad I found this movie again, I've been searching for over 10 years! This film falls into the category of films like Airplane: continuous jokes, oneliners, funny actions (bodylanguage). Mark Blankfield is absolutely hilarious. His transformation from the timid dr. Daniel Jekyll in an animal annihilated by sex, Mr. Hyde, is unforgettable, complete with gold teeth, ram's chest and gold chains. The part I loved most was when he kidnapped that poor old man's car and then drove to Madame Woo Woo's. Totally psychedelic experience without drugs! If you need laugh therapy, this is the movie to do this. When I first saw it, I had tears in my eyes and my belly was aching to laugh constantly. This is a movie that I could watch over and over again. I recommend.
