May contain spoilers <br /> <br /> This historical film was very refreshing. Although he may be exaggerating the actual events, it shows the inhuman nature of the emperor Qui, which he was later infamous. And there was not a single computer-generated person in it. I think it's great that China has produced such an epic movie. The costumes and settings were beautiful, the performances were also excellent. Dignity versus death is an important theme in this film and I think it reflects Chinese history and culture. I also liked a little allusion to terracotta warriors, a 3D carved map of China's conquest with individual soldiers. Emperor Thou, of course, later buried with his life-size terracotta warriors. <br /> <br /> I also liked the scene with the dwarf, he was a very interesting character, even if he had only a small scene. <Br/> 9/10 <br /> <br />
