This movie is the biggest ninja movie ever made in my opinion and if you have not seen it, it's worth watching. I would rate this movie a 10/10 if you want to see more, so check out http://uk.geocities.com/ninja3thedomination The opening sequence where the evil ninja is killing everyone on his way is great, his character is the best . He then has to possess a young woman who finds him dying. She then has to take revenge on the police who killed him, which means there are more deaths and actions. But only a ninja can destroy a ninja so she and her boyfriend, who is also one of her targets, get the help of Yamad (Sho Kosugi) to release the evil ninja's spirit and destroy it.
