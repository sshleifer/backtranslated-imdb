John Huston has finished his remarkable career with one of the most perfect and sensitive films I have ever seen. For his farewell, he decided to adapt James Joyce's beautiful tale, "The Dead," and made not only one of the most faithful adaptations of literature to film, but also created a film that more than 20 years later still far surpasses. this film a few years ago as a student of the University, I looked amazed at the screen, marveling at every aspect of the film: acting, screenwriting, direction, costumes, settings, music, cinematography. Thinking about it now, I still can not criticize anything. Huston could only tell a good story. <br /> <br /> A good deal of credit should also be given to Tony Huston. He knew better than to meddle with a text that is not just the perfection itself but already sufficiently visual for the movies. Father and son let the story breathe and savor the long and fascinating conversations between the characters and the significant silences. <br /> Donal McCann also deserves credit for his performance as Gabriel Conroy. I had never seen him in movies before, nor did I see him after, but he gave one of the most moving performances I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> In all, The Dead is a great cinematic experience. , of a legendary director who never ceased to be excellent.
