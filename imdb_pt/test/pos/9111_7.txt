When I first heard that Jack Black and Kyle Gass were going to make a movie about their band, I was freaking out! I love their music and I was hoping this movie was very funny! Now that I have watched, I can not say that those hopes were not met, but I think I expected more. The movie is full of good Tenacious D music and I really enjoyed hearing it all. There are many good jokes and I love the story, at least the first part. I do not like the way the movie ends. The ending is very abrupt and in my opinion they could have extended a little more. <br /> <br /> Overall I think it's a good movie to watch! Everyone who likes rock should watch it! You're going to have a good laugh!
