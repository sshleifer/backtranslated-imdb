The direction is brilliant, the cast is remarkable (although I would love to have seen a bit more of Aaron Lustig (from the Y & R fame) who played Paul Shaffer). I only have two little jokes about the movie, however subtle they may be. One-Roebuck's Leno is excellent, but his stage presence (that is, during what looks like the recording of one of his last few episodes) is a little lower than expected. Two - the distribution of foul language. I am willing to tolerate foul language, as long as it is not used for free and to some extent the movie was free. The language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce the pathetic of Bates' well-portrayed Kushnick by his frequent use of it, and served to make the Roebuck Leno a good thing because of its lack of use (of course, if the characters really behaved in this way, congratulations to all). However, the piece is excellent, as far as television and video are concerned. The film, I feel, had potential for the big screen, but would have required re-casting for small parts, and probably a different director, too (the aesthetic feel is that of Larry Sanders' show, good for HBO, mediocre for cinematographic purposes).
