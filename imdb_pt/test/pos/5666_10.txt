<br /> <br /> Giorgino is a strange, obscure and obsessive object; the cast is impressive, the plot is powerful, it reminded me of Edgar Poe's tales. Probably not a masterpiece, but it leaves us with the memory of strong images, good music, fear, sadness, confusion and a phrase that says it all: the wolves are coming. GIORGINO is now forgotten and when it was released, no one seemed to enjoy it. This is a shame. If you have a chance to see this, well ... give it a try.
