I really do not care that anyone here likes this movie, I do, and that's what this review is about. Lou Diamond Phillips is great at this comedic role. this train line abc is now for me an instant classic, the cg is great, yes train looks a bit fake, but the aliens wow they already rock "Todd Bridges" where Arnold is, and Mr. Drummond, wow he is out of the loop, I think that's what the prison does with you .. a bullet train is on his way to Las Vegas with the senator for him to make a great speech, a meteor has just hit, and now all of a sudden we have aliens running loose on the train, and our cop has to save the day, to make matters worse, your ex-wife is arguing with him. I just thought this movie was so wonderful, a must see if you like action.
