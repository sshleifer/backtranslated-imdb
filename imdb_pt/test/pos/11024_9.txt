Niagara, Niagara is an impressive and moving story about the two outsiders Seth and Marcy. Robin Tunney does a fantastic performance when Marcy suffers from Tourette's Sydrome, getting increasingly sick as the movie progresses. This movie is not very optimistic and is very difficult emotional, but at the same time very romantic. It's hard to explain, but see and find out for yourself. Definitely worth it.
