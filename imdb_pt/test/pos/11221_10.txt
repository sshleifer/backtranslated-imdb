After thinking a bit more about this movie, I find it very easy to dismiss it as the boy's dream. I actually received some spiritual strength from Northfork ....... Angels exist .... we are definitely entertained by Angels .... most of the time we are not even aware of it ..... At a point of turbulence spiritual and emotional in my life, I personally needed this film. Yes, as I wrote before, talk to so many ...... I can not wait to get to Heaven ... <br /> <br /> "Being so fed up with all the FX and Formula things, I found this film a genuine cinema, all I can say is that it touched me in so many ways, that I am still solving everything.North Fork is a wonderful movie that brings the viewer's mind out of the gutter. is very intriguing to me.Please note, because you will need to use the brain and heart that God gave you to follow the story.I think it is possibly a little on the head of some, but I feel these are the individuals with whom he speaks more importantly.I want to see this several times, so that I can absorb all of this. <br /> <br /> The industry needs to study this film to realize that we exist <br /> <br /> My thanks to all involved in the realization of this movie.
