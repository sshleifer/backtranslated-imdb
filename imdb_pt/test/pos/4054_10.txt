I saw this movie on PBS for the first time. So I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch, I get something else out of it. It is a true testimony of wanting to maintain a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you do not have to be old enough to cling to the past, even young characters like Charlotte do not want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is excellent with stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy. And it's fun to see the stars ahead before releasing recognizable films such as Kevin J. O'Connor (The Mummy) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Men in Black and Law & Order: Criminal Intent - one of my favorite shows ). It's just one of those movies that stays with you.
