It's the old, old story: kids party in an old house, demons are loosed, death and free nudity ensue. You all know that, it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Many people (okay, many horror fans, to be specific) have fond memories of this movie and it is always with a slight fear that you revisit an old movie to see if it's still as good as you used to think it was. Fortunately, that is. <br /> <br /> There's something for everyone (well, everyone who's a man, I suppose). From an amusing sequence of titles to a scam involving the clever use of Linnea Quigley's butt to the "mirrored" scene to the utmost in demonic fun, this is a blast from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Girls are cute the guys are. . . . male, the death scenes are well done with some good bloody effects and, unlike some horrors of the era, this actually maintains a good sense of atmosphere and even tension everywhere. Do not get me wrong, it's still fun at first, but it does offer some good and weird moments that should please most fans of the genre.
