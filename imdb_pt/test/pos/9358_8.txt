"Crossfire" is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that is a murder mystery with a strong message. It stars Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Levene and Gloria Grahame, and is heavily directed by Edward Dmytryk. We witnessed the shadow killing at the beginning, and for the rest of the film, Young, like Detective Finlay, in charge of the case, seeks to find out which of the three soldiers is responsible for death, and as important as, why. The victim, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), is someone the soldiers meet in a bar; they go to his apartment to continue his visit, and Samuels ends up dead. <br /> <br /> I do not know about 1947, but seeing "Crossfire" today, someone knows who did it and why the minute they see the suspects. I did not think it was so apparent back then, since these actors were just beginning. However, the film has a major impact with its powerful acting, good direction, violence and ruthless anti-Semitic language. <br /> <br /> The characterizations are vivid, including that of Gloria Grahame in a small role - she is a woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspicious soldiers, in a bar and can provide her with an alibi . The great performance of the film belongs to Robert Ryan, but everyone is excellent. Robert Young, in particular, is effective as a robust but intelligent police detective. Mitchum is very nice as a soldier who tries to help his confused friend Mitchell, a lonely, insecure man if he still has feelings for his wife. <br /> <br /> Really great and a must see.
