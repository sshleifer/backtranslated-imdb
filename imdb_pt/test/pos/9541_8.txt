This almost perfect film version of Edith Nesbit's popular children's novel follows the lives of Roberta (Bobbie), Phyllis and Peter, and her mother after her father is unjustly accused of treason and sent to jail. Are they going to live in an almost uninhabitable house in the country that is near a railway line? the mother writes stories to make enough money for food and candles while children spend much of their time around the train station and specifically waving to a particular train to "send their love to their father." Always an engaging and intelligent novel, the characters are brought to life under the perceptive direction of Lionel Jeffries (better known as an excellent actor). Jenny Agutter plays Bobbie, while Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren are her sister and brother. His mother is Dinah Sheridan, while the other memorable characters are played by Bernard Cribbins (Perks, the railroad man) and William Mervyn (the old gentleman of the train). <br /> <br /> 'The Railway Children' is gentle entertainment from another era, but it does its job beautifully. As we watch Bobbie grow up with the worries of an absent father struggling against his own needs both to be alone and to have fun, we can only rejoice when events come together at the end of the scene. Throughout all the time do we have a sense of time and place? be it from steam trains, university paper chasing or red flannel petticoats used by girls (and used to avoid disaster!).
