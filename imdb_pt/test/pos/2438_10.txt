Well, I do not know much about anything, but I'm sure I enjoyed this movie. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple and comforting. In other words, it was all he set out to be. <br /> <br /> The story goes around a girl's first love (as the title suggests) and I must surely warn you: do not expect anything challenging or provocative in terms of the subject here. I mean, it's a childlike drawing. It's really just a simple story, but it's well told, and holds your attention well. <br /> <br /> In the end: it's short, it's funny, it's cute, it's simple, it's good.
