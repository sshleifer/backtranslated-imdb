Everything you would expect if you are a Jackass fan. As always Knoxville and its crew risk life and limb just for our viewing entertainment. If you are a fan of the series and the first movie, you will not be disappointed as most of the time. The jokes they do to each other are twice as funny, cruel and cruel as ever, and the stunts and challenges are twice as difficult as any Jackass episode you have ever seen. If you're a fan, do not waste time, check it out yourself, because by Jackaass standards, this movie is an easy 10 out of 10 just for the opening credits, I can not go into details without spoilers, but you have to see it to believe .
