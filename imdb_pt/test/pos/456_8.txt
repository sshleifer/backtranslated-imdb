Yul Brynner is Major Surov, a Russian officer who sings and drinks vodka, parked near the Hungarian-Hungarian border during the Hungarian revolt of 1956 in Anatole Litvak's The Journey. Although the film has not yet been released on video or DVD, it remains one of Brynner's most compelling presentations. Because of the political upheaval, a group of travelers can not fly from Budapest, but is put on a bus to Vienna. Before they can reach the border, however, their passports are taken and they are detained for questioning by the Russians led by Major Surov. <br /> <br /> The Major has reason to suspect that there is a Hungarian freedom fighter among the groups being smuggled out of the country. In fact, Lady Ashmore is hiding a mysterious passenger, Paul Fleming (Jason Robards, Jr.), who pretends to be an American, but does not fool anyone. She is helping Fleming mainly to pay a debt she owed because of the problem her former association caused her. Among the other passengers is a British journalist played by Robert Morley, an American family represented by E.G. Marshall, his wife Anne Jackson and their two children, one of whom is the small screen debut of Ron Howard. <br /> <br /> Major Surov has a romantic interest in Lady Diana Ashmore (Deborah Kerr), and a novel of sorts develops between them. She offers him nothing but disdain and a hard upper lip, however, we suspect that beneath his heart he still beats. The intrigue of the Cold War and the powerful acting take history, but the novel is never convincing. There remains, however, one of my favorite films by Yul Brynner and deserves to be seen only by his passionate performance.
