Is it a full moon night? OH! It does not matter that they can change when they want because of this drug! What was I thinking if the full moon tonight?! Geez <br /> <br /> I really like this movie, there's romance, suspense, horror, and hot stuff;) I like the first half of the movie when the guy saves the girl from killing herself by bungee jumping and catching her. That was really cool. The setting of this movie is in the city of love that is Paris in France. The scenes of the cemetery are good, it gives shivers without knowing what will happen there or who is behind the walls. The scenes that make you jump out of your seat are really cool. Even they caught me in those scenes. His friend who died and the girl he killed in the graveyard but still shows himself to the main character (sorry I forgot his name), it was really funny. The actors did a good job, in addition to the make-up crews. The part where everyone is partying in an abandoned church, I can not believe people would do that because even if it's an abandoned church, that's still God's house. I bought this movie a long time ago and I do not regret having bought it. I'm a horror movie lover. I give this film 5 stars out of 6. For people who are open and love movies like this, give it a try, you may like it.
