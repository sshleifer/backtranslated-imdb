We saw it the other night on cable on-demand and thought, "This is the kind of movie that could have starred Alec Guiness and Glynis Johns if it had been made in the late 1950s." A farce in the English tradition. Alfred Molina and Brenda Blethyn are very sweet and sincere in their portraits. Naomi Watts simply chants in a ditazy way of Jayne Mansfield (if she could have acted). Rest of the cast has some great twists and turns. The Welsh landscape is delicious. An absurd premise, in fact and not at all believable, but that does not disturb the pleasure. Not a great movie, remember, but a really fun watch. And Walken is at his best crazy. A joy to behold!
