I'm shocked and discouraged that the Network has canceled the Talk Show with Spike Feresten! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the Fox Television Network, canceling the Talk Show with Spike Feresten and replacing it with Wanda Sikes? For those who are on the Net with little attention, Wanda At Large was canceled because the audience grew tired of their unpleasant insults that would leave the public terrified, and Wanda Sykes spitting his own brand of vengeful mud jokes is not humor, it's unpleasant and repulsive. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the Fox Television Network rewarded Wanda Sikes because she gained an important look over President Barak Obama. There is no doubt that Wanda's recent grumpy stare at the President of the United States is not funny and the laughter of the audience was only to patronize and please Barak Obama. <br /> <br /> Talk Show with Spike Feresten has a genuine sense of humor and has never deliberately or vengefully insulted any guest or performer. Spike's successful personality has always cheerfully ridiculed life and himself. And their Filed Pieces during the first two seasons with AFTRA actress Mary Mae Atwill, since the 21st century Mae West was absolutely hysterical with Spike Feresten's skits: Judge Joe Brown, Married Couples and James Kyson Lee Episode of Last Season, where Spike talks to Erica through the Internet on the show. <br /> <br /> Despite the Network's budget constraints for elaborate field pieces and Season Two's WGA Strike, Spike Feresten did not give up his sense of humor or show integrity. The Talk Show with Spike Feresten has always had new talents and its parody of Comedy for Stoners of Nanny 911 and Idiot Paparazzi were considered innovative and had an excellent production value. <br /> <br /> On a professional level, Spike Feresten was the best Executive Producer, and Set Producer, Brett Webster, along with his fabulous production team, was one of the best production teams I've worked on in my AFTRA career . It would be really too silly and sad to shame to cancel the Talk Show with Spike Feresten. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, your success could be brought to Comedy Central or another Network and Financially speaking, which would become a valuable revenue loss for FOX Television. <br /> <br /> On behalf of the late evening Fox audience, Talk Show supporters with Spike Feresten, including the entire cast and crew, asked the Network to retain the Talk Show with Spike Feresten Franchise and give the team a second chance to become a Fox Show success.
