Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" is not a Vietnam War movie. Do not confuse with one. It is set for the back drop of war, but it is a metaphorical exposition of the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche. It's also one of the most audacious films ever made, produced or even conceived (according to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Calling the masterpiece would be a euphemism of as ambitious proportions as the film's production levels). Opening uncredited and after a memorable first scene playing to the sound of Doors "The End" as Martin Sheen's captain Benjamin L. Willard hallucinates images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially presented in the first . 15 minutes, Willard's mission is "to end ... with extreme prejudice," Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has invariably left the confines of the Cambodian jungle and, as his general says, is "out there operating without any" Kurtz is a delirious Colonel who is now worshiped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him god. For Willard, this cache is a decent restriction, totally out of reach for any acceptable human conduct. "Operati seems a little more manageable than actual combat, but the journey he is about to undertake will be a personal quest that will challenge the boundaries of their human behavior. <br /> <br /> Joining a small team, they embark down the vast banks of the river in a fragile boat. Along the way, Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret.He was a normal man with a family, until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led the way that Willard is being led.The descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not too far away. the group as drugs and a kind of solitary confinement attacks their senses. But Willard seems undisturbed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. By reading about this mythical figure, he is drawn to the power of man and why he became what he became. We know that Willard's slow decay will match that of Kurtz. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. Your presence: unparalleled. Your genius: undeniable. But for those who do not know their acting prowess and are not accustomed to their physical nuances, Brando can be seen, in the eyes of an inflexible movie goer, as a hack. It certainly is not. Brando was difficult to work with, difficult to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for unintelligible words and incomparable monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing, even if we did not know. Your Colonel Kurtz is a being of unlimited illusions and continuous depth. <br /> <br /> If the film is an indication of the journeys to hell, Francis Ford Coppola's actual experience in making this masterpiece is a real account of a man's life. fanatical fight to produce a movie. It is reported that during the main shooting time of the film, more than 200 days, Coppola contemplated suicide. The film was not only an undeniable struggle to be made; It's a tiring movie to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of the smoking places, and his dedication spreads through the holes of Martin Sheen's Willard, a haunted soldier. <br /> <br /> I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this kind of movie. . At the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented, the films that challenged and stimulated were commonplace. In addition to Audacity, Apocalypse Now is pure cinema. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest level. But I shudder at the return to what has become the norm for today's movie standards: lack of innovation. It is not simply the lack of originality of the world of cinema today; is the fact that no one seems to mind telling a story or telling someone with a heart. But we still have the great ones like Coppola's masterpiece, a film that bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than we could understand. <br /> <br /> This depth in Apocalypse Now is the step to madness. Killing can get in the way. The loss of innocence can unbalance. But it is the damage from within; the countless dams of images that distress and distort us from our daily world and the memories that torment our deepest thoughts that eventually separate us from humanity and propel us into the realm of the instinctive, the savage and the animal. If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance, the act of killing provides man with his fundamental catharsis.
