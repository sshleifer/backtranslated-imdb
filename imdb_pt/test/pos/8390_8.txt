It just shows how wrong you can be. I did not expect to like this movie. I was disappointed with both Kill Bill movies (though I preferred the latter) and Death Proof (although it was better at the short cut of the double-billed release). I love Reservoir Dogs, I admire Pulp Fiction and I think Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature film - technically his most senior - including the last great performance of Robert De Niro. Since then, it seems to me while his films have gone well (I have not hated them) he has been treading water in juvenile referential, reverential, self-indulgent. <br /> <br /> So I read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and I hated it! Of course there were some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were some great characters. But on the page it was more youthful rubbish, largely ruined by the breadth of the title's uninteresting bastards. It made me think seriously about not seeing the movie. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I just changed my mind when I had the opportunity to see the movie with a following Tarantino Q & A in London. I thought it would be worth listening to him in questions and answers, as I know from interviews how fun it can be in person. <br /> <br /> So little was I prepared for the exuberant and brilliant amusement of Inglourious Basterds. <br /> <br /> Easily the best job of Mr. Tarantino since Jackie Brown is a triumph. <br /> <br /> Yes, the references are there, but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stand-in but he works well with little to do but looks aggressive, and does nothing to spoil the movie as I feared. While I admired Mr. Tarantino for using the stunt Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to heighten the joy of the main stunt scene, her lack of any acting ability on a key role was a problem for the film . The same could be said of Tarantino's appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote. <br /> <br /> What really makes this work is how big it is. The western vibrancy of the spaghetti for much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully exaggerated without falling too much into the quality of Kill Bill's cartoon. The violence is so great. The audacity is so great. Brad Pitt is so great! In the trailers, Hitler's moment and Pitt's performance bothered me, but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is really brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is the Mifune samurai in Yojimbo, he is Cheyenne's Robbers from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a lot of James Coburn vibe with him and of course a Lee Marvin advantage. Christoph Waltz (whom I did not know before) and Melanie Laurent (which I first noticed in a brilliant British short film in French by Sean Ellis) are sensational and I hope to see both of them use a lot more future. Tarantino clearly did not lose his eye to the cast, which seemed to abandon him in Death Proof. Waltz is also great at its performance. Chilling, still theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is adequately innocent of Cardinale, but sturdy, a fighter. Both dazzle here. <br /> <br /> That all cast members get the fun of what they're doing while they're not just having fun and trying to get laughs, it helps tremendously. Laughter - and there are loads - comes organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to taking a tip and going too far, but his scene is dominated just enough - with the help of Michael Fassbender, who seems to have been drawn directly from the model of the leader of the Great Escape Attenborough. <br /> <br /> All actors shine and Tarantino launches wonderful flourishes, but they work with history. Hugo Stiglitz's introduction of Schweiger is a riot. After a sensational opening of slow burning and a glorious introduction to these inglorious bastards, the rhythm never lets go more than two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> He also looks cute, marking this as a return to the actual movie. Doing more than just self-indulgent nonsense. Musical choices, as always, are inspired by Morricone. <br /> <br /> The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer where almost all the movies disappointed me, it was a huge surprise that the real fun and entertainment, but also the film involved and impressive, was this when I would have never believed in the script form. Welcome back QT.
