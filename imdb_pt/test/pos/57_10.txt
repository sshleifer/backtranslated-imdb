I gave this movie my 10 rare stars. <br /> <br /> When I started watching it and realized it would not be a movie with a strong plot, I almost turned it off. I'm very glad I did not have it. <br /> <br /> This is a character-driven film, a true story, which revolves mainly around the life of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a strong, beautiful person (inside and out) Black woman and how she touched the lives of so many people in the Lackawanna community. <br /> <br /> Highly interesting not only his strong characterization of the nanny and the people who lived in her pension, but also gives us a look. what life and community were for African Americans in the 1950s, before integration, and the good and bad sides of segregation and how it affected and changed the black community. <br /> <br /> In addition to excellent performances by all cast members, there are some good chants and dances from that era.
