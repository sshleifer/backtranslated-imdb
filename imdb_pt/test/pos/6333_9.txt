Having seen the movie years ago and been disappointed by its wasted potential, when I knew it was becoming a TV series, I refused to watch it. My best friend became a rabid fan right away, and knowing my love of horror movies, I could not believe I would not watch a single episode. I told him that the movie marked me for life as far as anything BUFFY was concerned, and he told me to forget that the movie still existed. He insisted that I give two episodes: "Once More With Feeling" and this one. <br /> <br /> Both are the reason I'm a BUFFY fan today. He was right - I was hooked right away. I've never seen a show with the courage to dare to experience an episode that has almost no dialogue, and nothing else could have achieved this with the sheer creativity and sheer creativity of BUFFY. I think X FILES might have gotten away with it if they had thought of it first, but I'm glad BUFFY did it. <br /> <br /> It is a credit to everyone involved that you are fascinated all the time, sometimes hanging on the edge of your seat. And when it was all over, she longed to know more about each character. So I went out and bought the box set for the first season. And the rest is history ... <br /> <br /> I guarantee that if you have never seen it, you will want to see more if you make this episode your first. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not giving 10 out of 10 is because I'm reserving that score for "Once More ..."
