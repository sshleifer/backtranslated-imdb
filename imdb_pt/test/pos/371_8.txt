I knew the premise of this film and obviously I can not miss a good movie, especially from the director of "Master of Suspense," Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Basically, tennis champion Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets the strange eccentric Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train traveling from Washington to New York. Bruno talks about a perfect murder, Guy hates his wife and Bruno hates his father, so Bruno "suggests" to swap murders. Obviously, Guy did not take him seriously, until, of course, when Guy's wife, Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) was found dead at an amusement park. The guy, of course, is the prime suspect, and Bruno continues to "bump into him," reminding him of his "plan," and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants dead. This investigation of Bruno's homicide and persecution is threatening his tennis career, and his relationship with Senator Morton's daughter (North by Northwest's Leo G. Carroll), Anne (Ruth Roman). Bruno realizes that Guy will not do the murder, so he decides to plant the evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty, Guy's lighter at the amusement park. After their tennis game, Guy and Anne (who obviously figured out the "plan" of the murder) rush to the amusement park to stop Bruno, and they have a rowdy carousel out of control at high speed. Also starring Patricia Hitchcock (the director's daughter) as Barbara Morton, Marion Lorne as Mrs. Anthony, Jonathan Hale as Mr. Anthony, Howard St. John as Police Captain Turley and John Brown as Prof. Collins, and Hitchcock's participation is the Boarding Man with a double bass. Some interesting interactions of dialogue and character, some moments of good suspense and, of course, the unforgettable end of the carousel, a good classic movie. It was named the Oscar of Best Photography. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was the number 75 of the 100 best icons of pop culture, the movie was number 32 in 100 years, 100 emotions. Very good!
