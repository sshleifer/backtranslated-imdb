The first feature film with the characters of Aardman Wallace and Gromit manages to bring elements of the whole half-hour program that aired on television. <br /> <br /> Wallace runs a company to humanly capture rogue rabbits from garden people, and has the brilliant idea of ​​experiencing his invention in the unfortunate rabbits once they are caught. Of course, like in other Wallace and Gromit films, things do not work out as planned. Similar to A Close Shave, there is a love interest for Wallace, in this case Lady Posh village, and a big villain with an upbeat dog. Gromit is beautifully excited with a wide range of expressions making the character laugh loud and funny. And of course, Peter Sallis provides Wallace's voice again and is a perfect fit. <br /> <br /> And as in A Grand Day Out, the cheese has a great comic effect as the movie moves. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, this movie is a bit long. There are great effects, and some parts that make you sit and watch, but maybe this story has worked better as another short subject rather than pushing it to the size of a feature.
