I think I'm some kind of Road Runner fan. I do not care how predictable it is, I laugh anyway. 'Beep, Beep' is predictable most of the time, although it's quite ingenious at the same time. Of course the Road Runner is chased by the Coyote and of course the Coyote does not pick up the Road Runner with every new try. The plans Coyote makes are very funny. You see exactly where it's going to go wrong and you will not be disappointed. Well, once you're kinda disappointed, what you think will happen will not, but it makes the joke even more fun. <br /> <br /> If you like the short Road Runner, you'll love this. Predictable jokes work and the animation is great and original at times.
