As well as a longtime fan of Kung Fu movies, I have to say that this is one of the best I have ever seen. Of course there is nothing special about the plot, but the man entertains. Like most movies of the genre. This movie is full of action and not boar its viewers. It's so fun when I see that I have a smile on my face all the time. This also has an impact on future films like Kill Bill. (Many of Kill Bill's sound effects come from this movie, for example). This is an essential view for all known viewers in Kung Fu. Open form to close this movie is filled with fights that really are some of the best I have ever seen in the genre. There are few Kung Fu movies out there that correspond to the sheer magic and entertainment of this movie. So if you're looking for a Big Kung Fu movie, check this for sure.
