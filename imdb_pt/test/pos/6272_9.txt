This movie must have been silently released somewhere in the world, maybe even in English. I hope no one has understood a word, there is nothing to understand in this movie anyway! Haahaa! Call me crazy, but I think this is one of the best movies of all time. Why would I come to this conclusion? Because it's my national pastime to sabotage horrible movies and this begs for it every minute! Once I became a fan of Myster Science Theater 3000, I had no doubt that they would find it somewhere and use it. For sure! The version they purchased was titled "Cave Dwellers" using some strange intro intro footage, not even from the movie itself (apparently they were ashamed to use footage of their own movie!). I can not say I recommend buying this movie. On the contrary, I strongly recommend getting the MST3K version. Of course to find more anywhere, MST3K DVDs are sold, do not miss out!
