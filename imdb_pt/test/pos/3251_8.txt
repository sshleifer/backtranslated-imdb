I am afraid I should disagree with Mr Radcliffe, for although he is correct in saying that this is not a comedy, it has many other merits. The plot is a little crazy in parts, but I believe that everything fits in very well, creating a nice and satisfying film. The last scene was quite abysmal compared to the rest of the movie, but the actual ending of the plot some scenes earlier is very interesting, showing exactly what someone is going to do under stressful circumstances. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to fans of thrillers and action movies, but if you are a fan of gangster movies, as long as you do not expect them to expect something as deep as Goodfellas, then you still have to find that's nice
