This movie appears on cable channels quite often and, I think I keep watching it over and over. The performances are wonderful, and the material has so much going on that there is always something new to take out of the movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too distracted when I watch movies at home, you know what to do, the dogs bark, the phone rings, the popcorn ends during the credits. But this film is about people and what motivates us, what animates us, what causes divisions between us and what inspires us. <br /> <br /> For me, these are films like The Love Letter that keeps me having a shot at new movies. Frankly, I'm surprised the movie is no longer known. I would love to see Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan in many other roles. They are a delight to watch. Kate Capshaw is wonderful and I had no idea she would be. Ellen DeGeneres plays a role that is much more complex than simply being the comic relief. <br /> <br /> This film provides interesting visuals as a suitable background for the characters and their interactions. I find it refreshing every time I take the time to watch it.
