Let me clarify that. This is not a "good movie", but I'm really happy to be there, I'm so happy to have seen it, and for the role it plays in my DVD collection, it's sublime. It's the PG-13's ultimate joke, it's college, as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, demanding so much suspension of disbelief that it may also be occurring on Mars. It is so healthy that even when it tries to be dirty, it would not make your grandmother uncomfortable. Watching this requires so little sophistication (in fact, thinking too much about what is happening will disrupt your appreciation of that work), it makes me feel like I am 12 years old again. And that kind of experience is worth more than $ 9.99.
