A film very different from Jerry Lewis, not like all the most famous films that everyone knows. Lewis deals with the difficult task of World War II and National Socialism in Germany in an unconventional way. But even more interesting and important, he does it in a very anti-American way. And like in so many things in the world and especially in the film industry, the anti-American means more sophisticated, more subtle, smarter or simply better. That's the reason the film was not a hit in the US, but a big hit in Europe. <br /> <br /> All in all, Jerry Lewis proved by this movie that he is able to do much more than simple slapstick comedy.
