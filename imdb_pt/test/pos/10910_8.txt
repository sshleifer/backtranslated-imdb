Howard (Kevin Kline) teaches English in high school in a small Indiana town. He is finally going to marry Emily (Joan Cusack) to the great joy of his parents. The city is also hectic because one of his, Cameron (Matt Dillon) has been nominated for an acting Oscar. Everyone, including Howard and Emily, are watching the Oscar on television when Cameron is declared the winner! In his acceptance speech, Cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay military in part because of the lessons he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school. You guessed it, it's your Howard! But Howard never "left"; in fact, he believes he is straight! With all the city and media members waiting and watching the events, Howard and Emily go ahead and get married? Or, is Howard really gay and realizes he can not go through the ceremony? This is a wonderful, funny, and human movie about a gay man and his situation. As the man who did not perform, he was gay, Kline is excellent and touching. The rest of the cast is equally good, with Cusack a spot as the confused groom and Dillon, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck and others on hand to delight audiences as well. The costumes are very nice and the setting in the lovely heart of Indiana is beautiful. So, too, the script, the direction and the production are very, very good. But the insightful, humorous, thoughtful look of the gay population is the film's best asset, no doubt. For those who would be offended by a gay-themed movie, yes, skip this one. But for everyone who wants to laugh wholeheartedly and get a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time, this is definitely the best movie out there.
