This short film (and the poem behind it) is one of the greatest metaphors I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> The poem is beautiful! Describes exactly the feeling of a person pursuing a dream and can not perceive it? but also tells how to stick to it! I see the "History of the Cat and the Moon" as a beautiful metaphor for human relationships, passion and love. <br /> <br /> Technically, a good job has also been done. Although very simple, the animation, in black and white, gives an allegory to the film and its message, but also of tenderness and nostalgia. <br /> <br /> In addiction, music also contributes to this poetic feeling. "Nothing else matters! I'll wait! She'll come when she can, or when she wants!"
