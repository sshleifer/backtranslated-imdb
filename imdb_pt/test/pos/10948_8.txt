Like a very expensive episode of Buffy stuffed with a lot of humor. A lot of yarn and a kung fu stunt. The Twins Effect enters the list of classics that should be seen in HK movies. Vampires have a cool mix of bouncy ghost type and cute European boy style. If you have the opportunity to see this in the cinema, it's worth a 30 minute drive, otherwise buy the import DVD before someone messes you up giving you a bad dub.
