There will not be a time in this movie when you're not laughing. This is Mel Brooks at one of his high points, and Cary Elwes carries the role of Robin with compelling humor. Every time you watch this movie, you'll discover a new joke, but the ones you've noticed before will never age. Highly recommended!
