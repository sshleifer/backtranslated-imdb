Let's go. Anyone who does not understand the greatness of this design here should be expelled from the panel of any critic. They should not be heard because they obviously have no sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Anyone who does not love this cartoon here driven by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch episodes of "Huckleberry Hound" for 20 years in a row! <br /> <br /> Wolf's takes and successes in this cartoon are the best examples of this important past of comedy that have already been captured in films. <br /> <br /> Tex Avery should get an Academy Award for this cartoon. This is the best.
