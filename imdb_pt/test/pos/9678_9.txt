I absolutely love this show !!!!!!!, it's basically an improved version of the simpsons of the fox (the cau'se makes it clear that the simpsons are very dry if you're over 9. It's political, irrational and irresistible). Anyone who says he does not like it, is lying, there is a character for each one, Peter, Stewie, Quagmire are my favorites, Peter, because he is rude, obnoxious, and just does not give a shit. of his incredible intelligence and how it hits you with something an adult would say when you least expect it. "And swamp because one of guilty pleasures are dirty jokes. There is also an episode for everyone as well. Mr. Griffin is going to Washington (VOL.2 SEASON 3). If you like sexual and body humor more, there is impossible emission (VOL.2 SEASON 3). Or if you like any other kind of mood, there is no meanness Janet (VOL.1 SEASON2). Basically, what I am saying is that when you watch this program there is a collateral mood for everyone. GIGGIDADE GOOOOO!
