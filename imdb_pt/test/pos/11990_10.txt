I'm in a big minority here. I also do not care much about the original caddyshack, plus the duo chase / murray scene and select Rodney jokes. Okay, break it down: Rodney Vs. Jackie - both are Jewish and have a similar mood. Rodney is a bigger and more distinguished name. Jackie takes an incidental and more observational approach to her jokes and is more 'up her' in this sequel. Jackie's attitude toward everything is memorable and, in a way, inspiring! their quick lines and overconfidence left me wishing I could express myself in such a way. Rodney was good, but there was not enough of him, and he was more "in your face" and disdainful. Jackie, in a rare movie look, makes a perfect replacement for Rodney (come on, a gun-shaped hair dryer?!?!) Really, look at the little things! <br /> <br /> stack vs. Knight - Both Play snobbish yuppies very well. Ted Knight, despite his wonderful TV / film career, kind of shows his age. but, he does the snobbery demands of the part and we want to see him fall. Ted seems kinda weak and is very annoying, throwing his anger and frustration too, while the stack is more incidentally malicious and vengeful; you really hate him and like to see him constantly fail. stack wins with me. <br /> <br /> aykroyd- well, they both had great classic SNL-like scenes with chevy chase ever present and enjoyable (ty webb). I really enjoyed the Murray / Chase. Murray plays his big, boring, chatty character with obvious improvisational skills and is adorable - but annoying. and exactly the same can be said for aykroyd. both get annoying after a while, but it's a draw. <br /> <br /> I really loved Part 2 about the first one. they are two totally different mood films. The first part is more drug / bathroom / sexual humor with a cast full of big names. Part 2 uses golf as the backdrop for a kind of "light-to-rich" comedy that makes one feel better about the working class. Script of the 80's? yea. a bit exaggerated? Yes, but it was not the first? an insult to the sport of golf? Yes, it's a movie. fine story yes, it's a comedy with real humor - not "dance with wolves" !! in addition, Part 2 has a much better soundtrack! PLEASE DO NOT WAIT THIS TO BE A SEQUEL FOR PART ONE !! IT'S 98% YOUR OWN MOVIE AND SHOULD NOT HAVE THE 'CADDYSHACK' NAME IN YOU. Having said that, I am a big fan of Caddyshack 2 and it is a great exponent of the 80s fluff entertainment with quality humor. VIVA JACKIE MASON !!! for all reducers - illuminate! It's a great comedy of its own. Randy Quaid was wonderful, Jonathan Silverman was wonderful, heck, everyone was !! all this chatting and now I feel like watching! I think I will
