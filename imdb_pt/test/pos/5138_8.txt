I read the book at a summer book club, and we all love it. My friends from that club agreed not to watch the movie so the book would not be ruined. I did not agree, and recently attended with my younger brother and my parents. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised. The film was very faithful to the book, without losing its own spirit. The 'new kid' theme has been shown just enough to have an idea, but that's not what story is about. <br /> <br /> The performance was not the best I've ever seen, but it was still good, and the kids, especially, had a lot of energy. The characters were interesting, and the plot was cute and not too exaggerated. It was a kid's movie that works great for adults or teenagers as well. <br /> <br /> I wish there was a bit more harsh Beatrice attitude, but she was still a great character. Mullet Fingers was a bit like I had imagined it, except that his hair was a little dyed, with blond hair and dark eyebrows. Roy worked very well as the boy and the new boy, especially interactions with his parents and friends. <br /> <br /> The message and the end (which I will not discuss besides liking) have come together make a great animated film for a rainy day. All in all, this was a great movie that you can watch again and again whenever you need to remember that the world is not a horrible place after all.
