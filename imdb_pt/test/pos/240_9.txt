In Brooklyn, nightclub dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing on McGuire, owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) perform a ritual on Friday nights: they order oysters at a bar, trying to find a pearl. Rusty's life changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover of Vanity magazine. She is invited to work at a huge Broadway theater whose owner proposes it. She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new lifestyle, missing the love of Danny and her old friends. 'Cover Girl' is a delightful romantic comedy, very naive and with magnificent pieces such as the beauty and the talented Rita Hayworth dancing, singing and acting; Gene Kelly, especially in two scenes, dancing with you and with Rusty and Genius on the street; the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectacular. Danny, the character of Gene Kelly, is almost unpleasant with his chauvinistic behavior. Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent: I found her amazing in 'Gilda', but she's amazing in 'Cover Girl'. According to information on the cover of VHS, 'Cover Girl' was the first musical in which the songs were part of the plot, continuing the story, rather than just being 'played' in the film. My sixteen year old son watched this movie with a friend of the same age at a recent Gene Kelly festival and they loved 'Cover Girl', so I dare say that this classic is recommended for any movie lover and not just for generations old. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Models' ('Models')
