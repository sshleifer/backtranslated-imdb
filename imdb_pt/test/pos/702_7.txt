Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford have already been friends outlawed, but now Sheriff and Young Ford is still hiring their gun. He is hired to get a job at the bank, but it takes time to get to the city and those who hire him hire someone else. This leads to all sorts of complications, much to a movie that is not even 90 minutes long. <br /> <br /> Randy and Glenn have girls here. Claire Trevor plays her usual good gal moment with a heart of gold. And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan who falls in love with Ford largely without noticing who he is or why he came to the city where Scott is the sheriff. <br /> It's western but unusual for time and Columbia Pictures was given the full technicolor treatment. The Desperadoes marked Glenn Ford's first technicolor film, a process reserved only for some of the more expensive films of larger studios. Harry Cohn certainly was not one to shell out for it. And definitely not during wartime. <br /> <br /> The plot gets a little confused when Ford and Scott are put to the test of friendship versus convenience / duty. The plot also involves some high-class hypocritical skunks in the town of Randy who are the real law-breakers with regard to the film. <br /> <br /> The four protagonists do a good job and the best supporting performance is Guinn Williams as Ford. Kind explosive Lunkhead from a sidekick. The climax involves a burst of cattle and a shootout in the town hall and is one of the best ever made in a Western movie. <br /> <br /> Fans of the four leaderships and faroestes in general will appreciate this.
