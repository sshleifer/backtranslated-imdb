After watching the talk show debut with Spike Feresten I took a moment to really think there are really good shows after 12 plus SNL and I was also sad to see that he was only 30 minutes long. His great writing skills have helped this program to overcome a series of lack of money and help. Electronic Lincoln was hilarious and I really think this will be a good Dark Horse Talk Show. <br /> <br /> I was very happy with the way he handled it and gave Andy Richtor some good lines to work with. As you would have suspected it was a little unstable, but for that kind of time interval was very good. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are not someone on grass or even if you are and you have nothing more important than attending this great play and have fun doing it.
