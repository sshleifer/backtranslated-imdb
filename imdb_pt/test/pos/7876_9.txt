My second favorite movie of 1970 (after Five Easy Pieces) was totally discarded by many idiots, calling a piece of junk to lure the audience. Peter Boyle, a well-known liberal, is incredible as the hardworking worker who has some problems with the younger generation. He's a scary guy, but he has a great imagination and it's very funny. I was a teenage liberal when it was released, but no matter how horrifying Joe thought it was, he took me by surprise, too! Susan Sarandon, in her first role, is perfect and a fox rich in mixed stone. The dinner scene in Queens is hilarious and insightful to everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This was NOT an exploration film and the screenplay (which was nominated for an Oscar) should have won that year. The director simply did not squander enough money to give Hollywood enough credibility. No matter your political stalking, then and now, you'll like someone else in this movie. Definitely 9 out of 10. It's on DVD and video. Check out!
