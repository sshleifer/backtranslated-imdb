Like all older movies, this "movie" is very, very short - about a minute! So, because of its brevity, it is not really possible to compare it to more modern films. But at the time, it really is a very remarkable film. A lot of this is because the prints were hand painted - making Annabelle look red and other colors while she does her incredible dance. I actually saw two different versions - one where it's red and one where it changes color all over. I think the red described on the DVD "The Great Train Robbery and Other Primary Works" is the best of them. The dance itself is very hypnotic and very much like an incredible piece of performing art. And, unlike other one-minute (or less) movies of the day, this is one I could watch over and over - it's just visually compelling and weird. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it online, it's a 36 second version of Google Video (type "serpentine dance").
