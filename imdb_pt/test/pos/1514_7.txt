Lucio Fulci's cat in the brain is an inventive and somewhat selfish tale of decent in a director madness. The director in question is himself Fulci, who stars in the film. Fulci became known to horror fans everywhere as "the godfather of blood," and for good reason, since he provided us with some of the worst and most horrible films ever made to decorate the movie screen; of eyeball violence in films like 'Zombie 2', for a man who was cut to death with chains in 'The Beyond', all the way to the end in gore fest known as 'The New York Ripper'; If you want to bleed (and let's face it, who does not), Fulci is your man. However, all this restoration of dreams like you and me has affected Fulci's state of mind, and he is quickly plunging into the madness, brought about by what he films. Fulci's problems also do not end in his mental state, since his psychiatrist, who went to see his problem, took on the task of assassinating as a hobby, using Fulci's films as plans for the murders! <br /> <br /> I have to say that acting in this movie is absolutely atrocious. There is a particular scene involving a prostitute, and it is just a way of being ridiculed, both for acting and for stupidity. Fulci takes the lead role of the film (obviously). He is not an actor, and it shows, but his performance is really the best in the movie. It is even safe to say that the whole, acting is bad for an Italian horror film. Of course, no one enters into an Italian horror expecting good acting, so it's a little pardonable, but I think Fulci could have hired some better ones. Bad dubbing also does not help much. However, something that helps is the fact that the terrible acting is counterbalanced by many gore, and it is extreme to say the least! People cut their heads, a woman is bathed in the shower (and unlike Psycho, here we REALLY see her), people are hacked, fed with pigs and there are many and many combat weapons - the chainsaw on display, which enchanted me without end. The amount of blood is massively exaggerated most of the time, which gives the film a kind of 'spoof', but Cat in the Brain is obviously a language film anyway. <br /> <br /> It would be hard to make a movie about yourself and not look like a big head, and Fulci, in fact, seems like a big head in this movie. His name is often mentioned, and he is on the screen almost all the time; is not much different from 'New Nightmare' in the ego bets, but it's obvious that he had fun doing it, and I at least enjoyed watching, so we can forgive him a bit of selfishness. The end of the movie puts it down - I saw it coming a mile away, but then I did not seriously think the movie would go that way, but I was wrong; Unfortunately, that happened. The ending left me cold, and the movie is best if you turn it off before the final two minutes. However, despite its end and its terrible performance, Cat in the Brain is a lot of fun and will please Fulci enthusiasts, and so it is recommended.
