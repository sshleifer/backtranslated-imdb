Not since Babylon 5 by J. Michael Straczynski, a television program has captured the wonderful art of applying a story arc to a television program. This is easily the best thing on TV right now! The characters are friendly and one can easily cling to them and take care of their well-being. Villains are the type you love to hate and leave you wondering what they will do. And Brian Hensen's puppet work is the most innovative. Lots of compliments to Rockne S. O'Bannon for a job well done!
