At first I did not think I would like this movie, but as it progressed, it got better and better. I love music and was impressed by how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and also liked the film a lot because of its music, the story and the way the story unfolded - slowly showing how Corelli captured the girls' hearts. The acting and the story were well done and well directed. At first, Corelli's bravado was annoying, but soon it grew in you. The plot twists were intriguing, especially the relations with the Germans. I would like to see this again to follow all the parallel graphics. I also want to buy the soundtrack to hear the song again.
