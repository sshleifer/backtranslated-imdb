This bittersweet slice of magical realism had a checkered production history (director / writer replaced) and sank at the box office, but it's a hell of a movie. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are pre-teen brothers whose looks are weird. the mother (Lorraine Bracco) becomes involved with a stingy alcoholic (Adam Baldwin). During his booze, Baldwin physically abuses Mazzello and manipulates him to remain silent about his situation. But when Wood nods at what's happening, the boys join their heads and create a fantastic solution to Mazzello's devastating dilemma. <br /> <br /> I love movies that mix fantasy and somber reality. They are rarely financially successful ("Lawn Dogs" is a similar example), but they are usually original and intriguing. <br /> <br /> The drunk baldwin is shot from a childlike perspective and his head is deliberately cut off. below the top of the board. This device allows us to judge him purely by his actions and as a beast totally physically. Both Wood and Mazzello are excellent, and they pull us effortlessly into the dark and scary world. <br /> <br /> The title's "radio flyer" is a small red wagon that transports your belongings here. Dream. <br /> <br /> Seriously interesting things.
