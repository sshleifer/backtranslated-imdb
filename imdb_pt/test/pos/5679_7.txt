Like most, I thought 'another crocodile movie'. So far we've had Primeval and Rogue in the last 12 months, what can they do again? Where both movies were about action and violence, this is about fear and tension. <br /> <br /> The performances are not worthy of Oscar when there is nothing happening, but in times of distress or terror, these people suffer as much as it is torture. There are holes in the plot and maybe the crocodiles do not behave like that, as others have pointed out, but the fear is so effective that it is an exaggeration to say that you will like this movie. It will leave you feeling as uncomfortable as the Passion of Christ.
