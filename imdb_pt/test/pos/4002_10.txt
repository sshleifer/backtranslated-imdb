Wow, what a wonderful movie! Mr. Im did it again! <br /> <br /> His latest work, Chun Hayay (2000), was a great movie, but this one is even bigger. Selected as an official film at the Canne Festival for the second time in a row of two years, this 66 year old director is getting better and better at what he is doing with a Korean culture. <br /> <br /> Quite simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up' who was considered a prodigy in the late nineteenth century. The basic story of this film tells the life of Jang, Seung-up and the historical context of his time. He was an orphan, but in his teens he was chosen by a nobleman named Kim, Byung-Moon. This Mr.Kim becomes a mentor to Jang as well as lifelong friendship, and continues to support his great talent that he knew in the first place. With Jang's great effort and natural talent, his fame grows ever faster as the strength of his country, Korea, falls. The personality of Jang portrayed in the film is very complicated, and one of the best actors Korea, Choi, Min-sik goes deep inside the soul of Jang. The eyes of suffering reveal the struggle of the life of a great artist. He's very serious at times, but all of a sudden, he switches to a wild maniac. He drinks like an alcoholic and sleeps with courtesans at any moment. In fact, he said in the film, "Without an alcohol and a woman, I do not know how to draw." (Alcohol and women are my only inspiration) "At the height of fame, to develop his own style, he travels all over the country, and never gives up his pride as an artist by authority or money. I do not want to give all the details, but I think you certainly had some ideas about the movie. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing about this movie is a cinematography. It is as impressive as they captured every beauty of the scenery. Yes, each scene is like a work of Jang painting. And the script is perfect too. It deals primarily with a deeper meaning than a true artist does. For example, Kim tells Jang in the film that "before someone holds a brush, you have to set a goal in life." This is a very moving and inspiring line, and there are many more. <br /> <br /> Go see this movie if you are at the Canne Festival. <br /> <br /> Chihwasun will be the biggest movie ever made that deals with the life of a painter in film history.
