as a "physically challenged" person (god, how I hate that phrase) I just happened to pick this up on the cable where there was absolutely nothing else to watch - overall it was a fantastic movie. Yes, I was a bit disappointed to find that none of the actors are disabled, but yes, I was a bit disappointed that most of the film was not filmed from the 'true' point of view of the disabled (can you imagine what that is? like always being the tallest person in the room and then having to live the rest of your life just with the asses and the busses of other people - having to always wait for the idiot to stop reading the newspaper in the only poor bay, supporting corporal expulsions rude of all others while you wait?). and the scene with him driving the car was absolutely me! Been there, done that, literally. but the film was true enough to matter - as long as I never lived in a residence or assisted living, there were many times during the film that I found myself waving and saying to myself, "Yes, that's true ... this happened to me ... "What struck me is that some of the commentators on this picture expressed the fact that the film made them see life a little differently and with a little more discernment like the life of a silent 'minority' can "Do not ask for more than that in a movie, which makes you think and see life differently, so, by virtue of that, the films have been tremendously successful. it should be necessary to view all children in high school . <br /> <br /> Practically for all people who are severely disabled, independence is one of, if not the most important focus of our daily lives, from working to socializing to re-creating. who felt that the movie was "cliché", try to live our life for a single day - you'll see that the movie was "cliché" because ... it's true. the challenges that the actors faced have only skimmed the surface of what happens to us every day - if we're lucky, we experience the same emotional and personal growth that the three characters (including the girl) did. every day presents obstacles for us to overcome - is that there is no dramatic music to accompany our lives, unless it is on our ipods ... lol!
