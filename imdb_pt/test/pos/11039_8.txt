This short was the first short released by Paramount Famous Studios and was one of several made by the studio showing Popeye wrapped directly against the enemy, most often the Japanese. While Warner Brothers, Disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios, made short films often portraying the Germans as foils, most of Famous Studios' efforts focused on the Japanese. Given the naval links of Pearl Harbor and Popeye, this is perfectly understandable. This is a short average. Seein 'Red, White an' Blue and Spinach For Britain aged better. But still worth watching. Recommended.
