A girl movie that the guys still like - Yes! Wonderful. Now I can have fun, enjoy my girl's company and not feel like I can not wait until the movie is over! Light - but funny. Good stuff. Whatever you do, do not miss the extras on the DVD. This is a great "blind date" file as well. Will Smith does it well - even if it's light - he pulls it out. The movie is a bit slow on the pace - do not expect too much action - the laughter is there - and so is the message - but the time is a bit slow. Use the low moments to whisper or kiss - it will pick up. The end makes the good times worthwhile. Above all, expect a fun and light fare - and expect some great enthusiasm from the supporting actors - they make the film. The plot twists are predictable - but it's a date change, so grab the popcorn refills from the kitchen - and do not pause it. Count on more dates after this movie - she'll want to see what comes next. Remember Hitch's advice !!! <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
