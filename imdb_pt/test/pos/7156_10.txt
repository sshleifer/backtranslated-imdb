the most "spiritual" film I've seen in a long time. maybe never. also a scene around the dining room table, a piece of comic perfection. I understand that a release date is coming in the fall. if it comes to your city and you want to see a movie that makes you think that's it. Aviva is great at it and she is certainly a future star - (Superbad is out now where she is) - also all the actors seem perfectly calibrated. There is a tone set by this movie that is used to amaze. I would not know how to call it - it's comedy, but the message of support is so fierce and direct that "comedy" is not a word big enough for that. I love this movie. It's a comedy of the thinking man. but even that phrase is not good enough. FTF has a message and this message needs to be heard now
