I have to hold Barney by drilling my head every day; Well, I think there must be reasons. First, I am convinced that our children are not idiots, they are just kids, but they know (my son a year and a half "selects" what to see) what is good or disgusting. Did you see the news? Do you think your children MUST KNOW reality as it is? Maybe yes maybe no; we (the adults) have the responsibility about what we want for our children and what we teach them. A drug-dealing movie? news about massacres in the Middle East? Of course, children should know that there is real life, but ... they are children; Let's give them some pity. What do you want for them? If you want to have children trained in weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor, go ahead, impose them deadly weapon, Kill Bill, anime of any manga, tell them that Santa is a depraved who enters the chimney directly to rape them. I want illusions for my son (do not get me wrong, I'm not saying that Barney and Friends are the best; in fact, the program has many flaws, I read other comments and agree with most); perhaps happiness is made up of dreams or illusions. At least, I want to teach you to grow FEARY but CAUTIOUS, who learns to think and believe that all is not serial killers or kidnappers, to whom they are reasons to be worth to grow. That, at least, he may be a little happy with his own dreams. So parents, do not underestimate your children; they know what they want.
