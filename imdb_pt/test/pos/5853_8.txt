I find it hard to believe that this can happen. We do not know if Justin and Richard were in trouble or had committed crimes in the past. The movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble. So the first crime they commit is murder? Just to play and fight with the cops? How do they catch any girl and say you are? Also Richard seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort, nor do the women seem to fight. Hmmm This whole concept is really hard to believe. That said, let's move on. I found myself really hating these punks and would love to be present with my gun with tactical ammunition from the police and see what their plastic costumes do then. As for Cassie, who was a victim of Carl Hudson has a horrible time trying to survive. The memory of being stabbed 17 times by Carl leaves her in an emotional mess. Sandra does an excellent job of acting. She sure made me believe she was an angry cop. As for resolving the crime, I thought it was great. This movie kept me planted in my chair. I loved the performance of everyone except Sam. He did not get up and left. The only thing this movie did not need was the love scene or I should have told the rape scene.
