I never dreamed when I started watching this DVD that I would be hypnotized by it in a few minutes. The story was completely absorbing and entertaining. The acting was superb. The biggest surprise of all was how charmed I would be with the love these two young women radiated across the screen. Her initial physical encounter for me was by far the most gentle, romantic, charming, and vicariously captivating love scenes I have ever witnessed in the movies. I literally stopped breathing. I could not believe the chemistry between the two actresses. Without nudity or explicit sex, they conveyed more passion and excitement than any American production could expect. Bravo to the author, the writer, the director and the cast.
