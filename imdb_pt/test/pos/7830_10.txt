This is one of the funniest movies ever made. And for those of you who do not understand, it's supposed to be funny. So often the comedies try to be so intentionally funny they do not understand, but here is finally a movie that succeeds in being hilarious in the most subtle way. Even "spoofs" lack the originality and natural feel of this film. It's a comedy classic that will surely be enjoyed at another time when studios are doing this sort of thing regularly. Lots of praise for the creators and for a hilarious cast of actors, including Isaac Wade, whose performances are top notch. Truly, a real star performance by a truly underrated actor. It will be great to see this guy get what he deserves.
