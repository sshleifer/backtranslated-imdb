I saw this movie for the first time as a young child. My sister told me about it and I thought it would be another kid movie. However, it remains an incredible movie as well. It is true that the subject behind the film is ruff, but it is also true that this movie will never stop touching your heart. <br /> <br /> I was only 6 when I first saw it and only yesterday, 7 years later, I saw it again. For the first time in a long time. Even after I knew how it ended, I knew I'd seen a billion, a thousand times I'd cried like a tiny little baby. When I saw him a few years ago, I finally got the idea and the seriousness of the movie. So I stopped watching for a while. But yesterday I did not change the channel, I watched. In the end, I was amazed at how much still made me laugh, cry, think and, most of all, believe in mercials again. I did not believe it in a long time and this movie took me out of my shell and opened my heart. This movie was not just shocking. I was also so impressed with the actors. Especially Bobby. So, if you're looking to see this movie for the first time, I suggest watching it on your own. With fabrics. And be ready to discover your young, sweet and innocent side and the side that still has hope. This movie touched my soul when I was only 6 years old, and even at this point of trying to figure out who I am this movie helped me realize what I do not want and still want to be in life.
