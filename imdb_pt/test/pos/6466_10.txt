This is one of the best performances by Cassavetes. The whole cast is excellent, as is Martin Ritt's sublimated direction. The anger, anguish, and despair of urban labor battles are magnificently counted in a way that is neither intrusive nor condescending. In a way, it is dated with its era, but in many ways, it is gloriously timeless.
