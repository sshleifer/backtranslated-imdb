finally I'm watching the movie El Padrino, from what I can see is an incredible film, and a lot of action Damian Chapa is a good director, but I must admit that I love his performance as Best. <br /> <br /> I saw the backstage that were edited by a lady named kinga, she needs to go back to school and learn how to edit. <br /> <br /> However, the film El Padrino is a pure 10 action epic. Why do most people who drive together can not imagine what the plot is? I'm very happy to see someone I know being a great real actor become a great director as well. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those people who love watching artists do it. <br /> <br /> BS
