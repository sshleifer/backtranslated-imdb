Superb story of a dedicated young teacher who teaches to teach minority children in an area off South Carolina. Jon Voight is a tremendous diehard, dedicated, idealist teacher who faces this challenge despite be a director. believes in severe discipline and has little regard for modern educational techniques, as well as an old-school superintendent, played with pleasure by the late Hume Cronyn. Madge Sinclair is the director who loves her babies. As a retired teacher, I could somehow relate to this great movie. The ignorance shown here, as well as the lack of cooperation with the authorities, is also quite apparent in urban areas. <br /> <br /> Voight realizes that these children need much more than the traditional teachings of a classroom. He makes them go out and experience life on their own, learning outdoors. <br /> <br /> The end is a definite misfortune, but so true to life. <br /> <br /> Surprising that such late students had an enthusiasm. to learn and were well disciplined. I think that answers my question. The behavior was there and they were motivated to succeed despite their environment. <br /> <br /> The end will only pull your heart. It was memorable and so poignant.
