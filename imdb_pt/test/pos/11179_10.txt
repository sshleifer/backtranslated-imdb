This was my second experience in the Monkey Island series, the full seven years after I was shown the first game. What was my response? "Oh, great, we're doing a cartoon." I'm glad my brother shut me up and joked because the jokes caught my eye once more, as did Armabrush's wonderful Armato voice - not to mention everyone doing well (I still think CMI's Elaine sounds better than EMI's). The cutscenes do well to illustrate something that is happening, and the art of play and cutscenes are excellent. When we found the CD with the originals, Secret and LeChuck's Revenge, we were ecstatic and spent hours working on Revenge - one of those moments was when we just sat and played for half a day. However, CMI has to be the Monkey Island game I played the most, especially for the return of sword fighting and offshore combat. That time you find Kenny and he says he went straight and then, "I'm running with guns!" had both my brother and me in tears of laughter. And that's not the best part of the game, not from far away.
