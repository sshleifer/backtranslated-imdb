After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin), I was more than thrilled to see your RIFIFI "Masterpiece" (O-Word Criterion). <br /> <br /> Now I'm a little disappointed with the story. <br /> <br /> So I have at least these five questions on my mind: 1. At the end of the countdown Louis Grutter tossed the main character Tony le St√©phanois from the inside of a house. He did not know if he was still alive or not, but he did not care about it and ran straight behind the house (with the money) to get to the car. Then, of course, Tony was not dead and shot him. GREAT QUESTIONNAIRE. <br /> <br /> 2. In another important scene, the chest specialist Caesar gave directly after the robbery as a gift a diamond ring (which was part of the robbery) a woman who worked for Louis Grutter in a night bar. Stupid, because before this character was not so stupid. And of course Louis knew directly that Tony had planned the theft of jewelry. ASK QUESTION. <br /> <br /> 3. After the Gangsters behind the murder of Louis Grutter, Mario Ferrati and his wife, Tony and his best friend Joe planned a revenge against the Louis gang. At the same time, they do not care about the safety of Joe's wife and her five-year-old son. Of course Louis's gang kidnapped his son. CHEAP and SIMPLE. <br /> <br /> 4. The perfect assault: Of course this is the best 30min. long scene across the lot, without any word spoken at all, but was this a perfect assault? Compared to other films dealing with this theme I could only smile when, for example, Tony was taken to a fire extinguisher to prohibit the alarm. IT'S SIMPLE, too. <br /> <br /> 5. The Grutter gang went to Mario's house because they knew (though ...) that the jewels would be there. So they kill Mario and his wife. And then? They are not looking for it! DO NOT. They ran straight out of the apartment. And more. They do not watch the apartment later so Tony can go after a while (it was the same day) to pick up the jewels. GREAT QUESTIONNAIRE. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a good movie. Because of the brilliant scene of 30 minutes in silence. Because of the very good cut (The final scene in the car by Paris is impressive). Because of a good actor named Jean Servais. Because of this black / white fever you will stay while watching. Because of some other reasons that other users wrote, but please do not tell me that this is an awesome story.
