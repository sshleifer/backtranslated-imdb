Unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/, this movie does not provide basic information. We are shown a snapshot of Danton's downfall, his process of simulation and execution, but unless one studies the revolution quite extensively, it is hard to understand where the characters come from (Fouquier-Tinville, Philippeau, Desmoulins, Robespierre ...) and so enjoy them for what they are: Danton and Joe Blobb can be the same person for the viewer. For example, Robespierre and Desmoulins were close friends since their youth, and this explains how Robespierre acts. Those who know the facts, however, will easily orient themselves and enjoy this good movie with actors presenting a solid performance, without useless subplots and good reconstruction of the times. Desmoulins and Danton are the best characters, but they all do a good job, even the 'demented' Saint-Just portrayed as a kind of psychopath. 'Terreur' was a period of massacres whose importance was not fully documented and which - most of the time - was driven by ambition, greed and resolution of personal disputes, fueled by ignorant sans culottes as the next epochal step against tyranny. .
