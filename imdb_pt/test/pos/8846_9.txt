Aaah ... The Thing. To see a horror movie in which not only is every character over thirty but distinctly unattractive makes a refreshing change, and reminds me of those distant times when the actors were chosen by because of his talent and ability to play realistic characters, not because of his adolescent appeal on a magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments instead of parodies with exaggerated style. And there's no twisting ending, no celebrity appearance, no fake pseudo-romantic sub-plot. <br /> <br /> And I really miss the physical effects on the set; with all those 20-year-old boys experimenting with crazy new ideas with blood vats and animatronics. In the five years between 1979 and 1984, we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howl, An American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Wolf Company, A Nightmare on Elm Street ... which was for terror purposes! And do not make me begin the death of the matte painting. The matte work in this movie is beautiful and perfect. <br /> <br /> What do we have now? Third-rate CGI, former video directors and professional stylists, that makes even horror movies "look" look like brilliant MTV videos. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to Netflix "The Howling".
