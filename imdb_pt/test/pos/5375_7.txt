This totally strange feature is a typical and excellent example of the satanically shocking horror of the 70's. The events are completely confusing and it takes quite some time until you figure out what the heck is going on, but the shocking atmosphere sucks you right away. From the indescribably bizarre introduction, showing a pair of mysterious children turning toys into real-life war machines, you know this becomes an uncompromising and brave shock. "Brotherhood of Satan" soon seems to be another part of the alleged and unofficial subgenre "sinister little town hiding an obscure secret." A young widower, traveling with his new hot girlfriend and his 8-year-old daughter, stops in a small remote town to report a car accident they witnessed on a nearby road. Villagers behave very hostile and insist that visitors leave immediately. The city clearly bathed in an environment of fear and panic as local children disappear inexplicably and unnatural forces keep everyone within the city limits. Hillsboro is in the grip of a satanic cult, apparently ruled by elderly members of the community. I really enjoyed the "Brotherhood of Satan". The story reminded me of a novel written by John Saul, but I can not remember the title. It was also a cult of old people who abused young villagers by their own greedy merits. The film depends mainly on scary scenarios (such as dolls and witchcraft relics), but a more engaging and coherent script would have been good. The subject often raises many problems and questions, and the director Bernard McEveety can not always provide us with answers. The climax is fantastic, very seventy (meaning shocking) and unforgettable. Beautifully filmed movie too.
