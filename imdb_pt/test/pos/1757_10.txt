I have remembered for years a song "JUST A COUPLE IN A CASTLE" ("No. 20, moonbeam, just a couple in the castle in the air"). I could not find the song, but I remembered it had to do with cartoon bugs. I found a reference to the movie on the web. I had seen the movie when I was only 9 years old at the Ligonier PA theater. I was glad to discover that Kenny Gardner was the lead singer of Guy Lombaro (I'm a Lombardo fan). And then to see that it was produced by the Fleisher Bros., which made another very nice complete design of "Gullivar's Travels" (also remembered fondly). Also the songs were associated with Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, who are among the best. No wonder I remembered the movie, the music and the colorful animation. As a full musical, this is a movie that should be remembered as one of the best of the early musicals. Now that I can remember, the plot may not have been earth shaking, but it was very well presented and makes for an easy to watch a delightful movie.
