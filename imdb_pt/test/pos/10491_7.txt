In the post-civil war, US President Van Johnson travels to Dallas and is murdered by corrupt officials and businessmen interested in installing the vice president, whom they can blackmail due to incriminating documents. A gunslinger (Guiliano Gemma) convinced that his black friend is unjustly accused of murder is intended to uncover the truth. Tonino Valeri directed this fascinating yet imperfect film, which is obviously an allegory of Kennedy's assassination. The film may misrepresent blacks as slaves working on plantations in Texas, but the film is nevertheless pleasant and presents an interesting interpretation - that Kennedy's death was the result of a coup de tat - that many Americans could not accept in the time. Oswald's murder is repeated here as the Negro accused of murder is murdered by the men responsible on the way to the Fort Worth prison. This moment in the film is more melodramatic than the death of Oswald with his various escorts shot down before his death scene. However, this is definitely one of the most interesting and worthwhile western spaghetti. Worth a look!
