I've seen cartoon spin-offs like The Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes and most of them are great. <br /> <br /> When I saw the All Grown Up rider in 2001, I thought it was interesting to see how the Rugrats would look like in their preteen and contained things that would normally happen during this period of life, like going to a show, go to school and stay punished. <br /> <br /> The TV show is better because the Rugrats seem to wear different clothes in each episode and Angelica is not punished as much as in the original Rugrats series. Tommy and Susie are punished in this series. <br /> <br /> I also noticed references to Rugrats in this show and even flashbacks of how the Rugrats looked at the original series. They actually talk to the adults at this show because they are 10 years older. <br /> <br /> This show is meant for an audience a bit older than the original Rugrats. Viewers of the original show may like this.
