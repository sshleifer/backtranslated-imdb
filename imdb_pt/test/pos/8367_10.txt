I never imagined that I would start liking movies like that. After seeing the 'Hero' of Yimou Zhang, I decided to check out his other films, perhaps looking for something similar. The second Yimou Zhang movie I watched was 'No One Less', after which I realized in what kind of movies I am now. No wonder why I have 'Keep Cool' right away. It's a simple, touching and brilliant piece of cinema, I pay my respect to the director. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that it is not the amount of money that makes the movie good. It's all about what the director wants to show and how successful he is by doing that. The story is very simple, a typical extract of a typical everyday life, in addition shown in a very simple way, the camera movements also strengthen the impression and feel of the film. I give a maximum rating for this film and I look forward to seeing other films by Yimou Zhang.
