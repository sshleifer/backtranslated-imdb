I did not know much about this movie where my roommate dragged me into it. I was so pleasantly surprised! The plot really caught my eye and kept it, and the characters are well-designed and realistic. The script is very clever and funny, and the cast does great things with it. And the best part is that it got to be fun without any explicit sex or violence! If this movie gets anywhere in your area, you really should go see this - stand up for this little movie, it's worth it!
