This film directed by George Fitzmaurice, who made so many excellent films, is well above his excellent standard. It's crisp, witty, with some wonderful lines, and has the inimitable Ronald Colman in the romantic lead. Colman plays the irresistibly charming youngest son of a rich Englishman. He is financially irresponsible (spending, for example, Â£ 15 of his last 20 pounds in the world on a cute terrier he names George), but open, wildly generous, disdainful of profit, irreverent in the most polite way possible and hopelessly. sentimental. He is so bold that all women fall in love with him. His girlfriend is a star of the music halls, and so in 1930 a middle-aged inhabitant played with his typical, narrow-eyed seductress, the young Myrna Loy. Fitzmaurice was not a big wearer of closes, and girls of that day had their faces half hidden with those terrible adherent hats anyway, so we do not get as good glimpses of the faces of the two heroines as we'd like. The director seems more interested in the charming Colman, anyway. The romantic female protagonist is young and young Loretta Young, who had not yet become the proto-Julie Andrews we usually know her, but she was still a flushed girl exuding all the sweetness of a rose garden and laughing cheerfully and heartily. all the time. It is obvious that a character with his fantastic sense of humor was needed to appreciate the social anarchism of the refreshing aristocratic character played by Colman. The plot matters little, as so often happens with these light and funny films. This is so fun.
