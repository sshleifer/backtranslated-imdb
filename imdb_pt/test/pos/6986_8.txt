It opens with its very long cliché ship flying through space. All I could think of at this point was "Spaceballs" and hoping there was a sticker behind it that said "We broke up for no one." The film shows some cryogenic freezers with the narration of Vin Diesel. I always thought his voice sounded cool since I saw Fast and the Furious. Since when I discovered he was so criminal, I thought the movie would be cliché. That was it. It was too cliché, and fate seemed to be against them at every turn. Erase every 22 years. Lucky for them, they land that day. The aliens can only be in the dark, hey, it's a solar eclipse. As much as I thought it was too easy and just a cliché, the movie ended and kicked the big @ss. I even went out and bought a copy of Pitch Black after seeing it. I really can not wait for Chronicles of Riddick.
