This is the biggest show ever done right next to the south park. I love this show! is so funny, and Peter's laughter is hilarious. You need to watch this show immediately for the few people who have never seen this show before. One of my favorite shows of all time. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to see some of the later episodes, as I dream of Jesus, or Tales of a third degree swims. But there was never an episode I did not like. All episodes are absolutely hilarious. Also has a great satire. You can find many clips on your tube. If you are somewhere near a computer or a TV, see it immediately, however, you can.
