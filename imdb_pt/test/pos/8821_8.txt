This is a "docu-drama" of (mostly) the last years of KW's life, with almost every part played by actors (but see which TV mayor touches himself!). It was made for the BBC4 arts channel, but my guess is that there will be syndication and DVD releases soon. KW is skillfully played by the excellent Michael Sheen, here replaying his previous stage role with great success. Most of the supporting cast is also very good, and a nice touch is the re-creation of television appearances of the period with the new actors. This is not, however, a clear vision - anyone familiar with the diaries and the unfortunate general behavior of KW will already know how it can be distorted in adulthood - so do not expect 80 minutes of Carry On style buffet, since the emphasis is decidedly pessimistic. Recommended, but it's tragic indeed.
