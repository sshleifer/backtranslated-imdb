"Everything is Illuminated" is a simplified interpretation of something more than half of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel. This version is more about changes in Eastern Europe from World War II to the post-Cold War era and how the younger generation relates to this story as a memorial to the family. <br /> <br /> The director / premiere adapter, Liev Schreiber, retains some of the humor and language clashes of the novel, especially through the wonderful Eugene Hutz as the Ukrainian Ukrainian tour guide. He is so attractive that the film becomes more his odyssey in his country and his family as he goes from his comfortable surroundings in sophisticated Odessa to the heart of a cynical and isolated land that has been devastated by conquerors through the communists and now capitalists. , with Jews and non-Jews as debris. As funny as his opening scenes are when he lays down his insolent bravery, we later feel his fish out of him on his own when he tries to ask the directions of the local backwoods. <br /> <br /> Shreiber uses Elijah Wood, as a North American tourist, as a tight gear in a visual panoply, since his character is less verbal than one of the book's narrators. He and Hutz perform well until the conclusion becomes more sentimental in this simplified plot. Once the grandfather's story takes over the last quarter of the movie, wonderfully and unpredictably staged by Boris Leskin, the younger generation does not seem to suffer any catharsis, as they just wipe the closure. <br /> <br /> Schreiber does a wonderful job visualizing the human desire to document the story. One of her credit consultants is Professor Yaffa Eliach and her style of remembering the shtetl life before the Holocaust through artifacts clearly inspired the look and is very powerful and effective. <br /> <br /> The Czech Republic replaces Ukraine and the production design team were able to find memorable symbols of change in cities, towns and fields, since it is now basically a road movie, and the Long scenes of direction creep a little. Schreiber retains part of the book's symbolism, particularly the moon and the river, but by cutting off the parts of the book that explain them, they look beautiful or nefarious to the atmosphere and no longer represent time and destiny. <br /> <br /> As W.C. Campos would have predicted, the dog steals most of his scenes for easy laughter. In general, Schreiber prefers more pungency than the book. It is irresistibly touching, especially for those who have not read the book, but are less morally and emotionally messy. <br /> <br /> The film is hugely high for its wonderful soundtrack, which ranges from Hutz Gypsy songs and instrumental. band for traditional tracks to contemporary tracks for Paul Cantelon's klezmer fusion score. <br /> <br /> This is not a film about the Holocaust itself, being a kind of mirror of "The Train of Life" (Train-vie), as the memory of a time charged with meaning now, but resonate more with those who have an emotional connection to that story.
