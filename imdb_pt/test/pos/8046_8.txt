The Battle of Elderbrush Gulch was the longest and most expensive of Griffith's that he did up to that point. In it, we see him trying to perfect the large-scale action scene that would be needed in his feature films, bringing together all the elements that made his earlier short film successful. Does Griffith use western format ?? already the ideal scenario for pure and direct action pieces ?? as setting for his first epic battle. Like many Westerns from the 1910s, is the starting point an eastern character going west? a device that might help facilitate public entry into the desert, and here the Orientals are a couple of children, which was important for the kind of picture in which it develops. For Griffith, you could not have an action without a sense of vulnerability and here he embraces her, with the children of the east, Lillian Gish as the disturbed mother of the "only baby in town" and even some puppies that are at risk. of finishing in the menu of the Indians. <br /> <br /> All this opens the way for an extremely complex and layered action sequence, blending the heroine's prey scene and the ride to the rescue with the battles Griffith was portraying since his early Civil War in 1909. There's a phenomenal amount going on here, and Griffith does a great job of keeping up the pace and keeping everything consistent and logical. However, juggling a number of elements in an action sequence does not necessarily make it much more exciting, no matter how cleverly they are balanced, and Griffith has created a better end of tension before and after this. <br /> <br /> But even a Griffith image so heavily focused on action would not be without its drama, characterization and atmosphere. At the Battle of Elderbrush Gulch, the emotional setup is handled briefly, but economically. First, we have the scene where children leave their home. The travel cart they travel head-to-head off the camera, making use of depth and distance to express their departure from safety and civilization. An equally effective scene is one in which we are introduced to the young Gish family, Bobby Harron and his baby. The people of the city cooed over the precious little one, then left the screen, revealing that two Indians were watching them from the background, adding a small sinister note of danger. <br /> <br /> Of course many spectators today have pointed out The Battle in the offensive portrait of Elderbrush Gulch of the Native Americans (in contrast to the friendlier Red Man's Vision), but perhaps not everything is as it seems. First of all, take a look at the Indian chief's son's vest? is black and covered with bright white dots. It looks like a pearly king jacket, maybe slightly modified to warmer weather. Now take a look at the "war dance" they perform later? has a certain "brown mommy" look to him. These are not Indians, they are cockney! So it should not be offensive to Native Americans. Just cockneys.
