This film is about Carlos "The Jackal" (Quinn), an international terrorist who, by the description of CIA agent Henry Fields (Sutherland), seems to mutilate women and children because of it. At least that's what he says to blame US Navy officer Annibal Ramirez (Quinn again) on taking on the task of posing as Carlos and placing him as a traitor in the eyes of the KGB. Ramirez is apparently physically identical to Carlos, but mentally he is his antithesis. He is loaded with order and Carlos is loaded with chaos. <br /> <br /> The movie is not an action to shoot with a gun, and that's a good thing. In his first half, Ramirez undergoes training to act and think like Carlos, and that is where the film distinguishes itself from other ordinary action films. An Israeli agent (Kingsley) joins Fields in training Ramirez, and together they seem to take on the role of parents in the birth of Ramirez's new character. Ramirez is taught not to like the things Carlos does not like, to act in the split second as Carlos would, and even to make love like Carlos (courtesy of an ex-girlfriend of Carlos). Of course everything he is taught would be well used in the second half of the film. It's a little invented, but Quinn gives a fascinating performance as a hangman. <br /> <br /> Another thing I liked about this movie was that it did not use the much hyped point in evil twin films - you know, the one where the evil twin insinuates himself into the good twin's family. Ramirez's family comes on the scene, but instead they highlight how his new character destroys his family life. <br /> <br /> A good humor laugh is injected into this film, often coming to the duo of Sutherland and Kingsley. An exception is the excessively used and seemingly gratuitous joke involving Ramirez's first name (Annibal, Annabelle, understood?). It was also exaggerated the duo's insistence on how powerful and astute and intelligent Carlos is. In my view, during the final showdown, the reward was not able to match the buildup. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of action movie, but this movie was smarter and catchy than the average action movie and kept my attention at all. My rating: 9/10
