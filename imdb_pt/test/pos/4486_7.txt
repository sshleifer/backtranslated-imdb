I think by the time I saw this episode, I had seen enough of Twilight Zones so it was discovered ahead of time. There is this strange set of characters that lie at the bottom of a cylinder. They are fine until an overzealous soldier appears among them. It is his first guideline to escape and so he builds up the forces and puts them into action to reach the top of the cylinder. There is a lot of discussion about purpose, reason and speculation about your past, but no one can remember anything. They represent different works: a flautist, a ballerina, a clown, a man in a tattered hat. Why are they there? This leads to an adventure and is solved in the end, but I think I had a good idea before everything happened.
