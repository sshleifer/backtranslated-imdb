This is easily my favorite movie. A tragic romance intertwined with a complex mystery whose strands are almost invisible until they all unfold at the end in a fantastic race. Bright shine. <br /> <br /> I'd love to see a little more of Gilles Mimouni's work, but at least according to imdb, he did not do anything else. Has the high quality of this work made the production of another task so daunting? Has it changed (back) to some other sphere of creative effort? I certainly hope this is not his last resort, but I can not blame him if he decides to stop this gem as his only contribution to the world of feature films.
