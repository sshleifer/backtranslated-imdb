Recently released on British DVD, this is a good movie (as long as you have a concentration capacity and IQ of more than one fruit fly). Not as depressing as it could have been, this is the dirtiest kitchen sink. Terrance Stamp is great, the music is sweet, Carol White is very believable as the single mom who can not stop loving the criminals. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where Carol and her friend who works in the pub with her (the one with the huge beehive hair that goes down over one eye) stays out and gossips about all the men who pass by there. <br /> <br /> The only thing that spoiled this was Shakey's performance. Carol's first husband, but if you can get over this, you're fine. And Donovan provides some of the faintest, softest and bittersweet lyrics that came out in the '60s.
