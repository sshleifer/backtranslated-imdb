Compared to this, Tarkovsky is a speed madman. <br /> <br /> By comparison, Bela Tarr is MTV. <br /> <br /> Compared to this, the movie "Russian Ark" is a roller coaster. I have just described 3 of the most sudden experiences I have ever known, and that is the best of them. But that's not saying it's bad. On the contrary, I really enjoyed it. But it was a chore. <br /> <br /> I will not describe the plot because you can easily find this elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the plot is insane. It's one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since Becoming John Malkovich. I think the interesting plot is the main reason why I avoided agreeing. (Also, the mood was good, which we rarely see in slow, artistic films.) <br /> <br /> Here we see a bizarre reversal of the film. standard. Most movies have little plot and little substance; however, they fill 90 minutes with many attractive images to keep us enthralled. But "The Hole" has 100% plot / theme without much to please the eyes. In that regard, I suppose it is a truly intellectual experience, as well as reading a painfully verbose novel like Thackaray's "Vanity Fair" (which I could NEVER finish!). If you have tremendous attention, I think you'll really like this movie. Despite its molessessy pace, it is highly creative and imaginative. It is like Jean-Pierre Jeunet in quaaludes and with a camera lens weak and dusty. Good luck.
