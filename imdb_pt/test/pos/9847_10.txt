It's the best acting film I've ever seen. All the performers are ancient Turkish theater actors, they are magnificent in this film. It is sometimes said that "They do not act, they live", you can actually see this in this film. The director is also competent, you can not see many cameras on the move, but the positions of the cameras are also good. But after the acting, the most striking part is the content of the film. It gives happiness, enthusiasm, desire to live, importance of real friends to people. We all started to live individually today, in this movie you see that there is someone besides us. And most importantly, you see that the most honorable feeling in the world is loving, loving your friends, loving your sweetheart. Everyone should see this movie ...
