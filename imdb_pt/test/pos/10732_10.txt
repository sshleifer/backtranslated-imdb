I've seen a lot of Dustin Hoffman movies like Straw Dogs or Rain Man and I liked them, but their characters are often to calm down or even to shy people. I hoped he was in this movie the same as he was in Straw Dogs, but I saw a totally different person. He was much more energetic in this movie and kind of reminded me of Al Pacino in Serpico. The film was very interesting from beginning to end. I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do almost anything to be with his son. This movie is also revealing. Personally, I think this shows that people should learn to commit without involving other people.
