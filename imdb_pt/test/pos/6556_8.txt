Uzumaki is a visually stunning film, but I felt as though some of the stories had been sacrificed. There's virtually no character development that made me feel personally separated from the movie, which is ironic, because all the puns aside, this movie really draws you with its many light spiral effects and awesome scene transitions. At first, the general cinematography threw me out, but as you get used to the overall look, you begin to see the beauty of this distorted film. This is a great movie if you're looking for an observer with a lot of substance or deeper meaning. It's a great horror movie that is not really scary or suspenseful, but somehow ... strangely.
