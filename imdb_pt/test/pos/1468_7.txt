This British documentary was recently screened at Comedy Central during the "Best of ??" week and can also be seen on the second season DVD of South Park. I remember seeing many commercials for the DVD showing clips from this documentary, most of which occurs with Matt Stone, Trey Parker and some other guy in a hot tub. It was funny when I saw the commercials, but I was used to seeing it the moment I saw the actual documentary. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Goin Down to South Park" is quite funny and fun. An interesting look at how the South Park episodes are made and about the series' story, when Matt and Trey had the idea in college. However, there was something about the tone of this documentary that really looked depressing. It's not as fast, fast, and as lively as the actual South Park episodes. Instead, it kind of has a slow, dry style, which can sometimes be funny, but most of the time you're just waiting for something to happen. If you have the chance to watch it, go ahead, but I do not think you're really losing too much if you never see it. <br /> <br /> My mailing list: 7/10
