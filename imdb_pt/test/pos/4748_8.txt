Recently I received SETE-UPS on video and I must say it was a very nice film. Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are great as the cop and crook respectively and a young Richard Lynch is great as the psychopath Moon. The late Bill Hickman is very good as his associate Bo and sets up a brilliant car chase sequence that will leave him at the tip of his seat. The other three members of the Seven-Ups team are very bland, but that's to be expected. <br /> <br /> I'm glad many people on this site have supported this movie. I think it should be a movie that should be released on DVD and not just forgotten. I certainly enjoyed every minute of it. The final scene between the two leaderships is excellent because the thug must face the consequences of his actions. SETE-UPS does not disappoint.
