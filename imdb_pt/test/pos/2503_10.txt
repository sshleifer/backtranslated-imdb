So well done. The photography, sound, music and performances were the best. It's also a fun story that brings a smile to your face in every scene - I loved it and I'm a straight 60 year old guy. Each character seemed to fit into one piece. It's the best performance I've seen of Mrs. Capshaw - she's been in more movies than I thought, but that was a wonderful achievement. I suppose it is an advantage to have Spielberg money behind you, allowing for a great budget and the best money can technically buy. Two of the cast have own and successful TV shows now - it's easy to see why. Tom Selleck does his good job as always.
