This movie is superb! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the pure-class vampire hunter, he kicks ass in such a fluid and violent way that it would make Bruce Lee proud. The film is a fast and exciting action ride and superb acrobatics. The first action scene and the last one are remarkable and Wesley looks like a Terminator while he runs around cleaning all the fucking heads. The script is very good and there is a sharp dialogue as well. Wesley should have done more action movies than him, I know he's a very good actor and in that he's not stretched as much as in his more comedic or dramatic roles, but as far as action stars are concerned he's the best actor all of them, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and maybe Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close. Also like Wesley being of quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that someone of short stature, compared to Snipes, seemed menacing, but he does. Overall, the film is crisp, stylish and I expect the sequel to be made at the same pace.
