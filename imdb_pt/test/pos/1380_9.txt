I bought this for a dollar !!! <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for a dollar and I have seen much worse for much more !! <br /> <br /> This is a Scottish science fiction film by Mark Stirton and according to the Making of (hysterical, by the way) production cost only $ 8,000. Eight grand !!! That would not pay for half a minute in Hollywood !! However ---- This is the best fun movie. If you like gritty things then you are in for a surprise. These are some rough character with harsh voices and swear words. I did not care, but my girlfriend did !! The actors do a good job and it's interesting to see people I've never heard of or seen before. That meant I had no idea who would die first. <br /> <br /> If you watch a movie for the latest visual effects, watch a Star Wars. The effects here are good, but a little weak in space. But the monsters are very well made if they are a little bit predated. <br /> <br /> Stirton does an amazing job with not much and I would love to see your take on a true Hollywood movie. At least it was not predictable and I almost fell off the chair when a guy ripped off his head !!! OK, so it's a bit derivative of other sci-fi, but for this budget is an incredible attempt and anyone who thinks about making a science fiction movie for 8g is easy or happens very clearly knows nothing about the film industry. <br /> <br /> Good notes for a good movie, extra notes to work on, extra extra tags for a really interesting Making of. There is no standard bull here, all production problems end up making it to be like Lost in Spot just with a movie at the end. But why are there no comments? KEEP CONNECTING SCOTS!
