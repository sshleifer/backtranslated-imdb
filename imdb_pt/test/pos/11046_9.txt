Greta Garbo starred in 'Anna Christie', a 1930 MGM talkie, the first time Garbo talks. 'Anna Christie' is a powerful film, but not for everyone. The film is filmed as a play, with short sets and cinematography, long dialogues and dramatic characterizations. Eugene O'Neil, who wrote the play 'Anna Christie', is known for his dark work and Garbo's character, Anna Christie, is a dark figure with a tortured past. <br /> <br /> The sound quality on the DVD was mediocre. Not to help is that George F. Marion, who plays Chris Christofferson, Anna's father, is verbally difficult to understand. Marion gives a good performance as the drunken old sailor who is teetering on insanity with his fixation of the evil "sea of ​​the devil". But his dialogue is written in a very heavy Swedish accent, this is true for the original O'Neils game. Marie Dressler's dialogue as Marthy Owens is equally difficult to understand. Dressler portrays, with credibility, old and drunk women, a 'quay mouse'. His dialogue is also true to O'Neils's original piece, as well as Charles Bickford as Irish sailors, Matt Burke, who chases Anna into a troubled relationship. Garbo is actually the easiest to understand. <br /> <br /> The strong point of the film is Greta Garbo. She offers a painful performance as a victim of neglect and abuse, leading to a life of prostitution. Garbo was a big star at the time and considered one of Hollywood's most beautiful women. Here her look is not glamorous, she is tortured. His body posture almost doubles in agony. She twists her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen. Garbo conveys these feelings of anguish to the viewer to convince us of his misery. <br /> <br /> This is a dark subject and Garbo brings it to life. It is not light, not fun, not for everyone. 'Anna Christie' is strong emotions, dug from the depths to be examined, this is an infernal ride.
