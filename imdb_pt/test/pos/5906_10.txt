In a genre alone, this film has a limited audience and narrow appeal, coupled with a subtle tone that permeates the entire production. However, it is a remarkable piece of cinema that is as timeless as a rare work of art. Capturing a time in Quebec rarely seen in movies, Mon Oncle Antoine's strength lies in the depth of his characters and the richness of the scenarios. Duplessis' Québec, parochial and feudal, is brilliantly cast as a backdrop that could not be reached by anyone but a pure Laine Québecois. <br /> <br /> It would be very easy to resort to stupid stereotypes, cliches, and myopic statements in this story. However, the director chose to ignore the forced images and instead focused on the essence of life in rural Quebec at the time. This makes this film exceptional in its authenticity, though not pretentious in its presentation. If only more contemporary filmmaking efforts would do the same, the viewing public could not be forced to choose between the exaggerated Hollywood Pablum that goes by to see Must See. <br /> <br /> Mon Oncle Antoine is - in every sense of the word - unforgettable. This will leave a lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived in - or visited - Québec. One classic. ********************************************** <br /> <br /> <br /> After reviewing some of the comments, it is worth noting that Mon oncle Antoine is NOT - and probably was not NEEDED to serve as a Hollywood / American cinema for sales in the mass market. A maturing story, yes, but much more than simple adolescent memories of the '40s in Quebec. Viewers who are looking for entertainment at the expense of complex character development will be extremely disappointed. Go watch action / adventure / romance / comedy for fun. Watch Antoine the Monster to be drawn to a rarely seen but absolutely remarkable society that has been neglected and ignored for a long time. <br /> <br /> The Grapes of Wrath is not a high-end thriller of the seat. , however, the story and the characters are what makes this American classic a long-lasting movie. Mon oncle Antoine is in the same genre.
