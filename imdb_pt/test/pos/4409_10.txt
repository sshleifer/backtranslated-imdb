Just to correct something in a previous review here, I do not believe this movie is only for people who know London, it's a case of a very specific situation being used to make universal comments. Jack Rosenthal says in an introduction to the published script that it was to be about characters who, by passing this test of knowledge, gain some measure of self-knowledge. <br /> <br /> I think it's one of the most perfectly written dramas I've ever seen: technically extremely competent in transmitting rather complex details, but it's also joyful in how it involves you. At first, you do not know more about this test of London Knowledge than about the main characters, but you stay with them until it's vitally important to you. You become tremendously proud of the characters who are successful and are crushed by those who do not. Especially the one whose fall, without giving anything at all, will make his hands fly to his face. Also as a fact, Nigel Hawthorne's character, Mr. Burgess, is called the Vampire, not Dracula. You do not need to know this, I'm not saying it's crucial, but it's a measure of drama: once you've seen it, you'll want it all and you'll evangelize all its details. <br /> <br /> I hope you see this.
