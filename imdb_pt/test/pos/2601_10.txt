Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He is not sure what time it is and Bunny and Duck arguing for help does not matter. Although Bugs prove that he is the smartest one more time repeatedly using reverse psychology in Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when it's over, it makes its mark. Daffy goes mad and demands that the rabbit be killed. Although Elmer is very stupid, he is hopelessly in love with the bunny thing. Elmer is really to blame for all this. If he was not such an idiot, he'd know it's really a duck season and he ends up with Daffy. But poor Daff can not believe the absurdity of the situation. His cruel plans of disorientation were thwarted by Elmer's stupidity. Daffy is so shocked that he even goes home with Elmer to be attacked in his living room. <br /> <br /> Poor Daff. He commands!
