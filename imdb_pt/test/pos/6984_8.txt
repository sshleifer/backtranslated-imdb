The influences of other films and science fiction and suspense stories are evident throughout this film. The movies that come to mind immediately are Alien, Aliens and Starship Troopers. The story itself is quite straightforward and not so original, hibernating space travel, landing on a seemingly lifeless planet, and a "deserted" geological expedition - except when the lights go out, forcing different types of people to work together toward to them. mutual survival, while the body count is set. This kind of movie is often fun as long as it's done right. I believe Pitch Black was well done. The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the more the movie continues, and I think people will be surprised at who does and does not. <br /> <br /> Vin Diesel plays Riddick, the convicted stereotyped criminal who has a murderous past, physical courage, high tolerance for pain, and can conveniently see in the dark. You know he's going to end up doing the right thing at some point in the movie because it's hinted throughout the movie that he really can have an awareness about things. Cole House plays the drug addict A bounty hunter who is probably in many ways a real villain compared to Riddick as his character unfolds throughout the film. He is more likely to be braver when the odds and firepower are in his favor. A very selfish character who in the end gets what he deserves. <br /> <br /> Radha Mitchell plays the co-pilot on the doomed ship, which is shaken from deep sleep because the ship has passed through a swarm of meteors. or the end of a comment. Finding the dead pilot in her bedroom, she tries to land the ship, which leads to our discovery of the character's potentially fatal flaw - fear of responsibility, responsibility and being a leader. His character in the short period of the story probably grows more, as he actually grows some conviction, takes control, and does not sit around waiting to be devoured by the night chasing aliens. She somehow strangely connects with the human side always away from Riddick, who in turn in the end respects her by her choices and she stays with them. <br /> <br /> The story in some cases plays out as you would expect, but I think you will be slightly surprised with which characters will survive this harrowing experience. This movie is a train disaster in progress to watch. Go watch it! <br /> <br />
