Love is hard to find in this fast food society we live in, so the man named Hitch does the duty of helping men find love with women they are madly in love with. its rules are that it only helps you to find love and not just some casual sex that seems like a big deal but soon the word starts to spread and people start to misunderstand what it does that starts to complicate the relationship with the woman I just met that he is madly in love with. <br /> <br /> "I have to say it's great to see Will Smith in a movie that does not make him try to save the world from aliens or robots. There are no jaw-dropping effects nor is it showing your body strengthened. He's just a normal human being in this movie that was really cool. He does not necessarily lengthen his acting muscles in this film, but the story does not ask for it, but even so it was nice to see him relaxed and not show off his ripped body to leave those of us without jealousy. . His character here is like with all his friendly characters, spirited and very charming, something that almost all the characters in this strange tale of love seem to share. The character Kevin James is just a normal guy who needs help to connect with the girl of his dreams, which really makes you feel for the guy and cheer for him every step of the way. the only character who was a painful spot for me was the character Mendez because she is so cool and calculated that it is hard to believe that Smith could fall in love with her. He must love a challenge, I think. <br /> <br /> This is the part of the review where I'm going to make a joke about how I would never need Hitch because I'm a great player but I've only been able to write about 16 reviews for another site and I'm still working on a small project, so I'm a bit tired now. While the movie is full of charm and friendly characters with funny lines, slowly but surely falls into the sea of ​​stereotypical romantic movies in which after the great scene where the terrible secret comes out, everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better than before. But hey how there are 4000 films on the underdog overcome adversity, so I think that another film with a predictable ending that was made to near death does not cause too much evil. I also really like the message of the movie, because in the end you do not need a formula to get the right girl, just be yourself and everything will come into play, which is the theme of the movie and why it works so well. I'm sure if the character of James caught the girl after following everything the character Smith said then it would be a very empty movie, but as it stands, it works very well. <br /> <br /> Despite being predictable, this is a PERFECT date film. It's funny, it's funny, and it's romantic, so anyone watching a movie on a date should be getting something after it's over. and by some I mean sex
