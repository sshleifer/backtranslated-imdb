I love dr. So much I believe David Tennant is the best Dr. the show ever had and Billie Piper the best mate! I liked the way Dr. and Rose had that connection and a great relationship and Dr. came in a few times to express his love for the rose! Unfortunately it came to an end after only 2 seasons. I'll miss seeing the stacks of rose and I think the show will not be the same without Rose! But David is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to see him play such a fantastic role! I rate this show 110% is FANTASTIC! The graphics and monsters in this show are wonderful and each plot is different but a bit connected and I actually learned a few things about the love, the world and the relationships of this show. So it must be one of the most fantastic shows of all time!
