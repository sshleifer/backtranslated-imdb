The magic of Hayao Miyazaki continues with this absolute pleasure for the public, Ponyo in Cliff by the Sea, his latest animated film, which turns the usual sweetness into charming his socks. I thought the trailer featured his music that was discreetly hypnotic, and I did not have to wait for an invitation to make sure I would have my ticket for the preview of the movie scheduled to open here next week. <br /> <br /> For Studio Ghibli fans, you'll probably know what you're going to do, as Miyazaki has another winner in his filmography, which will win new fans. I'm ashamed to say that until now I've only seen My Neighbor Totoro (look at that pile of Ghibli's DVDs) and love it in pieces, but I think it would serve as a final push for me not to continue to lose what. it would probably be animation films that I would enjoy. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (voiced by Nara Yuria) is a magical goldfish that longs to know what life is beyond the sea, with its constant incursions into a bubble to the surface. the water to take a look. However, these ambitions are not at all good for his humanoid father Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who feeds a little hatred against the human race for pollution, and touches briefly on a subplot on environmental protection / revenge of Mother Nature as well. An accident one day sees Ponyo being taken ashore, and is caught by five-year-old Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) who lives in a house on the cliff with his mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko), while the father Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) is mainly to the sea since he is a sailor. And you can expect a few moments of retrogression for the tastes of the Little Mermaid, or Splash made for children. To say anything else would ruin the fun. <br /> <br /> The art here is still simply amazing, even if it's in 2D glory, knowing that every cell is carefully crafted. There are so many things happening at the same time within the same frame, that you will probably be a game for repeated views just to identify all of them. This definitely surpasses any animated production in 3D or CG any day, given its beauty stemming from its simplicity, not only from the art department, but also from its history, despite complaints that have picked up a sheet from Hans Christian Andersen's classic. Although there are ways to make this film extremely dark, it only suggested certain dark themes, but opted for a film with more positive emotions, suitable for both children and adults. <br /> <br /> about love, that among members of Koichi's family, Lisa and Sosuke, and especially between mother and child. What's more, it's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish that he named Ponyo, and I tell him that Ponyo herself has enough cuteness in her to beat the likes of Bolt, WallE and Eve all hands down . The characterization here is top notch, and it's hard not to fall in love with Ponyo in any adopted form, especially when she's such a playful being that she does not hide her emotions - whether she's upset with you, or she walks away or you can wait for a jet stream to come out of your mouth to your face! <br /> <br /> Ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a perfect spectacle for my major films this year without hesitation. And the next time I go to Tokyo, I'll definitely make my way to the Ghibli Museum to take advantage of the magical world brought to us by Hayao Miyazaki. Movie highly recommended, so you will not miss it on the big screen!
