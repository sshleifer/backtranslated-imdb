I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival 2005. Based on Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, Everything Is Illuminated is the directorial debut of actor Liev Schreiber. Schreiber also wrote the screenplay. In the film, Jonathan (Elijah Wood) obsessively collects items from his family, from toothbrushes to seals and pieces of paper, which he then sells in plastic bags and pins on a wall of his house to record his family history. But the space for your grandfather is visibly empty. All Jonathan really has of him is a jewel and an old photo of him with a woman who hid him from the Nazis during World War II. Jonathan decides to undertake a mission to Ukraine to find the woman, thank her and learn more about her grandfather. <br /> <br /> His mission is aided by a couple of characters who run a tour company for Jews, including a Western-obsessed young man (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather (Boris Leskin), who thinks he is blind and that he may have memories and demons proper to the war, and his grandfather's temperamental dog. <br /> <br /> The script combines humor and drama with the three characters who travel the countryside in search of the city of Jonathan's grandfather, deepening more and more the memories of the past. The best performance probably comes from Eugene Hutz, playing Alex Jr. who starts the film wearing a slacker for fun, but evolves into something more not just like Jonathan, but all the characters gain their own enlightenment. Liev Schreiber, Elijah Wood and Eugene Hutz attended the screening and had a humorous Q & A following the film: Schreiber was very close to his grandfather, who was a Ukrainian immigrant, and died in 1993. This caused him to start writing to keep his memories on paper. Meanwhile, he was invited to read Foer's short story, The Very Rigid Search, which was an excerpt from the unpublished novel. Schreiber was impressed by the quality of writing, saying that Foer did in 15 pages what Schreiber tried to do in 107. Schreiber approached Foer and they talked about their grandparents, culture, films, and the nature of short-term memory in America ; In the end, Foer agreed to let Schreiber adapt the book. Schreiber's project was intended to be a road movie, but the book has a parallel narrative that is an imagined chronological story of the city of Trochenbrod. which covers 500 years; given his budget and limitations as a filmmaker, he said he would leave that to Milos Forman and make the trip. This imagined chronology was what moved him to make the film, in the first place, the idea that "a lovingly imagined past was as valuable as a past that he remembered accurately." "Schreiber said the movie was a series. of happy accidents. After unsuccessfully seeking an actor in Ukraine, he was walking the Lower East Side in New York when he saw a poster of a centaur woman, topless from the waist up, with an insane Cossack sitting on top of her. Under the poster said the name Gogol Bordello Ukranian Punk Gypsy Band. <br /> <br /> Eugene Hutz then took over the story. He had never acted as music, it was his first passion. One day a friend gave him the book, and he thought it was written in a manner similar to how he writes music; phrases / syntax, the language is mine. <br /> <br /> Later, they received a phone call from a producer, looking for music from Eastern Europe that was medieval but modern. Hutz met with Schreiber and soon discovered that the film was based on the book he was reading. Not long after that, Schreiber asked Hutz what he thought of Alex and if he could do the character by chance. <br /> <br /> Foer and Schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001, shortly thereafter. The events of September 11. Both were in Europe at the time and they talked about the derogatory comments they were hearing about Americans, which led Schreiber to want to find an articulate American who challenged the stereotype that Europeans have of Americans. Someone who was clumsy, vulnerable, imperfect, innocent and looking for history beyond the borders of his own country. Schreiber began to think about who he was, and Elijah emerged. <br /> <br /> One of Schreiber's inspirations as a filmmaker is Emir Kusturica (I think that's what he said, who also directed a segment in another festival film, All the Invisible Children) that said "you do not look the actors, you seek the people. " Schreiber said there is something about who Elias is that he has a generosity of spirit and a sincere kindness as a human being that appears in the film. Schreiber said the eyes are important when trying to articulate a character who is an observer, and that if "the eyes are the doors to the soul, those of Elijah are garage doors." <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood amused himself with a question about the similarities between his character Kevin in Sin City and Jonathan in this movie, as both are a kind of blank picture about what emotions are projected. Wood replied that Jonathan may look motionless and apparently emotionless, but it is all about his observations, about his experiences with other characters and the environment in which he was. <br /> <br /> About the differences between driving and writing: Schreiber said he likes to write much more and jokingly described the direction as "hell." After his grandfather died, Schreiber began to think of how to preserve some sense of history and of himself; Is it motivated by content or not, or just good at interpreting other people's work? He said he loved the exercise of finding out what is emotional for you, important to you.
