Recovery is an incredibly moving work, dealing with the devastating effects of brain injury not only on the individual, but on the whole family. Without resorting to sappy preaching or Hollywood finals, Tony Marchant's drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> The biggest compliment was David Tennant and Sarah Parish for their incredible performances. I had assumed before watching the drama that I would see some of their previous relationships on the bleeding Blackpool screen - but that never happens. No actor is recognized for any previous work, and I did not see any of them as an actor doing part of the 90 minutes. In addition, Harry Treadaway's performance as the son on the verge of starting his own life at university was fantastic - throughout the play he shows the torn nature of a teenager played in the involuntary role of being man of the house, <br /> Sometimes, almost every character in the drama is unfriendly. As a spectator, I wanted to give each of them a good guess to wake up to reality, stop getting depressed and start adjusting to the rotten but very present change in their lives. But under the same circumstances, I find myself acting like any of them - alternating between trying to show the rigid upper lip to the desperation to escape for anything, including behavior that is completely different from me. It's the show's greatest strength - true, no sugar coating, to force all of us to think about what we could do under the same circumstances. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult show but a must see. I hope it somehow shows up in the US.
