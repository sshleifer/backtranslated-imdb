I just watched hair after a lapse of 20 years. You got it. For those of us who have tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight against the rule of privilege and power; who resisted the fascism of the Johnson / Nixon administrations; who now as veterans of civil wars fought the war in Vietnam every day until finally the American beast died and fled; for all who said not in many different ways - it is remarkable how unsuccessful we were. How big the royal table Treat was in. How led the wizard behind the curtain. We were 20, 22, 24. We did not know the nature of the enemy. The size of the monster that in the next thirty years and counting would continue to eat the world. How could we? Even with the smoke and the bat (the bat!) In our hands, like Treat, we were too young, middle class too much invested, a very large part of the actions we hate. <br /> <br /> It was a moment. As Andre Gregory notes in My Dinner With. . . , there was a moment or two somewhere back there in the late 60's and early 70's when we might have found something beyond the yellow brick road. Something not fed by Bechtel, prisons, Enron and Dick. Something collaborative. Something innocent and critical at one go. Something with dancing. <br /> <br /> But we lost it. Like Kong folding a beam, the "revolution" was transformed into itself. In sexism. Racism. Homophobia And class crushing politics. Until we get to the "W". Treat would have hated "W". And Iraq and the pathological lies. If they were in that movie. So. But the moment passed and "W" was almost inevitable. Comprehensive incompetence, riding the drunken and furious ox in estuaries, children's lives and the shops of China. <br /> <br /> We should have done something more. Something better. But we clearly did not know what. <br /> <br /> Now what?
