Despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war, this film is not very sticky and pink, because love is like a rose: With thorns, that is. The four main actors define their characters realistically and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the realistic. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics of the cabaret / chanson-esquire songs (sung by Keira Knightley herself) drag the viewer ever deeper into the film, from place to place, between brutal war and between the pacific love. Some people may think it's too much a biopic, but it's mostly a romantic story, though it does follow Dylan Thomas's life and the triangular relationship that is steeped in joy and jealousy. <br /> <br /> London is viewed from another angle for once, Dylan's bohemian life during the bombing of the Germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small rooms, pubs and bars. Independent women, the soldier, and the charismatic poet are constantly embroiled in feelings of love and anger. <br /> <br /> Maybe the ending is too distorted and seems a bit inaccurate with the rest of the movie, but despite all this it's a great romantic story.
