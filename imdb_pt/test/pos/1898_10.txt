Yes, this is one of the big names in the black action genre. Confused mix of racist comedy and racist violence (sometimes reaching a disturbing tone, even for a fan of the genre) this movie is not his Shaft in the park. Wonderful parts of Rudy Ray Moore's comedy stand up and do not look funny, at least not to a white boy like me, but great in context. Much better than his different sequel, "The Human Tornado"
