During World War II, there were a bazillion movies created by Hollywood and after seeing many of them begin to look alike. However, OVER 21 is unique in many ways because it shows a side of the war you will not see in other movies - making it worth seeing even if you've seen the other movies! Alexander Knox plays the lead role, but the real protagonist of the film is Irene Dunne - which looks incredible to a 47 year old lady (yes, I checked - she really was like that when she made the film) . At more than 21, the couple plays husband and wife. He joins the military, much to the dismay of his father (Charles Coburn) and owner of the newspaper where Knox is employed, and most of the film happens when he is in the school of officer candidates. The film shows little of Knox at school, but focuses on Dunne as she lives in nearby Spartan housing for spouses. During this time, she (as the English say) maintains a 'rigid upper lip' and does her best - even if she is not a housewife but a famous professional writer. Occasionally, she gets very brief visits from her tormented husband, but most of the time is spent doing housework assignments and keeping the nosy Coburn at bay. Eventually she decides to stop the damn Coburn from phoning ceaselessly (he ALWAYS complains that his role will not survive without his son) by pretending to be Knox - writing wonderful editorials that everyone assumed were written by him. <br /> <br /> Although there is nothing earth-shattering in this movie, it's a very interesting slice of the life movement. Also, the acting around is very good. It is interesting that this film is a fictional recast of the experience of Ruth Gordon (a famous screenwriter) and her husband, Garson Kanin (also a famous screenwriter and director). When Kanin joined the army during World War II, Gordon soon wrote and starred in the play that became this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, I noticed that some of the reviewers really liked the speech at the end of the movie. and were inspired by it. Although it was very good, it was also very sad, because all this hope for a better world after the war was short lived.
