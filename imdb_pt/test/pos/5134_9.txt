In "Hoot", Mullet Fingers is involved in sabotage to stop the pancake house. The problem is that the builders start over, and he needs to take more drastic measures. When he is confronted with dogs, he frightens them with snakes, not before being bitten by a dog and having to go to the hospital. <br /> <br /> Roy at bedtime asks his father, who works with the Department. of justice, as he deals with crooks. His father says this involves the tedious steps of examining the documents, because sooner or later they all slip. You can see this with Enron and WorldCom. Roy examines documents related to the pancake house and finds a repressed document (he needs to get into the company trailer), so when the police see him, he has the law on his side. Unlike when he avoided the police. <br /> <br /> Remember, as mentioned before, Roy is not always law-abiding, and when the company man is killing owls (illegally), Mullet Fingers takes direct action. He can not wait for the law (Mullet Fingers is hiding). The film suggests that one should work on the system.
