One of the funniest of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short "Chess Fever," a crazy story of how a strictly intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. A comical subject as unpromising as chess has found an early departure in this delightful summary. Two young people play the game seriously against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to Lumiere's earliest short films, such as "L'Arrosseur Arrosse" or "Repas du Bebe", in which human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting. The difference in activities (natural = feeding the baby, watering the garden, artificial = chess) is possibly significant. <br /> <br /> The main contrast in this film is between this still background and the serene and placid chess set. the ferocious passions that the latter causes, while the accusations of cheating lead to a very unworthy fight. The intellectual game becomes a gross physical scrap, just as the pretensions of the filmmakers are always depleted by the "raw" demands of the public. <br /> <br /> What's more fun about the movie is not necessarily this downfall. , but the way it is filmed, its prolongation long after the initial joke has been made; the way the camera refuses to dignify the fight with something like attention, concentrating on the set, while glimpsing moving feet and dislodged clothing. The film's refusal to edit is audacious, so humor seems to come from something other than struggle, reflecting our need for physical contact about intellectual stimulation, our unwillingness to let go. <br /> <br /> What is especially bright is the end, as the upper-class boys are caught by the valet, who picks them up like two wandering boys, as if they are about to fill their ears. If the masters can not keep their place with decorum then someone will have to do it for them.
