This movie was awesome !!!! From beginning to end, the film is filled with fun, laughter, music, nice rock, hotties, more music, action, drama and f-bomb. <br /> <br /> Although some scenes are completely bizarre and improper, they were fun to watch and enjoyable. After all, this movie made you feel great and happy. Especially those who love rock. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great, the laughter is plentiful, and the plot is simple, fun but complex.
