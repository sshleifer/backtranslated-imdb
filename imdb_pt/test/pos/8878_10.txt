This movie was one of the rola on the ground laughing movies that I have seen. Danny De Vito plays Owen perfectly. Mama is very well portrayed and was one of the highlights of the film. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, it starts differently than you'd expect. Larry is trying to write a book and is having some problems. Larry teaches a writing class and Owen scored after Larry tried to convince him to read his story. Owen eventually asks Larry to kill his mother, and in return Owen would kill Larry's ex-wife. The whole movie was really hilarious. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end, when Owen writes "Throw Momma from the Train." Larry is furious because he has just written a similar plot book. It turns out that Owen wrote a pop-up children's book. <br /> <br /> I would really recommend this movie. I gave a 10.
