As a matter of propaganda during World War II, Sherlock Holmes was transferred to the then present. One of the results is "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon," starring Holmes, Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atwill, Dennis Hoey and Kaaren Verne. It is Holmes's job to deliver a scientist, Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) and his armaments project to the British government before the Germans can catch him. When the man arrives in England, however, his problems are just beginning. Holmes can decode the message that Dr. Tobel left before falling into the hands of the cruel Morariedad, save the weapon and possibly the scientist as well? This is an effective story of Holmes, set in the atmosphere of Switzerland and England. The series worked very well these days. It was not without their problems, but these problems had nothing to do with the time period. Whose idea was it to make Watson an idiot? Nigel Bruce's characterization - aided and encouraged by scripts - has always been the fake note. I much prefer Edward Hardwicke's characterization in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series - there, he is attractive, intelligent and a believable companion to Holmes. In the Rathbone series, Holmes is often condescending and treats Watson as the idiot he is. However, in this particular movie, Watson has the chance to be quite useful in several parts. <br /> <br /> I admit to being a complete sap for Rathbone's recitation of Richard II - "... this blessed plot, this land, this England" - I can not imagine how much it meant for Britons watching film in 1942. Sherlock Holmes really served his purpose.
