The Touch of Lubitsch is more than ever in this movie. Anytime humor and very subtle. The plot is simple but transformed in a delightful way by the director. The film cut is very clever and adds to the comic effect. A true comedy that is not getting so old for a 21st century spectator. The character is finely played by Gary Cooper and especially Claudette Colbert is so smart and stingy with this poor Micheal in the film. She avoids all her husband's traps and turns the situation to her advantage, very funny. And no problem, with Lubitsch, there is always a happy ending. A movie for very confident men with women. Do not let your girlfriend watch this movie ...
