Bill Paxton took the true history of US golf in 1913 and made a movie that is much more than an extraordinary golf game. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early 20th century and addresses the deep anti-Catholic prejudices of both British and American settlements. But deep down the film is about that eternal favorite of triumph against odds. <br /> <br /> The performance is exemplary everywhere. Stephen Dillane is excellent as always, but the film's revelation is Shia LaBoeuf, who performs a disciplined, dignified and highly friendly performance as a working-class French-Irish boy who fights against the prejudices of the New England WASP establishment. For those who are only familiar with their performances in "Even Stevens," this demonstration of their maturity is a delightful surprise. And Josh Flitter as the ten-year-old caddy threatens to steal all the scenes in which he appears. <br /> <br /> An old-fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: good acting, clear direction and a great story to the end - the final scene an affectionate nod to Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie.
