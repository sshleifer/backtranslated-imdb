For those who are not familiar with Alisdair Sims, it is, of course, the definitive Scrooge of all Christmas movies. (I? I think I'm VERY bad .. I did not see the damn thing). I think those who have seen Christmas Carol and are so accustomed to their character may find the Bells of St. Trinians quite surprising. You see, in this movie, Sims has two roles. One, he plays better heavy, and in the other, he's in the drag as school director of a private girl! So once you get it through your thick skull, this movie delivers many delights. The plot deals with the way the school tries to make some desperately needed money through a horse race. It's actually a bit trickier for little kids to deal with, but I think they would be worried about their mischief and the horses to really notice. Adults may also have stumbled on all the thick accents being thrown around as well. But again, the story is reasonably light, the action is crazy and frantic, for anyone to really notice. PS, all the kids seem to come from Eloise's school of cuteness.
