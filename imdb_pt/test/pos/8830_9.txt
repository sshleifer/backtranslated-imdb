I first heard about this show in 2005, first online and then previewing (and of course buying) the normally gorgeous, BBC binding book. Then I got the DVD; it did not disappoint! I had hoped for years ago that someone would do a science fiction show with an emphasis on the thrill of discovery rather than aliens, laser gun battles and other Hollywood boogie-maker tricks! Thank you, Joe Ahearne (also for your Dr. Who work, and Ultraviolet - the mini-series, not the shit movie of the same name)! What made me write this now (two years later) was that I had just seen SUNSHINE last night. And what looked to be from the same family as SPACE ODYSSEY turned (about 2/3 of the way) Freddy Krueger finds 2010! It was when SPACE ODYSSEY really stood out as a positive example of how to make a REAL science fiction film; more science, less fiction! ODYSSEY (as SUNSHINE) also dealt with the astronauts' shortcomings (Zoe's failed EVA, Ivan's efforts on Venus, mission control fights) and the danger of exploiting new planets with unknown dangers (the fatal peak of radiation in Mars). I would have easily paid to see this in a theater (I-Max, anyone?). And to top it all, not only were the spatial views impressive, but the characters were also well-designed. I found their interaction more realistic than the shrill histrionics of the Icarus 2 crew of SUNSHINE (Icarus, stupid name for a solar mission - did anyone read the mythology of Icarus?). Sometimes it takes a not so good movie to force one to watch a better movie again. As an armchair astronaut, I would trade my ticket for Icarus for a Pegasus seat at any time. In all fairness, however, SUNSHINE's visuals are quite impressive, though, and quite memorable. That's why I was so strongly hoping for him to succeed as an honest-to-kind science fiction movie. So even if this review is almost a review of SUNSHINE, I hope it will be read for what it should be; strong support for a BBC telefilm that succeeds where most high-budget film shows fail. ODYSSEY SPACE (also known as PLANET TRIP here in the United States) opens the appetite for solid SCIENCE fiction and offers a banquet. I really enjoyed the pseudo-documentary approach as well. As for time / speed ranges, they are covered if you pay attention. Where SUNSHINE melts, ODYSSEY keeps calm. If you are thinking of going to the movies for another dose of SUNSHINE, stay inside; choose a true SPACE ODYSSEY!
