Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot, Rock Hudson, during a mission in Germany. <br /> <br /> The songs are beautiful. Both are well matched. Julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the cool girl she usually plays. <br /> <br /> A half-German, half-English man who sings beautifully and entertains the troops in World War I, Julie sings some captivating songs from Mancini. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie. Some will say it's a "girl movie", but so what? It is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Supporting characters are a bit stereotyped. It may not be Rock's performance in Pillow Talk, Magnificent Obsession, or Giant. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards filmed the film in Ireland and the authentic WW I type airplanes were used in the film. Scenery for England and France is absolutely beautiful.
