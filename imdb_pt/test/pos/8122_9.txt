I enjoyed this film immensely, due to poignant scenes (humorous and ironic, some even "tragic"), believable performances, ingenious dialogues and a sincere interpretation of what it is or how it can be to be straight and / or homosexual and seeking fulfillment of their desires. I am aware of the paradox here: homosexual and heterosexual ... this is something that the film tackles in the end but never uses for the caricature. if you have your mind as open as people seem to have made that movie, in the end it does not matter if the ones in each other's arms are the same or not. <br /> <br /> "Mr. smith" matrix gives an admirable turnaround as a gay-house seller with "strange" appetites here, but that's not the only thing to marvel at. appreciate.....
