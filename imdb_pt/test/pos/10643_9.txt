After reading a biography about the last Russian Tzar (Nicholas II), and his failure to secure the support of the army, I decided to try the film. <br /> <br /> I watched with a completely open mind, not knowing anything about it (except its reputation). <br /> <br /> These are the things that impressed me the most. <br /> <br /> 1) The shots of warships, and the soldiers used as extras. More than once I stopped to think, "If this were done in this time and place, 80% of it would have been generated by computer." <br /> <br /> 2) Realism in it. From the flesh infested with larvae to the sailor's shot with his candle and the legend "Dead for a bowl of soup," this film makes no concessions to the cause PC (which, fortunately, had not yet been invented). 3) The slow descent to the madness of the Odessa Steps sequence. From the first shot, when the man without limbs appears, you realize that something may be wrong; since the photos in general are composed, you end up feeling comfortable around you. Then an amputee appears and people begin to fall into dramatic poses. Still, the shots are composed ... until the Cossacks appear on the scene, and the incredible juxtapositions of shot appear. This scene is easily worth the price of admission. <br /> <br /> 4) The fact that this movie is 100% unadulterated advertisement. Then again, when Rambo fought in Afghanistan, he was also having something to do with "propaganda"; just a different kind. <br /> <br /> General: a film marked by a slow narrative. However, Metropolis, Dr. Caligari's Cabinet and this film are perfect examples of inventive and daring films that are still remembered today for their merits. They really make modern movies look boring and repetitive.
