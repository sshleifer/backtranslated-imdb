Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator when describing this as a fascinating, fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It is not necessary to see all the episodes, since the first ones are the best, while the last ones are a bit tiring, but for anyone who likes German and good nature, it is worth seeing all the episodes. fashion, values ​​are constantly questioned, even the murder of the Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for those who are about to live or travel in Germany, preferably in the original language! <br /> <br />
