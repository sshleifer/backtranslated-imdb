When I was young, when that happened, I completely related to it. As an adult in today's sex-obsessed American culture, he does not have enough nudity to be called meek. <br /> <br /> Whether you are looking for American Pie type lust, vulgarity or fart jokes and feces, meatballs will disappoint with impunity and a guarantee. <br /> <br /> If you like Bill Murray, and like to have fun, you'll probably like and enjoy this movie a lot. Likewise with Stripes, Ghostbusters, Caddy Shack, etc. Just said, just go watch it and stop intellectualizing it. It's meatballs, for crying aloud! Why read a review? Just enjoy and have fun. And ignore the trash speak for others. Movies, like so many other things in life, are subjective. Each one in his. Always be careful of the 'expert' that diminishes the taste of others.
