The director, Ramin Niami, delivers the goods somewhere in the city. This hilarious farce, I believe, is in the tradition of a Mel Brooks comedy. Niami mocks New York society by creating the down-to-earth, eccentric, and tragic characters from an apartment building to buildings, bringing them to life from the first shots that feature them. Peter Stormare's performance as a Shakespearean gay actor is absolutely worthy of prize and the film in general does a good job of showing the lack of hope and the ability to laugh at self-centered ambition. Sandra Bernhard perfectly interprets the hetero and obsessed therapist. I really enjoyed Sandra's performance, especially since I have not been a big fan so far. Bai Ling, Ornella Muti and Bulle Ogier complete an international ensemble par excellence. I loved the scene with Robert John Burke and his gang of idiot criminals who could not plan a robbery if their lives depended on it. With an appearance by Mayor Ed Koch and a solid performance by Paul Anthony Stewart, Mom's revolutionary boy, Somewhere in the City, has fun without missing a beat.
