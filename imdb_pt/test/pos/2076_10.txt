Absolutely the most thoughtful, spiritually deep and intense Hamlet ever made - no other version comes close. Jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors who played him. Claudius, by Patrick Stewart, is fierce and still sympathetic - I particularly like the two idiots who play Rosencranz and Guildenstern. Very irresponsible and still sinister. Some may complain of the need for a strong Ophelia - she is not a strong person, that is the point, and Lalla Ward achieves the appropriate nuances. Amazing. Simply incredible - each of the more than two dozen times I've watched.
