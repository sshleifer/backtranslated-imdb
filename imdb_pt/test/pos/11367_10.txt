It was a long time ago (1960), but I have never forgotten this series and many times I wished it would reappear. He then corresponded with Mr. Rathbun, then president of Standard Oil, who sponsored the presentation on PBS. He sent me a picture of the tapestry (actually a charcoal version) used behind the credits. <br /> <br /> To the opening music of Bayan's "Elizabethan Masque," my family and I gathered around our black and white TV. to drink in Shakespeare's words as spoken by a group of excellent but relatively unknown (at least for American audiences at the time). <br /> <br /> We were introduced to actors like Sean Connery, Dame Judi Dench, Tom Fleming, Patrick Garland, Julian Glover and Robert Hardy. I have continued to enjoy their accomplishments ever since. One of the most interesting things was the way the actors continued to grow old in their respective roles, while Shakespeare's "King" plays were presented, perhaps for the first time, in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell these actors how much this series meant to me. <br /> <br /> If "Age of Kings" could be revived on VHS and / or DVD, it would please all those who wish to see it again and those who lost it the first time. <br /> <br /> GOOD NEWS! PBS just released an "an era of kings" DVD! SEE THE CATALOG FOR JULY 2009, PAGE 19, OR CALL FOR FREE. I just ordered mine!
