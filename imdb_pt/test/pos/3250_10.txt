I saw Two Hands in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all time favorite movies. It has action, adventure, comedy and romance, all in one (and a little zen played for good measure). Like many Australian films, the plot is easy to follow, but wonderfully interesting, and Jordan should feel proud of his work. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he was on TV now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favorite comedy scenes of not only this movie, but actually any movie, had been cut! So if you watch this movie, make sure it's the original version.
