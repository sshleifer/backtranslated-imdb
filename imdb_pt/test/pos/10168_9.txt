Many critics seem to prefer the original version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, which I did not have the opportunity to see. By itself, the 56 version is a very well done film. The Hitchcock film series of the mid-50s (including "Rear Window," "Dial M for Murder," "Vertigo," and "To Catch a Thief" as well as this movie) is one of my career favorites. In The Man Who Knew Too, Jimmy Stewart plays vigorously in his role as ever. Doris Day is very credible in the role of an atypical blonde Hitchcock. I thought there was nothing false about his performance. Her character may not have been written as strongly as the original, but it's definitely not reduced to the role of a passive, "Yes, dear," beautiful thing on Jimmy Stewart's arm. There were some really clever lines written for Hank (the son of the later kidnapped couple) in the opening scene of the bus - it's a shame that Christopher Olsen has read them so vehemently. It is rare to see a good performance by a child actor in the 1950s, however. Most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were very competent, especially the killer (played by Reggie Nalder). <br /> <br /> Some little details that make this movie undeniably Hitchcockian - the use of non-English, especially French, dialogues (something that Hitch did on a much larger scale in "To Catch A Thief"); the use of bad omen, Arab music in the hotel when the killer appears; Stewart and Day talking to each other in the church, singing their words to the sound of the hymn; the Albert Hall scene, specifically showing the musicians and the assassin's accomplice after the score, increasing the tension, as well as the percussionist preparing the dishes; and finally the murderer's weapon as it appears behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically (an effect that Hitch used at the end of "Spellbound", too). <br /> <br /> All in all, The Man Who Knew Too Much is a fun movie to watch. It's not as deep or overloaded with symbolism as some of his films ("Vertigo", "Strangers on a Train"), but it's still one of my top five masterpieces by Hitchcock.
