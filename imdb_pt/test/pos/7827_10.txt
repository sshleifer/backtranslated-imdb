When I first saw this program advertised on Australian TV in the late 90's, I ignored it thinking it was just capitalizing on Kevin Costner's 'Bodyguard' movie. But then I got an episode and wanted to watch it from the beginning. The partnership between Sean Pertwee and Louise Lombard was so well executed and the structure of each episode was extremely entertaining. It was not an over-the-top TV show that you could say that you spent most of your energy on making things explode so you could put that clip on the commercial to appeal to the audience and then not deliver on any other level. The show plunged into the lives of the two main characters and that's what made it interesting. The stories of each episode were also well written with interesting guests who were good actors. And, of course, there was a lot of action and intrigue that is always good. But what was great was that there was humor, and it flowed naturally from the characters, it did not seem planned. It was British, but in a good way, and if this show were made in America, it would certainly be on DVD now. I do not know why British TV producers are not interested in releasing this program on DVD. It was a great show and deserves a DVD release.
