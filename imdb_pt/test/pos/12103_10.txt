Like many other commentators here, I was expecting a taste of music that would satisfy my curiosity - and I got more than I asked for. I have heard and seen a powerful, exquisite, sometimes astonishing, sometimes moving, lyrical, sentimental (in the truest manner) and absolutely stunning blend of music and musicians. It reminded me of many forms of Indian music (East Indian), but at the same time it was very different. <br /> <br /> From Baba Zula's first track to Kurdish singer Aynur (who vocals) to Siyasiyabend to jam session (or 'Jugalbandhi' as we call in India) at the small Turkish bar Selim Seslar (Big fan now :)), I enjoyed every minute and wished it did not end. <br /> <br /> One of the best music reviews I've seen and heard in a long time. <br /> <br /> I long for a CD of the soundtrack and hope to find you online soon and also for old and recent Baba Zula albums. <br /> <br /> A day later, the music is still etched in my brain and I do not want it to disappear. Turkey and specifically Istanbul now seem so beautiful and exciting places - and I'll start saving today to go forward. <br /> <br /> Faith Akin - this is a gem.
