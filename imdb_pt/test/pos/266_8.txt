He inherited this from my x DVD collection when he left with my best friend (well said), watched it one night when there was nothing on television (nothing new then so) and it got a very nice surprise. Very British (you have almost no budget, no faces you know or have ever seen before), the accents were a bit thick for my liking, but after a disturbing start (a little too close to home in my case) he began to grow in me. In addition to the unnecessary cut, which really did not add anything, I found the film deeply uplifting, very real, natural performances everywhere left me wanting more of an ending that came suddenly too soon. Highly recommended!
