I love a movie that mixes suspense, laughter, style, good acting and a bit of self-parody. Hitchcock consistently took this, and in "Le Cercle rouge" Jean-Pierre Melville does the same. I regretted when this long movie ended. <br /> <br /> I agree with the English commentator who found observations from one of my fellow chauvinists. I love French movies, Italian movies, English movies, Indian movies - and increasingly rare American movies. I also feel that the writer who screwed up the film for not even being a good copy of an American gangster movie missed the mark completely. But I think it's like jazz: either you understand it or not, so why waste time trying to explain? <br /> <br /> Just watch "Le Cercle noir" and be prepared to be deliciously entertained.
