I can not rate this very well because I can not say I liked it. But it's the story that bothered me, not the making of the movie. The acting, direction, atmosphere, music were all good. It's just that once you see a lot of people doing things that you can not really relate to, the movie ends. It is educational in the way it depicts the horrors of war as seen from home and how feelings do not need to make any sense and yet be strong, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> Plot covers a period of a few years when the poet Dylan Thomas is taken under the roof of an old ex-girlfriend. He is married, brings his wife and then the boy, while the ex (Knightley) marries another guy. But the tension is there, Dylan is a self-obsessed idiot and the new husband comes home from war with a mild case of PTSD. Add some very temperamental characters and you're full of hands. <br /> <br /> In short, you need to be "in the mood" to enjoy this movie. The hard part is defining that state of mind. I guess I've never been to this yet. Ever. So it is probably best attended by adults with a strange complex human behavior and perhaps a curiosity about Dylan Thomas.
