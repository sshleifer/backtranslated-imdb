Although this film is among the sophisticated English classes, it is a simple story of a shattered couple. It has a somewhat dated air, being an adaptation of "A Way Through the Wood," a 1950 novel by Nigel Balchin (formerly very popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes, who despite the Academy Award for "Gosford Park" script, has a somewhat anachronistic personality, wrote the script and directed (the latter for the first time). With the DVD version I've seen, there's a more enlightening audio commentary by Julian. His main focus was on hitting his characters and, in general, he succeeded. In this he was aided by two excellent performances by Tom Wilkinson, such as James, the town's lawyer sewn, and Emily Watson as his attractive wife, Anne. He also kept it short; the race time is only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> James and Anne have a home in the city of Chelsea and a comfortable former vicarage in Buckinghamshire. Anne is a few years younger, but they have no children. From the outside they seem happy, but James, one of nature's moralists (unusual for a city attorney), is a control maniac. Just down the road is the aristocratic Hon. William Buel, who is not of the middle class morals, and he is more than happy to take advantage. But there is one complication, a road accident, in which an elderly cyclist is knocked down on a country lane by a ruthlessly driven Range Rover like the Army. Accounts. Soon James, Anne, Bill and the victim's widow (who happens to be the janitor of James and Anne) are drawn into a conspiracy to hide what really happened. The main focus is on the corrosive effect of all this in James and Anne's relationship. <br /> <br /> The third person in this trio, Bill, is played by Rupert Everett. From the cast's point of view, his languid and superior way is the right one for the role, but somehow it does not get there. Partly this is because he is supposed to be ill for some time and seems to be fine when he should be sick, and vice versa. The part seems underdeveloped. It's interesting that John Neville, Bill's father, who has only one significant scene, manages to establish his character beautifully in the time he has. <br /> <br /> The world of five-star hotels and top restaurants is very well evoked. As Julian Fellowes says in the audio commentary, these people are able to convince themselves that the Edwardian era still exists. In the background, the film is about what attracts a couple and what separates them. Nigel Balchin was going through a separation from the marriage when he wrote the book, and Fellowes made a good fist to convey the atmosphere. As he says, his adaptation is quite free, but the central theme is the same.
