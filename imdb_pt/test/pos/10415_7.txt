This photo is an interesting saga of the pioneering struggle led by Daniel Boone in the Cumberland Gap desert, threatened by hostile Indians. A treacherous Frenchman is the cause of all trouble between settlers and red men, while Boone tries to convince the Indians that the pioneers only want to build houses and live in peace. The film has a certain appeal because it is not a polished production, but there are good scenes of action, although somewhat violent for its time. The cast is made up of B actors, but all are good, especially Lon Chaney as Indian boss. Bruce Bennett is just as well as Boone, but is a little clean and speaks softly to be believable as a frontier man. The dialogue is rather banal, but the setting lends itself to the realism of the backwoods of Kentucky.
