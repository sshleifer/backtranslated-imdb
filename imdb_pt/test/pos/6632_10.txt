Shame represents a high point in a master's career. Ingmar Bergman penetrating, existential study of a couple on the island of Gotland dealing with surviving a long war. Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow give painfully detailed performances in this backup drama. The intensity of the films rests on Bergman, keeping our focus on the intimate and intimate relationships of his two characters - both talented musicians - trapped in a landscape they no longer understand. We see the way the external pressures of war complicate and erode their relationship. Both characters are forced by the material circumstances of war to betray their own sense of ethics. In one of the most powerful episodes, Bergman forces us to reflect on the manipulative power of the cinematographic medium, showing us an interview filmed with the character of Ullman who was reedited and distorted for political effect on one side of the conflict and is used by the other side as evidence of war crimes in a brutal interrogation scene. <br /> <br />
