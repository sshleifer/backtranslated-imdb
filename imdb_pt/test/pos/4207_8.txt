*** SPOILERS *** Even though the film "They made me a criminal" is far from as good as John Garfield's latest anti-hero classics as "Body & Soul" in 1947 "Force of Evil" in 1948 and his last and very underrated "He ran all the way" in 1951 is the film that defined his career from that point until his untimely death on May 21, 1952, at the tender age of 39. <br /> <br /> Garfiled plays the role of lightweight champion Johnnie Bradfield and later the fugitive from the law Jack Dorney, who is innocent of the murder he is accused of, even though he has been declared officially dead. Jonnie's director, Doc Ward, Robert "Doc" Gleckler, who during a drunken victory party killed reporter Charles McGee, John Ridgely, who would expose his fighter Johnnie Bradfield to the public. the son of the mother. Doc Gleckler smashed a bottle over McGee's head, killing him when Jonnie was nearly dead drunk with several women having fun in her hotel suite. Doc was later killed in a car accident with Johnnie's girlfriend, Goldie, Ann Sheridan, but Doc tensed up and, with Johnnie's watch, was mistaken for Johnnie. He said to stay dead and buried by his lawyer Malvin, Robert Strange, who took $ 9,750.00 out of the $ 10,000.00 of Johnnie's money he had for this great council. Malvin told Johnnie to take on a new identity and, from now on, call Jack Dorney and give him out of New York State; talking about despicable shysters. Johnnie now Jack Dorney runs the rails from New York to Arizona, ending at the Rafferty Ranch Farm Date, where most of the film takes place. <br /> <br /> If it were not for John Garfield in the lead role as Both Jonnie Bradfield and Jack Dorney the movie would have been lost and forgotten. Garfield, who was only 26 at the time, brought the best of them all in the film. Even the children of Dead End transported, I think we can call them The Arizona Kids here, acting above what you would expect them and they have become real and sensitive people, not a lot of slap clowns like in almost all their movies . All this for being on the same stage, or shooting location, with John Garfield. <br /> <br /> "They made me a criminal" is a good story that has the champion in disguise acting like anything but not to draw attention to himself and end up not just behind the bars but in the electric chair. In the end Jack showed what kind of man he is by not fighting the big fight and against all odds dramatically winning at the last moment but by four brutal rounds to get the money for his new family on the farm date including his Peggy Girl , Gloria Dickson, to open a gas station with him. <br /> <br /> Giving European champion Gaspar Rutchek, Frank Riggi, the fight of his life and getting $ 2,000, that's $ 500.00 per round, for doing so Jack showed everyone who looked at him as the "Arizona Kids" that sometimes punching is much braver and grittier than throwing one. The fact that Jack could easily have beaten Rutched, but not to expose himself to the police, like the loose killer Johnnie Bradfield. But instead he went as far as he could carry whatever Rutchek could throw to help his friends show more than all the fights he won in the boxing ring together. <br /> <br /> I at least did not find the end of the movie planned, but I fit the story well. Police officer Morty Phelam, Claude Rains, who came to Arizona from New York to arrest Jack had to live for years the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair. We were told all this at the beginning of the movie. Why know that Jack / Johnnie was innocent of the murder he is accused of and not knowing for sure if he will be found innocent in a court of law, would he want to make the same terrible mistake again? I can easily see this happening in real life, because not in the movies.
