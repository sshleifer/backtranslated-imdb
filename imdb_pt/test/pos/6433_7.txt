I rarely watch short films, since they only seem to be on late night television and are not advertised enough for me to know which shorts are worth. As The Room is an extra feature on The Hitcher DVD, it gave me a wonderful opportunity to watch a high quality short with Rutger Hauer in excellent shape. <br /> <br /> Artistically shot in black and white, The Room explores an obsession of the man with a room he passed in the early stages of adulthood and is expressed in an interview / documentary style. The dialogue is very poetic, typical of a man who expresses his feelings for a woman, but is also juxtaposed with ramblings and occasional shortcomings in fluency. This adds great realism and depth to Hauer's performance, which is perfect as an eccentric man with most of his life behind him. <br /> <br /> The piano music that Harry (Hauer) hears from the room is constantly in the background and highlights the touching atmosphere of the film and intensifies the feelings of sadness expressed by Hauer. <br /> <br /> Hauer proves that he is more than a Hollywood psychopath with this role and perfectly exhibits his most sensitive side. Mattijn Hartemink is also effective in flashback scenes like the young Harry with a silent role. It shows how he is affected by the song and his disappointment when it goes away. <br /> <br /> The ending is prophetic and leaves you with a greater reflective mood than many feature films. A very good effort.
