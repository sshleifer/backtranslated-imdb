This movie was even better than 'Waiting for Guffman'. The great strength of these two films is in the brilliant character of the small group of the city of Guest and Levy. If someone finds this movie boring or meaningless, God help them, they just do not understand. It is a mockumentary, something for which Guest and Levy have a genius. At the end of the movie where the southern lover of Guest at home tells us to relax after the show, he went to Israel to work on a "caboose", or when he tells us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyphic <br /> <br /> From an ancient Egyptian holding a small ancient egyptian in his hand, I realized that it's moments like this that make life worth living. Thank you Mr.Guest and Mr.Levy, and God bless you.
