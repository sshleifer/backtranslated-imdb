What an original work. I have always liked Liev Schreiber, the "actor", but now it is necessary to appreciate the man on a multidimensional level. How did he get that field of sunflowers? It was computerized, it sure looked real. And how do you audition a dog knowing that you will achieve this kind of performance? Does the gym have a pet category? I think what I'm saying is that I really enjoyed this indie, quirky and infrequent movie. From the excellent cast (you never know that Eugene Hutz was not a professional actor) to the director of photography (some beautiful photos) the song (bought the CD when leaving the theater) and of course the two "D's" (direction and DOG) . All in all a "10". <br /> <br /> /
