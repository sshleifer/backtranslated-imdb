Do not miss this age-defying photo. Without hesitation, a work of art. Not only the script and the music, but also the choreography, the casting, the cut: everything contributes to the perfect realization. Now almost 25 years ago and still amazing for maturity, art and sensitivity. Available now on DVD, do not miss either. The transfert is perfect <br /> <br /> and the sound is re-boosted. A mystery remains about this superb work: why did the actors not succeed after this beginning?
