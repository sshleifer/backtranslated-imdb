As a former Merchant Seaman I was really interested in this movie: I personally was involved in a clandestine quest to leave Kingston Jamaica where a person was found. We were able to put him ashore, even though we were on territorial boundaries. On another ship I was in the clandestine was found and we could not land anywhere due to passport / nationality issues. In fact, he remained for a year as an almost "honorary" crew member and worked for his livelihood. Africa is notorious for clandestine pickups. There is a big scene at the beginning of the movie when the bulk carrier enters the African port: its size surpasses everything. The crew pop on shore for a bit of intercourse and inebriation. So far normal. The drama begins when clandestinians enter the vast cavernous basements of the ship. Joss Ackland is brilliant as the captain with a drinking problem being besieged by his Nemesis suchet right in the way the company representative on board. The clandestine search is classic, but we had no weapons. I question the use of weapons in this movie. This ship seemed to have a vast arsenal. In my experience, guns at sea are severely restricted due to customs regulations., Also having a dog on board was strange. All rabies laws, especially in Europe, severely restrict the carrying of animals. Anyway, Pertwee is brilliant as the bitter Mate. The horror that follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable: the dark metallic background of the ships remains, and the feeling that there is nowhere to hide, adds to the drama. Some members of the freighter crew are not involved in the murder and those who get involved. are gradually sucked into a world of violence from which there is no escaping. The chase through the ship, especially the engine room scenes, are "edge on the seat": the feeling of extreme claustrophobia is abundant. The feeling of metal pressing and death being just a gun barrel away. The film is brutal: my girlfriend had to give up watching him during filming and scenes. Meanwhile going into Suchet in the comfort of his well appointed cabin gets drunk unconscious of the chaos 3 decks below. It's a tense, flawed movie, but the real message is that we can all be sucked into violence like this. Slowly and surely. Think of the train drivers who took the Jews to Auschwitz, the officials who made the train timetable. I always remember someone who visited the Dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and said that one of the S.S. guards had placed a bird table outside the camp's crematorium. This movie is like this: ordinary people suddenly find themselves in a world of uncontrollable violence!
