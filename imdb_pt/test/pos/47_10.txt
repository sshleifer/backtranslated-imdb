Lackawanna Blues is an excellent movie. The cast was perfect. Each actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played. Their chemistry together was incredible. The acting was superb. I felt like I knew the characters. I could almost 'feel' them. They reminded me of people I knew as a child, growing up in the '50s and' 60s. Oh, the memories !! My personal opinion is that this movie should be on the big screen for everyone to see. I've watched this movie so many times, that I can almost recite the lines while the characters are saying it. I can not even list my favorite part because I have so many favorite parts. Thanks for bringing back a part of my youth that I have never seen today ... and this is the black people loving each other, taking care of each other, respecting each other, caring for each other, and doing everything we do can help each other. Have to go now. I have to go watch again.
