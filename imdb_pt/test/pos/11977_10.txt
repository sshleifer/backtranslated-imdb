This movie is undoubtedly the best I have seen in my entire life. The stellar star cast is just an added bonus on the incredible special effects, and a deep story and sublime choreography. The film is about an old love affair that unfolds in the modern world. Two lovers in heaven incur the wrath of a great sage and are cursed. Subsequently, the woman is born again on earth. While she is in college, she is raped and commits suicide. The rest of the film basically focuses on the hunt for people associated with rape, for their lover who has superhuman strength and the mastery of various languages. Sonu Nigam delivers a very mature and profound performance in this film, and all the other actors do almost the same. The action scenes with Akshay Kumar are mind-blowing and should not be missed. You simply have to watch this movie !!!
