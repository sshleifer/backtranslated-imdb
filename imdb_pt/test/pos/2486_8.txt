Certain aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect, specifically some of the actors. However, I feel that this is probably the most important film of the "war on terror" era. I grew up hating hippies and in some ways I still do. It was not until the United States began the path of an unnecessary and misleading war in Iraq that I began to see the world through their eyes. I can feel what they must have felt. Although the film is a bit dated, watching it brings out these uncomfortable emotions about our current situation. It is clear enough at the beginning of the film that the Punishment Park is designed to be a concentration camp and death for all the "unpatriotic" elements of American society. This is certainly an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized society, but it is CREDIBLE. Sometimes I find myself believing that the US could easily fall into fascism. While watching this film, I could only think of how I hear similar feelings from people on both sides of the political spectrum almost daily. This film is a concentrated and crude distillation of the current American political scene. I am impressed and saddened by the fact that something relevant (and yes, precise) was filmed over 30 years ago. If you take a more moderate view of the film and decide to believe it could not happen here, take a closer look at Guantanamo Bay, some of our "enemy fighters," rumors of secret CIA prisons, and the many incidents similar to this one . in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1979 (8 full years after the making of this film).
