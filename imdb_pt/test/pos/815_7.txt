"Blind Date" is one of three stories made in movies by author Vida Hurst. Many familiar faces in this oldie from 1934. Mickey Rooney as a small punk word of mouth. He seems to be in the movie for comic and home "family values." Jane Darwell again plays the Willpower mother, as well as in Grapes of Wrath and the Oxbow Incident. Ann Sothern is Kitty, who dates Bill (Paul Kelly), but meets up with the rich Bob Hartwell, played by Neil Hamilton, who may or may not be best for her. You can certainly say that this was done early in the production code of Hays - at one point, Kitty says she can not be there alone with him if there is no one else in the house ... that change from a year or two before, when anything and everything was OK. Good solid plot, but lots of talk and small talk. This raises the question of what a girl should be looking for in a man; should she wait for a man with integrity who treats her lawfully, or just find a man with a lot of money, like most movies of the previous 20 years had defended ...? and how do men change when their situation changes? Beware of violence in the strange scene of the dance marathon. Viewers of the 1960s will recognize Hamilton as Batman's Commissar Gordon ..... Also some weird drama in the offscreen lives for some of the cast in this - Paul Kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle . Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer, who was 20 years older; Rooney ended up being married eight times. Tyler Brooke (Emory) and Spencer Charters (Pa) both killed each other in real life. The title "Data Blind" has been reused many times, for movies, TV series and even cartoons, but none of them seems to have the same plot as this.
