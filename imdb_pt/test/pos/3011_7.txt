I had no expectations when I started watching this movie. How surprised! This is a great, beautiful movie that will give your mind a good job! It is not simple. If you enjoy just the style of Police Academy, films without brains, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep and complex film with influences from such films as Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, plus many completely new ideas. Wonderful and twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story make this one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! Keep an open mind and you will love it!
