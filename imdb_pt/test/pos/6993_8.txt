This was a "sleeper" for sure !! Much better than I thought! I never realized it was a horror movie ... and who was this yummy baritoned hunk named Vin Diesel ... adding spice and intrigue to this movie that otherwise would not be released? The monsters in this movie were quite unusual, they were not the same gobble-up types! The ending was great too, for a change, not all "bad guys" are bad !!! I give 2 thumbs up !!!
