I absolutely loved this movie. For me, the best reason to see this is the stark contrast to cool dramas like "Boston Legal" or "Ally McBeal" or even "LA Law." This is reality. The law is not BS, it wins in some final discussion or through some ridiculous defense you get out of your butt, like the "Chewbacca Defense" in South Park.) This is a veritable farce of justice, the legal system has gone horribly wrong, and the work of good lawyers - not the stereotypical shyster, who uses all his skills to correct him. He will do more to restore his faith in humanity than any Frank Capra movie or KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. And most important, I cried. During the movie, during the featurette included at the end of the DVD - it's amazing. Wonderful movie; wonderfully done. Thank God the filmmakers did it.
