It's been almost 25 years since I've seen this movie. I would consider this movie as an all-time classic in a drama category. Anthony Queen does one of the most wonderful performances of all time. In a matter of minutes, it takes you from laughter to tears. This film represents a splendid image of how humanity changed after World War II. How much of that generation and the next lost their innocence. It took me a long time to find this movie by its name "the 25th hour". This kind of movie is not lucrative, but it is a treasure to some. I am very surprised that this film is not used to the media in a wide way, so that more people enjoy this image.
