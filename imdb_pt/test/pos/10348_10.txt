The brilliant performance of David Tennant and Sarah Parish left me in tears as many of the scenes were so familiar to me. My husband suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1977 and required a major operation that involved lifting the brain and plugging the leak. Like Tricia, I was naive enough to expect him to be his former self again. After more than 25 years of love and affection for him, he left me without warning to go and live with a woman he barely knew. He then asked and now I'm going through a divorce. I hope the program has helped people understand how it is to deal with brain injuries.
