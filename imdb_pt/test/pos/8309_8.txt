The CONTEXT is everything when evaluating a movie. When rating this film, you need to consider the time it was made. We really did not know what the Earth's interior was in those days, so you can not cheat a lot in the movie for the plot (based on a much older book). For the time, this was a special high-level effect and the production quality was great. I watched this movie in a masterfully restored HD masterpiece. By the time the make-up and effects almost make the guys in rubber suits look plausible as a monstrous thing. This is pure movie cheese complete with bad rubber suits, scary models and costumes. IMPRESSIVE. PS Doug McClure ROCKS!
