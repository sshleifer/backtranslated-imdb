I had no idea what I would see when I decided to watch this movie and, to my surprise, it's just an extremely well done horror film, which is easily one of the best of the 70's. The film is of course low budget and this is a great example of how the story and style of a movie create shivers, not special effects! Strother Martin is one of the great actors of characters of all time and he has a rare protagonist role here and the film also stars Martins, good friend L.Q. Jones and "Green Acres" Alvy Moore. Jones and Moore also helped produce this film. TV veteran Charles Bateman is the star and the beauty of "Enter the Dragon" Ahna Capri is his girlfriend. Capri is in a bikini at the beginning of the movie and it's beautiful to see! The movie does a great job of staying with the story and not adding a fake ending and I really liked the way the movie ends. Great atmosphere, interesting story and well directed by Bernard McEveety. Martins' performance is top notch as well, as he does not hold on and really puts himself in the role of Doc. Good and underrated film!
