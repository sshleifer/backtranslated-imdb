A very positive message for our youth is shown in this film. Through the sport of rugby as a medium, a high school rugby coach takes his players into their behavior and lifestyle, and off the field. <br /> <br /> The acting and direction are good. The rugby shots are just OK if you know some rugby or very cool if you do not know much about it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, it's worth watching, especially at a point in time when this sport is gaining more and more followers every day. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a true story that takes place in Utah. The trainer portrayed in this film has been in charge of the Highlanders for more than 30 years (and loses only the game every 3 years). <br /> <br /> Have fun!
