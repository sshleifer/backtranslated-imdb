This movie is not typical of Hollywood, although the choices are so bad that they often tend to stay away from the movies rather than being disappointed. However, this little budget gem is completely lovely and nice and definitely a keeper. The actors are as varied as the characters they portray, the Buffalo scene is charming (what a beautiful city), and the story shines. The lack of gratuitous violence, sex and the word "f" does not diminish at all! Take the kids, get the grandma, take a break in Hollywood! I give an 11 out of 10!
