This was a very violent film about anti-Semitism. However, unlike the GENTLEMEN AGREEMENT (which also deals with anti-Semitism), the film has aged well and does not seem heavy. In other words, he deals with the subject without seeming prejudiced or banal by today's standards. <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan plays one of the more vile characters, as he hits a guy to death just because he's Jewish. Robert Mitchum plays the investigator trying to get to the bottom of the crime. <br /> <br /> I give the film praise for its brave and inflexible look at hate. It is in many ways an example of Film Noir - even if the topic is not about gangsters or habitual robberies.
