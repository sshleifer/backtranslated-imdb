The latest film by Swedish filmmaker Roy Andersson, You, the Living, is not easy to review. One reason is that, in his own words, he broke with the Anglo-Saxon tradition of storytelling, in all its essence, the model of most western film productions. Another reason may be that although Roy Andersson is somewhat heavy on symbolism, his, unlike those of, say, Andrei Tarkovsky, are of a more elusive nature. It took him 3 years to complete this 86 minute film and it was not because he was forced to take long breaks between shootings due to financial problems or problems with the actors. The film consists of 57 vignettes filmed mainly by a camera, and it was the careful drawing of each of these scenes that required a lot of time. The image of this film that is closely related to the director's previous film, Songs of the Second Floor, is of utmost importance to the story, so this story is told in large part by the environment and environment in which the characters of the Andersson universe inhabit. and interact. Before each scene was finally filmed, there would be no less than 10 different shootings with actors, colors, dialogues, etc. The result is a dreamlike version of the surrounding world that most of us would recognize and if the setting is like dreaming, why not dream a little? Just as in The Discreet Charm of Bunuel's Bourgeoisie, when someone says, "I had a dream last night," you can watch it. But again, what is perceived as reality here is not very different from dreams. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film does not have a storyline in the traditional sense of the word and there are no main characters like so, the different characters that appear and reappear in different scenes are still found and their stories are inevitably interlaced. What most of these characters have in common is apparent loneliness, although they are surrounded by other people. The trailer trash chain smoking and compulsively drinking from a woman who dreams of having a motorcycle to get away from "all that crap", her corpulent and almost always silent boyfriend and her fragile and seemingly delicate but rather distracted mother, band members whose ability to improve efforts at home is not receiving a favorable reception from either their families or their neighbors, the Middle Eastern hairdresser and his arrogant client on the way to "a very important business meeting," an elderly man taking a nightmare about bombing in the skies, a young woman dreaming of marrying the young rock star she is so madly in love with. It is all about dreams and nightmares versus reality, but it works as much as an affirmation in support of the claims of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein that "all human communication is a lack of communication." People talk to each other, but it's like they talk to each other. They try to get close to others, but close others when they try to reach them. <br /> <br /> You, the Living, is a poetic film set physically in Stockholm, but universally applicable. The society it portrays is Sweden, its artistic language and the people exhibited are generally unmistakably Nordic. However, the subject he deals with, namely, the misery of humanity in a selfish world, goes far beyond this hemisphere. Despite the seriousness of its theme, the film itself seems much more cheerful and full of humor than one might expect. But in the director's own words "living is so complicated for each of us that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor." Thus, this film is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy, depending on its sensibilities, and not on a depressing black reality of human nature. It's unusual in its language and structure, but if you can think outside the box and have fun, you'll surely find this movie both fun and meaningful. It was shown at this year's Cannes festival as part of the Un Certain Regard program, which offers "original and different works" outside the competition. After the film was shown at Salle Debussy, the audience of 1,000 people applauded standing for several minutes. Do I need to say more?
