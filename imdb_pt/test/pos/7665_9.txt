I've never read a good review for "Vanity Fair" and I can not understand why. For something that was "rushed in ten days," everything works out surprisingly well. While admittedly "Becky Sharp" is a better movie and Miriam Hopkins is a better Becky, there is nothing to stop this from getting a solid 9/10. Sometimes Myrna Loy may seem too cute and cool to play a slut, but at other times she just has to squint and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees. Meow! The move to a more modern setting did not work against "Vanity Fair" and the only thing that really causes some conflict is the cast. Barbara Kent (Amelia) was less than six foot tall, and few of the leading men were too tall too - all coming together to make Loy look like an absolute woman from the Amazon! <br /> <br /> "Vanity Fair" is similar to "Craig's Wife" in that no matter how bad the main character is, you have to love her. And you know she deserves your punishment and then some, but you still feel sorry for her when she succeeds. Although based on the same "Becky Sharp" story, this version had a different ending, which is interesting to see because most other movies were almost identical. For pleasure, the end of "Becky Sharp" is more pleasant, although aesthetically, and the flow of the story, there is no doubt that the end of "Vanity Fair" is the best, whether you really like it or not.
