Once the slow start begins, the movie begins and really becomes quite entertaining in many unexpected ways. The cast is very good, with Heather Graham being perhaps the weakest of them. Casey Affleck as his brother is very good and extremely friendly, if you understand me. <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie if you just want to have good hours. Teenagers should really like this movie - it says a lot about relationships.
