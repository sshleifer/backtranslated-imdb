Very good movie. Very good documentary. It's great to see these detectives humiliated and discovered as the fanatic, narcissistic, and heartless zealots that their parents, community, and environment created for them. <br /> <br/> I tilt my cover to Pat McGuinness. Can we get that decent human being in some kind of commission or investigation? We need your integrity, perseverance, intelligence, clarity and spirit fighting against the fraudulent game that is the world politics and the big companies. <br /> <br /> All animals go out at night - prostitutes, cat hunters, fangs, queens, fairies. , dopers, addicts, sick, venal. Someday a real rain will come and wipe all the scum from the streets. Pat McGuinness must be the first drop of this real rain. The people who control this land are animals. They need to be drowned. <br /> <br /> I'm just in shock. Walking at night is a scary business. The inhuman howling and clucking is from detectives, on Murder On A Sunday Morning. In the spotlight of Pat McGuinness, they seem terribly caught up, terribly guilty and ready for a fair and horrible drowning. <br /> <br /> It's exceptionally satisfying, in a world where gamblers play a manipulated game, see justice done and see every narcissistic criminal drown as the pathetic human rats they are. <br /> <br /> How do you feel railway fingers, abominable and sinuous of the law? How do you feel about having your fraudulent process, your fraudulent confession, your fraudulent detective job, discovered what you really were? How is it? <br /> <br /> Hope you twist like a knife you miserable, one eye nothing.
