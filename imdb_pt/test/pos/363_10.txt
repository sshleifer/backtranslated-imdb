This movie was fabulous. It's definitely a top 5 hitchcock movie. Camera direction and photos are almost perfect (apart from the dog scene when he licks his hand, clearly in slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very believable that an innocent man could fall into such a trap. <br /> <br /> I would rate Bruno as the second most interesting character in the hitchcock (of course bates is the first). Robert Walker plays a very believable maniac. He did not get over the part that made it believable (just as perkins did not exaggerate his part). Overall, this is a great movie, a must-see for any hitchcock fan. <br /> <br /> <br />
