*** Spoiler in fifth paragraph *** This was an incredibly frank image for 1955. Otto Preminger and Carlyle Productions had a chance to do so, the Motion Picture Association of America refused to certify a film that openly shows a junky pointing a syringe full of heroin on his arm. Frank Sinatra had the chance to play a stunted musician and fall on his face in a role that required at least twice as much acting he had already done. Although all these bets are worth it, the movie is a classic, though not perfect. <br /> <br /> Nelson Algren's novel may be great, but it has a lot to add to fit comfortably into a two-hour movie. 'The man with the golden arm' is 119 minutes and often feels much longer. However, in my opinion it's not just Frankie Machine (Sinatra) who makes the film, but the other characters and their subplots, all involving Frankie. Ultimately, it's not just Frankie who has the addiction, everyone and everything seems to depend on him and he feels it intensely. When the pressure comes to be too much, the battery begins to beat on the soundtrack and Frankie crosses the street with his well-dressed "friend" Louie. <br /> <br /> It is an exaggeration to say that Frank Sinatra's musical career was always fashionable, but in the early 1950s he was in limbo between his days touring with big bands and the Las Vegas era. 'From Here to Eternity' established him as a serious actor and his career as a singer has also recovered, but 'The Golden Arm Man' was still a significant challenge, the whole show sinks or nothing with his performance. He takes it so skillfully that for several minutes I forgot I was watching Frank Sinatra, he must have known junky musicians and tapped that knowledge to the fullest. Set side by side with Billy Wilder's masterpiece, "The Lost Weekend," puts more emphasis on the sociological causes of addiction in "The Man with the Golden Arm." While Don Birnem (Ray Milland in 'The Lost Weekend') seems to be fighting mostly against himself, Frankie Machine is attacked by outside forces and takes refuge in the needle. No approach is totally right or wrong, mainly because the addiction is impossible to fully explain, but it seems that this movie may have benefited from a little more insight into Frankie's inner struggle. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler ** * One of the problems I have with this movie is the clich√©d dependence on "giving up the cold turkey". I realize that 'The Man with the Golden Arm' was probably setting the trend instead of following it, but that does not make it any better. At the beginning of the movie, Frankie has all the appearances of kicking his habit with the help of a doctor and a treatment unit of some sort. Of course, the drama of the movie requires him to stray, but I have found the American ideal that a man has to face his problems alone (or perhaps with the help of a good woman) out of place here. To get cold turkey and go out for the sunset with Kim Novak seemed very unrealistic. The end of 'The Lost Weekend' was similar, but in my opinion it was a bit less rosy.
