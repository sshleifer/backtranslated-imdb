When I rented this movie, I kind of hoped it was a low-budget movie, I'd shoot fewer Indy movies, but I thought I'd give it a try. I started to watch Part 1 and could not get away until I finished 3 hours later. It was by far one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. From the writing to the direction of the presentations, I was laughing, crying and singing throughout the Nan Astley passing ritual, from innocence to adulthood. Rachael Stirling is phenomenal in this movie. I had never heard of her before, but now I will forever remember the vulnerability and strength I felt in her performance. She, Keeley Hawes and Jodhi May are incredible as they guide you through the emotional turmoil you feel the most when you deal with an alternative form of sexuality. The fact that the film was set in the 1890s not only educates the public about homosexuality in this period of time, but also makes a statement about our society today. You should see this movie and, probably like me, will be paying a visit to the store to add it to your collection.
