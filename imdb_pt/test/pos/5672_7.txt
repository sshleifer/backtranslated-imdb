** SPOILERS ** Looking for a little more excitement, then seeing crocodiles being fed on sisters Grace and Pat, Diana Glenn and Maeve Dermody, along with Grace's boyfriend, Adam, Andy Rodoreda, decide to take a trip up the river in desolation . and desert, from human habitation, Australian Mangrove Swamps. With his Jimmy swamp guide Ben Oxenbuld at the helm of his motorized boat, the four are overturned by a gigantic saltwater crocodile that quickly grabs and drags a terrified Jimmy to the bottom together with him. Grace Pat and Adam end up stranded in a tree in the swamp, with Pat waiting for his life on the overturned boat. The rest of the film has the crocodile hungry and determined to play a cat and mouse, or human game with the trio ending in a clash in a mud bank where Jimmy's dead and dismembered body finally came to rest. Both the director and the actors of the film take advantage of the swamp, making it sometimes much more frightening than the giant crocodile swimming in it. We see the killer crocodile about half a dozen times in the movie, but they all hit you, and Jimmy Grace Pat and Adam, right in the stomach. <br /> <br /> Always been held in suspense by The giant reptile always does its low damage coming so unexpectedly that, crock attacks, have much more effect when you do not see them coming, as in the last ten minutes of the movie, when you do. You wonder from the beginning who in the end would survive the crocodile attacks and eventually live to tell about them. The ending with the crocodile vs. human confrontation was about the weaker and more unrealistic part of the movie. The crocodile that was so cautious and effective in the previous scenes seemed to have pounded, or swam, not to have the strength or speed to grab, with its lethal jaws, and to do away with the sole survivor of the expedition. In fact, the killer was so ineffective that even after he had criticized the victim or the victims, he simply could not handle them. This in the end turned out to be fatal on their part. Much like "Jaws" the movie "Black Water" has the killer crocodile, like the great white shark in "Jaws", more interested is killing his human prey, then eat them. With all the food available in the swamp and rivers that inhabited the crocodile it was only after the quartet, Grace Pat Adam & Jimmy, to invade his watery domain that he felt to be the great ruler. And for daring to do this, they would pay with their lives!
