The adorable and yet deadly Alexandra (the stunning blonde beauty Stacie Randall, who looks absolutely overwhelming in a tight black leather outfit) must find a magical amulet so that her evil demonic master Faust can cross our dimension. It is up to the fearless and sturdy police officer Jonathan Graves (sympathetic Peter Liapis) to stop her. Meanwhile, two gnome-dwarf creatures, who are not funny and bland, go mad in Los Angeles. Jim Wynorski, a veteran veterans exploration expert, reports the supremely empty story at a brisk pace and does not take this madness seriously remotely. The cast struggles with the silly material: the lovely Barbara Alyn Woods as cheeky, searching for police captain Kate, Raquel Krelle as a prostitute, sexy prostitute Jeanine, Bobby Di Cicco as Graves Scotty's clumsy partner, Peggy Trentini as the curator of museum Monica and Ace Mask as the cheery Dr. Rochelle. Mark Stevi's childlike cookie cutter script, an amusingly simplistic mood feel, Chuck Cirino's corn-ball count, the two dwarves with obvious cheap Halloween rubber masks, JE Bash's simple cinematography, no tension or nudity free feminine to speak the special gross effects (unless) further enhance the total and delicious delicacy of this slice of celluloid Velveeta. A playfully blinding piece of a lovely mess.
