I saw this movie for the first time on a sick school day about ten years ago. Compared to the Lifetime movies that I usually watched, it has become an instant, though obscure, favorite. <br /> <br /> I've seen it twice since. I think some parts are little extravagant, maybe the plot could use a little more action. <br /> <br /> However, it captures the fantasies and realities of children with uniqueness and warmth. The magical realism is similar to Amelie's and the heart with that of The Wonder Years. Despite the particular development of my taste, I still find the subtle magic of this film, the adorable characters and its charming simplicity.
