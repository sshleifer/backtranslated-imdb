This is fantastic! Everything from Score - to the final role of credits. This movie is a masterpiece. It's genuinely scary and its effectively hysterical scenario is enough to make anyone go creepy. Clearly the film was not rushed, and that David Schmoeller (who would later work with Fullmoon in the Master Puppet series) had a clear and concise picture of what he is trying to target. The professional aspect of the film is surprising considering the relatively low budget. It depends on no-effect scares (mainly due to budget constraints), but it still creates an atmosphere of tension. <br /> <br /> Stephen King stated that this was one of his favorite movies and I can not seriously blame him! It's one of my favorite horror movies and it always will be. This is my favorite full moon movie and it's been since the first time I bought a good few years ago. <br /> <br /> Money well spent! I own the VHS and DVD versions. <br /> <br /> 10/10
