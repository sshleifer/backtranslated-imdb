Are you looking for a comedy drama with suspense and cast? Well, find that little sleeper. John Lithgow and Billy Bob Thorton are great at this little plot. Do not forget the cameo by Jamie Lee Curtis. A touch of the 60's, a touch of "the prince and the beggar," and a dash of homemade gold makes a great story.
