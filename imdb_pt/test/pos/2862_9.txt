Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave Theater in Plainfield, Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie just because I figured it would be a WWE movie that would be good for a laugh. So I sat down and watched and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He's probably one of the craziest guys on the big screen (far worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has a big advantage for other movies that draws me to a horror movie. This shows Jacob Goodnight as someone who is human. He has a heart, no matter how twisted and scary it is. He feels pain, something Jason never does or seems to show. He feels sadness and pleasure, though again both are insane, which you will notice if you see the film. All in all, a different experience in my opinion than many slashers, and surprised me in some ways, as in who lived in the end.
