This extremely fun shorts is considered one of the best shorts of all time, and I certainly will not discuss it. Even in a country where first-rate animation short films are created regularly, this film still manages to stand out. If you have the chance to see this movie, do so. It has only ten minutes and still contains a man obsessed with saws, a woman washing the bathtub and a nuclear war. What more could you want in a movie?
