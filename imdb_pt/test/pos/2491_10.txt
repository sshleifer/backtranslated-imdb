To think that this movie was made the year I was born. To think that people are still having their constitutional rights taken away, now in the name of "homeland security." To think that this movie was intentionally banned from the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK addresses the political divide in the United States better than any movie I've ever seen. Had it been more widely seen, would anything have changed? Such a film is so polarizing that it has the potential to cause riots. It shakes you and forces you to take sides. This makes you face the question: are you for the right of dissent of the people at a time of war, or for the constitution to be compromised in the name of "national security"? The protagonists are forced by the government to run for the American flag in a game that undermines the ideals that the flag represents. The acting is totally convincing. So much so, I can not see any acting going on here. If this is a scripted documentary, it's more convincing than any reality television show today. PUNISHMENT PARK is possibly the most important film ever made. It really makes you think.
