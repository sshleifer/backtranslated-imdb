I'm not a big fan of Lucius Fulci's films. Most of his 80-year-old films had their moments, but they often appeared as imitations of second-rate Dario Argento. Except for the fun "Zombie" (which was an imitation of George Romero), I really did not like them. I know that Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the plot and characters of his films were very bold, even by standards. That's why "Do not Torture the Duckling" surprised me. In fact, it's a very well done movie with an engaging murder mystery. It is possibly the best giallo ever made, only seriously rivaled by the entries of Dario Argento in the genre. And unlike Fulci's earlier giallo, "A Lizard in the Skin of a Woman," it never creeps. <br /> <br /> Fulci's direction here is very good. It keeps the story moving at a good pace and keeps the viewer's interest everywhere. In addition, the completion of the mystery is a complete surprise to the public. In addition, it adds some clever touches such as optimistic soul music during a particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence. In general, violence here is contained and used only when necessary for history. The acting is good for the most part too, full of familiar faces from the 70's Italian exploration film. Both Thomas Milian and Barbara Bouchet are super cool everywhere. The only weak link is Florinda Bolkan, whose performance is greatly exaggerated. It's the only laughable aspect of the movie. "Do not torture a duckling" definitely comes with my recommendation and can be a good introduction to the giallo subgenus as a whole. (8/10)
