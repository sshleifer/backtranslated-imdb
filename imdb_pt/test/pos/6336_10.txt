This episode of Buffy was one of my personal favorites. Also number three of Joss's personal favorites as well. The episode featured very few dialogues and although the good Emmy staff decided they deserved an indication. Unfortunately it did not win. When Hush debuted for the first time, it received about 6 million viewers, which was the highest rated episode of the fourth season. That should tell you something. Even if there was very little talk, he managed to intrigue people enough to tune in. These gentlemen characters (who were my mimes) were some of the scariest creatures that the program produced (or any network TV show I've ever seen). Nothing is more chilling than a bunch of silver-tinned men coming at you with a scalpel as you smile. I think, despite the lack of dialogue, the actors did a fantastic job on the episode.
