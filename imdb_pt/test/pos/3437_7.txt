"Jaded" should not be considered an erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not to see pleasure, unlike movies like "Indecent Behavior" or "Friend Of The Family". <br /> <br /> "Jaded" is not an easy watch, since the story is difficult to conceive and is not so common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect stronger scenes. <br /> <br /> The rape scene was not (in my opinion) a well-crafted scene. I think the director did not use proper camera techniques in the film. That's why sometimes it seems boring and it gets boring almost at the end. <br /> <br /> The performances are extremely good of all five female characters. These women gave strong, intense, yet convincing performances that demonstrate the actresses' dramatic abilities. <br /> <br /> Legal concepts have helped much to understand the difficulty of the plot, because the legal term of sodomy is different from a simple rape. From the standpoint of Meg's defense, sodomy must be penalized as rape (an enormous degree of B-crime), although it is a different crime. Pat and Alex's defense claims that Meg liked it and asked for it. This is where the movie gets interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. The only certainty is that the sex scene fits into a legal definition of a crime. <br /> <br /> Watch "Jaded" if you like legal issues that are not very common in your society. If not, try it because it's a very good and strong drama.
