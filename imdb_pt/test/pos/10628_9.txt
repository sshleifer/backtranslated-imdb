Isabelle Huppert plays a talented piano teacher who is serious, hostile and distant in public and bitter towards her students. In particular, she bursts with violence and frustration, and her sex life is lonely and perverse. She lives with her domineering mother, who leads her obsessively to being noticed (and so advanced in life) as a talented pianist. The key to the characters of mother and daughter is "obsession". These characters can no longer change their impulses than a rabbit trapped in the headlights can prevent death. <br /> <br /> The piano teacher knows a young, attractive and talented pianist who is drawn to her from the very beginning. They start a relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the outset it makes perverse and violent terms that it must run into it, which makes it sick enough to want to end the relationship before it actually begins. <br /> <br /> The film connects to the female protagonist. Isabelle Huppert surprises with a brutal and completely convincing performance as a piano teacher. She cleverly shows a woman who is attracted to beauty and perversion, but her violence is fueled by her perverted impulses. Like a character-oriented film, you know it would not work so well if it had acted badly. This is powerful, intelligently represented and intelligently and sensibly adapted from the novel. The camera job also fits the movie. There is what I can only think of to call, frame scenes in which the director makes a scene and forces the eye to launch. This is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall, and is further evidence of the director's mastery. <br /> <br /> Expect to be disturbed and disgusted with this movie. But be brave - have the courage to go and see him. This is a very particular look at a person's life essentially, but do not expect to be entertained in the direction of Hollywood ... there are no car chases in this movie!
