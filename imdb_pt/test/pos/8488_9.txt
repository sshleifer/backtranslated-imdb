A couple of days ago I saw the incredible "House of Sand and Fog" and was impressed by the surprising performance of Ben Kingsley in the lead role. I decided to see "Ray", trying to understand how and why Ben Kingsley did not win the Oscar for Best Lead Actor. After watching Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles, I agree with the Academy: he really deserved to be honored. I like Ray Charles, I was not his fan, but Jamie Foxx's resemblance to him is incredible. The film is completely endorsed by Jamie Foxx, who participates in most of the shootings, and his movements on stage look as if he is a reincarnation of Ray Charles. As far as the story goes, I saw the extended version on DVD, very long, but also very nice, with many beautiful songs and scenes showing mainly a Ray Charles junkie. My biggest surprise was finding out that Ray Charles was a heroin addict and how he treated his own family. The presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the film. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ray"
