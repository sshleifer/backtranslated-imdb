There are movies that are just a different version of another, are not remakes, but just similar to others, it is not. Despite talking about the Mafia, it is seen in a different way and often seems only a secondary theme. I went to see the movie for the case (because the other's theater was full) and I was satisfied in the end. Surprised me, because of its black irony or cynicism, and there are more and more interesting items to analyze. It does not follow the classic forms of the movies, it's just different and I do not think it's the only one to like it. I am very happy also because it is Italian, and I feared that the Italian directors and producers were not brave enough to change the subject. In this movie you can also watch the new Italian style, but it is not blocked in clich√©s. I hope to be understandable enough, I know it is difficult, I also hope that this film can be exported outside our borders, it is a good product to export. I want to also highlight the music, very good soundtrack, the film needs this because of its long silent pause and they are covered perfectly by that song. Lots of compliments to the director, and thank you, cinema needs those movies.
