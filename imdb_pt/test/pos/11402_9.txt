Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples that any filmmaker should take a long look at. Of course, you could spend a lot of quality time reviewing the Hitchcock classics for Scorsese; but let us follow the example for the modern generation and study without enthusiasm. Where to start, I suppose someone could look at the film simply as a story, maybe even a docudrama that focuses on the pornographic industry of the late 1970s. And what an industry it was! The other half could focus on the incredible detail that a brilliant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and * ahem * eraser. But honestly, Boogie Nights brings back the pure, non-bulb! Shi $, in his kind of movie theater that I have not experienced since the great movies of the 70's ... ironic ... or stroke of genius. The story is full of richly detailed characters, with whom you can also relate, love or hate; but the impact of course, you're feeling something for them. Among the characters, the two performances that stand out are: Burt Reynolds, as director Jack Horner, and Mark Wahlberg, Eddie Adams / Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is also brilliant, just like Heather Graham ... but if I focus on any actor, it would have to be John C. Reilly. John's performance is a perfect balance between comic timing and character-driven emotion ... I'm a sucker for the line "Ever Ever Seen the Star Wars Movie? ... People Say I Look Like Han Solo". Anyway, the look of the film is incredible, the director of photography and director / writer / producer, came up with a vibrant color and flashy style that compares Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick (in terms of his perfection of his craft); but with creating his own unique look, and pushing the edge with the longest shot I've ever seen ... being the string of the new year. <br /> <br /> Music, like any great movie, is a character of its own. Sometimes it consumes itself with sadness or regret ... but mainly it is fun, dance and fun; the spirit of the 70's. Okay, going back to the performances. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of "cinema" means to his genre. The terrible transition from filming to film to recording on magnetic tape. The loss of his art, so to speak ... and the mentality changes for the people with whom he works. Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocence and sexual bravado needed for the character. For all those individuals who have seen Burton's Planet of the Apes, do not pay attention to Wahlberg's performance in that movie ... hire boogies and see the difference a good script can make! <br /> <br /> Julianne Moore plays the so-called mother for all, and with it comes the torment and anguish she feels, how life imitates art; and she loses all those near her. Heather Graham is the eye candy, but then retains his own, and steals some of the scenes even from the great Mr. Reynolds. Each character is multidimensional, rich in life and played by actors who seem to be perfect for the play. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is often funny, tragic, exciting and provides an uncompromising view of the turblulante. no-excuses and no lies; and offers the public a return trip. But more importantly, the film gives us a great example of how movies should be made; and a new director whose daring visions bring art back into the cinema.
