Crack House (1989) was one of the few films during the 80's that fit into this genre. What is supposed to be an anti-drug film is nothing more than an exercise in the exploitation of whites in depravity. There is nothing wrong with this however. The video presentation still has a drug message from one of the stars of the Richard program "turncoat" Roundtree, <br /> <br /> The film follows two young lovers in high school. One is an almost tough guy and the other is his girl. One of them is kicked out by a mutual friend while the other takes a trip to the slam and later has a chance to return to his former friends. Jim Brown appears as the movie "Mister Big" he is a bad guy who can still punk-out anyone and is a very sadistic guy who likes to hit his hoes and hit the tar from those who try to defy his word. Luke, of the General Hospital, is also a special guest. <br /> <br /> If you like hard edge sleaze, this movie is for you. Unfortunately, Hollywood does not do that anymore, and when it does, it's neither exploitative nor entertaining. Recommended for sleaze fans.
