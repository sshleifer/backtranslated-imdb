I'm not really much shows, but this is exceptional, because in the end, the viewer gets something useful besides entertainment. I do not have kids, but SuperNanny's lessons will be of great help when (and if) I do! My only complaint is that the show has been diluted since it was in the USA. I prefer the British version, with the sterner approach of the nanny. It's just me or someone else finds the US version a bit smoother ... now is the nanny "kinder, gentler"? I think we, Yanks, need a spoonful of sugar to help get the medication down? Still, nothing wrong with a happy and funny ending, is it there?
