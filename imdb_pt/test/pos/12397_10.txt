As an adult, I thank you for taking this film by chance when I was a teenager. Over time, I was experiencing family problems. This particular movie was able to capture what I was seeing from a closed world. How much peer pressure is too much? I actually had to buy this movie because it came on a different level from most movies that try to reach an audience. How far can an individual go for social acceptance? Who is the "bad" public? Teens struggle trying to figure out the answers to these questions, but after all ... who is the "leader of the pack" if there should be one? Is it the fort? The beautiful? Maybe the person we all like? Could it be moral character? As for the film, the cast worked together as if it were predestined. I just hope that more directors and producers try to create a work that reaches all of us as this particular movie came to me. I wish I could vote above ten because that particular title deserves much more.
