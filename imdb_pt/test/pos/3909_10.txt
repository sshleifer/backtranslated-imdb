I thought this movie was really good! Okay, so maybe there are some scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but I've seen a lot more pathetic movies that have gotten much higher ratings than that! Many movies nowadays are redone for a more modern version and there is nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. I do not think this movie was pathetic at all and I'm not saying it just because I'm a big fan of Chad Michael Murray but because I liked it. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and I really enjoyed it and we were talking about it all the way home! I would tell my other friends to watch this movie. I'm not saying it's the best movie ever to hit the box office, but it's a lot better than some people are describing. Everyone has their own opinions, so if you really want to know if it's good or bad, watch it and then decide.
