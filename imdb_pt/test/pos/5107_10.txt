When it opened in London during the Christmas season of 1969, this musical version of James Hilton's famous story was unmasked by critics. The same reception greeted when it opened in the US, prompting MGM to withdraw its Roadshow status and cut almost all of their music. What a mistake !!! <br /> <br /> Watched years later, when the fashion world of the '60s and' 70s turned to you, this version of GOODBYE, MR.CHIPS is a total treat. First of all, as "Chipping", Peter O'Toole gives one of his greatest performances. Watching him turn from the hated, cold and unemotional Latin teacher into a boy's inner college, to a man who can finally see the colors of the world (after falling in love and marrying musical star Catherine Briskit) is to see a genius at work. (If you can, watch LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, THE LION IN WINTER, MY FAVORITE YEAR and CHIPS from side to side for several days or weeks.Then you will see what a really good actor O'Toole is and how magnificent he is at CHIPS. <br /> <br /> Catherine, played by the brilliant Petula Clark at the height of her popularity, is always the man's dream: beautiful, caring, understanding, with a great voice to play. and fits perfectly into the story, while the late Herbert Ross's direction brings life to the proceedings. Okay, this movie may be a bit too romantic for some people, but for those who are looking for a story (If you can get your hands on the wide-screen version of the CD, better still.) I'm looking forward to the premiere of CHIPS on DVD.
