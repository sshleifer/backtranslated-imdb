Watching "Cold Mountain" gave me the impression that its director, Anthony Minghella, was deliberately trying to get over it and that his own film "that he was trying to overcome was virtually flawless" The English Patient "of 1996. Comparing the two films, the premise is quite similar.We have a passionate love affair between two people in a turbulent time of war and they end up treating the war more or less like a disturbance in the background as they try to find themselves back in each other's arms again. The plot differences are that Nicole Kidman's character is not married, Jude Law is a deserter, and the conflict is the American Civil War. "Cold Mountain" is, in history, more diluted and more than say "The English Patient" and is more on the level of people who want a simple love story with some sort of outside turmoil causing a problem. It's a shorter film which is a plus for people with m However, it is not as spectacular or original or genuinely exciting as "The English Patient". My * only * big complaint about "Cold Mountain" is, surprisingly, the love affair between the characters of Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Surprisingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the picture. They do not have a real relationship; we do not feel any real passion coming from them and the passion we see is more physical than emotional. I was most fascinated by the friendship between Nicole Kidman and Oscar winner Renee Zellwegger as well as Jude Law's travels around the country, dodging vigilantes and enemy soldiers. If Minghella had reinforced the importance of the love story, then I would have a better picture. <br /> <br /> Of course the movie is fun even if the love story is uninteresting. The Civil War sequences are absolutely great; they are of the modern tradition who show the war as horrible and inhuman. The re-enactment of the Petersburg campaign, in which tons of explosives were detonated underground and then followed by a melee battle, is horrifying. Minghella does not hesitate to show blood and blood in an artistic and sensitive way, and he is not afraid to show casualties of innocence and life in these scenes. There are times when women and men are killed, often by crossfire. And there's more to it. Only the sound design of the film generates tension. There is a scene where Inman and another deserter make a meal by cutting off the head of a dead cow. We do not see the cut, but the sound effects of the blade passing through the bone are repugnant. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must congratulate the cast for the performances. Jude Law was fantastic in the film and earned the Oscar nomination he received. I feel that Nicole Kidman deserved one too, even though her character is a bit shallow. Renee Zellwegger had the greatest mood of personality and screen theft. And then there are only the little parts that also really work to complete this stylistic world recreating a horrible time in America's past. Maybe Cold Mountain was better as a war movie, but it certainly would have been spectacular as "The English Patient" if her love story had been spurred on and made more passionate by screenwriters and director Anthony Minghella. As it is, it's a very nice photo, I was not bored with it and I recommend it. I just say that your love story - while being a central point of the plot - is a little softer than it needs to be and all the stuff around it was what really worked.
