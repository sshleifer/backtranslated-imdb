This movie came in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt. A triumph in the post-war period was largely forgotten in the 1970s, except for film students. He has recently begun to gain recognition as perhaps the most even-handed representation of the integration of soldiers into the postwar life ever made (and definitely includes such films as "The Deer Hunter"). the assessment lies somewhere between these extremes. <br /> <br /> The tale is simple. Three very different soldiers who have gathered after World War II (The Big One!) Fly back to their city in the Midwest and attempt to resume or create civilian lives. One has a disability, one has a comfortable job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to do but determination. <br /> <br /> There are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. Fredric March won the Oscar for Best Actor for playing an old sergeant returning to his job at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved "It's a Wonderful Life," which also deserved the award for best film, but clearly this movie touched a nerve with the post-war audience. Like I said, it was fashionable. March has a fantastic scene, a humorous speech that brought to mind a similar incident involving the real Pope Boyling, of World War II, and otherwise solid but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> I'm going against it, but I thought that Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was rightly ignored by the Academy. I detected only a hint of her warmth. In fact, I kept thinking she was going to slap Frederic March for annoying her. She practically grimaced every time they were together. Something was definitely missing there, in their forced smiles and their air of tolerance, instead of joy. I think all this absurdity about her being "the perfect wife" is only correct if you think a passionless housewife of the 50's is your ideal. You may disagree with this, but Academy voters apparently did not agree. She is a big problem with this movie, terribly miscast. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews as an ex-idiot of soda that has become a war hero, then ends up behind the counter again, it's amazing. He is sealed with a wife who evidently married him before going to war for the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. But then he runs the risk of March's daughter, Peggy (Teresa Wright in a fantastic turn), and fireworks explode. Both are great, but then comes that gap again that pervades that movie. Some moments of pure soap opera intrude, punctuated by the classic line of all time: "I'm going to end this marriage!" The novel is uplifting and mirrors a common condition after the war, to return military finding love when they return. Speaking of raising, we now reach Harold Russell. It has a naturalistic quality to its performance, or it is non-acting, which sounds as true today as it undoubtedly happened then. Taking a nonsense approach to your situation, it is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best of all the movies, is when he takes the girl who likes him to his room to show him the truth about his condition. "I'm lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some of the boys." Truly great thing. <br /> <br /> The movie has a few moments that go up. There are also some moments that belong to the afternoon soaps. Take the good with evil and see this for the high points.
