Every review I've read so far seems to have missed a crucial point. Shakespeare wrote for accent and pronunciation, as he did for Northerners in other plays. The Scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of language and profoundly affects what is said and how it is done. So listen again and notice the difference. The piece is well made and the rhythm of the words is much better than that provided by people who use a well-received, educated and well-spoken English. I remember the time a teacher at a school in Leicester, unknowingly, asked me at age 14 to read a piece of Walter Scott that was written in the tone of the Frontier. I come from the border and when I read how it should be read, it made all the difference.
