Wow, here's another great golf movie. That's at least three in the last few years that I really enjoyed, which were well done, beautifully filmed and inspired. The other two were "Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius" and "The Legend Of Bagger Vance". <br /> <br /> This is a true underdog story, if there ever was one. Having an amateur defeat all the pros and win the United States Open Golf Tournament is an unprecedented feat. I believe this is the only time in the 100 years that has been fulfilled. How much of this film is fiction embellished by dramatic effects, I do not know. I know I plan to read the book, and I know that in real life, Francis Ouimet had a three-play lead in the playoff with just two holes, different from what we saw in the movie. <br /> Whatever. Francis Ouimet's victory over the golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is a fact. It's an incredible story and the filmmakers did an excellent job of presenting it here. It's not just something for golf fans; this is a fun movie. Kudso to actor and director Bill Paxton for an excellent job. <br /> <br /> Yes, a lot of it is just golf, but there are subplots like Ouimet's relationship with his father and a beautiful young woman who is obviously interested in him. It is also a touching story of someone giving a child a chance. The film also deals with Vardon's demons coming from the wrong side of the tracks and trying to do this in the sport of an elitist, which was then both for Europeans and Americans. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf is captivating as Ouimet as is Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who do not know, Vardon was like the Tiger Woods of his day, perhaps even more unbeatable. In the film, Vardon is portrayed as a sympathetic and sympathetic guy; a genuine human being. the other big competitor, Ray (Stephen Marcus) is shown as a rather brutal and unpleasant guy. <br /> <br /> The fourth leading character in this golfing story may be the coolest person in the movie: a fifth-grade kid who ends up being Ouimet's caddy at the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the film. <br /> <br /> If all this - a huge underdog playoff against two powerful pros and having descended to the last hole - was not true, you would think, "Oh, man, this is so cheesy. in that?" That's what makes this real-life story fun to finally see captured in the movie. As with another 2005 sports movie - "Cinderella Man" - here's another great movie that was unfairly overlooked when it came to awards. I think good movies do not win awards ..... just the hearts of their viewers.
