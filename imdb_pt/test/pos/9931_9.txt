Watch out for the Scottish Play! In his fascinating and distressing Opera, Dario Argento returns to classic form, regaining the composure he lost by filming convoluted and delirious psychopodiators like Tenebre and Phenomena. In fact, based on a simple narrative that is offset by opulent pieces, imaginatively brutal murder sequences and refined photography, the film looks like the Argento we knew. The only real infraction of the opera is the lack of a Goblin soundtrack, which provided unusual, iconic and timeless music for many of Argento's greatest films (the opera selections used here are wonderful, however). is filled by several competent actors. While she is not Jessica Harper, Annabella Sciorra's look-alike Cristina Marsillach gets enough courage and compassion to understand the role of the tortured heroine. Ian Charleson is interesting as the horror film director who became director of opera Marco. And Daria Nicolodi is fantastic as always, even in her relatively brief role (watch the making of the DVD for a hilarious interview with Nicolodi about her role - clearly impetuous and resentful at the end of her relationship with Argento!) Fans of Stage Fright another great giallo from 1987, directed by Michele Soavi, who acted as director of the second unit of the Opera) barely recognize the final girl of the film, Barbara Cupisti, as stage manager here (I think they are the glasses that do this). <br /> <br /> With me, they are often the little things that matter, and Argento's fascination / obsession with images of solitary nightmares makes him my ideal filmmaker. The opera is full of little details that left me smiling. For example, I love that we never see the face of "The Great" Mara Czekova. I also love the scene where the killer is scraping the tip of his deadly sharp dagger through a television screen showing Betty's performance as Lady Macbeth. Finally, I challenge even the most gritty slasher veterans to not shrink as the "pin grids" are placed over Betty's eyes. <br /> <br /> In short, Opera is a clean, tense and tense thriller. With his solid performances, lucid focus and literary cinematography, he begs to be in the same league as Deep Red and The Bird With the Crystal Plumage. Can Might Opera be the last great giallo?
