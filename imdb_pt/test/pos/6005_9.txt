This production was very well made for a television original, providing a very appropriate original slope in Swift's work. To make the story of the picture work well, the film begins with Gulliver coming home. Everyone who has read the book knows that it will happen anyway. The story of the book's picture has Gulliver's deranged confusion in sections. For example, he is horrified that he will run down small people in England because he has just come back from a land of giants. But the film has all sections of the book on a long journey. When Gulliver recounts his travels, England's editing cuts for travel are very effective. I confess I found them intrusive and irritating at first, so they became natural. In the end, in addition, they have become a welcome addition to the story. As he tells his adventures to an ever-growing audience, more and more people hear his convincing fantasy, though they doubt his truth. For example, his hatred of the filthy Yahoos and the admiration of the pure logic of the fourth section go well when he is defending his own sanity. Interleavings between events in England and similar events or scenes in the tale are very effective. For example, ripping the table cloth to suggest the movement of towing a group of ships is inspired by the filming. The addition of Gulliver's family threatened by the lascivious doctor works well. Swift only suggests this by causing the suffering wife to protest against further travel. It becomes a natural part of this story. The cast and acting were competent everywhere. Some papers were exemplary. The crazy wizard of Omar Sharif is superb. The little emperor of O'Toole is plunging delightfully into senility. Many specific complaints made by other writers here seem to me simple personal preferences, which, after all, is what we are doing here. I read the abbreviated version several times a year from the fourth grade. I may have escaped from the full version to a college class, but I have read it a few times since. And I had to start over when I started reading about this movie. Although the Danson version is superior to any previous film, it does not replace the book. However, I think this will bring many readers to the book. If you have not read the book, enjoy this movie and go to the source. If you enjoy the satire, find "A Modest Proposal" by Swift, and "Drapier's Letters". Both are satires that attack the lousy treatment of Ireland and the Irish during the time of Swift. The draper protests cheap and inflated copper coins being dumped in Ireland. These were Wood's light coins, not good for face value in paying official taxes and debts. The clamor of Swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another battered British territory, the American colonies. The universal satire in Swift's book and this movie just sneers; they can not change human nature. Give Danson's excruciating experiences a chance. I think you will find them thought-provoking and entertaining.
