Everyone seems to compare this to The Matrix and The 13th Floor, and when I first saw it I would have agreed - I was expecting The Matrix and I was a bit disappointed. But after repeated exhibitions, my respect for this film has grown immensely. <br /> <br /> The thing to keep in mind is that Matrix is ​​a great action movie with some philosophical nonsense. The 13th floor is a passable action movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo a bit more interesting played in. Existenz is not an action movie at all, and it is not (as many seem to believe) about "reality" or any "profound concept ". It is about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial (both in its origin and in its behavior) world of make-believe. <br /> <br /> The most chilling moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats it "scripted." It is at this point that you realize that the people in the game willingly surrendered their free will to participate in a story. makes it all the more scary at the end, when D'Arcy Nader (or rather, his player) comments on the possibility of spending his life in the game. I completely sympathize with the "realist" philosophy, which provides interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the ultimate goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence. "Living in the game" is not living, but it is a tempting way to spend time on earth. "As Allegra comments on the real world , "there's nothing going on here." It might also attract someone else's imagination and pretend to be doing something interesting. (Although I have to ask if Cronenberg considers this a self-accusation, considering that he even offers worlds to be experienced in 90 minute stretches.) <br /> <br /> Upon leaving the theater after watching this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of those movies that was watchable just to see how it ended. But having seen this a few more times (thanks to SciFi Channel) I realized how much deeper it goes. Seriously, if you only saw it once, it deserves another vision.
