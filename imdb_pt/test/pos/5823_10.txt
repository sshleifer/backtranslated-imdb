One of the other reviewers mentioned that after watching only 1 episode of Oz you will be hooked. They're right, since that's exactly what happened to me. <br /> <br /> The first thing that impressed me about Oz was his brutality and unshakable scenes of violence that came up shortly after the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the most sensitive or timid. This show does not punch in relation to drugs, sex or violence. It's hardcore, in the classic use of the word. <br /> <br /> It's called OZ, since this is the nickname given to Oswald's Maximum State Security Penitentiary. It focuses mainly on the City of Emeralds, an experimental prison section where all cells have glass facades and are turned inward, so privacy is not at the top of the agenda. In City it is home to many ... Arians, Muslims, Gangsters, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and others ... so fights, deadly looks, dishonest business and obscure deals are never far away. <br /> <br /> I would say that the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows do not dare. Forget beautiful pictures painted for the mainstream public, forget the charm, forget the romance ... OZ does not move. The first episode I saw seemed so unpleasant that it was surreal, I could not say I was ready for it, but while I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got used to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence but injustice (corrupt guards who will be sold for a penny, prisoners who kill in order and get well-behaved, middle class prisoners being turned into prison bitches due to lack of street skills or prison experience) By observing Oz, you can feel comfortable with what an uncomfortable sight is ... if you can get in touch with your darker side.
