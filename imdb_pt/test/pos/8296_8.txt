Family happiness is crumbling when, from the outset, wealthy father Ward (Michael Ontkean) becomes poor and can not support the family any longer. Then Mother Faye (Jaclyn Smith) has to take on the role of family breadwinner and starts working to support the family and, at the same time, periodically alone, has to manage family life. It is not always good, but as good as it can. Family life hardly gets easier when the father discovers that his son Lionel (Joe Flanigan "Stargate Atlantis") is gay and is living together with his lover John (Joel Gretsch "O 4400") also an old friend of the family, resulting in that the father makes it clear to Lionel that he is no longer welcome to the family. Lionel was the one who most meant to his sister Anne (Leslie Horan) during her upbringing, since the family neglected her. Anne does not support the fact that her father cut the ropes with Lionel and therefore she ran away from home. As that was not enough, son Greg (Brian Krause "Charmed") enlisted in the Marines and is sent to war. The plot of this film may on some occasions seem a little thin, however, it still has a lot of realism, which makes it worth seeing. As this film illustrates many relationships and delicate situations, I believe it is best enjoyed by a mature audience, even if it does not last for teenagers to see and get something to think about before adulthood.
