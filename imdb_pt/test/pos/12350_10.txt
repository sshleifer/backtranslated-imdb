One Dark Night has a typical teen horror movie setup with a unique twist. The ultra-shocking musical score and gothic / claustrophobic atmosphere adds a lot to this little movie that it offers. Meg Tilly is excellent as "Julie" and leads us through the labyrinth of the mausoleum, giving a sense of portent and solitude. The other teenagers are just as effective in their roles as Melissa Newman, the film's ultimate heroine. The special effects are excellent, though dated. This movie is highly overlooked, but this can be good so it never gets ruined by endless sequels. There is a great black magic flowing through this film; once you get used to it, you really get it and have fun. Double-disc DVD is available, although the original negative has not been found to restore the movie. Maybe one day it will be located. I think, in a way, the carbon spots on parts help the film giving it a respectability of old school and making it more unexpected at the end, when suddenly there are many effects. The second disc has a rough cut / alternate version with a temp score version of the film which gives further explanation on the disappearance of two of the girls, much Poe-ish ("The Amontillado Barrel" comes to mind in a new way!) Also, great final tension entering the opening of the dark crypt. I'm not sure if it had the impact to the audience's mainstream, but it certainly worked for me and extremely scary ... also, there is a making of of documentary which is interesting because it gives information on what was happening at the moment with the actors, the team, the director and the writer; material franco, logo logos current, discussions of scenes and scenes, rehearsals. Very original that this material exists for a small film at that time.
