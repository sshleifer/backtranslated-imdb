if you have the mild pleasure of Floyd's pink music, you'll love this movie. The score is completely pink Floyd and of course the element of drugs plays a major role in this film, giving you doubts about life in the weakest moments. This movie also touches the heart with the story about love and the people around you ... There is also a huge connection to the world around you with the ambience of a personal island. This thing tells me that I need ten lines to sum up a movie, but I'm done that's all you get is why this movie is a 6.1 that's a big surprise for any movie with a score like this. take a look at the requiem of a dream and the fountain .... equally good scores for our generation, but overrated
