It does not matter if "National Velvet (1944)" is a bit vulgar and occasionally unconvincing, Clarence Brown's equestrian fable is a captivating and very agreeable story with good morals. After achieving modest success through her appearance in 'Lassie Come Home (1943),' the young Elizabeth Taylor, 12, landed her first role as Velvet Brown, a student in love with an obsession with horses. Although filmed in California, the story - adapted from a novel by Enid Bagnold - is set in a small town in the hinterland of England, and Technicolor photography is used to present the vibrant and beautiful landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs. Mickey Rooney takes the top billing as Mi Taylor, a mistaken ex-jockey with tortuous intentions, whose relationship with the young Velvet awakens his sense of dignity and opens a new and optimistic chapter in his life. Although he visibly struggles in a sequence, when he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses, Rooney is pleasant as the grumpy but passionate young man who must prove his worth. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps a good thing that Elizabeth Taylor had those fascinating violet eyes because her acting skills at this young age were quite limited. Its most emotional sequences, in which it shows courage and integrity in the face of adversity, seem rather empty, and the touching and naive notion that simply "believing" will accomplish everything is that which has been repeated ad nauseam for practically all inspiring sports films of all times already made. However, Taylor is brilliant and enthusiastic, and she works well with Mickey Rooney, who was no stranger to being a star-child. Anne Revere plays a very important role as the mother of Velvet, once a famous athlete, who not only swam in the English Channel but was lovingly trained by none other than Mi Taylor's own father. I liked that Mi was not informed about this until the final seconds of the movie, with Mrs. Brown correctly deciding that the youngster first would need to develop his own sense of decency, rather than exploit the memory of his late father for financial gain, as he would undoubtedly have done at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The movie reaches its climax at the Grand National Sweepstakes, where Velvet decided at the last moment to ride his own horse, Pi, in the world-famous competition. Under the guise of a Latvian man, she continues, as expected, to win the race, but is later disqualified - either because she is a girl or because she fell off the horse before being able to dismount (what a stupid rule!). This extended racing sequence is extremely well done, effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve-racking seconds of pre-race, and the confusion of the event that puts us in the same position as the Rooney character, stranded behind tall spectators and eagerly waiting for someone to provide an accurate update. It does not matter that we know he is a stuntman doing most of the difficult pilotage - in many scenes, we can clearly see a scary man in a wig - but the positive message remains the same. I bet the "National Velvet" has fueled the imagination of millions of young people in the last sixty years, and its power to inspire has diminished little over time.
