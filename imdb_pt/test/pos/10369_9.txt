As most other reviewers seem to agree, this adaptation of 'After The Funeral' is actually quite good. Always one of my favorite stories of Poirot, I was worried that this might be 'confused.' Well, it was a little, but only a little and in the end the result was completely fun. David Suchet remains almost flawless as Poirot and (as others have pointed out) the other star of this show is Monica Dolan, who certainly could not be surpassed as Miss. Gilchrist. I also really enjoyed Fiona Glasscott, who was spot on as the Rosamund Shane cut, but really, the cast was pretty flawless throughout! <br /> <br /> One point is overturned so adapters will not be able to resist accumulating many revelations in the final fifteen minutes. The business with the will and the housework was a bit unnecessary, although I did not care how they reinforced the structure of the Abernethie family (in the book the family tree is actually very complicated). The final moments in which the killer is revealed, however, are incredibly well done and I found the ending when they all leave Enderby, very touching. This is actually one of the best in the Poirot series so far.
