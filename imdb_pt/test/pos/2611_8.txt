Assy McGee is an intransigent and fearless detective, based on the countless examples of late-twentieth-century police dramas. The twist here is that Assy is literally a walking buttock. <br /> <br /> The cheap, low-browed facade of the show hides its cunning and hidden satire. That's not to say that Assy is devoid of fart jokes, only that bathroom humor is used in moderation enough to elicit consistent laughter, not groans and rolling eyes. The sequel to the program title demonstrates the clever and subtle humor used everywhere. The sequence consists of panning photos of the city defined as a 1970s police theme of jazz. In one photo, a police car is shown and the "camera" zooms in on the front faceplate holder, which is vacant. The mindless zoom satirizes the production of the typical 1970s and '80s crime drama and, incidentally, makes me laugh all the time. <br /> <br /> All the typical characters are included: the frustrated police chief who can not control Assy; the loyal and minority partner who acts as a blow to Assy's imprudence; the regular cops who detest Assy's means ... all are accounted for and all are hilarious satires of the typical police drama. <br /> <br /> Dubbing, played mostly by Larry Murphy, is nothing short of spectacular. Assy's voice - breathless and hoarse with a little drunkenness - is so clever and unique that it ranks alongside all the big names like Stewie Griffin (Family Guy) and Homer Simpson (Simpsons). Although the voice is drawn, the diction is clear and easy to understand. This is a nice change from other Adult Swim voices that usually require captions to understand. <br /> <br /> Besides the fantastic production and dubbing, the script is also hilarious. Assy's direct objectivity feeds most of the humor, particularly in his interactions with citizens outside the police force. <br /> <br /> If you have access to Adult Swim comedies, surely Assy McGee deserves attention. Each episode reaches a mere 8-9 minutes, so you really have little to lose.
