The Kite Runner was beautiful, poignant and very touching. I particularly loved the two children's actors in the film as well as the actor who plays the father. It really made me want to go back and read the book again. <br /> <br /> Music was a wonderful part of the movie's fabric. If there is a soundtrack to the film, I will buy it to accompany the second reading of the book. It is also a visually stunning film. The cinematography was beautiful and really added to the experience. <br /> <br /> The Brazilian word 'saudades' is very descriptive of how I felt at the end of the movie ... "is a deep feeling of longing for someone or somewhere, which is very sweet, but also dyed of an inevitable sadness "(definition given years ago by Antonio Carlos Jobim). <br /> <br /> I saw in a small movie theater here for a preview. I would love to see you again on a very big screen with a cheated sound system. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the formal launch. I would definitely recommend the movie to friends.
