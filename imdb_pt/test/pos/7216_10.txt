This movie is incredible. It's funny, sexy, violent and sick, but everything joins a brilliant version of Romeo and Juliet's Troma. If you do not mind being a bit rude (ok, but it's funny), watch this movie. Worth it! There is no level at which it is not delivered. I've seen this three times now, and it's still amazing. I recommend. Go! Take it!
