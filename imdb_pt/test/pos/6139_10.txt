William M. Thackeray once said, "A good laugh is the sunlight in the house." When I watched Take Away, I must say that the sun shone in my house. This film was superb, the opening was very cleverly done, the story joined well, in a nutshell, two owners of fish'n chip shops that usually enemies are forced to form an alliance to enter a fight of David and Goliath against a fasting. food chain that builds a restaurant on your street. The ending was hilarious, though I have met many who disagree with me in that movie. The film was very discreet, portraying contemporary Australian ethnic stereotypes, in particular the collision or cultural shock if you want between the traditional Australian stereotypes Anglo-Australian and Italo-Australian, and how they found a species of "unity despite adversity", very good. <br /> <br /> I found Vince Colosimo's performance as "Tony Stilano," an Italo-Australian fish-chip owner in his thirties to be first-class, his acting was very genuine and compelling through his performance , he was able to really bring forth the essence, or I should say the soul of the Australian Italian stereotype, which in reality is not very Italian, but also not very Australian, Colosimo found the balance, breathed deeply and gave life. <br /> <br /> Cinematography could have been better, more pictures of the area would have been cool, from what I can see, it was in Melbourn and but where in Melbourne? to me, looks like something between Ivanhoe and Bullen, though I'm not 100% sure about it. <br /> <br /> I do not know why so many people are comparing this movie to "The Castle", although they have similar themes that run through them, Take Away is in a league of its own. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was Excellent with a capital E, it has everything, it's funny, the jokes are great, it deals with contemporary issues faced by Australian society, history holds up well, I loved it! I recommend.
