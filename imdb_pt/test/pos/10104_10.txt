I first saw this film two years ago at the movies and I fell in love with this dark story of two teenage sisters meditating at home in their big country house with their father and stepmother. Their relationship with the stepmother is tense, to say the least, with the stepmother seeming to be increasingly unstable in her battles with the younger girls. The film still tilts with ghostly effects of oriental and horror style, which adds a strange and disturbing aspect to the story which at first sight is not clear but is even more intriguing. <br /> <br /> The direction is incredibly good. and the acting is staggering, with the particular stepmother incredibly well swinging from one style of humor to another in the film. The big house adds strangeness, and there are enough spots in the movie where you will jump out of your seat. This film to me clearly shows why Korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment. You simply do not get anything like that in the western world, unfortunately, and indeed I can see this being influential on filmmakers around the world in the next decade. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended viewing in my opinion, a real joy and scare ...
