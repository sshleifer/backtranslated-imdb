This is definitely an excellent 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of Charles Vidor. Rita Hayworth (Rusty Parker), Charlie Chan in Egypt, sang and danced with Gene Kelly (Danny McGuire), "Anchors Away", Danny McGuire owned a nightclub in Brooklyn, NY and was in love with Rusty Parker, who was a dancer in his club along with Phil Silvers, (Genius), "Coney Island" who was the comedian in this picture and also worked and danced along with Danny, Rusty. Otto Kruger, (John Coudair), "Duel in the Sun", played the role of promoter of a magazine for girls and decided that Rusty Parker would be his top model. Jerome Kern's music is heard throughout the film and the song "Long Ago & Far Away" is the theme song for this musical. This film was nominated for many awards and was a huge success at the box office during World War II, which kept people out of the war that was going on at the time. Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly were instant hits and her career exploded on the silver screen for many years. Great Musical and a movie you will not want to miss, this is really a great classic movie.
