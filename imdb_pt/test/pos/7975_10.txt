This is a great movie and I recommend it to everyone. Mr. Drury's acting is top notch as it always is and it blends well with the other actors in the film. It is not possible to give any suspense or drama found in the film. The hell to pay is a movie not to be missed !!! The plot was very suspenseful. I watched this movie several times because it has all the elements of a great western movie. It was very authentic in how they exhibited the components that deal with this film, including weapons, horses and clothes. The soundtrack is pleasant and adds flavor to the film. James Drury has the right touch when choosing a movie to get involved. This is another winner for the Western genre. !!!!!
