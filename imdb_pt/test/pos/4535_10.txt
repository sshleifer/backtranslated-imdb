Holy Schnikey! This movie rocks! The pair of Chris Farley and David Spade are great together. My favorite parts are "Fat Guy in a small coat, Oh my God, Room service and more scenes that will be remembered for years to come." This movie has a huge following cult, I wonder why, which proves that even eleven years after Chris The tragic death of Farley and he is still popular. He plays Tommy who will make you laugh every time you watch. He is a great comedian and misses. Mr. Spade reminds me of Dan Akyroid while Chris Farley I remember John Belushi. They made more than two movies together. This movie is a must buy and should be in the collection of all Snl fans.
