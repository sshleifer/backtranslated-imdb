The NYT review says that Sigourney Weaver's character is tense and frustrated and later that she could be the sister of the MTM character in Ordinary People. Say what? No way. This lady was peculiar from the beginning. NOTHING like MTM in ordinary people. Excuse me. Next, the NYT goes on to say that Sandy Travis of Sigourney Weaver and Ben Daniel's Travis Daniel is in his early 40's, "60's kids." Ms Weaver must be dancing a jig. I believe that by the time she made Imaginary Heroes she was 55 years old. She was born in 1949. <br /> <br /> NYT perceptions corrections aside, this was a very good film considering it was made by someone so young. Obviously, Sigourney Weaver thought so, and Jeff Daniels too. The young man who played Tim was excellent. <br /> <br /> There are some critical comments I could make about the script. As if I'd never understood why Sandy Travis missed her son. His kind of disintegrated behavior might have been triggered by his death, but that such behavior lasted for the movie that I felt had more to do with the marriage of stagnation, her relationship with Tim, and where he actually came from, and others unresolved issues, than any mourning of his eldest son. Ben's mourning was much clearer. <br /> <br /> So Matt Travis was an idiot. Does his mother think that too? Still, a very watchable film. What is becoming increasingly clear is not that there are no roles for women over a certain age, but it must be that such a director is so clearly in love with an older woman (Miss Weaver) and almost his movie a tribute to her. Kind of an anti-Woody Allen.
