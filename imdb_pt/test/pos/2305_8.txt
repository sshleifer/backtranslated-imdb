In 1895, in a small village in Japan, the wife of the bearer of the brood Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), has an affair with a man twenty-six years younger, Toyiji (Tatsuya Fuji). Toyiji becomes jealous of Gisaburo and plot with Seki to kill him. They strangle Gisaburo and throw his body into a well in the forest, and Seki tells the villagers that Gisaburo moved to Tokyo to work. Three years later, locals gossip about the fate of Gisaburo, and Seki is haunted by his ghost. The situation becomes unbearable for Seki and Toyiji when a police officer arrives in the village to investigate the disappearance of Gisaburo. <br /> <br /> "Ai no Borei" is a surreal and supernatural love story. Seki's remorse and complex guilty make her see the ghost of her murdered husband, spoiling the perfect plot of her lover. Cinematography is compromised by the quality of VHS released in Brazil, but there are very beautiful scenes, including "Ringu" and the American remake "The Ring" use the view from the inside well at the same angle. The performances and direction are excellent making "Ai no Borei" a great movie. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Empire of the Passion"
