A nervous thriller that aimed at great philosophical heights and that could not be achieved. I still liked the movie immensely. It had great elements of suspense, leaving me with that delicious spine that I expected from the thrillers, and this reached it purely psychologically, without resorting to growing blood and blood. The soundtrack and setup added to the suspense perfectly. Sometimes it was a little polite, particularly the acting and development of the character. It just might have been a better movie if we had known more about the nightmares of the past that the characters see when they close their eyes, and why they felt this desperate need to seek the "answer" that is so essential to the plot. After all, they seemed to keep on looking for him, though he knew or at least had an idea of ​​what might happen when they found him. I would recommend watching this movie if you are prepared to look beyond the grain to see the potential of a rough diamond.
