Yesterday I finally met my curiosity and saw this movie. My knowledge of the plot was limited to about 60 seconds from the trailer, but I heard some good critics who made my expectations rise. <br /> <br /> As I watched the movie, these loose parts were combined into one story that was becoming quite intriguing, with some seemingly inexplicable details. But in the end, everything is disclosed as a simple succession of bad luck events, "null luck" in Portuguese. Above all, I felt that the story made sense, and everything fits in its place, properties of a good script. <br /> <br /> I must also mention the soundtrack, which helps in creating an incredible environment. <BR> <br /> And if you think of the features Fernando Frigate used to make this movie, I believe that many Hollywood producers will be jealous.
