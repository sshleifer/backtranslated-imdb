Apartmente'L is one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. I experienced extreme frustration as I watched this movie while I was getting ready for the two tracks to come together. This never happened in the end, which disappointed me endlessly. But the ending adds an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie. It's not a movie that people will probably watch, but a watch itself will have a profound impact on people. As of now I have not rewatched the movie and I do not think I will. <br /> <br /> The story follows the experiences of a man, Max, who is engaged to marry Muriel. He remembers his old girlfriend Lisa (he considers it the love of his life) while listening, by accident, Lisa talking on the phone. So he tries to find Lisa. Here begins your extremely frustrating search for Lisa. There are many layers for this movie. There are underlying currents of envy, back and forth, and so on. There is also another character named Alice who is involved in all the confusion. The film then undergoes a series of twists and finally leads to a finalization that can be interpreted in several ways. It's fascinating how this movie has only four main characters, but clever writing makes it interesting and unique. What I love about the fact is that a movie about obsession, jealousy is done so lightly. It has a very fast pace, which is probably the reason it can attract a large audience. The main character, Max, has shades of gray and I felt the ending was perfect. I do not think he should be a clean character considering the fact that he's been looking for his long-lost love while he's involved and he also has an affair with Alice. <br /> <br /> Alice's character is even worse. Your manipulation and your compulsive lying can really irritate viewers (that's the point, I think). The scene in which she breaks in front of Lucien really shows another facet of her character. He shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all lies and games and wants to lead a normal life. In the end, she understands that she needs to get away from it all. The ending lends a cynical touch. Because it seems that Max's love for Alice is temporary and false. It is as if we say that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option (ie, Muriel) than to seek something that is so fleeting (ie, Lisa or Alice). In many ways, this is not really a romantic movie, but a satire on the novel (in a way). <br /> <br /> The performances deserve great praise. Vincent Cassel as Max does a great job. It perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not sure about his engagement. Its nerd appearance is an added advantage as it blends perfectly with the character. But the real star of the movie is Romane Bohringer as Alice. His nuanced portrait of a woman who is jealous of Alice and is in love with Max. The scene in which she cries "I am a lunatic too" shows her despair and her desire to live a normal life with a man who loves her. <br /> <br /> Btw I also found that lesbianism is another interpretation that can be extracted from this film. Alice's actions can be explained in several ways. And his irrational obsession with Lisa can also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. It may be exaggeration, considering she encourages Lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. But I have a feeling she was a lesbian a long time ago. She also avoids questions from Lisa about a boyfriend. She spends a lot of time with Lisa and is happy during this time. This may lead many to question their sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would give it 9/10. I think it deserves, but I subtract one because of the rewatchability factor. I think it's a perfect movie.
