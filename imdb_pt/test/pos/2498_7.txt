The love letter is one of my all-time favorite books, so, of course, I was skeptical when I knew it would become a movie. But, I liked. I've been smiling all through the movie. I admit it's not a great movie, but definitely a pleasant hour and a half. I thought Capshaw and Scott were perfect like Helen and Johnny. Just like I imagined them. And the city and the landscape were good too. I recommend this movie, but do not expect too much, just enjoy.
