While it is not "perfect", it is close. I love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Superman Police Chief), Housekeeper, Felix Restaurant Waiter and Judge ... I can go on and on. This movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since I was young, and my kids grew up with that too! "The baby swallowed the clock" was always my son's favorite phrase. <br /> <br /> Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and dresses stole the show along with the cute and funny S. Z. Sakall. Dennis Morgan also has great songs. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and I suggest you skip the remake (blah).
