After seeing Meredith in "Beyond the Prairie" I had to buy another movie with her staring. I can not believe how she let herself into this teen movie. You better watch this with the sound off, but just focus on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD in "Beyond the Prairie". Well worth it at any price, this needs paying to see. <br /> <br /> This beautiful lady needs someone to put her in a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman. Maybe some of your last ones might fit in, but I did not see them. She has the smile of a Cathrine bell and the eyes of Dana Delany with a much younger body. <br /> <br />
