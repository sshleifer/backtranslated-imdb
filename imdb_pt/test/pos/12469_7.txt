I really enjoyed the first part of this film in Africa for about an hour or so until animal cruelty from civilized humans in Scotland struck me in the second half and left me so sad that I could not watch it. However, this was done by the filmmaker to make a point that the early natural scientists ruined everything they did not understand literally "studying" to death without considering the rights and comfort of the animals studied, which we now know should not be studied anywhere, but in the natural world they inhabit, and as discreetly as possible. I recommend this film because it was a serious and honest story of Tarzan and made a point of showing the ruthless animal cruelty that was rampant in the scientific world of the 19th century, as well as the pure and simple, primordially primitive life that Tarzan lived as a young man who was found as a baby and raised by chimpanzees after the violent death of their parents in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert was wonderful and very emotional in his life role of Tarzan, just like Ralph Richardson. in his last film role as Tarzan's ultra-rich and noble ramps in Scotland. Andy MacDowell was handsome and very good as Tarzan's "Jane" and civilized in his first movie role. From his charismatic work in this film and his very amazing eyes, I can not understand why Lambert did not become a big star, but his very bad movie choices might have done so later. The fantastic Ian Holm, like a wounded Frenchman in Africa. aided by Tarzan and who then led Tarzan back to his unknown ancestral home in Scotland, was as great as ever. <br /> <br /> I am so happy that Tarzan got tired and did not stay in the cruel animal. civilized world at that time and went home to Africa in the end to live his life with his monkeys and loving "monkey relatives" who created him instead of staying in Scotland and living like royalty, which would have ruined if he did not mate -the first.
