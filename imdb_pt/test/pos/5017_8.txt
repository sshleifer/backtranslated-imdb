What happens to certain films that generate such opposing reactions? <br /> <br /> Some people here call the High Roller "disgusting." Some call it "extraordinary" (like me, actually). <br /> <br /> Why? I think it's because movies like this do not make idiot heroes, or glamor of degeneration, and some people simply can not deal with it emotionally. They need a hero. And I would also add that if they are poker players or players, they can feel personally betrayed when their existence is not justified. <br /> <br /> High Roller is NOT a poker movie. It's a people movie. It is not perfect, but looks good, is well written and wonderfully acted. And best of all, it generates an emotional response and inspires reflection. <br /> <br /> And maybe that's what makes some people so crazy.
