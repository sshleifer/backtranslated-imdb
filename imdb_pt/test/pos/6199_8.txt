* BE WORRIED WITH POSSIBLE SPOILERS * A friend told me to check out this series, and I'm glad I took her words for it. <br /> <br /> I read the synopsis on the cover of the DVD and was immediately intrigued. The main protagonist is Muslim? No way, this is the first time! It's about an FBI agent who is under great cover to penetrate a possible dormant cell in LA; and get it - he's a practicing Muslim. I was a bit skeptical at first, kind of hoping that some hero or antagonist would drop fanatic, silly, stupid, stupid bugs ... let's face it, many shows were guilty of that. <br /> But then I watched the first three episodes, and I thought, Okay, that's good. It was not until episode four ("Scholar") when I was well and truly impressed. I would like to compliment the excellent writing and excellent performances of the actors. I simply love the complexity of each of these characters - they are not the good and bad guys of the two-dimensional cardboard cutout. Michael Ealy gives a wonderful and believable performance as the FBI agent of Muslim Darwyn Al-Sayeed, treading the fine line between being the good Muslim and being a man with flaws. Oded Fehr gives his character Farik an interesting depth - Farik is not the typical oily stereotype of the Middle East, but simply someone who really believes in his cause and does not see himself as a fanatic, but a man willing to take any extreme measures to justify beliefs. He is very charismatic and authoritarian. But I would say it was Alex Nesic's performance that clearly left an impression on me in "Scholar". His portrait of the emotional struggle of his character was incredible - divided between the words of a Muslim scholar who encouraged him to return to the non-aggressive path, because it is the only acceptable path in God's eyes and Farik's persuasion to believe otherwise. I'm looking forward to seeing more shows like this, not a series of ridiculously high-octane man shows. He's smart and open-minded.
