Linda ... That word pretty much sums up this whole movie. Everything from cinematography, direction, acting ... brilliant. At any point in the movie, you can pause, and no doubt you'll be looking at something mosaic or "artsy fartsy" as some people would say. I assure you that after a remark, "Bobbycrush" will be stuck in your head. I know this from firsthand experience. Even the soundtrack is great. It fits in nicely with the tone and rhythm of the movie. Be grateful that Cam Archer exists in this world. We need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real (and surreal) images.
