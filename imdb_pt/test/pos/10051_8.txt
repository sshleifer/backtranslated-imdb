All in all, an excellent movie from that time and source (coming from Warner Brothers as if it had reached the peak of skill and style shortly before World War II), as long as you take nothing seriously. The film does not really claim to be historically accurate, and it certainly is not more or less accurate or credible than, say, JFK. (This may actually be more honest about this, although it essentially admits along the way that it is not to be taken as particularly based on facts, but more of an elegantly semi-heroic portrait.) It is important to note that the audience of the time was not more naive about the story than we are today; The NY Times review admitted that the public would "rule out factual inaccuracies scattered throughout the film," described the biographical account of Custer's life as "fanciful," and pointed out that the presentation of Custer's motives for final events was at variance with various historical accounts. . They might have really exaggerated the construction of Custer, it is supposed, but they manage to admirably portray it as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent, but properly determined, principled and inspiring. <br /> <br /> Flynn and DeHavilland, making their 8th movie together in 7 years (and their last), are so comfortable together, and play with each other so easily at this point, that it's not too hard to ignore how finely the courtship of them is written here. With a pairing for the first time, it would be difficult to imagine what could really attract Elizabeth to Custer, but these two make it work. The film is also missing its director from its seven previous films together (the much underrated Michael Curtiz), but given that he had worked with them on last year's Santa Fe Trail, it is understandable if he chose to leave this 1. (All they started together with Captain Blood and The Charge from Light Brigade - both are great - so we can not blame them if they start having trouble keeping them updated.) Raoul Walsh, the director here, is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences - which are excellent - and everything else outdoors. The interior scenes are a bit more uneven, but the studio artisans can make up for it very well, as well as the cast of "usual suspects" and new Warner Bros faces (Greenstreet, Gene Lockhart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, etc.). . I would have liked it more if Kennedy's character had been a bit less standardized (I usually like his work), but here he seems to be playing roughly the same notes in every scene; the part could have been better written - and I suppose they might have doubts about what he could handle, as he'd only been in movies for a year (Walsh probably took him to this after doing High Sierra together). <br /> Various highlights include the (probably imagined) representation of the genesis of "Garryowen" as the theme of chivalry. The last half hour is particularly striking, especially with the division of leads echoing the end of their partnership onscreen, followed by the final battle scenes. A completely exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
