In the era of the DVD, you'd think you could find just about any piece of junk in the celluloid, and for the most part, it's true. So why is it so hard to find this great film, clearly made by people who love noir as a loving tribute (never coming down in parody) of the most cinematic of genres. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are a success in this and Carla Gugino (KAREN SISCO, SIN CITY) makes her trademark now. <br /> <br /> This movie really has everything for movie fans. A b noir on steroids, the smart and steaming JUDAS KISS succeeds in all accounts. <br /> <br /> Please, Columbia TriStar PLEASE, release it on DVD soon !!!!!!
