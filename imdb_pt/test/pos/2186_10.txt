I saw this piece on Showtime a few years ago in the comfort of my home and when the final note was played, I wanted to jump off the couch and applaud the production. As it was, I shed a tear that was a lot of fantastic performances and songs. On my birthday, my kids bought me the VHS version as well as the CD of the play with Len Cariou on Sweeny Todd Role. <br /> <br /> I shared the play with many ... some finding the subject a little sick, but none having anything but praise for the songs. <br /> <br /> I've always loved the interaction in songs with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn, as well as Hearn and Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin. <br /> <br /> I must own the DVD.
