This movie was a huge surprise to me while I watched at the Cinequest at the great California Theater in San Jose. It's a musical, which I do not usually like, but I have to say this one was different. Robert Peters, who directed the film and looked at it, did such a wonderful job. During his question and answer session, he told the audience that he only had two other people for his team! Most of the dialogue was made on the spot and he actually made the film while attending another film festival in Germany! I can not say enough big things about this movie, the only bad thing is that you really tend to notice the work of the camera and it wiggles a bit. If you come across this movie, check it out!
