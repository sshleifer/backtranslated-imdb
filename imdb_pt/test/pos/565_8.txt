I watched it on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier. He compares favorably to the fictional court dramas. <br /> <br /> The story is of a 15-year-old black boy on trial for the murder of a white elderly woman in Jacksonville, Florida, based almost exclusively on her husband's identification with the victim and on a confession the defense holds was coerced. <br /> <br /> About half of the footage is from the trial; is complemented by pictures of the defense attorneys (two public defenders) explaining their case, interviewing witnesses and visiting important sites. This is edited with a minimum of unnecessary repetition and placed in logical order. The camera work is pretty solid. And there is a slightly surprising epilogue.
