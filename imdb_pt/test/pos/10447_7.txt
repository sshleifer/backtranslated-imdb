Spoilers: This movie has its problems, but in the end it passes the message. I liked it because it ends the way things really happen. The cool guy tries and tries, gets his heart broken several times, but in the end there is no typical Hollywood ending. It ends the way such things always end, or at least always have in my own experiences and friends. Anyone who thinks the ending to this is not how it actually happens, as the first comment seemed, believing the girl would show up, realize that she is dating an idiot who treats her poorly because he does not care for her or is naive or live in a more perfect world than I do. He gives 7/10 extra points simply because he was not afraid to finish on a low note, he did not give any real resolution, only the main character left his heart broken, confused and alone as many men of countless generations had gone before.
