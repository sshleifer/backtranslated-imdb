I saw this movie with my mother and I loved it! It was such a sweet story, (not to mention funny because of the supporting cast!) They never make movies like this ... ever! My favorite part is when Grace (Minnie Driver) finds out about the death of her boyfriend's wife, and that she has the heart of the deceased wife and she shouts, "WHAT DOES GOD THINK?" I believe in everyone (no matter who you believe in) have thoughts like that once in a while. But although it is very honeyed, it can make you believe in true love and destiny once and for all. (Sigh) <br /> <br /> The comic timing between Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi will spoil you (especially in the above-mentioned scene, it's terrible, and yet so funny!). They make a good pair and I hope to see them again soon. Guest Reviews
