Ghilli is the best vijay film and one of the biggest hits in his career .... As I had not seen the movie Telegu so I could enjoy this movie even more. The story is about a girl who wants to escape the clutches of a Local boy who wants to marry her. Since he is a fool, no body is ready to help heroin. Vijay, who came to play a match of Kabaddi, sees this and decides to help her. The rest of the film is how I saw the help and how the girl ends up escaping from the clutches of the bully and the political companions of Goon's father. The film takes a lot from the edge of moments of suspense and will keep the viewer involved to the end. Vijay is, as usual, very good in the role of the kabaddi player. Trisha, Ashish Vidyarthi, the vijay group of friends all did their job competently. A special mention has to be made about the villain of the movie Prakashraj. The character of the villain was duly recorded and prakashraj portrayed it very well. Surprisingly, for the first time, I felt sympathy for the villain in the end. The dialogue "Hi Chellam" really caught up with the masses. Vidyasagar's music is brilliant and the song 'apadi podu' is a rage everywhere. Harani has to be credited with such a nice masala film that will be appreciated by not only die hard vijay fans but also by the general Tamil film No All the world.
