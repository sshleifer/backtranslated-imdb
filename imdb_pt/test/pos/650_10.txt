A wonderful movie ahead of its time, <br /> <br /> I guess, in the eighties it was all about winning, Greed is Good? Remember this? I've seen this movie more than 20 times. For me this is a desert island movie, I keep watching because there is always something else to learn about these faulty characters that I just love, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin, they are simply wonderful too Beverly D 'Angelo, Beau Bridges comes in second, do not get me wrong, there are many other great performances in this movie, and it's also the way it's written that did it for me, and I hope you, a movie you'll want to see more and more, I think TV shows like "Northen Exposure," and now "Earl," owe a lot to this movie. but remember it's not a Tom Cruise movie.
