This is absolutely the best cartoon of the 80's, perhaps the best cartoon ever. I had everything in action, adventure, emotion and more ... <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how difficult it was for the Ruby-Spears company to make such a great drawing, a lot of money has been spent for this work of art and it was worth it, for example, only the scenes were difficult because I would not call the 80's for a year of great technology with computers like now in the world we live in, so the animated scenes were excellent! <br /> <br /> The cartoons will never be the same as before, so hopefully everyone will be released on DVD, especially the Centurions, as is my favorite. I have the full set of 65 episodes on DVD-R, but it's not the same because if they were released on DVD, people in the world would be able to buy it and watch the DVD in almost every store, which means much to the DVD. fans. My good friend Ted made this petition to bring the show back to the TV or better on DVD, that is, if we received many requests to take them back on DVD. <br /> <br /> So, please help us by signing the petition. at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html
