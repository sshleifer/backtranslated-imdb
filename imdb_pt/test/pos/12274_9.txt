Featured as part of a series of funny shorts at the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney, this movie was definitely a highlight. The script is great and the direction and acting were great. As another posting put it, the comic timing of the actors actually made this movie. Lot of fun.
