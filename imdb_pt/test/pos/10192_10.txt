THE HAND OF DEATH most definitely ranks a ten on a scale of one due, in large part, to John Woo's masterful direction along with Kat's superb cinematography: some of the slow monitoring videos are worth the price of a rental; There are times when this is limited to becoming an art film. Both James Tien and Sammo Hung are the kind of villain you can not help loving. Tien is particularly good as the worst of the bad guys. It's a reversal of roles for things I think I've never seen before (Tien usually played a hero and, in fact, with his mustache, I did not even recognize him at first). Sammo's "buck teeth" only make an already nasty character look even more flawed; that he is also a skillful martial artist makes him even less pleasant - in a villain whom you love to hate in a way. His choreography of the fight scenes is fantastic. Jackie Chan appears briefly (early and late) as a blacksmith, and I believe I glimpsed Yuen Biao somewhere along the way. Tan as lead is nothing short of magnificent.
