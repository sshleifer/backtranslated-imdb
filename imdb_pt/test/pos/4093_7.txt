I have to make up for all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch whenever I need a pick up. Granted it's not like the sound of the song, but it's so fun if choosing in movies is not your thing. I loved the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always been and always will be the favorite. I saw it when it first came out in theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this is 100 times better than Twiggy in "The Boyfriend". It is a modern musical and should not be judged by everyone who has been before. It is only best for dreamers like me who would like to be able to find this place - without disease, without war, without drugs, all the bad things in life are gone. This is nothing more than a good movie. That's what all movies should be. The title song by Shaun Phillips is superb and explains the whole feel of the movie. If acting is not the greatest, who cares. I love the idea of ​​the movie. Peter Finch, a very stiff actor, Liv Ullmann, beautiful as always, Sally Kellerman, surprisingly good voice, Michael York, typical, and Olivia Hussey, dazzling, everyone convinced me that they were ordinary people. None of them acted as actors in a movie. They acted like real people, just as I would if I found this place. Divided between going home and staying there, marveling at everything. Yes, there are flaws in this movie, but get over it, it's not Citizen Kane, it's a good musical!
