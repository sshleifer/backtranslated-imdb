I played for the first time around 98 'or 99' when I was with my friends. I found the game very good and I loved it. <br /> <br /> The game is simple. In a player mode, you go out there. like James Bond and complete missions in different places, such as an Arctic land or a city. My favorite was one with a tank. In two player mode, you and a friend choose from any character you want and go all out with a fight. In the area where you are, you will find ammo and weapons to help. From handguns to rifles to lasers and even your work handles. <br /> <br /> Again with two player mode, there are many places to go, and some to unlock. I find this game very fun but also very suspense. Because, you never really know where your opponent is , and it's amazing to see them behind a door where you're going. <br /> <br /> This game gets **** (1/2) stars or ***** Very good! Go play it someday!
