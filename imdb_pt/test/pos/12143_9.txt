"Class tous risques" seems the grandfather of "The Sopranos" to mix the criminal and domestic, and the movie friend, to feel as contemporary as Reservoir Dogs. Even though these thugs are affectionately entangled with wives, children, lovers, and parents, they are coldly relentless, and we are constantly reminded that they are, no matter what hot situation we also see them. They can tease a child's hair - and then shoot a threat in cold blood. The key is loyalty, and male camaraderie is beautifully conveyed, without ethnic or class stereotypes, even as their network of obligations and past retribution turns into suspicion and paranoia, since the old gang is in various stages of probation, retirement. or in less profitable new ventures. An intense charge is to send a stranger to perform an ancient escape scenario. It's a high point of excitement when a wife is informed that she is not the one the gangster is friends with, whereas virtually the only time we hear music on the soundtrack is when he remembers his wife. <br /> <br /> The street landscapes in Italy and France are wonderfully used, in the blinding daylight for dark waters and roads, from the opening of a pair of bronze robbers - who are traveling with the wife and two children. Lino Ventura, rough and steep, captures the screen immediately as the criminal father. And the second thug is clearly a casually shameless presence in their lives, as they easily coordinate theft and escape in cars, buses, boats and motorcycles. This is not the old fool who grew soft with the big-eyed orphan; these are their jobs and their families and they cross in horrible ways. <br /> <br /> The film makes no punches unexpectedly killing the characters, directly and as collateral damage, and defying our sympathy for them, to the end non sentimental, which is probably because there has never been an American remake. <br /> <br /> It looks so new that it is not until Jean-Paul Belmondo enters almost a third of the way into the film, looking as carefree as a young punk, which is perceived to be from 1960. Sultry Sandra Milo has smart and fantastic chemistry with him, from an ambulance to an elevator to a hospital bed. <br /> <br /> While the Film Forum was showing a new 35mm print with newly translated subtitles, it was not pristine. The program notes explained that the title refers to a type of insurance policy and is a "tourist class" pun.
