Well, it has to be said that Monster Man is a big movie mess, but somehow several different genres and a cliché plot come together to make one of the most enjoyable modern horror movies I've seen in ages! The two greatest styles the film mixes are a teenage comedy 'Road Trip' style and a vibe of Texas Chainsaw Massacre style, and at the same time one gets in the way of the other quite often; Director Michael Davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant change of tone means that we are never sure where the film will be made. Things start worryingly when we are introduced to two characters, both annoying in different ways. Adam is a silly virgin, while Harley is a fat, wide-mouthed "A-hole." Both are driving through the desert to attend the wedding of a girl they both liked in high school. After some strange events, they pick up a hitch-hiker, and then find themselves being chased by a maniac in a monster truck for unknown reasons ... The idea of ​​someone being chased by someone else in a larger vehicle is not original, but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the film's biggest assets. The truck itself looks scary because it is so dejected and rusty, and the fact that it jumps around the screen makes the unfolding action thrilling and full of suspense. After a while, you get to get accustomed to the characters and once Aimee Brooks gets into the fray, things start to look up. The teen comedy side of the film works very well, as Justin Ulrich is always on hand to offer some fun lines of dialogue and the scenes between the idiot virgin and the hot womanizer are quite interesting. When you think the movie could not get any more confused, things change to the stranger in the last third. Without ruining things, it has to be said that Monster Man presents the kind of ending that could not be seen coming, and along with the turnaround, is a big surprise. Some people may feel cheated by the sudden turn at the end - but I really thought it worked very well, because that fits in the movie where nothing here really fits ... Overall, this is not a 'great' movie - but if you're looking for some silly entertainment, Monster Man must hit the target!
