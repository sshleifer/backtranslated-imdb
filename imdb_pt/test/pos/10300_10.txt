On the outside, this film is best because of Vincent D'Onofrio (Law and Order: Criminal Intent), but this film is as good as the 1982 version. In a way, the 1999 version is better because it is more up-to-date ( a decade as compared to 27. The actors in this film were terrific, such as Terry Kinney (HBO's McManus, "Oz"), as James Daly and Tony Shalhoub (US Monk) and Gary Sinise (CSI: NY) Obvilubuly , the dialogue was changed to the contemporary audience, much of what he wrote remained the same, there were things that were not in the 1982 version that gave this a boost in drama and comedy, but in the end, this movie was as good as the 1982. In character: Vincent D'onofrio playing Phil Romano was excellent, better than Paul Sorvino. It is a game between Stacy Keach and Terry Kinney in terms of George, I would praise Shalhoub and, between Martin Sheen and Sinsise as Tom, I would say which Sinise won.
