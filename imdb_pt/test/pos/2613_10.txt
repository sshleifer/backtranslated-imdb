It's a conversation, shoot happy, alcoholic ASS COP! I saw the first and second episodes. The art and animation fit very well (note the facial expressions, lol). The main character is a weapon that carries distinctive, pair of buttocks, shooting at whoever he thinks is offensive or "guilty." So far, the episodes have had simple, straightforward plots that work very well with Assy's investigations. Don Sanchez, Assy's partner, plays the sober replica for A.A. antics and random "I have a guess" leads. Assy's lines are very funny and clever, here's one, for example, "I have a bullet and she has her email address on it, do not make me click send" * bang * "it looks like your inbox finished the new e-mail. "The reasoning box at Assy Mcgee's headquarters is so far, consistent and timely. As for the sound, it's perfect, the sound effects and the voice work are 9/10.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to catch some laughs before going to bed, like the air in the adult swim on Sunday nights. Very funny comedy, imaginative and visually different. 10/10
