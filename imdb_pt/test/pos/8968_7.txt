Consistency is perhaps this movie its biggest problem. The film begins as a quick, elegant and simply entertaining political satire, but in its second half the film gets more serious in tone, almost like Oliver Stone. Of course it is also a very serious subject, but I would say that the film would have been much better and more effective if it had been made completely in the same style as the first half of the film was filmed. <br /> <For a biography and a film about the theme of this film, the film is also quite short with its mere 102 minutes. The film because of this seems like it is not telling the whole story. It is clear that the follow-up to events after the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan is suggested in the film, but the film does not go deeper and does not explain much about it, which seems an inexpensive way to just glorify Charlie. Wilson, without showing the other side of the medal. Also the actual events of the film itself are rather simplified, although the story is still told (unnecessarily) complex at times. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film would have been much better if it had not been trying to be so serious at times and generally more light with its style and atmosphere. The film should have been, for example, more like "Wag the Dog", which managed to find a certain combination of satire and sensitive political issues. <br /> <br /> Because of this incoherent style and storytelling way, acting performances are also mixed. When Tom Hanks is playing his character more fun and more comical, he is simply excellent. But that makes it difficult to take your character seriously in the most serious and sensitive / shocking moments of the film. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always excellent as he is in any film he plays. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. Most of the other actors seem to be out there in this movie, just to be in the movie. This is especially true for Julia Roberts, whose character I found very mysterious to seem to have a very clear purpose for the film. She made a redundant impression on me and is therefore also really forgettable in this movie. <br /> <br /> It is not that the film is a bad watch, it is actually very good and also pleasant, but if the film had dared to be a little more daring, the film would have been better and, effective in what he was obviously trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> 7/10
