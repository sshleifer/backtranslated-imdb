Carla Gugino literally melts the screen in this crime. Her sexual appeal, ample features and sexy southern accent more than make this movie rewatchable. But the film has so many "other" things to make it almost a modern classic. Simon Baker's performance for one thing. Truly a great actor. Til Schweiger is so perfectly cast that it makes me wonder why he is not a big star "crossover". Gil Bellows completes this team and literally steals this show. The other Gugino neckline is easily the best performance of the film. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are so brilliant ... I can not describe it. Great chemistry. <br /> <br /> The music is so powerfully eclectic that it was a character in itself. Wonderful to see. <br /> <br /> People may say that it is Tarantino influenced ... I disagree. It is clearly unique and intelligent by itself. Sebastian Gutierrez does a wonderful job of directing this closely interwoven film and underestimating many scenes that have left me staggering. The ending is perfectly sinister and you never see it coming. All in all a beautiful movie that, for me, is the very definition of what a good movie should be.
