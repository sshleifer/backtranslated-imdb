I watched fantabulous! because in recent years Michael Sheen has become one of my favorite actors, and if you have not seen him in anything before embarrassing you in the first place, and secondly put in your hands a copy of Heartlands or Dirty Filthy Love. This production did not disappoint - Michael Sheen turned almost magically into Kenneth Williams, and gave a performance that was as tragic as it was clever. Not to take anything from the other performances, but like Kenneth, Michael really stole the show. I do not know how he does it, but every performance I've seen Michael give, he seems to metamorphose until the character he plays is truly, totally believable, and no matter how hard I try, I can not blame him. You should get my tea, enjoy yourself!
