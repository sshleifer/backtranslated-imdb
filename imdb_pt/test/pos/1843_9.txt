especially considering I can count on the one hand the romantic comedy movies I've ever liked. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is very good as a heart transplant patient, who has a mysterious connection with Duchovny's recently deceased wife. (I can think of several horrible movies that used this story - I think there was an LMN movie with Jane Seymour). This film, however, is a guardian. <br /> <br /> Duchovny is nice, and the scenes with his dog are cute and sad - the dog misses his deceased wife. All his friends want him to find a replacement, and there's a fun scene where he's on a blind date and Driver is the waitress. His date is horrible, and he finds himself intrigued by Minnie Driver. <br /> <br /> Caroll O'Connor is also good at one of his last roles, as the grumpy grandfather. Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi (this is the only movie I liked him) complete the comic aspect of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie because the story works, it's not overly romantic, and it does not insult the intelligence of the audience. Highly recommended 9/10.
