At first glance of this film, the camera angles immediately make you think this is a low budget movie that will get you bored or make you press the Stop button. Surprisingly, the plot comes forward and is played across the screen in a way that I would most identify myself with. I made this movie at 7, but as most would like, it should be a 10, you will understand how you watch because it is rare for a movie to be in touch with a person's feelings and how life should be shown by a TV. set. Most movies try to make him marvel at his special effects, twists and turns, and so on, this movie showed a good hand with a good movie backed by a style story in Alabama that most would find a good waste of a few hours. I wish I had put the popcorn maker after all well done!
