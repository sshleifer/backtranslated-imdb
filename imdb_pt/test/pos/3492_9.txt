The way I found out about this movie was when I watched American pie 2 at the beginning, had a trailer for Ali G Indahouse, I watched the trailer and this only forced me to buy the DVD, it looked incredibly funny! so the next day I went to my local shop and got it for Â£ 3.99 (bargain!). The movie is about Ali G, who is a "gangster" of the massive crew west staines, which rivals are the massive crew east staines. Ali has a bunch of "Boy Scouts" where he teaches how to survive in the "ghetto", teaching them to swear and steal cars, after Ali learns that the government is stopping the money going to the leisure center where Ali teaches children, he runs to MP for spotting and knocks down another MP in his attempts to get rid of the leisure center to make way for an airport in staines. Throughout the film there are lots of laughs while Ali stands up for some crazy things! Borat makes an appearance for a few seconds in the film too, this is a definite must watch movie for all fans of Sacha Baron Cohen out there!
