A lot of people do not think Dan Aykroyd is funny. This movie proves otherwise. Aykroyd is brilliantly delivering her one-liners in this comedy. The only big problem with this is that it wastes a lot of time near the end, going back and forth from Aykroyd's character and the doctor who chases him to prove he is a fraud. The doctor goes crazy like the doctor Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) in "What About Bob?". The scenes in which the doctor is desperately trying to return to Los Angeles are silly, unbelievable and bland. Other than this aspect of the movie is really funny especially in the first half.
