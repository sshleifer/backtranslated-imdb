Good show, very good acting, and the director takes us to swim through his plot in an interesting and unpredictable way, especially since, essentially, there are two people in a room. It does not run like many modern movies, but it also does not drag. Bohl is irreverent enough to believe her in the "now" of his character, who is still involved and does not go back on his "career" choices - so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep self-examination of her soul. .. Brundage has the delicate balance of weight, innocence, meekness and class to take "Buddy" very well. A little grainy in the quality of the film, but it fits the tone of the story. It could use a bit of polishing in the hair and make-up of things, but definitely worth watching.
