Imagine that. Someone makes a movie about the Columbine or Virginia massacre just the movie is directed by the guy who did it alone at home (I know this is nothing but me) and starring Sean Astin out of Goonies !! Imagine the terrorists being dominated by buckets of water over half-open doors and marbles, which is why you need to see the movie. unfortunately it does not go to the end, actually, having the skateboard lying on the ground for the evil Mexicans to stumble, but in the middle of the way you have to give up 7 for this, but not a 9 because you have not gone crazy enough. Pity, it looked like it would be a comic affair, it's worth a cult status
