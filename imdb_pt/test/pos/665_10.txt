It's the 1980s and teens are ready to party in an old and scary house that they claim to be haunted by the ghost of Murder McGee. After mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an Ouija board, children are forced to fight to the death fighting a vindictive ghost who owns and kills all their friends one by one. Sound familiar? Is supposed. It is clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic slashers of the '80s with the slogan: "Excessive violence, free nudity, zero budget." <br /> <br /> Do not get tired; It's pure entertainment! I liked the humor and the way he mocked all the clich√©s of horror, but at the same time he embraced what was amusing about movies of that time. There's something you get from this movie you never had with the horror movies of the 80's: good acting. The whole cast was very talented and you do not see much of it in any low budget movie, recent or not. There was a lot of chemistry between the characters. I was very entertained throughout the film, and I am completely convinced that the screenwriter / director and cast will go a long way in their separate careers. The script was very well written, and the dialogue flowed naturally. <br /> <br /> The effects were a bit amateurish and the scenes were not well lit, but the fact that this film admits on its cover there was practically no BUDGET I already know that. This film makes it simple to politely ignore your faults and just sit back and enjoy. Although this is not an Oscar-winning piece, it never claims to be, and sticks to it. It is very fun. If you like slashers, you'll really enjoy this movie. If you like blood and boobs, you will like it too.
