IT'S OK. So this can be done! We have here the perfect vampire movie. Gothic, cute. With all the ingredients. A realistic vampire. A wonderful story. Take note - I'm from Transylvania and I assure you, this movie respects the wisdom of vampires! It's just like the stories I heard in my childhood. For a transylvania, it's well ... believable. You should see this if you're interested in real vampires, as they were described in medieval chronicles and not as they are made in recent Hollywood movies (as far as I can imagine, the Hollywood problem is that they mix vampires with the incubus The incubus - called in my country The Night Flier, is the only beautiful demon that kills its victims by loving them.) I strongly suggest that the vampires are never beautiful or attractive, they can only inspire horror and revulsion. I recommend this to anyone gothic out there! See also the sequences, they are all very good! And of course, do not miss the shadows of DArk! Something similar is Nosferatu in Venice with Klaus Kinski. I recommend that one to.
