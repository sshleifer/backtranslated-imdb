Leslie Carbaga's excellent book on the Fleishers tells the whole story of Fleischer's great drive from his entire animation unit to Florida, and his subsequent ejection from Paramount. Mr. Bug Goes to Town did not destroy the credit of the animation pioneers with Paramount, though it's often said that way, and that was the favorite version of Paramount's story. According to Carbaga, the big studio, more than anything else, wanted to put the gloves on in the animation studio and completely relieve the famous bully brothers. Mr. Bug gave them the excuse to do just that. - The sad ending of a great and innovative chapter of American animation. <br /> <br /> I wanted to comment, too, that the movie actually debuted on December 4, 1941, not December 7. enough to do the trick, anyway, in terms of national mood harming the movie's success. But another part of the legend of this troublesome little movie is that he was killed for having the bad luck of being in theaters at the same time as Dumbo (released October 23, 1941) was still doing very fast holiday deals. I did not do research on box office numbers, but I would say that the simultaneous presence of Dumbo in theaters probably had an impact on Mr. Bug. Filming was on the rise at all times in that period, and the hit films could stay good in theaters for months. - Something unimaginable in these short and short days of DVD.
