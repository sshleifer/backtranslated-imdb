The Internet is a wonderful thing, is not it? I'm watching a recorded episode of one of my favorite documentaries, "Vietnam: The War of the Ten Thousand Days," from my DVR in Florida, USA, to my laptop in Kuwait; I'm writing a review on this series and just read another review from someone who actually lives in Vietnam! Amazing. I would just like to say that for Minh Nguyen to make the statement that America brought the war to Vietnam is one-sided. I know America was the main player in the West, but it takes two sides to wage war. The Soviets and the Chinese were great arms suppliers to the North, so why Mr. Nguyen does not mention them as partially guilty is showing an ignorance (well, I think we all know why he does not mention them, be it ignorance raised in a communist system and his political dogma, or because he is afraid to tell the truth for fear of being arrested.) In addition, Mr. Nguyen, I think that the parties on the North being the main aggressor throughout the war were not shown in their country, then blaming America again shows ignorance. Regardless, it is interesting to read a review of Vietnam (of course this could also be done, but I consider it to be real), at least the Communist East is somewhat open. As much as the mini-series; Why do I love it? It does not just focus on American involvement. This was a war that began 15 years before the United States got involved and the series covers every facet of the story, so it's a real plus. The footage used is top notch, every Vietnam War show you see made will now use the same footage, so you do not miss out on watching this older series. The date this series was made is another advantage. He has all the top actors being interviewed that you can not do now because they are dead of old age, it's an important historical reference. Thirdly, Richard Basehart adds a very distinct narrative voice, his voice sounds as distinct as the voice of James Earl Jones and I think it's a very strong compliment. I do not think you could find a better war documentary, it's like catching the relatively modern technology of 1980 and transplanting it to the year 1950 and interviewing all the generals and politicians on both sides of WWII. the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> OK, I see a subtle bias, a subtle bias of the 70-80s, like the NPR bias "All Things Considered," where everything seems so simple, but when you blink you end up swinging head. In this case shows that the later episodes do not shed much light on the role of the media and propaganda in general, all useful tools to influence the outcome of a war, do not you think ????? <br /> <br /> From an OIF war veteran going through the same thing 30 years later.
