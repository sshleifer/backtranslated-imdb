Cult director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his bloody 1980s zombie films, which earned him a reputation for being Gore's "godfather." Fulci's greatest absolute film, however, dates back to 1972 and although it is definitely violent and violent, it is not as bloody as many of his other films. "No If Sevizia A Paperino" aka. "Do not torture a duckling" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's biggest film, this tempting and absolutely brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre. The dazzling atmosphere and tempting suspense, the Sizilian scene, the intriguing story, the brilliant performances or the intense moments of pure shock - I do not know what to praise in this ingenious Giallo! "Do not torture a duckling" really does offer cinematic perfection in every aspect, which makes it an absolute masterpiece of Italian horror movies. <br /> <br /> Unlike other Gialli, they are not seductive beauty queens who are killed on the one hand, but boys who fall victim to a murderer on the loose. Bodies of boys are found in rural Sicily. While the police are desperately searching for the killer, the small town is basically full of strange people, and the villagers are screaming for a culprit ... <br /> <br /> The film is incredibly suspenseful and uncompromising from the start . , with a somber, dark and constantly tense atmosphere that has yet to find an equal. The acting performances are among the best in the Italian horror film. Tomas Milian (one of my favorite actors of all time) is excellent at leading, like journalist Andrea Martinelli, who is investigating the crimes. Sexy Barbara Bouchet offers both attractive looks and brilliant performance. Equally excellent performances come from Irene Papas and Florinda Bolkan, who is absolutely brilliant in her role. Riz Ortolani's great trail brilliantly intensifies suspense and atmosphere, and the film is ingeniously filmed in fascinating Sicilian landscapes. Although not as bloody as many other Fulci films, this film is definitely violent and uncompromising in its violence, with some shockingly brutal scenes. <br /> <br /> "Do not torture a duckling" has everything that brilliant Horror requires. This is not as easy to achieve as most other Fulci films, but I guarantee the quest will be worth it. Any fan of horror should see this my personal favorite, and I recommend any true movie lover in general not to miss it. A masterpiece!
