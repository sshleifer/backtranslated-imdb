I really like this movie. It is a retrospective at the time when this nation was really at risk of nations that attacked us or betrayed war, namely the Japanese and Germans. Robert Cummings and Pricilla Lane were excellent in the lead roles. The supporting cast ... Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, Clem Bevins and Norman Lloyd were also excellent. The direction, the rhythm and the end have maintained and continue to hold my interest. So much that I bought my copy. Thank God for Turner Classic Movies, they showcase many of the truly classic movies, including this one. Robert Cummings certainly was not a lightweight actor and although I am a big fan of Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea, two of my favorite actors who were the first to play the lead role, I I do not see what they would have brought to the role that would have surpassed Bob Cummings' performance. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that I like to watch over and over again and I urge others to see it.
