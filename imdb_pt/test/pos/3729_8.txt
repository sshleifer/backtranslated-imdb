I thought that Besson's film was able to pass without words what few movies could do with them; Capture the true human emotions. The fights, triumphs, setbacks, hopes and desires of the main character are so honestly shown that you wonder if he's acting. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamor afforded by most Hollywood productions, but minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical labeling of science fiction and become a real drama. However, calling this drama-only movie would take the fantastic post-apocalyptic storyline. It is true that this type of film has been done before, but I think this film captures the joys and sorrows of this kind of world possibly better than any other.
