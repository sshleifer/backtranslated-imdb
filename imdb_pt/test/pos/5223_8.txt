044: The Big Trail (1930) - released on 10/24/1930; 4/5/06. <br /> <br /> BIRTH: Richard Harris, Harold Pinter, Robert Atkins. <br /> <br /> DOUG: In Hollywood, Raoul Walsh unveiled his latest film, The Big Trail, a western about the journey west across the border, starring promising actor John Wayne, 23. In 1930, we are seeing many "first" but few "better" ones. In addition to John Wayne's first film, we have here the first widescreen movie (though we have only watched the full-frame version). Curiously, the decision to shoot widescreen was essentially the same reason why the widescreen became popular later: to compete with television, which had not yet appeared commercially, but was still an emerging curiosity. Even so, this movie was extremely good, giving us a harrowing look on the walk to Oklahoma. The opening cards show us that this is a western of the more traditional type, about America, about the land, who must live in it, etc., and is an excellent demonstration of this. Walsh gives us some amazing looks from the wagon company in the desert (when they reach a cliff, they must tie each cart one by one), and we also have a subplot of revenge involving Wayne chasing the man who killed one of his friends. (I remember something similar in Stagecoach). Wayne's tough cowboy routine is at least partially there, and will certainly evolve further into subsequent films. Since this movie represents all of Wayne's 30-year jobs for the Odyssey, we will not see his face again until Stagecoach, but as soon as we do, we will continue to see him until the end of the Odyssey and beyond. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Oh, our first Western sound, and John Wayne's first lead role. It's Raoul Walsh's Great Track. This review will be short, since it's been weeks since I've seen it. I liked this movie, but it was far from being a masterpiece. The most predictable adventure has had some surprises, such as when the thugs' brain, Red Flack (Tyrone Power Sr. in his last role) is killed in the middle; I thought he would be the boss at the end but it turned out to be Bill Thorpe (Ian Keith). I remember I did not like the way Breck (Wayne) kills Thorpe and demands revenge in the end. I understood that this was what he should do in the story, but I did not really like his reasoning when he tells Ruth why he has to do it. I think he had a much greater responsibility for the hundreds of settlers he led through the harsh west. <br /> <br /> Last film seen: Animal Crackers (1930). Last film in chronological order: Soup to Nuts (1930). Next movie: L'Age D'or (1930).
