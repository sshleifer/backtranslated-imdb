The '70s were a great time for horror movies. The Brotherhood of Satan is more of a neglected gem. It is packed to the brim with great surreal and disturbing scenes. It's also great to see Stother Martin and L.Q. Jones (who also produced) in decent roles. <br /> <br /> Part of this is a little dated and tacky, but the Brotherhood of Satan kicks the Devil and many other 1970s Satanist movies.
