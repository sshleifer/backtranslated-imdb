Another classic performance of Maniratnam and his team. They can be proud to display this movie at every film festival because it has everything they need to name it as a "classic of all time". The war and its impacts on Sri Lanka through the eyes of a ten-year-old girl is the movie, but the scenes and circumstances will certainly not be as expected. Madhavan is no wonder that he is one of the best actors in the country, who can always add beauty and unique identity to the role he plays, and must have the audacity to act as the father of three children when he is considered a dream boy . glamorous personality in the industry. AR Rahman's music makes the movie special for those who like melodies. Above all, the story and the way it is told make it the best movie of recent times.
