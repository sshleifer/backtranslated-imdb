Although Bullet In The Brain is undoubtedly superior among short films, it largely looks more like a little text than a movie. And it's a bit difficult to feel sorry for the teacher when his clever comments lead him to a shot. But once the bullet enters your brain, we begin to understand a bit about why he got so sick of life in the first place. There is an absurd amount of detail in this reasonably short film and that's what makes me feel it should have been stretched a little bit - it seems like there is almost too much to be absorbed at once as details come flying to you. fast. A slightly more relaxed rhythm and less optimistic narrator in the final section would have benefited somewhat from this film. Despite these complaints, there is no denying that Bullet In The Brain is a pretty stupendous job compared to many short and even full length films. Creators should be applauded for trying to make such an emotional and literary film in the current mood of quick jokes and Hollywood action.
