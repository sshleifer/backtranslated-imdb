When I saw this movie, it reminded me of all the biggest dreams I've had (mostly full of robots). I can relate to Eledore's problems and I have a resemblance to Shiro, and this is a great movie. to watch (if you're a Goth that's bitter and eccentric like me!). All in all, watch before you get out of print!
