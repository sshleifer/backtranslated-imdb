This is the kind of movie you rent when you're incredibly tired, or harmed in some other way ... The acting in this movie is so bad it seems intentional, and for you to know how bad the special effects are, there's a scene in which puppets are coming to life, where you can see most of a hand holding the puppet, moving it. The film appeared to have been filmed with a camcorder. When I saw this movie for the first time, a punch fight almost exploded when my friends and I were calling each other names of this movie, which was how awful it was. If you like to get mad at movies, I recommend this to you, otherwise flee as if your life depended on it.
