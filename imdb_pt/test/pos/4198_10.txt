This is one of those movies where it's easy to see how some people would not like it. My wife never saw it, and when I just remembered last night, I waited until she went to bed. She might have been amused by a few snippets, but I know she'd have enough in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> The head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly bogged down in the psychedelic era. It can be seen as a filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as a sort of postmodern acid journey through cinematographic genres. If you are not a big fan of these things - psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism and the "aesthetic of the acid journey" (assuming there is a difference between them), you should probably stay away from this movie. On the other hand, if you're a fan of this sort of thing, you have to run out and buy Head now, if you have not already. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the film never received much respect. This probably has a lot to do with prejudices. After all, it stars The Monkees - Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork - and The Monkees was a musical group of actors reunited by the producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider to be a kid friend of the child. Beatles gummy for a television series. At the time, they had as much respect as, for example, Menudo, New Kids on the Block, The Spice Girls and so on. As a fellow reviewer of the IMDb notes rightly - "Maybe people in 1968, thinking of the Monkees as a silly pop band made by the Beatles, would refuse to see (Head)." <br /> <br /> The Monkees and Head were never able to abandon this negative perception of the public. It's a shame, because there was so much talent, both musical and otherwise, in The Monkees. It's probably stranger than Rafelson, who heads here and co-produces with Schneider, and Jack Nicholson (who, Jack Nicholson), who wrote the script and also co-produces, decide to take The Monkees in this unusual direction. It's as if New Kids on the Block suddenly released an album equivalent to Ummagumma (1969) or Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother (1970). In fact, Head's songs, written by The Monkees and frequent collaborators like Carole King and Harry Nilsson, have a similar quality to Floyd, somewhere between the era of Sy d Barrett and the post-Barrett era. This is far more prominent than any Beatles resemblance. Some people have complained about the song in the movie, but to me all the songs are beautiful. Incidentally, some people do not like the era of Barrett (or other) Floyd, which is equally difficult for me to empathize with. <br /> <br /> But what is it? The basic essence is that The Monkees is making a journey through various film genres - there are war scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenes, drama scenes, Western scenes, science fiction scenes, and so on. . Except, in the reality of the film, this happens mostly (if not exclusively) in a studio. At the root, we're watching The Monkees filming a movie. Of course, all scenes in the various genres have something surreal and self-referential about them, and they, and individual scenes within a scene, tend to lead one to the other using dream logic not unlike the Monty television series Python. As a dream, Head tends to waver between a good dream and a nightmare, while it is often one that makes you laugh in your sleep (something I do often, by the way). Technically Rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to understand what was said above. There are scenes with extensive negative images, there are many very quick cuts (including a great sequel featuring Davy Jones and Tony Basil dancing alternately in a white room and a black room, using a reversed white and black combination in each of them). occasionally switches back and forth as fast as two frames at a time), there are many bizarre sequences, there is an animated cow mouth, there are strange editing devices, and so on. For my money, I wish these things were not just a relic of the psychedelic era. This is the kind of artistic approach I like. It seemed like a good idea back then and I still think it's a good idea. I'd like to see movies like The Aquatic Life with Steve Zissou using (2004) using these types of extended techniques. Now, that would make this movie surreal. <br /> <br /> Interpretatively, some people who are not so attuned to the aesthetics of the acid journey have complained that it is basically b. to offer meanings to something destined to have none. I do not agree with this pessimistic / nihilistic view; Head was meant to have a lot of meaning (s), and it's not just conventional non-plot films that have multiple interpretations. Nicholson, Rafelson, and Schneider have many interesting things to say about The Monkees - the movie postmodernistically comments on its status as a manufacturer; pop stardom - well before Pink Floyd, Head confuses pop stardom and violence, from war images to fan images dismantling their idols cannibalistically; and naive U.S. ideas of international awareness and respect - well-armed foreigners in a desert surrender to Micky Dolenz just because he's American, then they blow up a Coca-Cola machine (again in the wilderness) for him because he's thirsty and can not gain access. The film comments on many other topics - from the big industry to the police, polls, bystanders (especially in relation to tragedies), and so on. The head is full of ideas, appropriately, with clever and multifaceted things to say about them. <br /> <br /> The head deserves to be considered a classic - it's basically shooting for the same vibe as the Beatles Yellow Submarine. Both premiered in November 1968, curiously, and both were conceived as a kind of summation of psychedelic aesthetics. Yellow Submarine was not successful. Head is everything Yellow Submarine should have been.
