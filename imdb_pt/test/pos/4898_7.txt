There are two ways to turn a TV series into a movie. <br /> <br /> The first, most common and least successful, is basically making a feature-length TV episode - see the disasters of Steptoe & Son movie. The second is to do something else - something quite different, the Monty Python. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the creators of the TV series worshiped the latter, and they invented something unique. , smart and funny - could not feel less like a TV episode. <br /> <br /> Try to understand this - the writers, interpreting themselves, are confronted by their alter-egos of Royston Vasey, touched, of course, by them, and said to continue writing the series, otherwise, the apocalypse will happen in the village. <br /> <br /> High concept, invented and easy to screw up? Yes, but somehow they succeeded. Not for all tastes, maybe, and the end drags on, but the fans will be delighted, and this may even win the uninitiated.
