Well, it's a great job for Aparnaji and some in which people like that make us believe that there are a lot more concepts so far that need to be cast and the movie is a great media to do that. Well all the great actors together, so nothing to say about the acting or direction, but the movie gave us a great message through out. He foresaw the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true from our own point of view and we want to solve all problems according to it. From there, from teacher to servant, all tried their own ways. So when Joydeep was arguing with his wife, he says "she's looking for something she'll never have" and the wife replies "are not we all?". So that was a great comment that after the movie left me with a great question: "Are we all sick?"
