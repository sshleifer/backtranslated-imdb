Although Flatliner is 15, this was the first time I saw him. I had heard about the Flatliners movie, but there was never a buzz about it to make me leave and rent it or make sure to see the period. Well, I picked up one of the premium channels and I must say it was very good. <br /> <br /> This movie was about some young medical students deciding to explore death. They have discovered a way to cause a person to die briefly and bring him back to life. In addition to the cast of stars, this movie took a serious bite. Just the thought of exploring death is fascinating enough, but I really thought the screenwriter and director did a great job of giving a different, yet inspiring, insight. It was not a generic attempt to thrill, frighten and make the mind think ... this was the real deal. <br /> <br /> Instead of becoming an empty, shallow, star-filled thriller, this movie had substance. A hard-nosed thriller, with a white ear knot, seat tip, and hard nose. I give it 8/10.
