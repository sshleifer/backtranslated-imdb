I chose "The English Patient" for an extra-historic credit assignment. I thought this movie would be incredibly annoying. Instead, it has become one of my favorites. It portrays life in World War II fairly accurately, and the love story is incredible. The love story made the movie so incredible. I felt this interesting feeling, passion or something. It made me want to watch the movie over and over again. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are incredible actors and the way they interpreted their characters is incredible. The wonderful look together and really seemed to be in love. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie to watch as a leisure activity or for a task.
