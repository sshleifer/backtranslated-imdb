I read ashew's comment and thought they should be watching a completely different picture! <br /> <br /> I just watched the movie this morning and was quite surprised. <br /> <br /> To address the ashew comments: <br /> <br /> Trail Street is a very well done western. <br /> <br /> And Randolph Scott was in on it for a bit! <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes was funnier than I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The thugs had good criticisms of me. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see Robert Ryan as a straight guy. A good guy - he's usually so slimy. <br /> <br /> In all, a good western, very well represented and written. <br /> <br /> I liked the background story of Kansas and the "wheat winter" that supposedly helped to become a state as well. <br /> <br /> I thought the girl who played Susan was adorable - can not think why she did not become a bigger star!
