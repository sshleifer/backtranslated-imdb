This film is undoubtedly one of the biggest milestones in film history. In looking at this film, we can only note in retrospect that world cinema in the 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy, such a strong and appropriate use of sound image assembly and a quasi-religious admiration of ethical choices in human life. Cinema, then, was not just an art form. It was much taller than ordinary life and gave many people the hope of living after the tragic war. It is said that even Picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art may appear only once in 100 years! Hearing that time was also different. I read that after seeing Kurosawa's "Ikiru (Live)" on their first release, the young couple calmly said to each other, "It's a good movie, is not it?" I think contemporary cinema, although technically developed and open to a new narrative perspective, has lost the most important trust of the public. Cienma was once the most popular art and unlike the modern fine arts and contemporary music, it has given millions of people hope and ideals. In this point of view, "Letyat zhuravli" should be in the pantheon of the classics of all time, such as "City light", "Ikiru" and "La Strada".
