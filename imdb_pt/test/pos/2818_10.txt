I love seeing a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose asked many interesting questions on her journey of achievement. Is it possible to achieve peace and inner fulfillment by external means? Does our society teach this? Can someone be a victim of memory that can lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of someone's environment? To what extent can one control or control the environment? How is a human "typical" or different from Rose? Finally, would the result or history change if it were from another country like France or Italy? I loved that this movie provoked all these questions in me, while entertaining, stimulating and keeping me guessing until the end! Every time I watched, I learned more about the movie and about myself.
