A boy who adores Maurice Richard of the Montreal Canadiens receives to his horror a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater by mail. Recently I watched this in a class where few students were interested in hockey, but almost everyone knew about Maurice Richard and the rivalry between Toronto and Montreal. Highly fun, fun and accurate.
