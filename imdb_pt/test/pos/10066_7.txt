Madonna goes into action again and she fails again! Who's That Girl was released just a year after the huge failure of Shanghai Surprise and two after the successful cult film Desperately Seeking for Susan. She chose to act to forget the failure of the previous film, without suspecting that the latter could also be a failure. The film received a bad acceptance by the critic and American public, whereas in Europe it was a success. Madonna says "some people do not want her to be successful either as a pop star or as a movie star." The soundtrack album, in which she sings four tracks, sells well and the single from the title track was a big hit around the world, as was the World Tour. The truth is that Madonna failed as an actress because the script was very weak. Butit is not so bad, especially for those who like the 80's: it's a disorganized, trash, colorful and cheerful action movie! In the end, it's very funny watching it.
