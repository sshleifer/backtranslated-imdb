Starewicz is infinitely inventive and his techniques still impress fans of animation 70 years later. We may have computer-generated techniques now, but all he had in 1934 was an imagination that did not take no for an answer. Everything he wanted to see on screen, he created. <br /> <br /> And he wanted to see some really bizarre things - every imaginable piece of junk is called for the service: old shoes, chicken bones, utensils, broken glass, dolls, monkeys, rats ... looks like if there was nothing out of bounds. <br /> <br /> A truly strange, even unsettling, movie that should be seen by anyone who has a passing interest in animation. This movie must be seen to be believed!
