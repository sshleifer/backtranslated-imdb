Looking for proof that real life is more fun than fiction? You just found it. This excellent documentary about an aspiring filmmaker (Mark Bortchart) who refuses to admit defeat is the funniest film I have ever seen - probably because it is also one of the most tragic. Curiously, the more I watch the movie, the more inspired I become.
