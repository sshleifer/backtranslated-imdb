It's good to see an adult comedy. Masterfully structured by Aaron Sorkin through the domain of Mike Nichols. Nichol's domain is to present characters with all their shocking truth, from the sad and fascinating Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" to the sad and fascinating Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law and Natalie Portman in "Closer." "In" Charlie Wilson's War "the shocking truth is out of character and the sad and fascinating Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are at the service of something else, it's personal only to a certain extent. Amy Adams witnesses and exists as a character, witnessing, an unsurpassed task that Miss Adams manages to overcome beautifully.It is Gus, by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who in the Hoffman is the first to be introduced by Hoffman, one who survives the disrespect with which he is treated by the absolute conviction that he is smarter than all of them. The rhythm of the tale helps enormously not to fall into a myriad of useless questions.A short comedy, smart and sad and when was the last time I could say that?
