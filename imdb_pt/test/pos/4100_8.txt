As a movie buff, I had obviously read all the excruciating reviews and funny and sarcastic comments about this movie (my favorite is Woody Allen's joke). If I had my life to live again I would not change anything ... except for watching the musical remake of Lost Horizon "). So I've never been able to watch it without smiling at the choreography / set / songs, etc. Recently, I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the movie. reputation. He really liked it, and - after trying to block out all the negative prejudices I obviously had about the movie - me too. There's nothing particularly bad about Lost Horizon, and it's much more enjoyable and watchable than many other 1970s movies. It's not even especially the camp. The lyrics of some of the songs are pretty repetitive and simplistic, but this is not really apparent when you hear them for the first time or have the flaws pointed in advance, so you're ready to mock them. As for all critics who have stated that the cast can not sing in tune, this critique disintegrates, as Liv Ullmann, Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were nicknamed (brilliantly also, as the vocals perfectly match their voices), and Sally Kellerman has a lovely and totally original singing style. Vocally, Kellerman's duet with Olivia Hussey in "The Things I'm Not Gonna Miss" is excellent. Special mention should be made of the brilliant performance of the legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer as the High Lama - and his comments about shattering humanity are coldly apt to the fragmented world of today. I would not even say for a second that Lost Horizon is a masterpiece (The things I would not miss are the uninspired choreography, and Bobby Van's "Question Me An Answer," which could easily have been cut), but if you have not even seen the Lost Horizon, or have not seen it for some time, try to watch without the attitude "Oh boy, let's laugh at that pile of crap", and you'll be amazed at how nice it really is.
