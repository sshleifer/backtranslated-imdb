"How can a name, not even a real name, break your heart?" See how. There were few cinematic versions of a celebrated novel that did justice to the original material in Cold Moodhell, by Charles Frazier, Anthony Minghella. If you have read the book, you will be able to feel most of the great scenes recreated from the soul. I personally cried several times as I read the novel and spent most of the night watching the movie through tears. <br /> <br /> Amazing scope, beautiful words, great acting and great music. In the DVD interview that accompanies the film, Minghella talks about the multiple layers of the story. They all work. One of the best movies I've ever seen and an invitation to one of the greatest novels of the last ten years.
