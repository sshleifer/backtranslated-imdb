"FOOTSTEPS", it's my opinion, is a pure ABC success! I do not remember all the episodes, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when an accident occurred at school. I always laugh at that. In fact, I think of almost every J.T. case (Brandon Call) and Cody's lines (Sasha Mitchell) were funny. It would have been nice if Penny (Patrika Darbo) had stayed on the show for the rest of her run. Everyone always performed well, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope it never stops being displayed in syndication.
