I turned 13 when Elvis hit the big time in 1956 with his first hit RCA. A year later, Buddy Holly intervened to give the king a contest. One of Buddy's great talents, in addition to his singing style and compositional skill, is often minimized. Buddy was also a talented guitarist, developing a unique rockabilly style in his Fender Strat. Gary Busey tries to capture this aspect of Buddy's persona. There were other contemporary rockers of equal caliber, like Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins and Eddie Cochran, but Buddy's talent is often ignored. <br /> <br /> As noted by others, Busey is the driving force behind the success of "The Buddy Holly Story". Not only did the screenplay play with the facts of Buddy's life, but it also intervened several anachronisms for Buddy's two years of popularity, basically 1957-1959. One that comes to mind is the scene in which Buddy and Maria are watching a 3-D movie. Buddy is disenchanted with all this and tells Maria that it will never last. It's just a fad. In fact, there were no 3-D movies in circulation at the time. The apogee of 3-D was in the early 50's. By 1955, the fashion had disappeared. Yet another example where only a little research would have been enough to make the story more believable. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's hard to separate what really happened from the urban legends surrounding Buddy's career. The story about how crickets got their name may or may not be apocryphal, but it certainly did not happen the way it is presented in the film. Another problem with the film is how Buddy's parents are portrayed. Certainly Buddy's parents supported his musical career. "Maybe Baby" is credited to Buddy's mother and she had participation in the song's composition. <br /> <br /> It's good that Buddy's greatest hits have been used in the movie, but I miss listening to one of my favorites, "I'm looking for someone to love." I am proud that, as a result of this film, Buddy's song has been reissued for a new generation to hear. His legacy is one of the best since the early days of rock 'n' roll. Rave, my friend, stay tuned.
