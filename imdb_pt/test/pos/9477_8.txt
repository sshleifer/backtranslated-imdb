This is what James Cagney is all about, cuties, arrogance, nail-hard and pointless charisma. <br /> <br /> Although the plot looks serious, the movie is anything but. It's made in the crazy comedy style of the thirties and works well with his "fights" with the fianc√© Mae Clark and his reactions to the high stories of his colleague James Burke. <br /> <br /> What elevates you above normal is the dialogue and the cast that delivers it. The dialogue is good, but it is nothing unless the delivery is punctual and can reflect on the characters involved. This is done well for all time. <br /> <br /> Good entertainment and very enjoyable.
