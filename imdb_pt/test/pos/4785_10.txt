Steamboat Willy was not the first drawing to present Mickey Mouse. The first movie to star in America's friend was "Plane Crazy." "Plane Crazy" was released on May 15, 1928 in Hollywood in California in the silent film format. "Steamboat Willy" was released on November 18, 1928 as a SOUND movie (it was also released on July 29, 1928 as a silent film). So doing "Steamboat .." Mickey's first sound film, but not the first movie for the American little mouse. While many game shows have used the question, "What was Mickey Mouse's first appearance?" The real answer is "Plane Crazy" and not "Steamboat Willy". These dates can be verified in IMDb on "release dates".
