very rarely do I happen to write a comment for a movie ... but this movie !!!!!! oh my sacred god !!!!!!!! there has never been a better Hindi movie than this one ...... and never, never was there a better movie than that ...... it's the king of all comedies ..... <br /> < Aamir Khan is arguably the best comic actor in the Indian Film Industry ... though it's funny to say that because he's a class actor, not a comedian ... but what he did in that movie is perhaps the most hilarity of any Indian actor in a comedy. Salman Khan was never a good actor in my eyes ... but this movie got the best out of him ... he was innocently comic ... if ever there was a term like that .... just what the doctor ordered, as far as his role in the film was concerned ... rajkumar santoshi I do not know why, I never tried to hand in the comedy again. ... directed large enterprises such as The Legend of Bhagat Singh and Khaki, but could not recreate the magic of andaz apna apna. I do not care because this movie bombed the box office .... although I feel sad that a movie like "hum aapke hain kaun" was the reason for failure ...... from from now I hope the rumors become true ..... there will be "andaz apna-2" they say ....... we like the public can only say AMEN !!!!!
