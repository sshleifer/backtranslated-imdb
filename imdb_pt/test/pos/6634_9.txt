Extremely pinch the view of a war situation in which the couple of Vargtimmen (okay, they have different names and initial situations, but the actors are the same) is caught in the crossfire of two fronts. Representing battle groups as faceless and superordinate authorities is often captured in sublime and surreal images and draws interesting parallels to those of 1984 in Orwell, even though Bergman thwarted this context on a personal level of a slowly blooming marital war. That is why innumerable fundamental and philosophical questions regarding the marriage of Eve and Jan are relevant and essential, while the threat and danger of external tears open a chasm in the interior that was once covered with licks. An intense allegory on the fragile facades of civic conventions.
