The third part of Miike's Dead or Living trilogy has nothing to do with the first two parts, more or less. Show Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi are back for the lead roles, but this time the movie pushes us forward 300 years or more into the future ... post apocalypse. Riki plays a tough cop, an enforcer for the extreme police policies of the corrupt city, and Show plays, a hobo who joins a band of oppressed rebels in the city. The film must have been filmed in Hong Kong, since the majority of the cast is of Cantonese, with Terence Yin and Josie Ho being the most familiar faces. There is also a team of HK acrobatics on hand for the action sequences of the films, which are very cool in an HK-via-Miike style. <br /> <br /> This could be a reason for a low budget B movie, but in Miike's hands, of course, they become something more interesting. It is a slow and thoughtful film that snakes and does not try to force anything into the spectator's throat. The characters are rounded and interesting, and the plot is an interesting structure, but rather loose, for the story to be hung. <br /> <br /> In short, a fairly low effort up to the action scenes, which show Miike's growing ability to drive. and choreographed a very cool action. Watching the small making of with Show & Riki on wire platforms is really fun - you can tell they were having a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie tries to unite the films 3 Dead Or Alive, which is quite unnecessary because each one is actually self-contained. Miike's explanation of the connection is very funny, and limits the series very well. <br /> <br /> Not as deep or well developed as DOA2, not as scandalous and intense as the DOA1 ... yet another good Miike film Despite.
