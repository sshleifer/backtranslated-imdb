Ignore everyone else's comments for this movie and watch it on paid cable (like I did) or rent it. You owe it to yourself. This movie is what the movies are (supposedly). Hard to categorize (and God knows how it was cast as a "high concept"!), But this is one of the angels. Check out. What do you have to lose?
