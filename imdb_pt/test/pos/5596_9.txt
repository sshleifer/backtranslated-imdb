Race Against Fear has to be one of the most moving TV movies I've seen in a long time. All performances by the leading actors were superb, especially Ariana Richards (Mickey Carlyle), William Bullimer (coach Kurt Ansom) and Susan Blakely (Margaret Carlyle). Ariana, in particular, performed an extremely emotional performance with facial expressions to match. She portrayed the emotions that Mickey was feeling perfectly, and you could easily believe she had actually been raped, so realistic was her performance. <br /> <br /> RAF is an incredibly realistic film due to the moving performances of the film. fused. Bullimer looked incredibly good as a rapist, and you hated him more and more as the movie progressed. Blakely also made an emotional performance as the mother of the raped girl (Mickey Carlyle), and you felt more and more pity for the Carlyle family because no one believed them about the rape. <br /> <br /> In all, RAF is a great movie. It is both exciting and full of suspense as you are continuously unsure if Ansom would be sued for rape due to a lack of witnesses, evidence and belief in the allegation. I completely recommend watching this movie.
