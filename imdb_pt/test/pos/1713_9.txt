I liked some of the older Doctor Who many years ago, so when the new one came out, I just had to take a look. I was so satisfied - with the characters, the story lines, the updated look, I got hooked! From Season 1 (27 for older fans) to Season 2 (28), it continues to improve. It fits well with the old shows as well, although you do not need to know the old programs to take advantage of this new version. <br /> <br /> Although there has been a cast change, I recommend Doctor Who. - with Chris Eccleston and with David Tennant. <br /> <br /> I like that they have given the characters so much depth. The Doctor seems more vulnerable in this series, perhaps because he is the last TimeLord. The range of emotions that Chris and David show are truly remarkable, and I felt their pain, anger and sense of adventure along with them. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper (Rose) brings a very human element to each episode, although she is much braver than me. With her talent, Billie will go far in the industry.
