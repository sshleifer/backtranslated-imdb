Snakes on a Plane was such a sensational movie that it was inevitable and a little crazy to try to release another film with almost the same title in the same year, let alone the same week. Reading the other reviews here, I see the results. Many people are crazy. Crazy because it does not have the best special effects. Crazy because it does not have a star cast. Crazy because they wanted to see Samuel Jackson say, "I'm fed up with these M & A's - Well, this is certainly not the version of Samuel Jackson, and maybe that's good. Snakes on a Plane was lost between a cop and horror movie A family action movie and a bloodsucker movie. The Saturday Night Live performers laughed as Jackson swore enough to make a grandmother cover his ears, and as far as the kids go, they would be traumatized by violence. Snakes on a Train, however, knew exactly what to do. It was a cheap horror movie made on a train, of course it had snakes, and of course many of them were scientifically harmless garden snakes with fake sound effects.He loses a step in his plot or intention where the version "on the Plane "was stumbling on itself from the first scene. <br /> <br /> I took advantage of the sup fun The worst that Snakes on a Plane had to offer and I admit the "... in The version of the train was a bit dry. But in trade, it was a cool and unexpected story. This little horror movie could have gone much more wrong than it did. <br /> <br /> For this he gets 7 out of 10.
