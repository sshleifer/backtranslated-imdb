It has been said that Batman Begins in Batman's first movie to "hit", but I think it is a horrible exaggeration, as I think the new Batman movie, although larger than Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, pales in comparison to the classics of Tim Burton. with this being the best of the five. The darkness is beautiful, as is the music and scenery, creating a mysterious Gotham City, unlike Batman Begins, where Gotham City is a normal-looking city. The villains are great in this movie. You literally can not take your eyes off the penguin and the catwoman. I applaud Tim Burton for being original, with his use of the penguin as an aberration rather than a common criminal or a clone of the old Batman TV show. In Batman Begins, we have the scarecrow, who is not as demanding on the screen as the penguin or catwoman. The film does not have to focus solely on Batman, because we already know his story, and it's the villains we're exploring and trying to figure out, and it's they who create the plot, with the penguin running for mayor. and seeking revenge for the defection of his parents by killing the first offspring of Gotham, a task he failed. Danny Devito presents the all-time best performance in a movie about a superhero villain, even surpassing Nicholson's wild card. The final scene where the penguins drag the corpse of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful. It is a tragedy that Tim Burton is not allowed to complete his trilogy, as Warner Bros., interested in marketing appeal, wanted to "relieve" the films of Batman. And they got their wish ... unfortunately. Tim Burton planned to direct the third film, using Riddler as the villain, without Two-Face and Robin to ruin everything, and I'm sure Michael Keaton would have signed. So this is the last great movie of Batman. Batman Begins is dull but boring, boring, average, full of dodgy villains and a playboy Bruce Wayne. A decent Batman movie, but the best Batman movie of all time? Never. Batman Returns holds this crown.
