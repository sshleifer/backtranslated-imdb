This is one of those movies when you're watching, you wonder if it's documentary or fiction. After the film, Ramin Bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the film has a script. The Bahrani camera is silent, it is not critical, it almost erases the film director by purpose, the background is not arranged to make the photo beautiful, but do not misunderstand me; There is a lot of preparation for this movie. Starting at the personal level, being the part of the environment, being ignored when you shoot. <br /> <br /> The main character is a 'real' actor in every way. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank the entire crew for this movie, showing us another country within New York. I strongly suggest you enjoy other stories. <br /> <br /> Bora Kizilirmak
