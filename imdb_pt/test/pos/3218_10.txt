This is definitely an excellent show. I do not have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that sort of thing. But it was not. It's surprisingly deep. He's also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you see every time you watch. It's a comedy-drama, which is rare when done right. It's about Rory and Lorelai's relationship. Instead of the classic relationship between mother and daughter, it is a best friend relationship story - about mother and daughter. The characters are perfectly cast and everyone does a great job. It's definitely the best TV show I've ever seen.
