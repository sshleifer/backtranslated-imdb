In the 60s / 70s, David Jason was renowned for his many supporting roles in television comedies such as 'Do not Adjust Your Set!', 'Hark At Barker' and 'Doctor' Series. It was in 1974 that he landed his first starring role in "The Secret Life of Edgar Briggs" by London Weekend Television, written by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna. <br /> <br /> Edgar Briggs is a secret agent of the 'SIS' ('Secret Intelligence Service'). He really tries to do his job well but always seems to ruin things. Surprisingly, however, he can always get to the bottom of the cases, much to the astonishment of his colleagues - "Buxton" (Michael Stainton), "Spencer" (Mark Eden) and "Cathy" (the lovely Elisabeth Counsell), all of whom respond to 'The Commander' (Noel Coleman). Briggs is married to 'Jennifer' (Barbara Angell), a woman who, much like Michele Dotrice's' Betty 'from' Some Mother's Do 'Ave' Em! ', Has the patience of a saint and stands beside her grumpy (but well-meaning) husband, no matter what. <br /> <br /> Like 'Some Mother's' Ave 'Em' and 'The Baldy Man', 'TTSLOEB' was laced completely with slapstick. In each episode, Jason did acrobatics like plummeting from a high window sill or falling from the top of a ladder while decorating his apartment. It was really 'face pie'. <br /> <br /> 'Edgar Briggs' was not a big success due to the poor scheduling of I.T.V. Too bad, because it was a fun and enjoyable show, well served by his star and the excellent support cast. The protagonist, however, did not seem to like the experience of the show. David Jason vetoed repeated performances of the show because he thought his acting was not refined. Granted, David Jason who played 'Del Boy', 'Inspector Frost' and 'Pop Larkin' is very different from what played Briggs, but by no means was his unrefined performance. Most of the actors would have turned Briggs into a ridiculous caricature, but Jason's performance made Briggs a realistic and dependable figure. Strange, perhaps, but not unimaginable. <br /> <br /> Jason's next vehicle was 'Lucky Feller', in which he played Mummy's boy 'Shorty Mempstead'. He also could not do the classifications. His stroke of luck came in the form of "A Sharp Intake Of Breath" from A.T.V, in which he played in the ambulatory disaster area 'Peter Barnes' for four series between 1977-1981. So while not quite as remarkable, "Briggs" is an easy and worthwhile observation. Good 'James Bond' style theme too!
