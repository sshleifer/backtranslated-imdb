This movie had a distinct Woody Allen feel about it, so if you're not a fan of dry humor, black humor or humor with your hand behind you, you'll probably find something else to do. If you are, however, this is peculiar, with some twists and a fluent and natural dialogue. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite engaging, not exactly like a train wreck from which you can not take your eyes off but close. I mean that in the best way possible. The intrigues are many, the twists and turns are enough to fully engage the senses, and the characters are frankly kind. <br /> <br /> I had so much fun with this movie. <br /> <br /> 8.3 / 10 of ... <br /> The Devil :.
