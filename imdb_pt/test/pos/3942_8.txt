This film was adapted from the well-known sutra of Journey to the West, where a monk with his three students seeks to find a lost book regarding the Buddha's teaching. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not as solemn as previous films made according to legend, however, it has managed to bring romance and a fun scene full of humor. <br /> <br /> This real goal of this film revolves around more about the monk who were mostly saved from being eaten by flying demonic creatures. One of his students, the Monkey God managed to get him out of the battle at the crack of time, but was in turn captured by the demons and thrown into the deep throat of a dragon, locked in that particular dungeon. The monk woke up in a small village where he met Mei Yan (the so-called Ugly Serpent's daughter) who fell in love with him at first sight. Though ugly, she did not let her appearance be pushed aside to get to him. However, a quest to rescue his three students soon reveals itself full of obstacles and each of them aggravates with Mei Yan following the monk. The problems deepened and that is where conflicts between relationships get worse. <br /> <br /> The rest of the tale would be left at your disposal, but suffice it to say that this film does not depict the typical plot of the story. book is more for those who want to get a funny and light picture than Journey to the West and the obstacles of love really mean. <br /> <br /> In the end, the whole abstract can be described with just one word, and this is love. The monk was to show the Heavenly Gates, the Heavenly Palace and the Buddha himself how love can overcome even the worst fears of all and considered fit as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of higher powers. <br /> <br /> A wonderfully created and funny act awaits those who purchase this ticket. There would not be, of course, regrets, at least on my side and those who were with me in the movies that day watching the same movie.
