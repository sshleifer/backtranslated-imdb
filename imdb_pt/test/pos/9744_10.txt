Arguably the best serial ever made (no argument here so far) about Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov and the beautiful Dale Arden traveling on a rocket to another universe to save the planet. Along the way, in fascinating, spectacular and action-packed chapters, Flash and his friends along with new friends like Prince Barin, Prince Thun and the incredible King Vultan pool their resources to fight against the evils and armies of the merciless Ming . of Mongo and the betrayal envy of his daughter Priness Aura (now she is a car!). This series is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot, acting and budget - it's miles ahead in those areas. Produced by Universal Studios, it has many antique sets at its disposal like the laboratory suite of The Bride of Frankenstein and the Opera House of The Phantom of the Opera, just to name a few. The production values ​​in general are advanced, in my humblest opinion, in 1936. The costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and top notch. We have hawk-men, shark-men, lion-men, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids and tigrons (oh my!) And many, many other fantastic things. Are all credible and first-rate special effects? No way. But by 1936 most are very impressive. The musical score is incredible and the chapter beginnings are well written, long enough to revitalize the memories of the spectators of the previous chapter, and cleverly marked. Director Frederick Stephani does a great job putting everything together wonderfully and creating a movie worthy of Alex Raymond's comic strip. Finally, the acting is very good in this series. Often serials do not have untalented names around one or two previous talents - here, most people have some ability. Do not get me wrong, this is not a Shakespearean troupe, but Buster Crabbe does a nice job like Flash. He is ably assisted by Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson and the rest of the cast in general with two outstanding artists. But before I get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted, it must have been amazing for this series to get by the Hayes office. I see more meat in Flash and in Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than in films decades later. The Crabbe shorts (and unfortunately for all of us, Professor Zarkov (Frank Shannon)) are wearing a pair of shorts that people can wear. They are wearing medium suits and are absolutely gorgeous Jean Rogers may have limited acting but Lawson too is sensual and beautiful, but to me the two actors who make up the series are Charles Middleton as Ming: offensive, sardonic, ruthless and entertaining. Middleton is a class act. "Tiny" Lipson plays King Vultan: noisy, exciting, hilarious - a symbol of pure joy in life and all the essence of hedonism. Lippson steals every scene he's in. The plot snakes here, there and everywhere - but Flash Gordon is the penultimate series of space operas and the basis for immense scientific fictions to be followed.
