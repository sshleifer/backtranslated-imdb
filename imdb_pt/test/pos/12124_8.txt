First of all, let me say that this is probably in my opinion one of the 10 most underrated movies since this came out in 72. I simply loved this movie, it's very urban, bland, no true Hollywood glamor added to it. you can really feel for all the characters here, I love the blood that just splashes is abundant here. Joe Pesci was very good here but for me it looks like he was definitely outclassed by main character Joe Cortese, now I know nothing about him but the boy can he really act .. I believe this movie is probably true because living in New Jersey, living near Philly, you're here that sort of thing all the time. I think if the film had a bigger budget, and Robert Deniro said as Jerry's boss, you'd have a perfect movie, but who am I to discuss, I was so absorbed in this movie that it's already up there in my with medium streets. I would like Hollywood to return to this urbanized and courageous display of cinema: it would be very good to do so. this movie is a great drama with great actors in it. and I recommend it to everyone.
