The cast for this Rigoletto production is excellent. Edita Gruberova sings magnificently and passionately to Gilda. Luciano Pavarotti also sings splendidly. Vergara is a great Magdalene; Fedora Barbieri is a famous older singer who sings the maid, Giovanna. Weikl sings Marullo; Wixell sings both Rigoletto and Monterone. Like Rigoletto, Wixell is probably the most convincing vocalist in this set of great singers. Kathleen Kuhlmann on Contessa. All directors are well known and world renowned. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting Rigoletto, visually as well as musically. <br /> <br /> I have this on both laser discs and DVD. You should have too!
