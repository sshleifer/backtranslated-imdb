I loved this movie when I was a kid. I saw theatrical. Randy Edelman made a good soundtrack composition. David Seville is the Chipmunks' father and recording manager. The Chipmunks consists of Alvin, who is best known for playing harmonica, Simon who is a brilliant scholar and scholar & Theodore, who is the youngest and is always hungry. There is a lady known as Miss Miller, who takes care of the squirrels and has 3 daughters known as Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor, who have the same character as Chipmunks. My favorite songs from this soundtrack include "Diamond Dolls, The Girls of Rock & Roll," and the ringtone "My Mother." Alvin really wanted to see Europe when Dave had to go there for the deal. playing around the world in 30 days of video games that led them to compete with each other doing the real thing.
