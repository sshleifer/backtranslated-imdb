I'm a big fan of this movie and found the mini-series "Children of the Dust", the version that fans should look for. At least 20 minutes or more are cut into the DVD version of this movie. <br /> <br /> I would also suggest to viewers who liked this film to check out the book, there is a more rounded plot with Corby / Whitewolf and Rachel, more about Black History and Buffalo Solders. There were two stories for the series or for the movie. <br /> Sidney Poitier only shows that he improves with age, the talent continues to increase the chemistry between his character Gypsy Smith and Regina Taylor. I also liked the plot Billy Wirth / Joanna Going, they seem to play against each other as well. <br /> <br /> Billy Wirth is, of course, the "Indiana Vision Model." The look, the attitude, the dream of every woman who wanted to be taken in one of these novels by a native hero. I worked for myself, too. Much more could have been done with this plot, but it gave the viewer a brief glimpse of racial problems in the 1880s, the white ownership of the native school, the lack of black pioneers to set up cities in the west. Michael Moriarty (Maxwell), as always a great actor, appears as a very affectionate and confused teacher, not knowing if the "whites" should be interfering in the native culture. <br /> <br /> For those who like characters and watch them change this movie is for you. I thought the chemistry between Poitier's character and that of the orphan Whitewolf was moving a lot and I thought that Wirth and Poitier worked very well together. Billy Wirth did some of his best scenes while working with Poitier. <br /> <br /> Going sometimes gets on my nerves when you just want to stop and shake it or give it a wake up call. . But overall, it was a great night of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Look for the two-tape version of this miniseries, if you are a fan, you will see the difference.
