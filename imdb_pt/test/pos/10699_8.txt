This is a very silly movie, including what may well be the least erotic ever made to reach the big screen (the heroine dumps the V-8 itself and invites the hero to lick - hey!). And yet, it also features the resplendent Lucinda Dickey in what is by far her most erotic performance. In those days, women - even action heroines - with real muscles were a rarity, and I still remember the way my jaw dropped when Dickey took off his blouse, revealing the most powerful back and biceps females I had ever seen . The beauty and vitality of Dickey lead the film: she could have been a Schwarzenegger if someone had had the vision to promote it.
