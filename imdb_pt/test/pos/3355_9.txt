I saw this movie right out of college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I began to wonder why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. So I remembered - Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Developmental stages, basically the change over time in which part of the body and its assisting stimuli receive our main attention, as well as the change of emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and the background. His next encounter is oral with the dingaling of the Mad Hatter. I forget the rest of the talk and the order of Alice's encounters, but I remember how well they matched. It's interesting to see a skin film with some brains behind it, instead of the clich√©, "I'm here to deliver your pizza. <br /> <br /> I do not see how Kristin DeBell's career could be destroyed by this movie, as was her first film. And Reagan's tiresome hypocrisies had not yet spoiled this land when she was released, but somehow he and his clown Meese affected Miss. DeBell. When Meese was staging her anti-pornography commission (to distract people from her own criminal activities), Meese hired the services of an anti-porn activist named Judith Reisner. Reisner was obsessed with images she perceived as child pornography. She saw the "Alice" cover that DeBell did for Playboy and promptly announced that she had scientifically proven that Ms DeBell was actually a collage of photos of several adult women and the face of a ten-year-old child. Okay, right....
