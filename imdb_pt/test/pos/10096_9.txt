It is a horror film that, while not empty of bloody scenes, depends more on psychology and the masterful construction of tension to create emotions.

They deal poorly with the death of their mother and try to protect a world of them, defending them against the adult world. So the film seems to be in its outermost layer. In fact, the film slowly evolves into something very different, slow pace, but no picture is lost to convey the feeling of exciting beauty, so I will not say much more. Watch, it's one of the best horror movies genres in the Far East that recently conquered the world cinema and really shows that they have managed to do it for good reason.
