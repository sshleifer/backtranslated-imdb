A good movie for horse enthusiasts and most of the rest. It's a horse-racing movie, and it's a "little man has a chance" movie, and it's "how far are you going?" movie. Walter Mattau once again proves his ability to adapt as an actor. It fits just like Lloyd Bourdelle, a Louisiana Cajun bum. This film gives you a rare glimpse of Cajun Louisiana horse racing screen. He has a young quarter horse who is a top race driver. "had nothing but a gas station and a good horse." The Bourdelles take the opportunity to become big, taking the Shadow horse to Ruidoso, New Mexico, to prepare to race in the All-American Futurity. But how far does Lloyd go to gain fame and fortune? Also memorable from this movie are scenes of Lloyd spitting tobacco juice and waiting for your truck to begin.
