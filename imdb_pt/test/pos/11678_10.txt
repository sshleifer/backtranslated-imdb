THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! The decline of Western civilization ...... what a great title eh? And coarse a great movie. This is the best show movie I've ever seen. A close second is the movie Talking Heads "Stop Making Sense". I first heard about this movie when Waynes World came out in 1992. I looked up the name of director Penelope Spheeris and thought in legal name, what else did he direct? I thought the first name was pronounced as envelope. After some time looking at movie guides I came across the acclaimed Decline and realized that Penelope was a woman ..... my mother corrected me. I spent 8 years of my life trying to track this down. I finally saw this on VHS in Vancouver, where I currently live. It was worth the wait. This captures very well the Los Angeles punk movement. This is teen angst in that it is the best personal. My favorite is the Germs band that needs subtitles for the lyrics because Darby Crash sings so crazy that you can not understand. I laughed when I saw this. The band Black Flag lives in an abandoned church and the band X is a very intelligent group. He also laughed at the letter some idiots write to Slash Magazine about how we do not need to save the whales, there are countless miles from the ocean for us to shed toxins! I became a big fan of Penelope Spheeris after that, and I saw all his punk films - Dudes was OK, and Suburbia is a cult classic! I own both on VHS. She's a real underground filmmaker and I love her stuff. I would love to have seen this movie in 1994, when grunge was so popular. I was a big fan of Nirvana at the time but unfortunately I saw that in 2002 and by that time I had grown out of grunge and now I listen to Crystal Method / Fatboy Slim. Quite a change of pace, I know, but what can you do? But if you want a true representation of the punk movement, it captures you better than anything. Much better than 1991: The Year Punk Broke. This is a difficult movie to find, but if you get your hands on it, rent it, even if you do not like the song, it's a great job. Nowadays, it may be easier to discover that the DVD is so popular. Incidentally, Penelope produced a little-known film by Albert Brooks called "Real Life", which I also own. Very funny stuff on today's reality show! Rent Decline ...... Highly recommended! Thank you!
