The trailer does not even come close and only scratches the surface of the film and rightly so, not because it has this obligation to keep its actual narrative a secret, but because what actually happens will provoke entirely different lines of questioning, some of which are frustratingly not answered in the movie, leaving you to your own devices to interpret the series of events. Which, of course, means a lot of material for a post-show discussion. Metaphorically, the box refers to how we, humans, tend to subconsciously submerge ourselves in situations or things in everyday life, and how our closed-minded thoughts tend to see things from a certain perspective, rarely out from the box. There is a speech made near the end by one of the characters who will leave you thinking about this fact, which governs the basis of the whole film, and even threading into existentialism, where our bodies are mere vessels for the soul, and from the cradle to the the grave we put in more boxes in a fashion way of life. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about the movie is how it tried to sound smart through the frequent name falling from secret government agencies like the CIA and NSA, as if there was something openly clandestine about these agencies that we should be aware. They have little purpose other than to put every action and every person under scrutiny, that no one can be trusted, destroying in a sense both the characters and the public, while we try to follow trust problems to aid in the interpretation of the narrative. Having set that up in 1976, against a NASA manned space missions scenario, and in Langley, Virginia, it also provided that sense of caution that will drain your energies as you pass through it with patience. Based on the tale Button, written by Richard Matheson and made into an episode of the Twilight Zone, the story follows the Lewis family, where husband Arthur (James Marsden) works at NASA and develops a foot prosthetic for his wife Professor Norma (Cameron Diaz), and you would think that the whole family is happy with his son Walter (Sam Oz Stone), until one day a mysterious man named Arlington Steward (Frank Langella in a facial effect inspired by two guys) from whom we are eliminated in the opening, come knock and give them a Deal or No Deal button in a box. Dip the button and they'll get a million dollars (we're talking in terms of 70's dollar here), even though a stranger out there dies. If they do not, well, the deal has an expiration date. <br /> <br /> History would settle a deal, which naturally triggers a mysterious sequence of events unfolding, with even more obscure characters (appearing with nose bleeds), some who are inexplicably zombies, seemingly all under the influence, or employment, or Arlington Steward. Whether or not Steward is Death, a clandestine public servant, a messenger of God, or a representative of the aliens after an anal investigation, remains unanswered, then, in any case, it's as if he's delivering something expected, begging humankind to abandon his innate greed so that his work can be stopped and returned to wherever he comes. <br /> <br /> If you need a bit of distraction from the disparate scenes that make up the narrative, production sets and art direction are beautiful in recreating the look of the 70s as you try to uncover the mystery of the consequences that result from not fully understanding the fine print. It is a complete cycle of this examination of human nature, of our greed for immediate gratification, manifesting its result in long-term pain, confusion, and other choices we make on the basis of real sacrifices. Cool special effects come into play too, though it leaves more room for the movie genre. <br /> <br /> So, is it horror, science fiction or a mystery thriller? It's all rolled into one, along with a hint of the philosophical. Just do not expect a straightforward narrative film with clear and easy answers in the end? This is like an episode of X-Files on steroids.
