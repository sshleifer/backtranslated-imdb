This 1955 film assault follows Tony le Stephanois, recently released from prison for robbery, as he assumes the theft of his life. He joins his former assault colleagues and brings in a security expert, Cesar Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also directed. He only directed because he was blacklisted as a communist in the US and could not work in Hollywood.) This movie's brightness is half an hour during the assault. During all this time, there is no dialogue and no music, just soft sounds of digging into the floor or drilling the safe. This increases the suspense and draws you. They get away with several hundred million francs in jewelry, but a jewel offered to a dancer by Cesar attracts the attention of a trio of brutal brothers. They set out to get the inventory for themselves and bring unhappiness to their trail. Great assault / gangster movie, but I prefer J.-P. Melville's films in this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a lemonade I had last night. I had gone to a Caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugarcane juice instead of sugar. It also had lots of ice and was heavy on lemons, making it quite sour (which I like). The sugarcane juice gave it a subtle taste, slightly more ripe than the real sugar, and the ice made it cool and refreshing as I sucked it. 7.5 / 10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
