This is one of the most anti-traditional war movies I've seen. Instead of typical films that emphasize glory and perhaps superhuman characters (such as John Wayne), this film is just the opposite - emphasizing the dehumanization that ALSO happens in the war. The story concerns the Japanese who are imprisoned in the Philippines after the US returned in late 1944 - early 1945. By the time the film begins, the Japanese were clearly defeated, but because of Bushido's insane logic they can not if allowed to consider delivery. In one of many moving moments, the main character is told at the beginning of the film to introduce himself to the hospital, since he is not able to fight because of his tuberculosis. The problem is that the hospital does not accept him, so his commander tells him to go to the hospital one more time - and if they do not accept him, he must blow himself up with a grenade! Well, that happens only in the first five minutes of the movie - much worse things happen to this soldier and the few stragglers because they will not surrender. In addition, there is a case in the movie in which a soldier tries to surrender but is shot dead. This happened much later in the war, because often the Japanese soldiers gave in to explode as they approached. In addition, the film shows the most vivid representation of the hunger and madness of any movie I have seen. In addition, cannibalism, cowardice and betrayal accompany this very bold, realistic and depressingly realistic film. You just could not have made a better movie of that kind. Horrible but great.
