This was the first movie that directed me to the great actor Martin Sheen. He modestly states that Charlie is a better actor, Charlie can not hold a candle to him. <br /> <br /> I found suspense and completely enjoyed the interweaving of the love story with the main plot (and I usually hate Love Stories). There's a twist at the end that seemed totally reliable, particularly in the early 1980s, and probably now as well. <br /> <br /> The final scene left me on the edge of my seat. This film broadly illustrates that betrayal is often granted by those we trust, while the declared enemies have more in common than they suspect, and finally that human compassion can be found where we least expect it.
