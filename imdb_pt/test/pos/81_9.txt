A wild and undisciplined lion was placed behind bars for a circus carnival. Suddenly, he notices a hole in the floor of his cell, then sticks his nose into that hole to inhale it. At first, he thinks the Bugs Bunny house is a camel; however, when he awakens Bugs from his sleep, hoisting him to the ground, there he finds Bugs, his next trainer. <br /> <br /> If you ever wondered how Bugs would turn a wild lion into a Hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts, you should watch this cartoon. Director Bob McKimson offers endless laughter through absurd and unexpected demonstrative humor. <br /> <br /> Signature scenes include: 1 / the look of the Bugs Bunny house, cross reference to Donald Duck with the acronym of the name BB on the bedside of Bugs < <br /> <br /> 2 / Bugs Bunny's little trip with the mine going up to the ground floor <br /> <br /> 3 / When Nero the Lion calls his friend, the Elephant, for help, Bugs uses a toy mouse to scare the elephant; since the Elephant needed a broom to overcome the toy mouse, it uses Nero as a broom! <br /> <br /> 4 / Bugs becoming a clown with the appropriate costume and makeup and the clown jokes he makes <br /> <br /> 5 / Trapeze scene while Nero chases after Bugs <br /> /> <br /> 6 / the famous Human Cannonball scene after which Nero the Lion starts dancing Hawaiian Hula <br /> <br /> The magical moments that keep the Acrobatty Bunny always fresh in our memory: <br /> <1 / When Bugs comes out of his rabbit hole, he thinks he's in the Pinocchio story; and begins to act to save Pinocchio from the giant's whale's stomach <br /> <br /> 2 / When the lion roars to scare him, Bugs responds back to him with roar <br /> <br /> 3 / Bugs arguing with the Lion because he's making so much noise, then finding a piece of wood to rub it against the iron bars while singing to make more noise than he <br /> <br /> 4 / Wearing rubber heels in the circus, Insects start jumping like toy rabbits and makes Nero jump! <br /> <br /> These are the top 10 reasons why Acrobatty Bunny is a Bugs Bunny classic and can be found in the Bugs Bunny Classics of MGM / UA Video (1989).
