A criminally short show that spawned three spin-offs (Naked Gun 1, 2 and 3), this is a fast-fire comedy that has more hits than mistakes. Leslie Nielsen plays detective-lieutenant-sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent detective who fumbles and wanders around with his boss's assistant, Captain Ed Hocken. The lines of the story are spurious at best, but they are deliberate, since goodness here is not in the narrative, but in the interweaving of a constant wave of jokes along with some genuinely strange characters and wonderful <br /> <br /> The jokes themselves come in many forms, whether word games, antics, puns or background jokes, most of them getting to the point, although a few dropped a little. It is inevitable that with this' gag approach every few seconds, some will fail, but the ratio is good. <br /> <br /> The characters are a delight. From the guest star of the week dying in the opening seconds of each episode, the lab scientist who seems to be conducting cruel and unusual experiments on children to the brilliance of shoes that is some form of oracle, writing is witty and sharp as a cleaver. <br /> <br /> Although not particularly successful at the time, he quickly developed a cult following group, many blaming the relative lack of success of the shows to be ahead of their time and too sophisticated for the target audience , among them none other than Matt 'The Simpsons' Groening: and he should know. <br /> <br /> Dated by today's standards, if you can see through that aspect, you are in for a treat.
