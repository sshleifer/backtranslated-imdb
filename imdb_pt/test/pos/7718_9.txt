I just came back from seeing this brilliantly funny movie. <br /> <br /> Granted, part of the reason I loved was because I could point people and places I knew ('I walk there every day!', I work there! ',' I had drinks there ! ',' hey, that's our mailman! 'etc ...). but still, if you're in the mood to feel good with a little spice (sorry pun) - that's the right answer. relationships, culture and, most importantly, love are all entwined within the plot. <br /> <br /> With preston (where the movie is set) recently being made a city, it is good to see that work presenting the place and adding to the feeling of surprise. is also a brilliant representative of the many cultures in this northern part. <br /> <br /> Fabulous!
