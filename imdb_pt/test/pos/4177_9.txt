Head should have been a proud moment not only for his stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or for his director / co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also for his other co-writer Jack Nicholson . As it is, most of them seem to avoid it, and for outsiders the movie is considered, at best, as a curiosity. <br /> <br /> Although the TV series has been famous based on the antics of the Beatles '' Help! ', This movie is also judged by the same agreement. However, away from the banal and overly overrated films of the Beatles, and even from the dated Monkees T.V. series, Head has a depth layer. A current of the dark nature of man is at work here, and although this may sound like a bizarre thing to say about a manufactured pop band, the use of certain themes and images (beating women, laughing at cripples and real scenes of a Vietcong ) POW shot dead at point-blank range) give the film an advantage that many "serious" movies would not dare to aspire to. <br /> <br /> There are also fun times, ranging from the parodies of James Bond to 'Big Victor' and my personal favorite, Mickey Dolenz under beseige by Arab soldiers on horseback. (One of them turns to Mickey and whistles 'pssst!', Just for the 'pssst!' Appear in captions!) The group is aware of their image made in the movie ('I am the dummy, Mickey I am always the mannequin' , says Tork, summarizing his unilateral role in the series), meaning that his characters? do they play "themselves" acting and not acting here? are more open and consequently less generic and irritating than they were in the series. This level of parody and self-awareness comes to assume its fabulous origins, with more subtle interpretations of the Maharishi and sincere thanks to a waitress who asks, "Well, if it is not a gift from God to the eight. years old?? Are you still paying tribute to Ringo Starr? Also listen to Tork whistling 'Strawberry Fields Forever' while in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Then there are the songs, of course. Six of them here, a little more psychedelic than normal, which may have alienated their fan base, and even a special participation of Frank Zappa would not have drawn an adult audience to their charms at this time. Probably the best is the charming "As We Go Along," although the first, a song inspired by Carol King, talks about the desire to live while time is passing ruthlessly and death is approaching. On a lighter note, his chorus "The dolphin is laughing" seems to be a direct take of "I am the Walrus". Constantly inventive with direct references to silent movies and drug culture, perhaps Head's best feature is its narrative structure. Is not it the only ?? but the most important ?? which is why it improves with multiple views, the story goes to the left, to the right, to the front, to the back, to the circular and through various levels of reality. In essence, a series of sketches has loosely attached, its cohesion is reinforced by the challenging space-time storyline that unites its internal logic through flashback, dream sequence, mind prisoner and remote control channel changer. With a perfect beginning and end, this smart, intelligently written film was not what the Monkees pre-adolescent audience was expecting and subsequently suffered a critical negative reception. Now these expectations are gone, this urgently needs a serious reevaluation.
