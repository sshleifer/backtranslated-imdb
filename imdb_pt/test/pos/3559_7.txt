Rewarding killer George Hilton, the suave Mexican bandit Gilbert Roland (who is great) and bank representative Edd Byrnes try to trick each other as they seek out a large amount of gold from one of Roland's train robberies that was hidden by a treacherous member of his gang. <br /> <br /> While not the best the genre has to offer, it's still light-hearted enough with lots of light action-packed fun and a satisfying ending. Any Gun Can Play is mainly remembered for its opening where George Hilton knocks out three bandits similar to Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Django. The following year, Hilton and Roland met with Van Heflin. and Klaus Kinski at the highly recommended The Ruthless Four.
