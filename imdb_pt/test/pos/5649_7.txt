I saw this in 1993 on a VHS tape, but I have not been able to find it in any source ever since. This is a very somber and uncompromising look in the last days of the Japanese army in the Philippines. Anyone who has an interest in the Pacific war would do well to watch this movie and see what conditions the other side fought. As far as I can tell, this is historically accurate and shows how easily men can plunge into complete barbarism. I understand that the Japanese army was completely cut off from any refueling in the Philippines until 1945, so there is no doubt that many of the terrible incidents described here happened. I might not have been able to identify with the characters in the movie, but I appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive. If I had to compile a list of the top ten war movies, this movie would be about him. See if you can.
