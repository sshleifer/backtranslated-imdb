I found this one to be more chaotic than the short medium Stooges (strange as that may seem). There were several funny parts, especially the jokes in progress ("Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!"), The glass door cracking, the Stooges running into the supplies room and coming back with ... well, you know), but also a little of it all was taken up with things that just did not make sense to me. I have to assume that these were generally taking off scenes from the movie "Men In White", but since I do not know much about this movie I can not say for sure. Maybe if someone could explain this, I would appreciate this short more.
