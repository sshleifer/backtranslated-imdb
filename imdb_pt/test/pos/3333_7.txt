"The Saint Takes Over" starring George Sanders as Simon Templar, also known as "The Saint" in this 1940s entry in the series. Also starring Wendy Barrie, Jonathan Hale and Paul Guilfoyle. On board the ship en route to the USA, The Saint finds himself and tries to make time with a woman (Wendy Barrie) who gives him the brush. Simon is coming to New York to help Inspector Fernack, now totally discredited due to a gangster scheme; $ 50,000 were found in his home. The gangster, Rocky (Roland Drew), of course, was found innocent at the trial, and he and his mafia members pay the bill for the board and lawyer - $ 90,000 in total. Today you need this to defend yourself from a parking ticket. This was a homicide rap. Rocky sends his bodyguard, Pearly Gates (Guilfoyle) to the attorney's house to steal the $ 90,000 from the vault. The lawyer catches you red-handed and sends you back to your boss with a message. Seconds later, he's dead. Rocky finds a similar fate. And so on - who is killing this gang of gangsters? The Holy One has to ask one of them to tell Fernack to be released - can he reach someone before he is murdered? The woman he met aboard the ship reappears and figures prominently in the case. <br /> <br /> Few actors have a way with a line like George Sanders, and his dry wit, good looks, smooth voice and depth as actor suit Simon Templar perfectly. Paul Guilfoyle provides a bit of humor like the nervous, drinking milk, Pearly Gates, and Jonathan Hale is great as Inspector Fernack, sometimes exasperated but worried. Wendy Barrie, who has appeared in many episodes of Saint, is very good as the woman who catches Simon's heart. <br /> <br /> Very nice.
