"Children of wax" also shown as "Killing grounds" is an interesting mix of genres. Some may think that gender purity may be just for good, but to me the eclectic symbioses are very amusing. It is also in its history the mixture of suspense and popular action, as well as the combination of the historical masterpiece with the ethnic appeal for tolerance. This movie is built with the starring presence of my favorite actor the perfect Armand Assante, but is also marked by the acting of a shooting star? Hal Ozan. We saw him recently on the HBO TV show called "Sex." "Children of wax" is entertainment for the public, but at the same time it has an eternal morality for ethnic tolerance. This is a wise way to seminar the welfare. Discussion on the contemporary problems of our day can be made with attractive means on this side is very positive of the movie "Children of wax".
