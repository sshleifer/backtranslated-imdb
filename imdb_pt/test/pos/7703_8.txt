One of the most macabre, depressing and revealing documents. I watched in a while. There is no narration or story to tell, just a "third eye" type camera following two couples of heroin addicts in New York during the seasons. Watch them fling themselves on the floor of the public restrooms, then "clean" their needles in the public toilets ... sometimes it's a bit much and you need to take a break just to take a breath. <br /> <br /> Anyone currently on alcohol recovery / drug addiction should watch this when they are craving it - it really shows for what you might be coming back for! After seeing this, it's a wonder how one could even try this drug to begin with. <br /> <br /> The only thing I needed was a follow up at the end to tell where these people are today. Judging from what is shown in the document, there is no hope for any of them. They mention that they want to improve and give up, but it seems that the only end of their habits is to stop death. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not for everyone. I found myself watching a car accident - after I started watching it I just could not turn it off. I had to keep watching with a dark / morbid fascination of what it's like inside the life of these addicts.
