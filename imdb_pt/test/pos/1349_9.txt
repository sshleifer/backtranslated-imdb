This is a movie, which has all the basic elements of the genre. It makes you want to cry, makes you laugh, makes you angry, makes you angry, etc. <br /> <br /> The subject of the story is fortunately not about some disease or drug, what is the common trend in gay themed movies these days, but focuses on the social interactions between the characters that could be considered as not belonging to the high school elite. The piece and the direction may be a bit more sophisticated, but on the other hand it is better because it shows the distress of the characters they are experiencing. If this was planned, then this is a remarkable job and certainly an achievement, especially for a young director. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's a good story that gives you a little insider, what it's like to be a fat girl and recognize it for yourself.
