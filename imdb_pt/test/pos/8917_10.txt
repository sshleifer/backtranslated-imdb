Do not be fooled: this is no longer a weary example of the Girls of Sideral Space pretending to be the French ski team that comes to Earth to collect the same type of sperm possible, although the synopsis may suggest otherwise. This film is a jewel, an absolute gem that enriched my life from the moment I set my eyes on it. Hilary, stimulating, action-packed and incredibly erotic, "Ach joden mir noch einen" is a Tour-De-Force Euro-Madcap, a Bavarian classic grossly underestimated. <br /> <br /> Stop whatever you're doing and rush to rent, or better yet, buy this movie right away.
