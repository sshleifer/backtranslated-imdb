When I first saw this on tape, about 10 years after it was released, I thought it was one of the best James Bond films. However, after seeing it again at the turn of the century, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think it's a little overrated just because critics were so happy to see Sean Connery end his 12-year hiatus by playing Bond. that they did not dare criticize the film. I guess what disappointed me was the end. After investing two hours in the film, you expect a less mushy and more satisfying ending. And it can be difficult, but I was disappointed not to see the regular actors in the supporting roles, like Miss Moneypenny, Q, Felix Leiter, etc. On the plus side, there were many unique action scenes, particularly at the beginning, and the two villains were interesting. I thought Klaus Maria Brandauer was the more intriguing of the two because he was so discreet and looked like the "cool guy next door." He was not her normal Bond villain. <br /> <br /> That had enough "skin" for a PG movie, especially with Kim Basinger starring, never being an actress known to hide her figure. The language was very docile, but most of the James Bond films are very good in this department. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a "fair" Bond and nothing more. Just because Connery is in it, that does not mean it's automatically good. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan proved they could play the role well.
