"Side Show" is one of the strangest horror movies ever made by Full Moon Pictures. Very bloody in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it be (The trailer for this movie shows all the bloody parts). In addition, visual effects and interpretation are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of such horror movies should check out the Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp and other Full Moon Pictures .
