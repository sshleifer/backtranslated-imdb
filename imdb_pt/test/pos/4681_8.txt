The Italian Job is a real blast to watch. It's a genuinely entertaining film, something you watch for pure delight. It is not heavy with drama or emotional, has no cosmic statements about life, and is not violent or profane. It's just a fun movie. Between watching the tiny Mini Coopers flying through the crowded streets of Los Angeles and the large pieces of geek-turned-crook stereotyped computer (played happily by Seth Greene), I had a great time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Special congratulations to the background music. They really set a masterful tone for such a movie, so subtle, but that keeps you on edge when necessary. Apparently many artists contributed to the song, I thought it was the most respected part of the film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. It's not inspiring but a great movie to watch at the end of a movie. Bad day at the office. <br /> <br /> Barky
