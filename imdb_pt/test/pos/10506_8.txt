This movie undoubtedly does not go well with some, because most of the horror is mental. But there's something for almost everyone, including some really cool abduction scenes with aliens. The film makes extensive use of alien abduction mythology, while also showing a bit more intelligence about some facets of the abduction myths than you would expect from a movie. Jillian McWhirter is excellent at what should have been a tiresome performance.
