This was one of those movies that I always found (whether on TV or on a cheap DVD), but it never impressed me when I thought I was not losing too much. Was it on a night and I thought oh well? Why not. A good decision too, how would I kick myself for taking so long to get around to it. For me, that impressed me as it is up there with Burt Reynold's best features ('Deliverance', 'White Lightning' and 'Boogie Nights') and back to the 70s / 80s thrillers of urban hard and difficult crime who were not afraid. to be obscure and obscure, to create characters, to pack it with a brutal force and realistically incorporate the local places (Atlanta being the case here) to the grounded photograph fold. In certain tones, it kind of reminded me of 'Dirty Harry', but that's loosely. However, it's a sharp blues score with his teasing kicks, fun shifts and unbalanced sounds, very much made me think of the pulsating punctuation of Lalo Schifrin that he orchestrated for 'Dirty Harry'. The soundtrack to music, on the other hand, is unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Sergeant. Tom Sharky was a narcotic agent of the Atlantic before a slip during a bust having demoted him to the vice job. Along with their new squadron, they are faced with a ring of prostitution, which attracts their interest, due to the fact that it belongs to a crime lord who is difficult to follow and condemn. What they dug up involves a prominent government figure and a program girl who can give them some important names but they should get to her before she is a target. The acts of Burt Reynold, but also direct an uncompromisingly firm and muscular form that would combine with his laconic performance and the thematically hard and rigid script of Gerald Di Pego (adapted from William Diehl's novel) . Well, it shows a kind of heart / insightful thoughts between the armor inside the scenes involving the British actress Rachel Ward, be the staging scenes when he is looking at her from another building (and slowly becoming infatuated with her) to when they finally come together, but these last half-way interactions slow the momentum, but give it noir as blows. The performances are quite accurate with Reynold's formulating a great relationship with the exceptional actors Charles Durning, Earl Holliman, Brian Keith, Richard Libertini and Bernie Casey. The blunt profanity and witty dialogue between these guys was a blast. As for corrupt villains, Vittorio Gassman builds imposing power and power, but it's Henry Silva (who seems to have been born to these roles), an ingeniously insightful and uncontrollable way of doing the show. Where your appearance seems to outline things to come and help them fit together. In addition, his cat-and-mouse climax full of adrenaline and violent with Sharky and his team is brilliantly done. <br /> <br /> Exciting action passages can be quick and dry, but remain lethally violent as an immensely difficult interrogation sequence. . Some useful and old techniques of filming increase suspense. The intriguing material keeps him fairly tactical, being derived from character, but when we think of his smooth navigation, he offers a blunt surprise or two along with some intensely difficult clashes.
