I have fond memories of watching this visually stunning movie as a child in the late 70's and early 80's on wor-tv (now upn-9) in NY. Despite being a product of the 60's, this movie has hardly aged. The effects are as wonderful as 2001 and, to some extent, superior (the model's work is impeccable). With an attractive cast, great color photography and set design, and an evocative score, JTTFSOTS is a winner!
