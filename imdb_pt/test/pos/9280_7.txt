Um ... a serious movie about troubled teens in Singapore, a country I do not know much about, but I have the prior impression that all children are highly disciplined and controlled by their family and government. Well, I think I'm wrong, just like other cities / countries, they also have their troubled teens who also lead the not so amazing rebel way of life, drugs, fights, bad language, and .... many other obvious signs of being a bad boy. The amazing part of this movie is not really about how these kids run around causing themselves and others problems, but rather the subtle homosexuality hidden behind their so-called loyalty between them. The bond between these "siblings" may well have originated from an unconscious gay tendency within these boys. While it's not uncommon for str8 guys to have a close friendship, but watch this movie closely, he must be attending all kinds of gay film festivals and I would not be surprised if he could win much more prizes for this direction!
