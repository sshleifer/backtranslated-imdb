First of all, I would like to start by saying that it is a refreshing beginning to see a British drama that finally seems believable. Patrick Stewart plays the role of justice as (Ian Hood), the government science advisor, with his constant and unshakable views on authority and thoughts about the future of "real world" science "and how he feels. being used or abused by others. <br /> <br /> Not only is the cast fully maintained throughout the Series, but it makes the characters look more believable than most other British Drammes. Ashley Jensen also offers a first-class performance as Dr. Hood's (Rachael Young) bodyguard, she brings a refreshing insight into everyday, unscientific and disinterested visions of science, and her constant struggle with Hood makes some very funny and memorable moments between them. <br /> <br /> The way the series keeps all the scientific elements more realistic. I consider it positive and more engaging than the psychology we are accustomed to on other TV programs of Fiction or Science Fiction. . There are, however, notable disappointments with the series, every time an episode ends, I am disappointed that they do not seem to cover every aspect of the plot, and sometimes leaving open stories open . <br /> <br /> Although we keep in mind that this is still the first series, I hope we will come back to form in the near future, where these open stories can finally have a meaningful conclusion that they so deservedly deserve. <br /> <br /> For those who like slower science-related plots, this is the ideal program to watch, since it can always be convincing and more important to the point.
