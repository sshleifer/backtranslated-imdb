Okay, I must admit, I like Peter Liapis a bit and I admit that this is not the best sequel to Ghoulies. I mean, yes, it had its faults, like NO GHOULIES. But the two Ghoulies who came ashore were really funny, I think they were called, Dark and Lite. I liked the plot of the movie. And even at the end of the film, both Ghoulies suggested there would be a sequel. Still waiting. I laughed a lot. Peter Liapis reprized his role as Jonathan Graves, this time playing a detective, how cute! Ghoulies IV may not be scary or full of suspense, but it's definitely funny. I thought about commenting on this movie and just saying - it's not that bad. Worth watching, even if the Ghoulies are not in it.
