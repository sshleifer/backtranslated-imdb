The first time I saw this great movie and Alyssa, my star *, playing Frances Ella Fitz, was very good in this movie! It was so real and your puppy so cute! I first saw it when I was 11 and it was the best movie I've ever seen, and you know what? I still think so! 10/10 ********** = Greatest of all!
