First, what are some of you thinking? This is the best movie I've seen in ages! <br /> <br /> Secondly - I do not think of it as a British film as it is set in Dublin and has mainly Irish actors - Moran, Gambon, Aisling The Sullivan (Rita), Deirdre O'Kane etc. <br /> <br /> Third, I thought Moran was excellent. He was funny hilarious from the outside. Micheal Caine seemed to be just there to get the context of Moran. Each character he assumed perfected. <br /> <br /> Abigail Iversen I thought I was better than any other child actor I've seen. She was believable as the smart kid and also as a child and an adult (yes, I know this sounds weird, but hey ...). Even she managed to obfuscate Caine. <br /> <br /> Iversen and Moran worked very well together and were very funny on the preparation scene. <br /> <br /> Barreler (Gambon) was very funny in his ineptitude.
