I think I like this movie as well as any I know; is not perfect, but under the title "The Americanization of Lily," this charming and memorable semi-musical satire that I suggest was most appreciated, and still loved by those who recognized his special spirit of kindness produced by Blake Edwards, and solid narrative. The unlikely but delightful story follows Lili Smith, a spy of the marginal type for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lili Schmidt passing by as Smith is helping his uncle who is also a patriot to Germany, but neither cruel nor political, just opportunistic. Lili's target is William Larrabee, a leader of the US charismatic squad who can provide valuable information. The plot becomes complicated when Lili falls in love with Larrabee, has her eyes open to the consequences of her spy role, and sees the effects of fighting on wounded men in a hospital and realizes what that might mean for her men whom she has known and liked . She becomes jealous of a rival for Larrabee's affection, then realizes that she can no longer do what she is doing and gives up the espionage business. The logical end of the film comes when, after the terrible World War I, when she sings the theme song from the movie, "Wishing" in a dark theater, one by one the members of the Larrabee squad appear, including the lover himself, indicating that they forgave her and her former opponents; and even Uncle Kurt joins enthusiastically to the chant of "It's a long to tipperraree," to indicate that all is well with the world again. This is an audacious brilliant story idea and sometimes written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of the fame of "John Goldfarb"; and it is a delightful narrative. Larrabee's squadron, including an inebriated one that keeps beating and other kind guys people this movie alive; and the feel of this sleek and brilliant film is almost epic, both in its scope and in its accomplishment. Credit should go to Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for his costume designs, Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for sets, Fernando Carrere for another handsome production design, Henry Mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score, and for Russell Harlan for his brilliant cinematography . In the beautiful filming, the main actors are Julie Andrews as Lili, Rock Hudson as Larrabee, Keremy Kemp as Lili's Uncle Kurt, Michael Witney, Lance Percival as inebriated pilot, Gloria Paul as Lili's rival, and many other great actors. in smaller parts. It's hard to say enough good things about the rhythm, or the cleverness of comedy from side to side; this element is introduced by Edwards to give vent to the horrors of the real war, as for example the almost comic-opera approach with which the men made war in an era of more naive civilization. This comedy also helps pave the way for Lili's conversion. from the uncritical acceptance of a duty to the German state to the acceptance of the reality of what it is doing and potentially what it may be causing. This is a rare "life-like" film about Lili's "Americanization," her affirmation of herself in the real world, and then others, before the tragedy can happen. It's amazing, I find it beautiful in many ways. I consider it to be the main work of Blake Edwards to direct; and under the title "The Americanization of Lili," I believe that with almost all the changes that could have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film, it conforms to all standards I know of.
