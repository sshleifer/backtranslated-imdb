I agree with the comments already posted on this site by the previous appraiser. <br /> <br /> I first came across this movie in the '80s when I was working in a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, many of the psychiatric barbs hit the home. I especially liked the ending, where the psychiatrist spoke through Grodin's hospital door. Believe me, it's pretty accurate. <br /> <br /> It is clear that doors in most psychiatric hospitals are not locked, nor are they used today, and any hospital MUST be licensed to have a "padded room." but a wonderfully underrated film, and certainly one that is quite entertaining. <br /> Jeff
