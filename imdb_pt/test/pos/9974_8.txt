"The Merchant of Venice" is one of Shakespeare's best-known plays and is still regularly featured in the theater. Unbelievably, though, this movie seems to be the first English-language version made for the movies and not for television. There were a number of versions made in Britain or America during the early days of cinema, but all of them were silent. <br /> <br /> The reason for this neglect of the piece may be related to the sensitivities about the alleged alleged play. anti-Semitism, a subject that has been all the more sensitive since the Nazis' rise to power in 1933. (This may explain why all previous versions were made during the era of silence: in 1908 or 1922, it would have been easier to portray Shylock as a simple villain than it would today). However, in my opinion, the film is not anti-Semitic. It must be remembered that during Shakespeare's life there was no established Jewish community in England; the Jews had been expelled by Edward I in the late thirteenth century, and were not allowed to return until the time of Cromwell, about forty years after Shakespeare's death. As far as we know, Shakespeare has never traveled abroad, so it seems quite possible that he has never personally known any Jew or experienced the effects of anti-Semitism firsthand. The play is not simply about the Jewish question, but is, among other things, an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudice. It may, in fact, be a coded examination of mutual antipathy between Catholics and Protestants in Tudor England (something Shakespeare certainly would have firsthand experience) and an appeal for greater tolerance among them. So, as now, traditional anti-Semitic stereotypes have always described the Jews as greedy, but Shylock's chief sin is not avarice; if he were, he would certainly have accepted Bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducats, double the amount borrowed by Antonio. On the contrary, the sin that besets Shylock is anger, and the root of his anger is the way in which he and his fellow Jews are treated by the Christians of Venice. Not only are Jews seen as second-class citizens, but Jewish lenders, like Shylock, are specific targets of abuse, although the services they provide are necessary to the Venetian economy. The play shows the corrupting effects of prejudice. Not only do such visions corrupt Christians who hold them, they can also corrupt Jews who are abused. Shylock's revenge is disproportionate to the damage he suffered. Spitting on him and calling him a dog, Antonio behaves like an intolerant and rude man, but rudeness and intolerance are generally not considered crimes worthy of the death penalty. In addition, Shylock seeks revenge on Antony not only for the undoubted errors that Antonio made in relation to him, but also for all the errors, real and imaginary, that he suffered at the hands of the Christian community, as the marriage of his daughter. for Lorenzo. <br /> <br /> It is to the credit of movie director Michael Radford and his star, Al Pacino, that they understand all of these issues. Pacino's Shylock initially has a kind of angry dignity about him that gradually gives way to vengeful rage, and finally, after his humiliation in the scene of judgment by Portia's reasoning, to pathos. We clearly see that he has been the instrument of his own destruction, but we can still sympathize with him. In my view, none of Pacino's performances I have ever seen matched those he gave in the first two 'Godfather' films (not 'Perfume of a Woman' for which he won an Oscar, and certainly not 'Godfather III' ). , but 'The Merchant of Venice is the closest to these benchmarks. The other acting performance that stood out was the bright Portia of Lynn Collins, speaking her lines with great clarity and simplicity and bringing the intelligence and resourcefulness that make her character more than simply a romantic heroine. I was less impressed with Jeremy Irons' Antonio, who seemed very passive. Antonio is a complex character; part loyal friend, melancholic contemplative part, part religious fanatic and part entrepreneurial capitalist. Although Irons captured the first two aspects, it was difficult to imagine his Antonio spitting on someone of a different faith or risking everything in risky business ventures. Radford's interpretation of the play was attacked by the Daily Telegraph film critic who, while admiring Pacino's performance, disliked the period and argued that Shakespeare needs to be placed in a contemporary setting if it is to have "relevance" for a modern audience, citing a recent stage production that defined action in Weimar Germany. I would strongly disagree with this approach. Theater and cinema are quite different media, and although there have been some impressive modernist approaches to Shakespeare in cinema (Trevor Nunn's 'Night of Kings' comes to mind), a traditionalist approach is often the best. (I preferred, for example, "Romeo and Juliet," by Zeffirelli, to Baz Luhrmann's). The idea that we can only appreciate Shakespeare in a modern way is pure intellectual laziness; we are not prepared to make the effort to see our greatest writer in the context of the Elizabethan society that produced it, but rather to prefer that he be seen as a substitute man of the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Radford's traditional approach not only allows us to appreciate that fanaticism and revenge are ancient and universal problems, but also contributes to a visually stunning film. In the play, the scenes set in Venice are characterized by a turbulent action; those at the Portia Villa in Belmont are happier and more peaceful. In the film, external Venetian scenes were filmed on the spot against the gray, misty winter skies, similar to the look of "Do not Look Now." The candlelit interiors, with brightly lit faces against a dark background, recalled the effects of the chiaroscuro of a Caravaggio painting; I suspect this was quite deliberate, since Caravaggio was a contemporary of Shakespeare. In contrast to dark or misty Venice, the scenes of Belmont (filmed in a charming Palladian villa on an island on a lake) were characterized by sunlight or moonlight. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best adaptations of Shakespeare in recent years; a clever and visually appealing look at a complex game. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Some mistakes. We see a black swan in the water in front of Portia's house. These birds are native to Australia and were not introduced into Europe until well after 1596, the date the film was filmed. In addition, Portia's portrait in the lead coffin is painted in the style of the Florentine Botticelli, who was active about a century before that date. Lynn Collins may be reminiscent of a Botticelli beauty, but it seems unlikely that a late-sixteenth-century Venetian lady would paint herself in the manner of late-fifteenth-century Florence.
