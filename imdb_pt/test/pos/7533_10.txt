"Nagisa no Shindobaddo" or "Like Grains of Sand" is an incredibly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls dealing with the state of becoming one with who they are. This movie is not about homosexuality, but it is about sexuality. <br /> <br /> Aihara, a distant girl, will definitely make viewers ponder who is behind the indifferent girl. Does she love Yoshida? Or does she love Ito? Or has she somehow become a lesbian because of the "incident"? (I doubt it). <br /> <br /> And Yoshida? Does he realize that he loves Ito in the end? Well, we all know he loves you as a friend. But you will never know when you see this movie ... haha ​​:) In the end, Aihara (along with Ito) delivers an exceptional message to the public: what does it matter if you love a boy or a girl. And I have to tell you, I'm so dense that I did not understand at first. ^^ ;; It's because of the whole of no conversation scenes ... You have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and NOT for what they say (especially the final part ... phew, boy, that was confusing !) It's a confusing story, but it's beautiful anyway. :) This movie is certainly one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen (and trust me, I've seen a lot).
