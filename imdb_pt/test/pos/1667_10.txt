To perform a job like this on Rififi (for example, The Score and its opinions), you need to have nerves of steel. This apparently demands and commands this. Jules Dassin is the master. <br /> <br /> I was on the edge of my seat everywhere. It deserves to be better known, although it was not at the time of its release in 1954, due, it is supposed, to the fact that the director was on the hypocritical Hollywood blacklist of his day. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who does not have the pleasure of seeing it. <br /> <br /> I can not give enough stars.
