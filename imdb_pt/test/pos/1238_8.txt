(A WARNING - CONTAINS SOFT SPOILER) A movie almost made to make you stop and check your memory - is confined to an almost empty motel where the huge courtyard resembles a circus and the rooms seem to be temporary retreat points rather than refuges; As the characters become increasingly preoccupied with the past, the present disappears more and more, until the Countess's last incendiary appearance on the black Mercedes marks the fusion of reality and fantasy. Whether their stories are true or not, and whether Stanton is truly the father or just a wacky old man getting into their stories, it seems impossible to determine. The theme seems to be how love of an extreme and inconsiderate nature messes up stability to the point where reality itself falls apart; where the exotic and lost fantasy becomes dangerously tangible. The image of the burning motel - a symbol of displacement devastated by destruction - is an appropriately strange ending to this strange yet effective, surprisingly imaginative film.
