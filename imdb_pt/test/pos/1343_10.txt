One of the best memories of my childhood. Must be on DVD. It captured everything we grew up in the seventies - peace, softness, flower power and great acoustic music. The two hosts, Carol and Paula, were the definitive peacenik hippies, with long hair, peasant blouses and bell-bottoms (they looked like a Katherine Ross (The Graduate) and Ali McGraw (Love Story) <br /> <br /> They made us happy with chucklepatch jokes, gave us lessons about being cool through conversations with the garden squirrel, and entertained us with their guitar music. Carol was also the original Sandy in the original production of "Grease." <br /> <br /> This show must be in a time-of-the-time capsule that would also include: "The Yellow Submarine", "Arrow to the Sun "and" Marlo Thomas "," Free to Be ... You and Me ", also," Sunshine "and" The Point ". <br /> <br /> And last but not least, that theme song: "So long, we hope you had a good and good time, ah ha, glad we have to say good morning to you, I hope we can see you from on See ya, See ya, happy you could stay a little, ah ha, I hope we see you again, see you, see you later.
