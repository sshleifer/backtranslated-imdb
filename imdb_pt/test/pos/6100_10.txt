Spoiler Alert I worked as an extra on this Lifetime TV movie (filmed in Seattle). It's really interesting when you participate in the production of a movie, because usually they are still in the process of writing parts (as was the case here) or making editing cuts and major changes in the final parts. My husband and I worked as extras in this movie, and I remember them arguing on set as it was yet to be determined whether the girl dies or not in the end. Frankly, I never thought that Margaret Colin's character really had adequate punishment for the crime of running over, lying to the police, covering up, etc. Could you imagine how the ending would have to change if she had just killed the success and fled? victim rather than end up coming out of the coma well? Just something to think about. <br /> <br /> By the way, I play a police detective you can see for a fraction of a second and my husband plays another detective you can see quite often (we counted four times). Margaret Colin was great to work with and very down to earth, although Lisa Vidal (now a regular in life) was indifferent. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie turned out to be about 7/10, but as another poster commented, it's still a real tear-jerker and makes a great movie on Saturday afternoon.
