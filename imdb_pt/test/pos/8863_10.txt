The Thing by John Carpenter is the best horror movie ever made. Not only that, but it's also one of my all-time favorite movies. What makes the movie so good? It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything seems to work on The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions when everything seems to fit. The film is even superior to Alien in creating a kind of moody atmospheric hell. The fact that it's not just about gore (which is wonderful by the way), but is capable of creating an unparalleled paranoia in movies. A truly wonderful film that is loved by all horror fans and anyone who has good taste in movies.
