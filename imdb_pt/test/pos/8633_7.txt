Having read a lot of negative things about this movie over the years, I've always avoided it, but the advent of the cheap public domain DVD encouraged me to finally get a vision. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was transferred from a poor copy. The modern prequel, filmed on tinted paper, is blurry and the contrast non-existent. Faces are occasionally difficult to understand. That said, the current story is fun and Lou appears as a talented actor, more than in many of the boys' films. <br /> <br /> When the movie changes to the story of 'Jack', the film changes to 'color' and I use that term freely. Most shades are orange or brown. The greens look particularly bad. Dorothy Ford as 'Polly', the giant's maid, was a big plus for me as I liked her in an early appearance of 'Andy Hardy'. <br /> <br /> With so many negative comments attributed to the actual quality of the print, I am still happy to give this film a 7. This gave me a lot of laughter and this is more than the vast majority of comedies I've watched over decades can manage. <br /> <br /> One to watch if you have the chance.
