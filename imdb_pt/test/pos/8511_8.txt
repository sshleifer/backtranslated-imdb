Although Never Say Never Again (NSNA) has a weak soundtrack, it is far superior to its competition at the time, "Octopussy." Never Say Never Again is an upgraded and improved version of Thunderball (Connery's least popular linking movie). NSNA is rich in clever dialogue, insight, intelligence, sexual appeal and one of the best and most compelling villains in the Bond series. In addition, NSNA features a talented and beautiful young Kim Basinger. British comedy fans will also recognize the actor (Attwood), known as "Mr. Bean". I would not trade any of Moore's pictures for that one. However, previous efforts of Connery / Bond (with the exception of "Thunderball") are superior. <br /> <br />
