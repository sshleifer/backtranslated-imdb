I thought I'd witnessed every wrinkle the crime / gangster film had to offer, but the Garrett-Marcin-Hammett combination produced some genuine thrills and surprises here, thanks to Mamoulian's vigorously vigorous steering, Lee Garmes atmospheric photography, remarkably sharp film editing and impeccable special effects. Brilliant acting also helps. Coop presents one of his most compelling performances as the disguised cashmere smuggler (the kind of character progression he should repeat in other roles, like Sergeant York). Miss Sidney (center photo) in her first major role is also a big surprise. The directors receive great support from Paul Lukas, Wynne Gibson and Stanley Fields as the heavyweights, and even Robert Homans' detective. The film was obviously carried out on an extensive budget that is brilliantly deployed in its realistic and crowded sets of public.
