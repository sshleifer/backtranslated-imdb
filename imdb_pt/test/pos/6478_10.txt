Pat O'Brien had his best role as Notre Dame football coach, Knute Rockne. From humble beginnings, Rockne entered Notre Dame as a student around 1910. He likes chemistry, but becomes a wonderful football player and hero. <br /> <br /> After graduation, he teaches chemistry at school, but there is football. the fever that pulls him, forces him to abandon chemistry to pursue his dream of training the game. In a way, too bad, the school probably lost a great chemistry teacher - certainly much better and better than what I had in high school. (Erasmus Hall, Brooklyn, to be exact). <br /> <br /> He motivates his students. He will not tolerate academic failure. He is a season coach. <br /> <br /> O'Brien captures that common touch. One of his students, George Gipp, is memorable in an excellent supporting performance of Ronald Reagan. The years go by and the achievements are high, but Knute remains the same coach who testifies before Congress when football is questioned. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp is remarkable as a Notre Dame priest who knew that Rockne was meant to train football. Albert Basserman is appropriate, but his Jewish accent on a priest's portrait is at best odd. Basserman was nominated that year in the category of support for "Foreign Correspondent". <br /> <br /> Rockne's tragic death in a plane crash has stolen the world of many years from a totally professionally wonderful human being. The movie is great.
