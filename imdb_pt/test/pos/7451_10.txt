Now, after watching The Advent Children twice, the plot is not as shallow as most have criticized it to be in my opinion. If you have not played FFVII or disliked for any reason, this movie is probably not for you. Being familiar with the original story is a prerequisite to fully understanding the AC, otherwise you'll see the biggest CG animation of your life so far. <br /> <br /> Without ruining the plot, I must admit that after seeing AC we have put together pieces with my friends relying on our knowledge of FFVII. Seeing this the second time allowed more attention in the story and most of the questions we had were answered. Some were not. AC is clearly for FFVII players / fans and honestly does not try to be anything else. There is little or no realism outside the FFVII world that serves the purpose. Music is mostly rebuilt FFVII themes with a heavier touch (TBM team according to final credits) and works well with eye drops without exceptions. I found the music enhancing experience added to visual fireworks in all situations. <br /> <br /> We all know that you can not put a FFVII in 1.5 hours and bear this in mind that the plot actually offered more to me than I expected. There are two issues at hand in the FFVII: AC and both stories were wrapped very smoothly between the action sequences. And believe me when I say there's a lot of it. Action that is. <br /> <br /> I am changing my vote from 9 to 10 after watching it a second time because I had missed some explanatory strings that I could not ride the first time it provided some answers. As a warning, it will be easy to disregard the story and focus on the graphics, but try not to judge the Adevent Children because of it. If you do not let the story in, it's no wonder it seems careless. <br /> <br /> I will not praise the graphics because I suppose we all know they are incredible, which may be a euphemism. Especially the characters speak much more with their facial expressions than ever before. I hope you pay attention to the plot as it makes sense and works well with the whole. Get ready for the ride of your life, there are no breaks.
