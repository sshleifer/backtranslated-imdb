If a joke does not offend anyone, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Inki's cartoons are offensive, no doubt. So it's rap. Leave it behind. I suspect that any black nigga finds Inki cartoons hilarious, and that people who take offense at them are white people who still think Black needs his paternalistic protection against racist humor. <br /> <br /> Seriously, Inki's cartoons are funny. It saddens me, not because someone is really offended, but because someone may be offended, I can not buy cartoons from Inki or The African Queen or Song of the South on DVD.
