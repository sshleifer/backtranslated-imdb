When I was working, I remember having a really nasty customer to deal with who insisted on doing everything on a personal basis. I was telling him things my agency could do and could not do and he firmly believed that I was personally out of it to do what was rightfully yours. I swear, but I was thinking about this guy while watching John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their battle of intelligence. In The Line Of Fire, Clint Eastwood is a veteran Secret Service Agent who was at work. in Dallas when young, when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He has had his doubts ever since and was given to drink and his life at the same time was a real mess. He went back to the details of the White House now, and when the owner of a potential killer lived with his Secret Service tenant, it was Eastwood and his partner Dylan McDermott who designed the case. <br /> <br /> But the killer is not an ordinary crank. case. He is a professional at his job, trained and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive and I'm not sure, but I thought Malkovich was better. Incredibly, Malkovich could have been better, but he saw Eastwood as the agent. manager invaded his apartment while working and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls Eastwood the whole movie and mocks him. And after a while what Malkovich says and does makes Clint real. <br /> <br /> The presidential killers we had in our history were lucky amateurs, unless you believe some of the conspiracy theories about some of the murders. A guy like Malkovich, a professional with real or imagined resentment, is the most dangerous kind of enemy. Others to be named in the cast are Fred Dalton Thompson as White House Chief of Staff (and be president in real life), Rene Russo as another agent who falls for Eastwood's male charm John Mahoney as head of the Secret Service, Gary Cole as head of the White House Secret Service, Gregory-Alan Williams as another agent and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as president and first lady. <br /> <br /> But when Malkovich is, he owns the line of fire. The climax with him and Eastwood is unforgettable.
