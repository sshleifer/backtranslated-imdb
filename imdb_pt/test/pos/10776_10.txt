This is a movie about passion. The passion he describes is misdirected, even to the protagonist. But here's the incredible power of this film: it shows us that what we believe can be tainted by nonsense and can even lead us to do things that are destructive - to ourselves or to others. In addition, those who try to escape the passion (see the drug addict who visits the studio) also risk self-destruct. <br /> <br /> The world needs to hear the message of this movie more often.
