Renee Zellweger shines like Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, relaxed and joyful comedies of the year. <br /> <br /> When obsessed prostitute Betty Sizemore witnesses the murder of her insensitive husband by two murderers (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she says that the cast members of A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to meet the famous heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character in the show). <br /> <br /> Like the two strangely paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and punctual Freeman generate some very amusing. Chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his off-screen smarmy actor personality. Renee Zellweger makes an innocent, candy-filled and sometimes terribly sweet performance like Nurse Betty. It exudes kindness, warmth and is irresistible. Although the script sometimes looks like a comedy, it is filled with unbelievable characters and planned situations, Zellweger is so nice and so disarming that everything comes together. With just a few touches of black comedy to keep things interesting, a winning performance of Zellweger, a great supporting cast and a competent script, Nurse Betty is absolutely charming. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
