I saw this piece of perfection :-) during the fantasy film festival in Berlin and when I left the cinema I felt like I was being "stoned"! I've seen a lot of movies but there are only a few that I call perfect like koyaanisqatsi or fighting the subconscious cruelty of the club is definitely one of them !!! half of the people left the exhibition in Berlin and I can understand them for sure! this is not a movie for "normal" people with dreams and illusions! A person who is living in their dreams day after day, not wanting to see all the horror in our life and on our planet, will be very shocked by this movie! if someone reads this now who saw s.c. and also think great: just contact me - so far I have not met anyone who shares my opinion - would be cool !!! this movie earns 10 points out of 10! finally I'm sorry for my bad English - I'm not a person studied !!! (and not so good * g *)
