I first saw The Victim (aka Out of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a kid, I loved watching anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you're a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as Suspected Murder in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden. Her acting in The Victim as Kate, a terrified woman trapped in a secluded house during a storm, with a killer behind her is brilliant. If you like exciting thriller thrillers than this is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end. Another great performance worth mentioning is Eileen Heckhart, who plays the mysterious and suspicious housekeeper. Unfortunately, like most Miss Montgomery films, The Victim is not available on DVD and I believe that although it was released on VHS a few years ago, it is a rarity these days. I was fortunate enough to have recorded when it was aired on the television ten years ago and so I have a good copy of this great film. A must see!
