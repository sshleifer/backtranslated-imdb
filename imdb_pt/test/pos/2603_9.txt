The four signs on the road say "If you're looking for fun ..... You do not need a reason .... All you need is a gun .... It's rabbit season!" <br /> <br /> In the woods, we see hundreds of "Rabbit Season" posters posted on each tree. We see more and more signs pointing exactly to the Bugshole's hole. Who is putting all these signs? Daffy Duck! <br /> <br /> Daffy puts on the last sign, comes out on tiptoe and tells us, the audience: "Very insensitive to me, I know. But, what the hey - I have to have fun! it's really a season of ducks. "From there, we see Elmer Fudd, a shotgun in his hand ... and a semantic war between Bugs and Daffy with Bugs winning every time. Only in cartoons, fortunately we can see someone being hit by a shotgun in the head five times and keep moving forward!
