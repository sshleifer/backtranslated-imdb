When I saw this movie for the first time, I did not believe it in my own eyes. In front of me was a big, well-made parody of Valentino ... see the bullfighting Stan Laurel that way is like seeing a great fencer in action! It's a very good parody, rich with ideas, with a smart and charming Stan ... old and good as whiskey. (or the drink after that)
