I had the pleasure of watching this movie when I was 10 years old, (having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know there are subtle mistakes in the direction of art and costumes, but above all this is the best film, to this day with the appearance of the 18th Dynasty. <br /> <br /> The film just approaches "The Egyptian" by Mika Walteri. "<br /> <br /> The score of B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful !!! Presentations as follows The late Edmond Purdom performed well as an orphaned child adopted by his parents after his years of pregnancy. He states that he keeps to himself, has the best education available, and lets face him is an emotionally distant person, given his education and high intellect. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is well as a humble tavern maid; Honest and sincere love. <br /> <br /> Bella Darvi, people have complained of his accent, she is Babylonian. <br /> <br /> It is not so apparent in the film that Sinhue is so obsessed with Nefer Nefer Nefer.His correct name.In the book Sinhue is enjoying his carnal fruits and takes revenge at the beginning of the plot, leaving the drugged body of Nefer Nefer Nefer with the workers of the "House of the Dead." <br /> Gene Tierney as Baketaten , is brilliant! When she tells Sinhue that he is Pharaoh, it looks like she could devour him (in his weakness). She is intense, bright and coldly beautiful. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding is painfully tragic in his mission to bring all people to know his one God. I believe we are seeing Ankhnaten through the lens of Egyptologist A. Weigall. A vision at the time that had a pre-Messianic feeling about the vocation of Ankhnaten. Has your monotheism influenced the Jewish people? Notice Psalm 104 and other images of Egypt in the Psalms? <br /> <br /> Peter Ustinov provided the alter ego for Sinhue. He is a street sage and an astute survivor. Excellent acting as always. <br /> <br /> Mature people never thought much about their personal attitudes. His Horemheb is an ambitious "super patriot" who ends up killing Sinhue more than one person in his quest for power. (Walteri) I felt the ending of The Egyptian was confusing because Sinhue's personality changes very easily. He has a living son (Toth dies in the novel), the power is delivered to him through the half-sister Baketaten, he is more He could have modified the Priesthood of Ammon as he was able. <br /> <br /> But NO! Sinhue gives up everything, everything including the future of his son to become a ragged beggar preaching monotheistic love? <br /> <br /> That change was very immediate and the big flaw in the script! <br /> <br /> Film look, color, most costumes (Nefer Nefer's gold dress was far above the top while she is more richly dressed than the royal family), the music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I'm going to watch the movie again easily. <br /> PS I know you know that Horemheb does not directly suckce Ankhnaten, but I could not resist this fact.
