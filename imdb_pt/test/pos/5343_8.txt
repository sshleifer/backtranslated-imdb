Aardman's staff made a cool, fluffy and wild adaptation of their short films by Wallace and Gromit to present, as the man and his dog, inventors who seem to have more intelligence (or practicality) for the latter. In this case, they invented a machine that can capture all the bunnies that are devouring the plantations throughout the quiet English village. In particular for Mrs. Tottington (or 'Totty' for those who are 'close'), much to the chagrin of Victor Quartermaine who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trusty rifle. Wallace and Gromit seem to succeed with their machine, but Wallace has a mix: a machine he made to make more food suddenly intersects with a rabbit - the curse is on! <br /> <br /> Much of this is about the fun so lightweight a kid's movie could ask for, but it also tilts the hat to the older tradition of the classic cartoon comedy: Looney Tunes, which in turn is in debt with a lot of silent comedy and vaudeville. Sure, the Aardman guys (Nick Park and Steve Box) have more tricks, tricks and ingenuity with their stuff. It's never less than incredible to see how they put the stop motion to use, even when a joke or a joke might be a bit on the funny "ho-ho" is not funny "ha-ha" side (a criticism tired but I'm going to say it. Curse of the Were-Rabbit works so well on all fronts for the public, in its twisted history and sudden dives on display (the history of the Golden Bullet is a doozy), Park and Box and company never lose sight of the joy in the material . It is confusing and warm and completely off the wall for the kids (even the younger ones will love the adventures and strange gadgets, like the truck that Wallace and Gromit drive around), and for adults there are little barbs of funky and absurd tones in the middle of a classic English farce. Just (and I'm probably a minority opinion here) when compared to the Chicken Run it's almost a slight slight work - there's less any plot than there are a lot of jokes and of course many puns involving rabbits and monsters and carnivals and cheese (and horrible men with egos in their guns as Fiennes expressed Quartermaine). But when it's the best, it's one of the funniest movies of 2005. That gives me a big goofy smile when it's on TV.
