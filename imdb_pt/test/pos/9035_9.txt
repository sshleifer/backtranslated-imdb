Intruder in the Dust (1949) Dir: Clarence Brown <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> Excellent Southern Gothic tale, adapted from Faulkner's novel about a black man accused of the murder of a white man, who asks a young white man that he has helped to prove his innocence. Lucas Beauchamp (Juano Hernandez) is a kind of anomaly in this small town. He is a black man who owns the land in which he lives and does not think much of the unhealthy social order that most maintains peace here and in many similar little towns. So when Lucas is found holding a gun on the corpse of Vinson Gowrie, shot in the back no less, young Chick Mallison (Claude Jarman) (whom Lucas saved after Chick fell through the ice while hunting in his land) fears that the city finally has the chance to "make Lucas a pussy". Trapped, and with a very real chance of being lynched before the night is over, Lucas tries to help Chick, as the only person he knows "not confused by notions." Chick asks his uncle John, a lawyer, to defend Lucas and while the man is initially bothered by his own notions, he agrees and they run up against the assembled crowd to save Lucas's life. <br /> <br /> The film has an unusual frankness for its time and is mostly free to moralize. The lawyer character has a tendency to speak of an incredibly self-conscious dialogue that sounds more like something on the printed page, but has a minimal impact on the tone. This is a credit to the rich characterization of all others. Juano Hernandez, who appeared primarily in the films of Oscar Micheaux, is superb as the proud Lucas. Porter Hall as the father of the murdered man, perhaps in the best role I have ever seen him, and Elizabeth Patterson as a valiant old lady who sympathizes with Lucas's case, stand out in supporting roles. The scenery is perfectly realized. In fact, it is filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner's hometown. Brown also uses the crowd in an effective way, it's always an anonymous crowd against a single person (like Lucas when he's arrested or John when he's going to his office), this is very menacing. Or the grotesquerie of the whole city gathered in prison to witness the lynching as if it were a parade. Worth noting is an absolutely fascinating scene when Chick and his friend Aleck go to evidence in a graveyard. Robert Surtees (THE EVIL AND BEAUTIFUL, THIRTY SECONDS ABOUT TOKYO, BEN-HUR) shot the image. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of 4
