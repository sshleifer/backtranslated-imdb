Sheba Baby is always underestimated, probably because it has a pg rating, instead of the nominal rate of a Grier movie. all that pg means is that Pam does not take off her blouse, she takes the top off of all the other movies she's in, after all. is more exciting than Coffy, more action. It comes out slow, but when it's on screen, the emotions started. as Dolemite d'Urville Martin is the heavy one trying to get Sheba's father, but she is not having it. she makes a war against Martin and his gang of cronies. the best scene is with a stupid pimp in your car that I'm still laughing at. I thought it would be stupid because of the pg rating, but I was wrong, it replaces sex with violence and in a blaxplotation movie that can only be good!
