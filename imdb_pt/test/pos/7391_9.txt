The first time I saw this movie, I wanted to like it for so many reasons, but I just did not do it. He looked a little annoyed. But there was a little question I had about something I saw near the beginning of the movie, so I watched it again? and then finally clicked on me. I watched the movie for the first time knowing the "final surprise", and while I definitely would not recommend having the final spoiled you, I still enjoyed most of the movie and discovered the many seemingly insignificant events that everyone unravel to point out a very schematic sinister. <br /> <br /> I do not think everyone will love this movie, or even like it. If you like some of the actors, you will like this movie because the acting is quite strong and they all get a lot of time on screen. If you like mysteries (ie, Hitchcock) you will like this movie. If you like independent or psychological movies, you will like this movie. This really worked for me on all these levels. If you do not like the actors, mysterious plots or psychological elements, you may not like this movie. But that is your loss. Personally, the only thing that irritated me a bit was the accent. Nice try, Alan Rickman, in the American dialect, but it was not much better than the scene at Die Hard. (The wonderful voice compensates for the strange accent, though.) The blend of accents in the film was a little strange, but it was not so disturbing that it became difficult or particularly irritating. Also, switching from scene to scene camera was evident and could bother some people, but I really think it was added to the scenes (or scene? I really can only remember one scene where the change was severely different, but it worked ). <br /> <br /> When you see this movie, see it at least twice. The second time you see it, I hope you realize how much the plot is really intricate. Every time I watch this movie (it's less than an hour and a half so multiple views are not difficult), I seem to notice something about it and wonder, "Why did this happen?" or "Was that intentional?" I like movies that make me think. This does. So just watch. Twice.
