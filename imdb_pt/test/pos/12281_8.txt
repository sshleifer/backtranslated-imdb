The whole town of Blackstone is scared because they lynched Bret Dixon's brother - and he's coming back for revenge! At least that's what they think. <br /> <br /> A great Johnny Hallyday and a very interesting Mario Adorf star in this Italo-Western, obviously filmed in the Alps. <br /> <br /> Bret Dixon is coming back to Blackstone to investigate why his brother was lynched. He is a solitary and gunslinger par excellence, everyone is afraid of him - the Mexican bandits (fighting the Gringos who took their lands!) As well as the "decent" citizens who lynched Bret's brother. They lynched him, because they thought he stole their money instead of bringing it to Dallas for bank security there. But that's only half the truth, as we discovered in the course of this psychologically interesting western. <br /> <br /> But beware, it's a depressing movie when everyone ends up being blamed in some way and definitely everyone is bad for the bone ... <br /> <br /> Still, I liked it a lot and gave an 8/10. Strange, that only less than 5 people voted for this movie from January 12, 2002 ....
