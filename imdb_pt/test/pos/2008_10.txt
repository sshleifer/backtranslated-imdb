This young filmmaker has a knack for capturing his audience quickly with unusual camera work and meager but intense screenings. The concept here of combining animation with live footage is remarkably well executed and the soundtrack is very good. <br /> <br /> The decision to release the film in twelve parts online puts the director's responsibility in making each episode fascinating. enough for the viewer to invest in the purchase of each future episode. I just wanted all the movies to have that kind of commitment to keeping the audience entertained throughout their stories. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
