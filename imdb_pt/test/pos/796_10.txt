I barely know where to start writing about this gem, except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton at the height of his powers and certainly must rank with the half dozen best short comedies ever made. The GOAT is twenty minutes of gently passed jokes, cleverly photographed and beautifully executed; two reels of uninterrupted comic book inventions driven by an unmistakable stream of paranoia that somehow led to a happy ending - which was not always the case with Buster's comedies. (See COPS for a case where Fatalism got the better of it, or ONE WEEK for the victory of Defeatism.) If I had to describe this movie in one word, I would call it "effortlessly," but if I had permission for two I would call this "seemingly effortless," for surely much hard work goes into the creation of any comic work that unfolds with such sublime ease. Still, they did not call him "The Great Stone Face" for nothing: Buster never let the public see him sweat. <br /> <br /> A sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is defined "throughout the Millionaires' Race." "That is, in a loaf of bread in a dingy urban environment where Buster waits patiently at the back of the line and as a result is not fed. In a short time, through a series of accidents, coincidences and absurd misunderstandings, Buster is considered a fugitive killer named Dead Shot Dan and is being pursued by all the cops for miles, and yet as long as he is clearly dismayed by this series of events, never a sign of self-pity or even surprise; we have the feeling that he has always known that this is what life would have reserved for him, and that he has no time to feel sorry for himself anyway, he has to find new ways to dodge those cops and escape the last trap. As soon as Buster refrains from playing for sympathy, he never pa You try to laugh too, which is especially impressive because THE GOAT should be one of the shortest comedies full of laughs. This is the movie that shows that iconic image of Buster riding from a train hunter to the camera lens itself, which is not exactly a joke, but it sure is provoking laughter in its own weird way. Meanwhile, there are gags involving guns, dogs, cops, an incredibly hairy mustache and a clay statue of a horse that melts under Buster's weight (a surreal sight indeed), but some of the biggest boffos are saved to the end when Buster is trying to fool his main enemy, Big Joe Roberts, a rotund cop who also happens to be the father of actress Virginia Fox. Trapped in Big Joe's dining room, Buster leaps over him and sails through a shaft, turns a phone booth on an elevator and pretends to disappear, and uses the elevator itself to get rid of its pursuer and win the girl in time for a last fade-out gag. <br /> <br /> To say more would be a disservice to first-time viewers. I just wanted to be able to see this movie in a theater full of people who had never seen this before, and floated in laughter. Live musical accompaniment would be nice too; and, incidentally, the musical score provided by Kino for his home / DVD version of THE GOAT is top notch, serving as a cover for an already tasty cake.
