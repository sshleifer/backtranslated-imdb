I agree with msinabottle; This is a great movie. Here are a few excerpts from the dialogue: Raisuli (Sean Connery) to Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen): "Do you see the man in the well, how does he draw water?" When one bucket empties, the other fills It is so with the world, at the moment you are full of power, but you are pouring it, wasting away, and Islam is licking the drops as they flow from your bucket. "Raisuli: The English have paid very well in the past. Pedecaris: Well, you will not do what you want with the Americans. President Roosevelt will have his head for it. Raisuli: Roosevelt. This President Roosevelt - would he try and take himself? Pedecaris: He certainly would! He is a man of courage and strong moral fiber. He does not kidnap women and children! Raisuli: What kind of rifle does he use? Pedecaris: a Winchester! Raisuli: Winchester Winchester I'm not aware of this rifle. Pedecaris: You will. <br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt (Brian Keith): The American Grizzly Bear is a symbol of the American character: strength, intelligence, ferocity. A little blind and reckless at times, but brave beyond any doubt. Oh, and another feature goes with all of the above. Newspaper reporter: And that, Mr. President? Teddy Roosevelt: Loneliness. The bear lives its life alone. Indomitable. Unconquered But always alone. He has no real allies, only enemies - but none of them are as big as him. Newspaper Reporter: Do you think this could be an American trait? Teddy Roosevelt: Certainly. The world would never love us. This can respect us. It may even grow to fear us. But it will never love us. Because we have a lot of audacity. And we are a little blind and reckless at times too.
