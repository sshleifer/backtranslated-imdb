This film has a remarkable performance, by Marília Pêra, and an impressive diction by Argentinean Hector Babenco. This is, in my opinion, the best Brazilian film ever made. The film was filmed with children from the favelas, the Brazilian ghettos. The children were not actors and were cast by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about the criminal children who are arrested in the correctional prison, which looks much worse than Alcatraz. Children are constantly raped and beaten by the police. Unfortunately this is not purely fiction, in Brazil this happens until today. A must see for anyone who likes violent movies. But take your mother out of the room because it's a difficult movie.
