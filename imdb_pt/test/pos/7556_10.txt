The film accompanies four friends from the 1950s (when they are in high school) until 1981. They are Danilo (Craig Wasson), a Yugoslavian immigrant; Georgia (Jodi Thelan) a "free spirit"; David (Michael Huddleston), who has no personality, and Tom (Jim Metzler), a big guy, strong, handsome and robust. All three are in love with Georgia, but she only loves Danilo. The film focuses primarily on these two - it chronicles their lives, love and attraction to each other over the years. He also enters Danilo trying to win the love of his immigrant father. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, but it's not without its negatives. The loud and strident voice of Thelan is annoying (but you get used to it); history jumps very quickly; The lives of Tom and David are never explained (Tom appears with a Vietnamese wife and children and David has a wife whom we never met until the end); some crucial scenes are poorly written and there are some obvious pre-release cuts (probably to keep the movie in 2 hours). <br /> <br /> But everything else is so good that you can easily forget the problems. The story is compelling - you really know and understand the characters and always get involved with life. With few exceptions, the script (by Steve Tesich) is good - in fact, Tesich was a Yugoslav immigrant and based much of the script on his own experiences. The whole performance is great - especially Thelan and Wasson -, also Reed Birney launches a strong and enjoyable performance as Louie, Danilo's roommate in college. And Lois Smith is very interesting in her role. And look quickly at Mercedes Ruehl and Glenne Headly! <br/> <br/> Basically, it's a great story about immigrants, maturing, loving America and covering the 50s and 80s perfectly. <br /> <br /> This movie was (unfairly) defamed on its release. The studio did not know how to advertise it (it's a difficult movie to market) and critics criticized it (Pauline Kaels review in "The New Yorker" was particularly harsh). He barely touched the theaters (I was lucky enough to play him in 1981 in his short season) and simply disappeared. This is a shame. This is a movie that is ready to be reissued. I'm not betting on it - but you never know! A definite 10 all the way!
