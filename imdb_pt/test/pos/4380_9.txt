It takes a rare movie to improve every time you see it. The brother does this and then some. The first time I saw this, I have to admit I had never seen anything like it. So I wanted to see him again, and now I'm up to two digits with this great movie, the best Coen brothers movie they've ever done, with Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy coming in second and third tight for me. George Clooney gives the performance of his career playing Ulysses Everett McGee, a convict fugitive who knows how to speak very fast and does not really know much about it. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are the perfect partners for Clooney, particularly Nelson and his portrayal of Delmar, a faithful but uneducated fugitive. John Goodman is my favorite character as Big Dan, perfect. This reminds me of his part in Raising Arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. Coen brothers favorites Holly Hunter and Charles Durning also offer memorable performances. <br /> <br /> Joel and Ethan Coen are masters in their craft. It's not like they try to win an Oscar every time they make a movie, they just try to tell a story they want to tell, and it's fun. It's a loose adaptation of the Odyssey, and I mean loose for all of you, fanatics for Homer. It's just great. <br /> <br /> The most amazing part of this movie is the coloring. I saw how they managed to feel the dust of the movie and I'm still amazed at just thinking about it. Coloring becomes an important part of the film. Great great movie.
