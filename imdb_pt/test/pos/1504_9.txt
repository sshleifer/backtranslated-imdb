This is an interesting movie. I find it very funny, although the mood is very dark. Fulci is good and funny acting himself, it's a really funny and really crazy "self portrait" of an artist ("I make horror movies. If I made love movies, no one would buy tickets ..."). And it's also SEXY movie: Almost all the time there is some "action" or tension happening; and many sexy girls / women ... Maybe that goes to the heart of why someone starts making movies / art in the first place ... It's a true psychedelic trip, maybe better looking a little drunk or a similar mental state. There are some nasty scenes, obviously, because it's Lucius Fulci. In fact, some of these scenes are pretty disgusting. Anyway, it's one of the three best and most complete Fulci movies I've ever seen (the others are House By the Cemetery and Zombie. I did not see The Beyond). In fact, the script is overally, in my opinion, quite ingenious. You can see this movie as a portrait of an extreme neurotic, or a person suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (buzzwords): the character has a compulsive need to confess "crimes" or bad thoughts; Especially crimes he did not even do. And he questions himself all the time: what if I have done it? What if I want to do this? I made it? I want to do that? He exaggerates and exaggerates his thoughts. I'm sure Fulci was interested in psychology and maybe even read something from the area; in his film "House By The Cemetery", for example, there is a character called Freudstein. This is perhaps the most direct and direct film Fulci ever made. I also like the simplicity of the photo / photos in this movie. The only thing that disturbs me a little is sadism, especially for women; I do not quite understand why? Is it entertainment? Is it art? Is that horror? Anyway and overall, this is really interesting and well done film, definitely recommended classic movie, at least for fans or anyone interested in this genre. For others, it may be too much.
