Brief summary of the book: Boy, Billy Tepper, about 12 years old, is the main cause of problems of the school, and if he is expelled from another school, he will be sent to boarding school. His school of luxury boys in Switzerland (or somewhere like this) is dominated by Arab terrorists, so I'm not sure. Billy has no friends and likes to use his laptop to hack into his school's database. He, with the help of two teachers, thwarts the terrorist's plans and saves the whole school. The book was not bad, but it was sooooo cliche. <br /> <br /> Now, about the movie; traded Arab terrorists for Cuban terrorists and made Billy, 17, the leader of his group of friends. They like to have problems, but normal teenage things. This movie was believable. It may not be realistic, but the characters are real. You can watch Billy, Joey and the rest of the guys and see real kids acting the way they did (or at least wanting). <br /> <br /> Great action scenes. Not everything goes as planned for both sides. Taking down the terrorists was confusing and the good guys got hurt. I will not say who, but it is painful (I know, I use that word a lot). Sean Astin is excellent. As a teenager, he often played the idiot best friend. This movie proved once again that he could play the protagonist, boy, anything. The only performance that could have overshadowed his was Wil Wheaton, who played the only son of a New Jersey mafia man. He hated his father and everything he represented. (Far from Wesley Crusher) Generally this genre of film is the one I watch for the purpose of making grace; but not the toy soldiers. The story line flows, dialogue is generally believable. I can not think of a single moment when I saw myself screaming on TV "Oh, it would not happen" Great movie that should be in everyone's collection.
