The hottest and most engaging movie of its kind, Those Lips, Those Eyes, made me smile and cry, reminding myself of the work that is needed to pursue a dream and the pain of deception. Hulce and Langella are superb and the history seems to be writing. A brilliant screenplay by David Shaber (one of my favorites! - see The Warriors and Nighthawks for more ...) and beautiful scenes filmed locally (I think) in the very summer theater where the story takes place. You can not watch this movie and you do not want to drop everything and get into the theater! Please check this video if you can find it.
