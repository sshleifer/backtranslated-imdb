Three ten-year-old children, born at the same time during a solar eclipse, begin to maliciously murder anyone who offends them. While the films of murderous children were not exactly new at the time those twisted 80s were destroyed. the children's theme as killers works great for this movie. Bloody Birthday does some good chills and suspense while it manages to be a competent killer thriller with some weird qualities. It spans a fine line between cheese and creepy, but remains fun throughout with an interesting storyline. There are some strong scenes of murder as well as good nudity to establish this as a solid guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> The cast does a good job. Young stars Elizabeth Hoy and K.C. Martel made some threatening presentations while rising star Julie Brown does a striptease before a memorable murder scene. Veteran star Susan Strasberg does well as the teacher and Jose Ferrer has a brief appearance. <br /> <br /> Everything around that entrance is not bad, although it's not flawless, but it's worth watching for genre fans. out of ****
