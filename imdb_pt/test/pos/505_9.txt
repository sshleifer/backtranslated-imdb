In the growing cinematic genre of comic book adaptations, Blade is by far one of the best and most loyal (in general) to the original material ... since the character has almost 30 years of history in comics since his debut as a supporting figure in Tomb of Dracula, by Marvel, the writer took almost ALL the characters and traced elements of the history of the comic book. While changes were inevitably made, the more delicate points of the film move directly over any criticism. Do not let any of your friends talk about you: Blade is a great movie. If you feel too "comic" to you, Stanley Kubrick snobbish, that's because you should. Deal with it, but do not do it for it.
