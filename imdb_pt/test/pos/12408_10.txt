This movie about a group of small-town teenagers who decides to rob the local bank is excellent. Brian (Justin Walker) wants to leave his small town, much like Jimmy Stewart in "It's A Wonderful Life." However, unlike George Bailey, Brian will steal a bank to fund his dream of attending art school, even if his father is not supportive. The offer to Brian is to act as a customer and distract the guard. It is a tempting offer that if offered to many, I question what they would do. Anyway, Brian does it. When the sheriff (James Remar) and his force surround the bank, things go from bad to worse. It's a draw even with the feds coming in to kill the kids if they get a clean shot. The sheriff should avoid this and try to end the impasse in a peaceful way. Unfortunately, tensions increase, and adolescents jostle. Some are out of control. The paper cutter scene is awful and hard to watch. Very intense!
