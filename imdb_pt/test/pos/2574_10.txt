If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man avenge himself creatively from the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've heard the wonderful song that keeps the emotion raw. The surprise is that in a history of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech that transforms the film. Look for a final scene that is an unexpected evidence of a wounded person healing. Perhaps we, who ask ourselves why we sink into the abundant profane, learn that love may be located above the loins of the heart. From the pounding beat follow the rhythm to where love is sacred.
