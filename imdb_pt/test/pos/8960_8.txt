Yes, this movie has many gay characters. He also has heterosexual characters, characters who are not sure about their sexuality, people who are looking for some truth about their existence. <br /> <br /> This is not a film about sexual orientation. It is about the solitude and difficulty that humans often experience in connecting with each other. Filmly, Denys Arcand intelligently balances the various dimensions of relationships and contrasting, ever-changing relationships. The serial killer is a bit less successful (it seems more like a way to summarize several points of the plot and, unlike the rest of the movie, is thematically heavy). <br /> <br /> Thomas Gibson focuses and grounds the film; is a silent performance, but behind the beautiful and arrogant exterior, he slowly reveals a terrified soul for fear of showing or accepting the love of those around him. The supporting cast is strong, especially Mia Kirshner as Gibson's friend, a gift of rent with precognitive powers. His role is more metaphor than a literal concept - strangely innocent and depraved at the same time, it represents the light and darkness of the characters' sexual consciousness. <br /> <br /> The film involves and often surprises in the development of the character. The effect is a bit like Robert Altman directing a script by David Mamet - the dialogue does not diminish due to some tearful remarks, plus a few moments invented at the beginning. Often in our quest for love and a conventional "relationship," we ignore the love that already exists around us - in our friends, family, those who are able to see us as we are. Arcand and writer Brad Fraser make a few shrewd remarks about the different ways humans try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that negation returns to haunt us in so many unexpected ways. <br /> <br /> This movie is a rewarding experience. It may not be for the fanatics who can not overcome the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see the greater and transcendental message of hope and redemption. Loneliness is a universal experience. A movie like this, which dares to explore the darker side of our lives with a clever and insightful look, deserves applause and an open-minded approach.
