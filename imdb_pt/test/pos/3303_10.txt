The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone, but for most of us it is love. But not everyone knows where or who to look for real love. This story is the bet of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes, "we are the captains of our own ships," and so holds true for our lives. We are responsible for the choices we make in our lives. Once we make those choices, we should live with them. As we watch this story and see these women making choices that will likely change their lives forever, we wonder, would we make the same choices as these women or would we be wiser? Who knows?
