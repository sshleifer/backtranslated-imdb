Yes, maybe there are parts of this movie that require a hanging belief a bit, but that does not detract anything from the charm and wonder of the movie. It was shown as part of the city's youth film festival and was the favorite of the organizing committee. Which is not surprising. The subject - reuniting in a race-ravaged South Africa, though post-apartheid, is highly current and the treatment of the theme is inspiring. Of course, as the previous comment mentions, the film has its flaws, but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject belies these shortcomings. I saw this with my wife and we came back the same night with the kids. A movie to watch, meditate, discuss and act on.
