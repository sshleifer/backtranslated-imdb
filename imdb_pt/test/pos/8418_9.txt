I am a Maharashtrian, a teenager who lives in the 21st century, and it is obvious that I do not really like Bollywood, let alone Marathi movies. However, when I watched Shwaas, he left me with a unique sensation that only an extremely effective film is capable of generating. <br /> <br /> It is a fact that, like most Indian films, the film has its true and complete effect only if seen in its original language. Many of the film's emotions and meanings are embedded in his dialogues about Marathi, which, however tried, can not be effectively translated into English. Shwaas explores, in intricate detail, the relationship between a grandfather and a child. And do complete justice to this strong bond. Dialogues like "mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahe" (My parsha is also one in a million) add to the excitement. Anyone who has closely watched the relationship between grandparents and children may relate to the situation portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, definitely worth watching. It's a film that left a profound effect on me. I would certainly recommend it to anyone!
