This is a film about the music that is currently being played in Istanbul. Istanbul was the center of the two Old World superpowers, the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Today, it is a megalopolis of almost 10 million. So it is no surprise to anyone that much music is being played in Istanbul with a wide variety of voices, styles and influences from all over the world. It's Turkish music, of course, and I've been fascinated by Turkish music since I bought my first record a long time ago. The film features different singers, instrumentalists and bands. Comments spoken by the musicians illustrate well the music being played and the social context in modern Turkey. To my perspective, the most interesting comments were from Orhan Gencebay. In addition, the films show mainly urban landscapes of Istanbul, which is very pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> "Crossing the Bridge" is listed as a documentary and includes minority songs, for example. Kurds and Gypsies. Other important topics are omitted, such as Turkish jazz music, or the music of Armenians and Greeks. <br /> <br /> This film is strongly recommended for lovers of music and culture from Turkey, the Balkans, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. It may also be worth it for those with a keen interest in the global effects of musical styles like Rock and Roll or Hip Hop.
