This is as good as it sounds. <br /> <br /> This is a six episode episode (briefly) about what life would have been like when dinosaurs ruled Earth. Made in the style of a documentary about nature, this show ends up with the talking heads, it just gives us the good things with the dinosaurs trying to survive. <br /> <br /> Surely this is not a true documentary, since nothing we see on screen can be attested with any certainty, but it's a better guess, and a fun one at that. Here's a show that brings dinosaurs to life in a realistic way, which does not involve ingestion of people. This is a show that should be shown to any child who loves dinosaurs since they will infuse them with the WOW OH factor to get out and find out more. It will also entertain the hell out of them, and you. <br /> <br /> See this. If you enjoy animal shows or nature or science shows or Disney True Life Adventures (except that no one really is dead) or just a good trip to somewhere else, get out and ask for a copy. Your brain will thank you.
