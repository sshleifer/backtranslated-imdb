This movie is good, but not the best of Schaffner. My favorite is Papillon and Patton, but this is a sad and very good movie. Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference. I'm going to miss Schaffner and this is his last movie. <br /> <br /> A good movie from a great director! 7.5 / 10
