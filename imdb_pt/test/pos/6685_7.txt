After an assault incident at New York's Grand Central Station, an innocent bystander (Kevin Spacey, "The Common Suspects") is arrested by police, who believe he is under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. We can understand why they think this, considering how politely the man informed them that he wears his sunglasses because "the light on his planet is really bright." And then Prot (as he identifies himself as rhymed with "goat") is sent to the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute, where an exhausted workaholic physician, Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges, "The Great Lebowski"), tries to understand the so called illusion of this man. <br /> <br /> Prot's way is courteous and cooperative. When asked why he believes he has been institutionalized, he responds naturally that it is because "you think I'm crazy." In a few minutes, after satisfying his insatiable hunger for fresh fruit from Earth, the completely revealing Prot revealed that he is an alien from the planet K-PAX, which is 1000 light-years away, circling the binary star system Agape and Satori located in the constellation of Lyra. He also details how his infinitely more advanced species have mastered travels faster than light, by harnessing the energy of light, an accomplishment that is supposed to be thousands of miles away for the human race. Powell is understandably very skeptical of these outrageous claims, although he is fascinated by them, and is committed to understanding how Prot came to believe in such a thing. Meanwhile, Prot uses his time to observe his colleagues in the psychiatric ward, eventually offering everyone around him something to live for and the hope of a cure. On July 27, Prot later reveals, he will depart again for the K-PAX, and he can only take a human with him. What really will happen on that date, no one is sure. <br /> <br /> Originally scheduled to play Dr. Powell ?? with Will Smith as Prot? Kevin Spacey stepped into the lead role when Smith had to withdraw from the film. You can tell that he has had so much fun with his character, the completely practical delivery of his sometimes ridiculous dialogue ("Your product alone was worth the trip") often eliciting genuine laughter. There is undeniable intelligence behind many of Prot's words, but logic holds that he must be delusional ... should not he? <br /> <br /> The public is taken from one side to another between the possibilities ?? for the first segment of the film, we almost accepted the possibility that Prot is an alien (this is a science fiction movie, is not it!), before being totally convinced when Prot inexplicably exhibits an impossible knowledge of the astronomy of a system newly discovered planetarium. A final investigation by Dr. Powell offers us a carefully packed earthly explanation for Prot's illusions, but this is quickly discarded, and we scratch our heads again. The film, quite rightly, keeps its ending open, letting the audience contemplate what they have just seen and discuss with those around them. However, whether you believe Prot is an alien or not, two irresistible certainties remain in your mind: the Universe is indeed a fascinating place, and perhaps there are higher forces that we, humans, have not yet discovered.
