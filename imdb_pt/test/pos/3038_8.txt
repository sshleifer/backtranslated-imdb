This movie is a piece of the time it was made ..... Realistic. Films were not candy coated during the late 60's and early 70's. Producers did not try to create a happy ending that did not exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience which, hopefully, would stimulate them to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world, this movie would probably not be made. There would definitely be no such end, no matter how realistic. The sad fact is that the film portrayed a situation that could not be improved without the improvement of the relationship between traditional Southern thinking and the progressive movements of the time.
