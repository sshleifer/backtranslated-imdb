It is worth dismantling the Hindu pantheon before watching this movie. Three main female deities - wise Sita, nourishing Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer - as well as three main male deities - the grave Rama, playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender - are all alluded to. Knowing folklore as surely every Indian member of an audience lends a wealth in telling the current story. In fact, a popular tale is staged first on the stage as part of a spirituality lesson and then in the "real life" of the film. "Fire" speaks against misogyny and homophobia in the society of which its producers are native, and it does so with a beauty that weaves the message across multiple levels of viewer consciousness into a deeply satisfying presentation. This is the best movie I've seen in the last ten years; very highly recommended!
