Jack Webb's film, 'The D.I', came from a real-life investigation into the death of several trainees in a swamp on Paris Island in the 1950's. As usual, Webb, being the patriot he is, defense much like the rest of his shows. I actually met this tame movie by the 1957 standards. I served in the Army and I can understand the intensity of the training on Parris Island (Camp Death by some), so this movie can never come close as the Full Metal Jacket. I think this is a good movie that is more patriotic than real. But again, think about the time frame it was made (1957) and what could be allowed and said in the film at that time. I've always found Jack Webb clean and very loyal. I know that many criticized the film as unilateral and governmental propaganda. If you feel that way, watch 'Full Metal Jacket' with R Lee Ermey. I'm a fan of Webb and I appreciate the film on its merit, not accuracy. As I said, Webb believed in this country and maintained institutions with high moral standards (LAPD-Dragnet, Adam 12, Emergency, etc.). Just relax and enjoy this from a very strict moral time period in this country. Do not be too critical of Mr. Webb. Mark Lockwood Lubbock Texas ..
