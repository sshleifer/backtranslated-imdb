Tom Fontana's Unforgettable "Oz" is by far one of the greatest TV series ever created. Brilliantly written, rendered and directed, it is as close to perfection in any form of art (film, television, literature, music) as possible. Haunting his extreme brutality, he creates a prison world filled with diverse characters ranging from compassionate to terrible. It is a spectacle that, however brutal it may be, you can not take your eyes off it. The combination of professionally trained theater actors with film and television actors allows for a range of diverse and original performances. <br /> <br /> And while the show is universally praised and has a loyal fan base, it can not be felt that it was underestimated during its run on television because of other HBO dramas such as "The Sopranos," "Sex and The City" and "Six Feet Under." And while all of these shows are fine masterpieces and borderline to their right, many people forget that it was "Oz" that was HBO's first entry into a one-hour television drama series. It was a bold and risky first entry and with it HBO made a grand slam with her. This is as good as it sounds.
