I usually really like this movie. The animation is supreme: it means they bothered to animate the hair and skin of animals and people. And being an amateur in graphics and animation (self teaching me through books. For those of you who are curious about the same subject, I use Discreet's Gmax program.It is a free high quality program that can be downloaded from the internet) that the quality of the animation shown here is of a high standard. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie is good. Although this film has no character development, this story is still understandable. Generally, I believe that this movie should be seen mainly by people who are fans of the game, as the story follows the game closely. As for me, I do not play the games and therefore I do not have the wowing effect that it probably does on the fans of the game. <br /> <br /> For those who like the game, I suggest this movie for you, and if you have not played yet, I would still recommend this movie to you.
