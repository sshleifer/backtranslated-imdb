I'm very surprised that so many people do not like this movie. I think it's a lot better than most teen movies that came out recently - Ten things I hate about you (can we say teen bopper movie and what was with the principle of writing these porn novels?), Cruel Intentions (where a character gives up on her virginity because of a fun car ride), and she's all of it (mediocre). If you are looking for something that is just fun - I say go with Never Been Kissed. My mom loved it and she hates movies (one of her favorites is BEACHES). This is a great fantasy about what you would do differently if you could go back to high school. People who have been marginalized in high school are more likely to enjoy this movie. This reminds me of 'Romy and Michele's High School Reunion'. And the end puts me in the best mood. Of course the plot was made, but how many recent movies can you honestly say were not made in one way or another. The cast is also charming. And to those who think Drew can not be nerd - she does everything very well. Another good teen comedy I recommend that was recently made is the ELECTION, but it's more a satire on school and politics.
