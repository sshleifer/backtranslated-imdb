I remember the events of this movie, Donald Crowhurst's ill-fated 1968 cruise on the Golden Globe in a single hand around the world yacht race. I was 13 years old and lived in England. The previous year, Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis, he was decorated for his exploits) completed the first circumnavigation of the world. I remember this mainly because we were given time out of school to watch her return (on a grainy TV in black and white!) And then her knight for the Queen. This triggered a huge display of patriotic fervor in the UK. Everything seems so unique now. Chichester became a national hero, but he had stopped midway in Australia to re-equip his yacht, so the next logical step for the yachtsmen was to try the journey on and on. <br /> <br /> It is important to remember that this was a global pre-GPS, when communications ashore were still quite erratic, it did not matter in the middle of the ocean. Now with GPS receivers that fit into a keychain and calculate a position within a meter anywhere on Earth, it's hard to remember a time when you could go to sea and literally disappear. As Donald Crowhurst did. <br /> <br /> A number of yachtsmen signed up (all men at that time), including the mysterious man, Crowhurst. Essentially a weekend sailor, Crowhurst had not been a spectacular success in any previous venture, including careers in the British Army, the Air Force and as an electronics entrepreneur selling aids to navigation. He wanted to do something great with his life, and he saw the first prize of five thousand pounds (well over $ 100,000 in today's money) and the publicity that followed as a means to start his business. He signed an agreement with a sponsor that proved to be safer than his boat, which meant that failure would bankrupt him, and soon found himself a popular figure among journalists as he prepared for the race. Now the English always adore the idea of ​​a brave amateur facing the "professionals." (Think of Eddie the Eagle, missing out on numerous Olympic ski jumping competitions, and the amateur riders who regularly start the Grand National horse race.) The crowd lined up to watch him go, but his boat was not really ready. (the last competitor to leave the UK) Crowhurst must have known that he did not have a serious chance. But a lot was happening to him to give up. <br /> <br /> In wonderful filming, we see doubts all over the face of his poor wife. Left behind with her four children, she is interviewed moving throughout the film, along with one of Crowhurst's sons. She was in a winless situation. If she had tried to stop him, she would have been considered a spoiler, but after that she was torn in doubt whether she could have saved his life by preventing him. Faced with the certain truth that his boat was leaking and would never pass through the southern oceans, and unable to turn around and face ridicule, bankruptcy, and ignominy, Crowhurst devised a plot to cheat. Left in the sea of ​​Argentina and Brazil, without radio contact, he waited for the leaders to bypass Cape Horn and return to the Atlantic, thinking he could enter the end of the line and pretend he had sailed all over the world. . He elaborately faked his records and made 16mm movies and audio recordings to back his plan. But as one after another the other competitors gave up, he realized that in fact he would come in second and his records would be examined. Unable to face particular detection, his diary suggests that he lost control over reality and ended up committing suicide. Your yacht was found. He never was. <br /> <br /> This beautifully edited film also follows the journey of Bernard Moitessier, an experienced and enigmatic French sailor, who was second and certain of the fastest travel award, when he left the race abruptly, unable to deal with the clamor and publicity he knew he would face, and sailed off into the distant blue, finally arriving 10 months later in Tahiti. Having spent about seven years working at sea myself (though on very different ships to these) I quite understand the attraction of the ocean. Standing on the deck, watching the water in all directions to the horizon, knowing there is a few miles of water beneath you, nothing between you and oblivion, but a thin metal hull without easy access to TV or radio (even nowadays on most ships in operation). you feel quite isolated), you can actually escape the responsibilities of everyday life for a while. There is a careful analysis of what drives people to try this kind of long, lonely journey and the effect it has on the human mind. Most people would think that trying to raise four children is enough adventure, but much is made of the need for self-discovery in the difficulties of the sea, the search for oneself. <br /> <br /> I strongly suspect that Robin Knox Johnston, the former sailor who won the race (and many since) probably knew very well who he was before he left, which is why he succeeded not only win the race but also keeping your sanity on the way. Those who have been looking for something deep within them may not have completely liked what they found. <br /> <br /> The wonderful archive of Britain in the late 1960s is almost a sufficient reason to watch this, (did it really seem so bad? I do not remember looking so clumsy, but maybe we can the worst aspects of the past?), but overall, it is an excellent and well crafted film. Highly recommended.
