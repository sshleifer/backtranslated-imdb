It should be noted that this film was not "improvised" (as you are probably thinking), despite what the title suggests. The film was heavily scripted and rehearsed - Cassavetes did not have enough money to withstand the inevitable high production costs of some sort of "improvised" film, even if he wanted to produce such a thing. The film's "improvisation" is contained in the actors' performances and the emotions they draw from the lines. <br /> <br /> Having said that, let me say that this is an awesome job that I'm sure will come back again and again. The depths of emotion that Cassavetes is able to draw from the smallest gestures and interactions are incredible. I have no idea how he was able to drive such incredible performances from the actors, especially under the conditions he worked on. This really is a magnificent film landmark that I would recommend to anyone interested in exploring beyond the Hollywood cast.
