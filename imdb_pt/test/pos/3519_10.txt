Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that sends chills down your spine every time you watch! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (good job Mr. Lieberman!) Which makes an extremely well done slasher! Although low on blood for the 80's, it still has the effect on you after it's over. The opening kill (machete through the groin) looked so real! And the fist for the death of the mouth left me stunned! Overall I give this classic lost 10 stars out of 10 stars! If you are looking for a bloody festival, do not look here. but, if you want shivers sent down, see this one. There are 6 deaths and one of them you do not see, but, do you mind thinking "how was she killed?" the stranded theme reminded me of 1977, the Hills Have Eyes, which followed the same concept, but in the wilderness with canninbals. But, still slasher fans, give this gem forgotten, I promise you, you will be staisfied!
