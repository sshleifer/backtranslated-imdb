This is one of the nine short films on the anime disc, "The Animatrix". It's my favorite. The work of art is incredible. The black and white texture, a bit grainy, perfectly captures the mood the segment is trying to portray. The story is short, and the ending is true for filming noir. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave the Animatrix a "7", but this particular segment deserves a "10".
