I want to start this review by saying that I have no idea what "Begotten" really is about. All I really know is that in the beginning God kills himself, in turn, giving birth to Mother Earth, which is impregnated with the semen of God. She is then born a child. The rest is very subjective, and you have to interpret it in your own way. <br /> <br /> How I chose to play the film was this; God killing himself meant the beginning of the scientific revolution, when people began to question the doctrines imposed by the church, such as the geocentric vision of the universe and so on. Mother Earth symbolized people beginning to think for themselves and reject the church. "This is so because God says" visions. "The Tribal people were the church attacking them, trying to force Christianity down the throat. Son Of Earth fits in all that. Mother Earth and the Tribal people seemed to be fighting over it, so maybe it represents people's freedom or something. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the parties The end of this film should mean: Panning, raping, then dismembering Mother Earth and the Son of the Earth and smashing them on the floor like a mortar and pestle can mean anything, but that's where the fun of this movie is; the way you want it <br /> There does not have to be a definite meaning for this, you can let your mind wander <br /> <br /> Sometimes you do not even know what you should be looking at because it's filmed at a strange angle or it's very confusing. The only thing the one that disappointed me was that I was expecting a truly terrifying movie. I was going there thinking that I would get a phone call immediately after with a "seven day" notice. What I received was pleasantly different. It was not scary, but it piqued my imagination. Trying to decipher the film's enigmatic message was a creative challenge. There were many scenes that were really beautiful. Mother Earth soon after she was born and the final scene of the forest path comes to mind. <br /> <br /> So, overall I would have to say that I liked this movie. It's certainly the most abstract film I've ever seen, but that's not a bad thing.
