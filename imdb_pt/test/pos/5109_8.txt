If you see only one Ernest movie in your life, make it one! This is by far the best of the series, with its uninterrupted laughter and intelligent humor that is suitable for all ages. The other "Ernest" movies were good too, but most people tend to get bored of it quickly (not me, though). <br /> <br /> In this film, Ernest P. Whorrel is assigned to work on a jury. case of murder. The killer, Nash, just looks EXACTLY like our clumsy Ernest hero. Nash thinks this is a good opportunity to escape the jail, causing him to switch identity with him, so we can see how Ernest reacts to the slammer. <br /> <br /> A great movie! If you have not yet seen, watch!
