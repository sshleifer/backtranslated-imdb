The violent death of Fernando Ramos da Silva just eight years after the conclusion of this film, only increases the poignancy of the powerful message of Dierector BAbenco. The film is divided into two halves - the first in a reformatory where a group of young people is abused and violated by violent law enforcement and guardians. The second background is the city where they are confined by their own actions and morality, which includes assaults, pimps and murders of different characters that come into their lives. <br /> <br /> The different sex and gender roles in the film allow for constant character changes as they interact with other people. Particularly interesting is the character of Lalica, a transvestite who is a mother and lover of some of the children. His reaction to the arrival of Sueli, a prostitute, is both poignant and tragic. <br /> <br /> There is no happy ending to this story and I recommend watching it with caution as there are some very uncomfortable scenes to watch, especially at the opening twenty minutes. But while watching, it's important to remember that this is not just a fictional tale. The actors are not trained professionals, but boys selected from the streets of SÃ£o Paulo. They actually lived this life that is portrayed so vividly on the screen and, in Silva's case, died at the hands of the police, who are portrayed so brutally. A documentary? A piece of fiction. It borders on both but it certainly makes the heart of the material painful and it is a movie that really leaves you breathless and thinking long after you have watched. <br /> <br /> 10/10
