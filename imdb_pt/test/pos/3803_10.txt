Although this film has never achieved commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-made pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The plot portrays a boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal adventure, similar to a dream, with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. So anyone who tries to see this movie from the perspective of their compliance with reality will probably be disappointed; is not intended to be "realistic". It is, however, intended to be metaphorical with extensive apparent symbolism for those with excellent attention to detail. In addition, symbolic representations are left open for interpretation, which can be said of great works of art. Do not be fooled by the cover (if you rent or buy this movie) - the film is not what appears to be on the surface.
