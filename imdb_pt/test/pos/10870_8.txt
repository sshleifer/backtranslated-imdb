Displayed this morning for the press at the Rome Film Festival, "N - io and Napoleone" is easy to love. First of all, you can count on great production values, as very few Italian films can today, with wonderful sets and costumes. The cast is great too. Director Virzì constantly speaks of young leader Elio Germano as "a young De Niro". Now, of course he's going too far, but surely the boy can act. I loved his performance, and he did a great job with the accent (Tuscan). Daniel Auteuil is a great actor and did very well as Bonaparte. It's really great to see him performing in Italian, I hope to see him working in Italy again soon. The supporting cast also worked well - people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore may seem improbable choices, but they all gave great performances. Even Massimo Ceccherini, best known for appearing in his own idiot movies and unpretentious TV reality shows, fit in well and was really funny. The bass of the cast was "Diva" Monica Bellucci. Of course, she was a little better than usual, but she managed to look (and sound) totally unnatural even in the part of Baroness Emilia, in which, with a good dose of self-irony, she wore her own umbra accent. The script, by veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virzì himself, is intelligent, with lots of laughs and some really exciting moments as well. Of course, the ending puzzled me. The message is half ambiguous: the whole movie says that political ideals can lead you to blind hatred, but if you approach, you learn that the object of your hatred is after all a human being like everyone, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes pathetic, so that suddenly it is hard to hate him; so in the last few minutes he says that it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning. Personally, I do not really like that notion. "Io and Napoleone" is still a nice film, the best presented at the Festival so far (the other is Fur and the Hoax). My rating is 8/10
