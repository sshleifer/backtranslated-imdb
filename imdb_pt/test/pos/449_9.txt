There have been many excellent reviews about this movie and I want to add my voice to the praise. Yul Brynner has never been more powerful and attractive. His major Surov was fascinating. His eyes simply can not leave the screen when he is in it. This is his movie. This is not to scorn the rest of the cast, which was also exemplary, especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson. As they were mostly stage actors, they brought many nuances to their performances. For example, I've seen this movie at least 4 times, but this is the first time I've noticed the reaction of the German girl when she came face-to-face with a Russian soldier. Even though he was not threatening, his absolutely hysterical reaction made me realize that she must have been in Germany after World War II and was probably raped by a gang by the Red Army. The possibility of discovering deeper layers of history that may be just below the surface makes me want to see this fascinating movie over and over again. Please put it on DVD.
