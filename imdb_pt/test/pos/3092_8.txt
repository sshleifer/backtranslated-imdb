Fata Morgana is by far one of the strangest and most bewildering art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, although it has elements of documentation of images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so obscure, I wonder if it was worth telling this story just so that these images exist. The film is basically the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of a stranger, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all happening in the Sahara desert. The title of the photo refers to the illusion or reflection of images, real and hallucinated, that people in the desert often witness. These are also known as mirages. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with an airplane landing followed by the airplane landing again and then again and again and again and again and again and again and again. With each plane landing, the actual architecture of the place it is landing on and of the plane itself begins to dissolve slowly and produce less and less real and more and more reflective images. The images in this movie only become more intense and more unusual as the image continues. The film's narration tells the creation of the universe while alarming sexual images of sand and landscape pass through the camera. The shots go farther and farther into the desert and Herzog films what he sees and finds. The strangest reflections in the world are in sight from afar, while Herzog finds some of the purest, photogenic collections of outsiders you'll probably see. When Leonard Cohen's soundtrack kicks in, you can be sure you're in the world of a crazy man who's in love with the universe. <br /> <br /> I can not say much more about this movie without spoiling anything. , but I will say that it is a disappointing experience and there is nothing quite like it. I love watching movies that are just in own classes. This film certainly is a good example of how Herzog likes to blend narrative narrative and documentary in an interchangeable way. Fata Morgana, unfortunately, goes beyond the time limit, but when it comes close, the images will probably be etched in your mind forever. Definitely a must see for those who are obsessed with nature and the origin of the universe.
