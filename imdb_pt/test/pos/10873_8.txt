Debbie Vickers (Nell Schofield) and Sue Knight (Jad Capelja) want to become one of the coolest high school girls. Uncool and ugly girls had two options, being a mole or a prude! Debbie and Sue imitate them by using their cheating practices in an examination. Two of the cool guys, Garry (Goeff Rhoe) and Danny (Tony Hughes) ask for the answers and everyone is arrested. After a complaint from the director (Bud Tingwell), the cool girls meet them outside on the playground, and confront them about whether they "beat" all of them. Like Debbie and Sue, not the cool girls invited them to the "beasts" to smoke. They then start to walk with them on weekends at the beach, watching all the boys surf. Sue ends up hanging out with Danny and Debbie with Garry. A lot of the usual teen action occurs including sex, drugs and rock and roll. Garry has an overdose of heroin that makes Debbie face the inequalities of life and decides to learn to surf instead of just observing the boys. They are not happy, but they watch her, calling names, and eventually Debbie rules the board. A cool movie from the early '80s Aussie.
