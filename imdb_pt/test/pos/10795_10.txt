I've seen it a few times and I'm completely stuck with it every time. It is very full of suspense and intense. Describing it sounds annoying, but it's amazing. It's the kind of movie you need, you can not miss anything, but if you dive in, it will stay with you for a long time after it's over. Now thinking about it I do not even know what Stone was trying to make us see. Just the story of Alan Green? I think not. It was a look at ignorance, stupidity, self-absorption and a guy losing control. Maybe he had more grip than the listeners. I did not like Barry, but I still seemed to care about him for some reason. I was puzzled by why I could not get it out of my mind when the movie ended. I wish I could see inside Olive Stone's mind for this one.
