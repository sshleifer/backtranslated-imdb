As a recreational player with some knowledge of the sport's history, I was pleased with Disney's sensitivity to golf class issues in the early twentieth century. The film portrays well the psychological battles Harry Vardon fought within himself, from the childhood trauma of being dumped to his own inability to break the glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as equal in English golf society. Likewise, the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles, being a mere caddy in the eyes of high-tier Americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his position. <br /> <br /> What I loved most, however, is how this theme of the lesson manifests itself in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a working class drone who sees the value of hard work, but is bullied by the upper class; his mother, however, recognizes his son's talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior. <br /> <br /> Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the film has not been the actual location of the historic tournament, the little freedoms taken by Disney do not detract from the beauty of the film. There is a small Disney moment at the pool table; Otherwise, the viewer does not really think about Disney. The ending, as in "Miracle," is not a Disney creation, but something only human history could have written.
