I think several others have already commented on this movie, but I liked it so well that I just wanted to say how good this movie is. I gave him a rating of 9 out of 10. He did not get a 10 because it is too slow to start. I almost gave up on that, but I'm glad I did not give up. Hold on, it's worth the wait. <br /> <br /> This is mainly about a relationship movie: deception, trust, and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer, Jessica Lange and Jason Robards all do jobs in this movie. <br /> <br /> Situated in the Midwest farm country, the character of Jason Robards is a farmer whose first grandfather settled there. Jason's character is getting older and he decides to create a trust by dividing the thousand acres of farmland among his three adult daughters. That's when the plot of this movie really begins to be made. <br /> <br /> The sisters turn against each other because of misunderstandings, not greed for the land. They also make some discoveries about each other's childhood and about their marriages today, including an adulterous affair, as the father becomes increasingly abusive, demanding and paranoid - until the awful truth about everyone finally boils. <br /> <br /> This movie really struck me emotionally, I got angry along with some of the characters, and sad with them. I could feel their pain due to the excellent performances that were given. <br /> <br /> The ending was a surprise to me, but according to the growth of the characters. <br /> <br />
