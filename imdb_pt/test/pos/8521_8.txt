As the 1970s came to an end, rumors in the entertainment industry began to surface about Sean Connery's possible return to the role he made famous in 1962 - James Bond. He was asked to Cubby Broccoli on location in Brazil during the realization of 'Moonraker' by BBC Barry Norman as he saw the prospect. Understandably, the producer was reluctant to compromise with an opinion. When 'Moonraker' opened, Bond fans were outraged by what they thought was a character's cheapness, and the jump to the 'Star'. The bands of Wars as well as 'Live & Let Die' had done with the blaxploitation craze a few years before. Many publicly expressed their hope that Connery would return, even if only to show Eon how a real James movie should look like. <br /> <br /> Years of legal battles followed. The original screenplay, titled "Secret Service James Bond" (later titled "Warhead") was written by Kevin McClory, Len Deighton and Connery, never filmed and remains one of the great blockbusters of undone movies. <br /> <br /> A new script, closer to the plot 'Thunderball', was commissioned. It was written by Lorenzo Semple Junior, better known as the man who put the camp in 'Batman'. He also wrote 'The Parallax View', one of the best conspiracy thrillers of the decade. Feeling that the script needed a British touch, Connery brought in Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, writers of the British sitcoms 'The Likely Lads' and 'Porridge'. The witty title was suggested by Connery's wife, Micheline. <br /> <br /> "Never Say Never Again," opened just before Christmas 1983, for a shower of critical praise; usually sensible critics were so ecstatic with Connery's return that they ignored every other aspect of the film. Many used it to ruthlessly attack Roger Moore's series, particularly that year's "Octopussy." In fact, 'Octopussy' is superior in all respects. 'Never' does not have the thrill and spectacle associated with Bond, sometimes it looks like a TV version. movie. The story had been made earlier and better in 'Thunderball' 1965, so 'Never' would always come in second place. It was also hampered by not being part of the official series, which means that Monty Norman's "James Bond Theme" and the gun barrel logo of Maurice Binder could not be used. <br /> <br /> As Bond, Connery is magnificent, effortlessly, returning to his most famous role. Playing Bond as an older, intelligent agent worked. Barbara Carrera got her best film role as the villain 'Fatima Blush', a lady whose love for murder is such that she dances afterwards (so she thinks) by killing Bond. Kim Basinger burns as 'Domino'. As S.P.E.C.T.R.E. agent Maximillian Largo, Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a chilling performance. One big disappointment, though, is Max Von Sydow as "Blofeld". The posters gave the impression that he would be an important character, in fact he appears only in some scenes. With a stronger script, he could have been one of the greatest villains of all time. 'Never' promised to be a setback for the first Eon Bonds, like 'From Russia With Love', but did not deliver. The gadgets were there, but they were used almost in apology. Bond's rocket motorcycle was a tiring device even in the 1960s. The film tried to compete with Eon's Bonds in terms of humor. Saving yourself by throwing your own urine sample on the face of a killer is a farcical moment like any other you'll find in 'Moonraker'. But the nadir comes with the introduction of Rowan Atkinson as the Foreign Office official 'Nigel Small-Fawcett'. He gives such an incredibly horrible performance that you wonder if he thought he was in a Footlights magazine. <br /> <br /> Michel Legrand's music is horrible, the man seems to never have seen a Bond movie in his life. <br /> <br /> Although the film was a financial success, seen years later, it is the weakest of the 80s. Connery himself was disappointed with this, and did not play a movie again for a few years. <br /> <br /> 1983 was a good year for 007 maniacs, in addition to the films of Connery and Moore, George Lazenby made a delicious cameo on the made-for-TV 'Return of the Man from UNCLE.: The Fifteen Year Case later'.
