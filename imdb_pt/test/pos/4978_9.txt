I really liked this movie. I have a real sense of justice and an eye for an eye, and this film offers this in spades. Glenn Ford is offered a very low price for his ranch by the great farmer in the valley; then one of his ranch hands is beaten and thrown "to help him decide on the sale." When the farm's hand dies, and the sheriff refuses to do anything, Ford seems at first reluctant to do anything, warning his men not to take matters into their own hands. But that's exactly what he's about to do. I knew this movie was about to catch fire when he walked into the hall and stared at the guy (Richard Jaeckel, one of my favorite evil characters actors) who killed the hand of his ranch; after a delicate exchange of dialogue with him, Glenn Ford slaps his face and kills him. Sort of a little more justice, he kills this guy with the gun that belonged to his murdered cowboy. In a short time, we are treated with Ford leaving his ranch to be burned, so his men are justified in ambushing the crew of the other ranch; then Ford and his men sacked all the horses and cattle of the great villain's ranch; then they appear and burn the outbuildings and the big house on the ground. Talk about earning a great time. Lots of action in this movie. There's more to the story than that, but I'll just recommend that you watch the movie. Glenn Ford was someone who showed over and over what could happen when you misjudged someone, and I really enjoyed seeing him do the old fashioned justice.
