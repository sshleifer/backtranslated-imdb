Let's make it clear from the start: I'm an idiot with the emotional sensitivity of the cubic stone. Therefore, I consider the dramas of people with disabilities, the social stigma or any illness they have and scream about it like stupid movies in bad taste. I mean, if you have a message, you can say it without the help of sick or miserable people. <br /> <br /> However, I liked this movie. It's about people with incredible bad luck, like personal health, but they do not cry about it, quite the contrary, they try to live and people try to "protect" or "take care" of them by actively removing them from real life. life. The message is to live life to the fullest, even if the end is as sad as possible. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: how the dramas of sick people go, this is a guardian. It's sad, but hopeful. I like James McAvoy, even though he always seems to represent the arrogant rebel. I also say that Steven Robertson played very well. Either that or he actually has partial paralysis. :)
