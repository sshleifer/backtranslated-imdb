A visually graceful but interesting film is mainly the plot. The film portrays a zigzag progress of exploring the deeper feeling of the lead actor. Max, who lives in New York two years ago and intends to marry a girl he met there, returns to Paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend, whom he still enjoys very much but finally discovers what he really loves the most. is your best friend. Narrative nonlinear, so many flashbacks and all parts are well articulated. The three women Max knew symbolized something we should pursue, though we may not have a clear picture of the underlying motivations. His bride is what he needs instead of what he loves and therefore completely no loyalty we can see. Nor does she give you love, but only stability. True love also can not be found in his relationship with the ex-girlfriend. Just a fantasy for him to escape - many very romantic things he did for her, but almost nothing seems nice. The one who really animates Max's life, in fact, is her best friend. The balance reached at the end is not the same as the initial balance because Max understands much more about his innermost feeling. The nonlinear structure makes research progress seem more complicated. It's not as ingenious as "Pulp Fiction," but things look much more natural in "The Apartment." Max is not the only character that undergoes a transformation and, in fact, interesting is also the description of Romane Bohringer. Good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful. A good comment of today's love and undoubtedly a movie that is worth seeing. <br /> <br />
