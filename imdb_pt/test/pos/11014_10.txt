One of the best movies I've ever seen - a classic "Matrix" movie. For many years I have been trying to get it on VHS or DVD - to no avail. The German film industry still prefers to leave valuable cultural contributions (after all, this is Fassbinder!) Rot and collect dust in some files rather than distribute it commercially (and make a lot of money if that is what stimulates rather than promoting creative thinking). However, WDR once told me if I paid DM 200.00 to verify the copyright (non-refundable) and then 8 DM per minute of copy plus the cost of the materials, then they will consider preparing a copy (single! ) For me. Some way to sell something! The same problem we have with many other TV movies or series like "So, weit die Füße tragen", "Sonntagseltern", "Kellerkinder" and others. Excellent TV series - never to be heard again. Germany, wake up! <br /> <br /> March 2007 UPDATE: Last year I finally got a DVD copy of WDR's "Mittschnittservice" for over 50 euros. Great!
