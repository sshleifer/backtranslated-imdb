Fantastic, deeply moving crime thriller starring Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan. <br /> <br /> From the vertiginous sequence of opening to the extremely satisfactory conclusion, this cat and the mother almost do not lose the rhythm. <br /> <br /> Johnny To, again working with the composer ace Arthur Wong, builds another operatic actioner that sprouts up in front of his contemporaries. <br /> <br /> The images of To are strong and moving. His court, combined with the extraordinary musical tracks, is exemplary. You are in the hands of a film master. <br /> <br /> The two sequences in which Andy Lau "hides" from the cops on a bus, pretending to accompany an agile beauty (Ruby Wong), are a testament to the uniqueness of To. leadership skills. <br /> <br /> Lau Ching Wan is strong and authoritarian as the tormented cop while Andy Lau is dynamic as a dying revenge for the death of his father. <br /> <br /> This is superb film-making, only slightly compromised by some English dubbing in a scene with the criminal Waise Lee.
