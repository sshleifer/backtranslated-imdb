I heard a lot about 'The English Patient' and finally decided to take the CD and find out what all this Burmese was about. What I discovered was cinematic delight and, I repeat, "should" always be observed with an open mind. If you're a religious and moral fanatic, I'm afraid this is not a movie for you because you will not be able to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you will continue to insist on the moral dilemmas that this movie creates. As I remember correctly before watching this movie, I read the review on this site and I was completely disgusted with the opinions of the person I quoted saying "that the protagonists deserved what they received." When it comes to morality, I agree with it, but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I have rarely seen such a beautifully crafted film. I keep hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. First and foremost this is a love story and yes it is an extramarital affair (moralists, care), but let's not focus on it. Instead, let's focus on how the story was told. It's a mix of flashbacks and the present. It is set in World War II and tells the story of a survivor of an air crash (Count Almazhy was beautifully played by Ralph Fiennes), who is taken care of by an army nurse (Juliet Binoche) in war-devastated Italy just before the start of conflict. end (defeat of the axis powers). The burn of the patient with much pain continued to recall the torrid affair he had with an Englishwoman Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) shown in flashbacks set in prewar Africa. The past and the present are so cleverly intertwined in history that you are kind of transported into history and have the feel of a bystander at first hand. The places in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and the characters too. I'm a romantic and I'm not ashamed to say I had tears after it's over. Watch with someone you truly love. The movie begins and ends with the same desert scene where the sand dunes twist and curve like a woman's body and it was breathtaking. The sense of loss and sadness has been so overwhelmingly transmitted by the actors that it makes me wonder why God! Why do we have wars that destroy the beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the destruction of Innocence? <br /> <br /> Anyway, deservedly won a lot of Oscars and I will go hunting for other works by director Anthony Minghella. This kind of brings back the romanticism in the genre of David Lean's films. It almost reminds me of 'Lawrence of Arabia, which was also desert-based.
