This is a very realistic film. It's the most realistic I've ever seen in urban youth. The actors were great. I'm going to look for more Gomez movies. I had never heard of the movie until someone mentioned it recently. I bought it on DVD. I was impressed. I have not seen anything come close to life as I do in Philadelphia. That comes quite close - in fact, a scene in which there is an accident (I will not ruin and give details) reminded me of an almost identical situation in Philadelphia. At first I thought Gomez took the scene from that real-life event, but then I realized that he made the film a few years before that. I also agree with the point that this movie did not try to broaden its appeal by putting on Hollywood crap. Gomez also directed "Laws of Gravity" - I look forward to seeing him.
