Dolemite is one of the best movies with a pimp like a hero, who knocks the man down, getting in touch with all the best women the ghetto has to offer. Remember that these women know karate and are great naughty women. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - The final scene of the fight is pretty crazy, with Dolemite ripping out Willy Green's heart. Make sure your copy has no rating. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a cast full of innovative and brilliant characters like Hamburger Pimp, Reverend, Mayor, Queen Bee and others. The set is great, and the sets are full of 1970s style. There are a few messes in production, like boom microphones popping up accidentally, among other things, but that adds to the charm and laughter. <br /> <br /> I would recommend drinking a pack of 6 before and during this movie, and keeping square and man at a distant distance.
