I'm not sure I like this movie or not. I think it's scary and completely weird. Chris Glover, as always, did a great performance as Layne. I think his performance was very good and one of the best, but I do not like the character. The performance of Keanu Reeves was very good, and I really felt for his character. Most of all I think the whole cast gave great performances as if they felt the characters were real. I did not like some, but I genuinely felt sorry for others (Keanu Reeves). I would like to know if this was the original ending that the film should have, because it did not end as I had hoped. I was disappointed with the ending and did not feel like it did the rest of the movie justice. If you like weird, weird and very different movies, choose this one. If you like things that are normal, please stay away.
