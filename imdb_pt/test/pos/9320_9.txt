One of the best musical bios. Dennis Morgan is great as the singer / songwriter Chauncey Olcutt. The supporting cast is very good, especially Andrea King as the glamorous Lillian Russell. The turn of the century atmosphere is the perfect setting. The technicolor is excellent. A simple plot, but the movie just makes you feel good. Morgan has always been underestimated as an actor and singer.
