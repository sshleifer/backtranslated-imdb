Okay, here we go, you've probably read in previous reviews about this movie that is horrible, misrepresented, avoid at all costs. Well, I suppose in some ways this is true, it's fair to say that you can not write a spoiler in this comment as there is no plan to ruin it. However, there is a fine line between the horrible and absolutely hilarious and believe that this movie is the last. The acting is so bad, the plot so non-existent and the ending so utterly disconcerting it will make you laugh all the time. There are scenes in this movie that take comedy to a new level. Do not expect an Oscar winner, but believe me for the small price you'll pay for this disaster, it's worth every penny.
