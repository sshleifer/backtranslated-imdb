Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), called Ale abbreviated, works in a auto body shop in what came to be known as the Iron Triangle, a 20-story stretch of self-dismantling and car dealerships near Shea Stadium. Queens, New York. Here customers do not question whether the parts come from stolen cars or because they are able to receive such large discounts, they simply spend their money and expect everything to be on the increase. Despicable outsias such as these are not highlighted in tour guides, but Iranian-American director Ramin Bahrani puts them on vivid display in Chop Shop, a powerful Indie film that received great affection last year at Cannes, Berlin and Toronto. Following his acclaimed "Man Push Cart," Bahrani spent a year and a half at the site that F. Scott Fitzgerald described as the Great Gatsby as "the valley of the ashes." <br /> <br /> Despite all its description of desolation, Chop Shop is not a work of social criticism, but, like Hector Babenco's Pixote, a study of pungent character, in which the survival of a boy is bought at the price of his innocence. Filmed in Willets Point, Queens, Bahrani makes you feel like you're there, sweating in a hot, humid New York summer with all its noise and chaos. The focus of the film is on the charming 12-year-old Ale, who lives on the outskirts without any support or supervision from an adult other than his boss (Rob Sowulski), the real-life owner of the Iron Triangle garage. Polanco's performance is raw and somewhat uneven but he won the standing ovation he received at the premiere of the film in Cannes along with a hug from Iranian great director Abbas Kiarostami. Cramped in a small room above the garage together with his 16-year-old sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales) who works by dispensing food from a lunch wagon, Ale is like one of the interchangeable spare parts with which he deals with. While he dreams of owning his own food service van, in the city that never sleeps, he knows that the only thing that can do the "top of the pile" is another crumpled fender. In this environment, Ale and Isi use all the necessary means to keep their heads above water while their love for each other remains constant and they still laugh and stage the childhood that was never theirs. As Barack Obama says in his book "Dreams of My Father," the change may come later when his eyes stop laughing and they close something inside. Meanwhile, Ale complements his earnings by selling chocolate bars on crowded New York subways with his friend Carlos (Carlos Zapata) and pushing pirate DVDs on the corners, while Isi does tricks for truck drivers to save enough money to buy the stuff. rusty $ 4500 van in which they expect to start their own business. <br /> <br /> Although Ale is a "good boy", he is not above stealing pockets and hubcaps in the Shea Stadium parking lot, events that Bahrani's camera observes without judgment. At Chop Shop, Bahrani provided a compelling antidote to the success stories won by the Hollywood dream factory, and gave us a film of impressive naturalism and respect for its characters, similar in many respects to the great Italian neo-realist films. and recent Iranian works by Kiarostami, Panahi and others. Although the outcome of the characters is far from certain, Bahrani makes sure we notice a giant poster at Shea Stadium that says, "Make dreams come true," leaving us with the insinuation that, in Rumi's phrase, "the drum of achievement of that promise is beating "
