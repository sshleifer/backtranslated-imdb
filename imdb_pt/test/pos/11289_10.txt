The existentialist experience of E. Elias Merhige in the enduring is definitely a hell of a boring clock. This is like something that Alexander de Large was forced to watch in "Mechanical Orange". But despite how unattainable this movie really is, it's a success. <br /> <br /> If you're reading this and have not seen the movie then it's too late. For me at least the reward (after 3 separate views with lots of pause between you) was to see the list of characters * after * the story was told. That's when the simple message came home. But I wonder if Merhige could have told a 5-minute story in about 30 instead of 78. However, seeing how the credits cast is featured prominently on the front page of this film , the cat is already out of the bag and you will certainly only enjoy this movie if you enjoy the existentialist cinema of the early twentieth century. Even so, you may vomit. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but I recommend Merhige for creating a work of art, even if it is unacceptable)
