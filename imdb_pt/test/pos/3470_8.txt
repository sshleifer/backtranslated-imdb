Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the "flowering" of one of them. An embittered, young "Spike" (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly befriends a young man (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside the home, but McAvoy and he are committed and determined to return to the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and moving and often moving tale of inner strength, overcoming physical disabilities. The two tracks are great, especially Robertson, who certainly must have spent some time studying the disabled to get this complicated role. It appears in almost every scene and acts like an absolute storm. For those who do not know, they may think that it actually has CB. Highly recommended.
