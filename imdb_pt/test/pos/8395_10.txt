This is one of the most insightful movies I have ever seen. The script language, customs, scenery, plot, characters, etc., are all supreme. You will not be bored. I watched intensely or just listened to this movie while working so many times that I lost count. Scarlett ages gracefully, gaining wisdom beyond her years in the end. This film takes you from Tara to Ireland where your family comes from and you see the results of another civil war there, this time between the Irish and the English. <br /> <br /> This movie portrays the double standards of men at the time - a man is still respected if he has girlfriends and prostitutes, but not a woman. If it is seen only in a private place with a man, society accuses it of impropriety. And of course Scarlett was always thinking outside the box, breaking rules when necessary to create the necessary change, helping people and / or surviving. <br /> <br /> The beauty of Scarlett is definitely up to the bone. Her strength, self-esteem and wisdom grow as she ages. <br /> <br /> I remember your words when I find myself very much on my plate, like "tomorrow is another day," and the way she behaved, her determination and courage, and learned from her experiences. This is a good movie to show to your daughters that it teaches a woman how important it is to have respect for herself and that men, especially the very handsome ones, can have two sides and treat a woman differently depending on how she acts and respects itself. An attractive woman needs to learn what this movie teaches. <br /> <br /> This movie is like therapy to me, and it's better than Gone with the Wind. The second part happens in Ireland and anyone who is decent Irish will appreciate the scenery, the people and the character of Scarlett.
