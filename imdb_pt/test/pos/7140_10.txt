This is more than a Sat. afternoon special. Extremely well written if very low key there is much here if you look at it. Take the companion cat / scout for example. Not only could it have been a comic book, it should have been a comic book. The comic book industry (as well as the movie advertisers) missed the boat. One of the least really knows great movies. A great screenplay by John Sayles is a strong point, but the acting is also good. Probably the best "superhero" movie I've ever seen. Short on special effects, but long on credibility. This is a guardian. I've never seen a DVD of this movie, but I used to have a VHS version. Good hunting
