And what is your gender? Behind the scenes expose history; what theatrical life really is like behind the curtains of Broadway (and others). Certainly has a lot of competition: Singing in the Rain, both I and II (1929 and 1952), 42nd Street, Golddiggers of (you cite the year); Ladies of 1934; Noises Off (1992) from the far side and A Star is Born I and II from the 1930s and 1950s from the tragic side: not to mention Summer Stock of 1950: the list keeps rolling. So what makes this movie so special? And why are there so few comments on this incredibly big movie? So few people actually saw this? How amazing to see a young Frank Langella pre-Dracula and Pre-Frost-Nixon for 30 years! How amazing to see the cool and talented Tom Hulce so pre-Amadeus! And yet another superb Stiller! What a wonderful line of talented people at their best from so long ago! And this script! Who was this David Shaber? So full of realistic disillusionment and pathos compared to the usual sentimentality and feel good comedy! As especially exemplified by the Star-Is-Born-like episode, where the heroine reaches Broadway, while Langella's character has to settle for yet another provincial tour. <br /> <br /> Langella's subsequent hysterical and sadistic explosion against the stars. struck Latin teacher and his granddaughter in that he expels his fury and frustration is just one of the many fantastic and psychologically real moments in the film. (The Latin teacher and her behind-the-scenes love affair certainly echo Marlene Dietrich and her teacher seduced in The Blue Angel of 1929.) Another in the series of mercenaries and cold-hearted agents like Kevin McCarthy, who was preceded by Burt Lancaster in The Sweet. Smell of Success (1957) and succeeded by Alan Alda in Clubland (2001) in the history of cinema. The sexual release of the Hulce character resembles similar incidents in O'Neill's great comedy, Ah, Wilderness. <br /> <br /> And what a tribute to the long-lost operettas: The Red Mill of Victor Herbert; Rose Marie and The Hobo King by Rudolf Friml; The Song of the Desert by Sigmund Romberg etc. What satirical insertions of parts of the great plays play like Romeo and Juliet. Homage to the theater itself as expostulated by the star Langella. The richness and depth of this film are simply endless. And to be sealed by such a title! Who could have an idea of ​​what this great movie is about a title so ridiculous and insurmountable? But on the other hand, what title could apply to such a magnificent drama that could have lived up to its emotional and exciting content? <br /> <br /> PS: I just saw (Frank Langella) your latest movie. Spectacular performance: as Richard Nixon in Frost-Nixon. How this great actor after 30 years simply goes from triumph to triumph!
