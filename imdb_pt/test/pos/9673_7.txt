I own all the family face stations so far and I have to say Vol. 6 was the biggest disappointment of them all. There are still many laughs to be found here, but I think Vol. 6 as the later volumes is slowly providing less and less laughter. At least for me. <br /> <br /> The biggest annoyance I had with Vol. 6 seems to be very heavy on left-wing politics. I sincerely believe that if you can laugh at other people, you must laugh at yourself, but this volume really seems to stick your political views in your throat and I think it takes a lot of the show. Insinuated all conservative states are horrible places, Insinuating we need more gun control, Insinuated school are under funding, Insinuated religious people are crazy, Bush is devil's friend .. I could go and this is only from the first three episodes Of course that some things were funny but it gets to a point when you're not making a comedy and you're just pushing your political opinions about other people.
