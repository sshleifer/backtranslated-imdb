Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a Texan congressman, womanizer and impoverished, with no discernible legislative record. In 1980, he was interested in the situation in Afghanistan, which is in the midst of a brutal war with the USSR. Under the auspices of his old, ardent Texan social-socialist, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), he travels to Afghanistan to assess the situation and is shocked by what he sees. He returns to the US determined to help the Afghans, only to find his colleagues extremely indifferent to the situation - and himself under investigation for drug use allegations. Relentless, Wilson recruits Herring and the vulgar and exiled CIA agent, Gustav Avrakotos (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), to start a complicated arms deal involving Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and a largely unknown US Congress. Ultimately, the Afghans defeat the Soviets, but as the United States celebrates its victory, Wilson and Avrakotos find their warnings about Afghanistan's post-war instability by not listening. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is a brain candy. a really cool movie for the most intellectual viewer and entertaining entertainment for the movie goer. The film brings together an incredible variety of talents, both in front of and behind the camera, and fulfills the promise of being a great time. The movie has only one flaw, which we'll get later. As an examination of the unlikely way in which the greatest secret war of the 20th century was waged - and perhaps the way things are done by the CIA and other intelligence agencies - is fascinating. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting on several levels. The story depicted in the film - with all its scandalous double-dealing, covert covert operations and, most of all, its success - would be as outrageous as a work of fiction, which could easily be dismissed as satire. But things really worked that way, at least within reasonable limits. The film portrays our three protagonists in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without obscuring their flaws. Wilson as a person who does not apologize for his vices (even hugging them) - even if he is willing to embrace a just cause. Herring is a sort of elitist, and its born-again righteousness attitude is discouraging - but it is deeply committed to the cause of the Afghan people. Avrakotos is a CIA outsider with an attitude problem, despised because of his "street" past - but his love for the country and hatred of communism are unshakable. The fact that this strange trio could play an important role in the fall of the USSR is not only proof that anyone can make a difference, but also that truth is stranger than fiction. It's also very interesting that all of this is interpreted as a comedy - not surprising given that our writer is Aaron Sorkin, but it's an interesting way to approach that story. <br /> <br /> The film, however, has a drawback, which is a bit surprising. The film seems to cheerfully celebrate the feat of Wilson and company. That's fine - nothing wrong with defeating the Soviet Union, is it there? - until it is considered that from the ashes of the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan came the Taliban and eventually al-Qaeda. Regardless of the level of US responsibility, this has happened, and the film's picture of Wilson's success is almost absolute. To be fair, the film addresses this issue at the end, with a fairly current discourse by Wilson about the inability of the US to clean up, but it is done so tertiary that the average viewer is not likely to get much out of it. . The general impression will be that these three notable people helped the Afghans to defeat the Soviets. This is not a fatal disadvantage, remember, but it's a worrying aspect of a brilliant movie. <br /> <br /> The talent of the film is remarkable. The legendary Mike Nichols offers a stylish and beautiful production; the material is perfectly suited to its discreet and directive style. Sorkin offers yet another brilliant script; the film has dozens of quotable lines and classic Sorkin exchanges (the best being the "Scotch Bottle" discussion between Wilson and Avrakotos), and retains something of a political and historical perspective behind it. The cast of the film is a marvel: Tom Hanks does a great performance as the lovable rogue with a cause, Julia Roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as obnoxious but committed Joanne, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals all scenes (as usual) as the abrasive Gus. . The always lovely Amy Adams takes another step on her journey to stardom as Wilson's long-time assistant, and Ned Beatty, Om Puri, Emily Blunt, Christopher Denham and Ken Stott lend support to the cast. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is a clever and entertaining movie, a wonderful entertainment a little more than light. The fact that he decides not to be more than that should not be held against him; it's brilliant at what it does. <br /> <br /> 8/10
