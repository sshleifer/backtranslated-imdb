I've seen this movie once a long time, just once, and I did not know where it came from, and I looked for about six years to find it, and finally I found it here on the IMDb! Just the whole concept of the film is great, I believe it has something to do with a race of bioengineering beings, maintaining control over us and our planet, but there is one person who is no longer assimilated to conformity. And the way he does this, to avoid being tracked and located, is what keeps the movie entertaining. I do not remember exactly how it ended, but I remember it ended with a great climax and a good turnaround.
