I liked this movie. The way these mutants looked, along with the tone of the movie, is very good. Also, David Cronenberg as Philip K. Decker was great! It makes me wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life (except for the murders, of course). <br /> <br /> I was impressed with the creatures for this movie, although this movie probably had a somewhat low budget. , the mutants / creatures / monsters looked great, especially from 1990. This is definitely a unique movie and not a crap. It makes me want to find a novel on which it is based. This is an interesting movie because it shows how humans can be monsters and the "monsters" are the only one with humanity.
