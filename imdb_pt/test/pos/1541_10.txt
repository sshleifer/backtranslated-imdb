Cabinet Ground. The title itself evokes thoughts of secrets. And that's really what's at the heart of this Amnesty International film. Secrets of government, personal secrets, both are integral parts of this story. By far the greatest performance seen in a long time, both Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe were phenomenal in their interpretation of a Governmental Interrogator and Victim respectively. With only the two actors in this unusual standard length film, it is immediately clear that both actors were dedicated and talented enough to pull the viewer into this little bubble of a world and close the door. <br /> <br /> A word of caution ... <br /> <br /> What is not mentioned in the description of this movie is that there is a subplot that deals with childhood sexual abuse. While there are no graphic details about the abuse, his nature can be difficult for some viewers to watch - especially given the intensity of the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> I am not a big fan of Amnesty. International films, but this movie attracted me because the acting was so exceptional, and I can not help but make this film one of my personal favorites.
