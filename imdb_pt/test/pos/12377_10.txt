Some will say that this movie is a guilty pleasure. I loved this movie, but I do not feel guilty about it. You can tell that all the cast and crew had fun making this movie. But Jack Frost 2 will not get along with some people. From the beginning you can say that this movie will be tacky and definitely has an amateurish appearance. Well, if you have the privilege of watching this movie, after watching it, remember that Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman is a pleasure, not a guilty pleasure. Now, because I can not fill ten lines here, some great scenes: <br /> <br /> SPOILERS The three women on the beach had huge deaths. The first had Jack in a tree trying to drop pendants into one of them. He remained missing, so he dropped an anvil on it. The next woman fell on an ice bed. The last of them was stabbed in the eyes with tweezers. <br /> <br /> The other big one was where two stoners surfers are hanging near a frozen pole. One of them is trapped (of course). Jack Frost pulls him back and pulls out his tongue as he says "COWA-TONGUE-A DUDE!". Well, you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the snowball kids kicked their asses. <br /> <br /> ** END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> infinite stars
