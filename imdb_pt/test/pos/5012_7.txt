The basis for this dynamic docudrama is the true story of one of the most extraordinary card players of all time. STUEY is a tight, cohesive biopic of a real ace of poker whose life is a one-way trip to Hell with few detours. <br /> <br /> This dramatic feature sets itself apart from other poker movies. It represents a rare and serious attempt to bring to the silver screen a true story of the ultimate compulsion for gambling. The complete obsession that annihilates any closeness of spirituality and nullifies any chance of redemption. This is the least likely movie an executive at Vegas Casino would recommend. And it's the only poker DVD you'll probably find on the shelves of Gamblers Annonymous. <br /> <br /> There are scenes in this movie that poker aficionados refer to as some of the best betting scenes of all time. Stu reading his opponent's hand and, in particular, a bluff scene in Texas hold'em. <br /> <br /> Prophetically, at the beginning of the movie, we see a young Stu being bullied by a band of neighborhood thugs. Poker is for the lonely who seek revenge. It's a game of patience that bullies do not have. 'You can not intimidate me!' It may well be an underlying feeling of punitive force that a champion poker player sets off on his opponents. <br /> <br /> Conservatives will look at this movie as a cautionary tale of a soul lost in sin. They might evoke Mark Twain: "The best data throw is throwing them away." The young and liberal masses will inevitably have a more simplistic and supportive view. They may not have heard of Twain's quote but will surely remember an observation made by Stu's stunned friend who learns from Stuey that he has won a car from a local character in a game overnight. "You tell them to go to hell and they're looking forward to the trip." <br /> <br /> The mosaic of Las Vegas vignettes that we see in STUEY will remain in memory for a long time. Frank Sinatra, the most generous tipper? Forget it! No one is as extravagant as a sniper. And for visitors to Las Vegas who may not know the impact of the fall on the quality of their stay, check out Stu's scene while staying at a hotel in Las Vegas! <br /> <br /> 'This is what I should do, this is where I should be.
