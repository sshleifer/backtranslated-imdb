This movie is about a group of four friends who destroy a car while driving. They build a campfire to stay the night and wait for help. To pass the time, they tell scary stories to each other. Talking about it would ruin the movie, so rent and enjoy !! <br /> <br /> I'll say it starts a bit slowly, but every story gets better and better. This film is starring some of today's best actors, Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movies), James Marsden (Disturbing Behavior) and Ron Livingston (Office Space). So you can see that there are big name stars, but not really big ones! Go rent or buy as fast as possible !! This movie is incredible!
