I hate vampire movies. With that said, this was very interesting for me. I want to stress one thing tho. "bakjwi" literally means bat in Korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you see Count Dracula or vampires turning into a bat and flying away or wuheva. We also know that bats are mammals that can fly, so many categorize them as "exceptional". While watching the movie, I realized that the bat theme is deeply rooted in this film more than just to make the vampire-bat connection. <br /> <br /> Duality of human nature = if you ever read Aesop's fables, there is a fable in which mammals and birds are fighting and a bat seems unable to take a side and tries to play both ways to your advantage. Mammals and birds discover what this bat is doing and banish the bat from their land at the end of the story. <br /> <br /> The two contradictory sides of human nature are constantly in battle throughout the ex movie. friend of the blind priest of Sang-hyun, Sang-hyun's effort to quench thirst and his sexual desire, tae-ju playing both sides, his ordinary boring life. your vampire adventure, etc. (it will not spoil much, you have to watch the movie) and this theme is beautifully presented in a plate with delicious sides of romance, sex, violence, religion, dark comedy, tragedy, revenge, his name! <br /> <br /> I feel that many I find this movie boring and very long, but this movie is very new and new, something I have not yet seen b4. I would not say this is the best job at CW Park, but we are. def. the strangest to understand, yet darkly intriguing!
