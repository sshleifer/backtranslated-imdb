"Do not Torture a Duckling" is one of the coolest Italian horror movies I've ever seen, and I've seen my part. To call it giallo is a bit misleading, because it's not really a typical mystery of murder. It's more of a straight horror movie. <br /> <br /> Complete with one of the most brutal and bloody scenes of such an old film, Fulci's spinning and spinning film overflows with a scary environment and an old-school Italian mood. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect. The ending is genuine and original. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Do not Torture the Duckling" you really have to wonder how the back material of Fulci became so out of fashion. I like all his things, but he's gone astray. Maybe he thought he already did it ... Because with this movie, he hits the target. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who thinks Dario Argento owns the giallo genre. Fulci hits him with this. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 children.
