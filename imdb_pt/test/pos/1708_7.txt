Like talk shows, Larry King Live is not bad, and since he occasionally gets good guests, it's a show to call from time to time, but not compulsively. When Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, a former president or other important guests sit in front of him, it's not too bad. At other times he tends to get guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal that does not contribute any smart information to the country and feeds an uneducated audience who wants to hear the latest gossip about movie stars and TV. During the OJ Simpson trial, it seemed that all the other guests on his show were related to the case. But is this really journalism? Or the National Enquirer in the tube? Sometimes it comes out a little like the trash TV - Jerry Springer in an interview with phone calls rather than a live audience. <br /> <br /> On the other side, King's show is definitely much better than Bill. O'Reilly whose show is nothing more than a more certain political platform of the Rush Limbaugh variety. That said, Larry King is not a bad interviewer, but unfortunately he is not great. King does not always go out as he fully understands when intellectual material is being presented, especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics. It always seems like the minute that King can not handle the problem, is when he turns to the phone calls, maybe hoping someone in the country has a better question than he. He could interview someone like David Gergen, but he may not have read any of his books. More or less like the movie producer who never bothered to read the screenplay. <br /> <br /> When you are an entertainment celebrity, no problem. He may leave as if he is well informed, since the material is not so substantive anyway. Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not exactly rocket science. And I notice that he usually saw the last movie of the star. Watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book. However, if it is the likes of John Dean or Bob Woodward, King quit a bit as if he had not finished homework. Then to the phones. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a real and deep interview, Terry Gross of NPR is probably the best interviewer in the United States. She reads and / or researches everything written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas. I do not see King doing this. Sure enough, he probably has a thousand-times-bigger audience than Terry Gross, which can say more about the American audience than King. In short, Larry is better than Bill, but not as good as Terry.
