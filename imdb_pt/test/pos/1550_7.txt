I kind of liked this movie of Columbus for its atmosphere, which was like a real thriller and its approach, sometimes I even remembered film-noir, the movie its first 30 minutes or something. It's very cool and done in an old-fashioned way, with the right camera angles and the use of light. It does not instantly mean that this movie is brilliant, but it's solid enough to consider this a good entry into the Columbus movie. It's definitely a better movie than the average Columbus movie entry. 26 years after his previous appearance in the movie Columbus, George Hamilton returns once again to play the lead role alongside Peter Falk, again as the killer. , in a totally different and new role, of course. I liked him in his role and he was a good villain of Columbus, who gave the good old lieutenant a good contest. They had some cool sequences together. The problem with Columbo's "modern" movies has always been that he did not have a well-known good actor, opposite Peter Falk. This film obviously does not suffer from this problem. But I must say that this film does not present Peter Falk at this very moment. He certainly played the character better and his performance is not consistent enough within the film, which is probably also due to the film of its director Daryl Duke, who also directed the really terrible movie "Tai-Pan" among many other projects. It has a very nice and nice story but the fact that the same kind of plot to cover up the murder was used earlier in a previous Columbus film also does not help, of course. It was formerly used in the 1975 film "Columbo: Reproduction". However, it is clear that it also still has quite "original" moments of its own, although, of course, in essence, each film Columbus is more or less the same. But that's okay, that's what made the Columbo series so big and consistent. If it is not broke, do not fix it. <br /> <br /> It is also true that within this film more clues than normal are left for the lieutenant, which does not mean that the film is the killer. more stupid or sloppy, but I see more as writers being more enthusiastic than others. This does not make the movie or the story bad and in fact perhaps even make it more enjoyable, see Columbus working hard and discovering all kinds of small but important clues. Fortunately, the film is also replete with a fun and effective comedy from Columbus. <br /> <br /> Simply a good entry for the Columbus movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
