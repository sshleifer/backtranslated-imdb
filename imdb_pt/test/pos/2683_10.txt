This is, in short, the TV comedy series with the best cast of all time, and the friendliest ones as well. Each one is a first hand comedy actor. I know only one TV series that was better The King of Queens has a handful of actors who are as good as you can enjoy - Kevin James, Leah Remini, Jerry Stiller, Patton Oswalt, Nicole Sullivan , Victor Williams, Gary Valentine, and even everyone else ... I spontaneously and continually and readily enjoyed it. Old age did not spoil the fun, anyway. series is clever and original, miraculously spared from the stupidity of current TV and trash.It is politically incorrect and does not court minorities in the usual disgusting way. <br /> <br /> Comic strip is very palatable and tasty. > <br /> I read, mostly with approve writers, and sometimes they write about their favorite shows still, although these writers are several, I found in none of them the least mention of my favorite TV shows (- but it is true that critics who like themselves are not those with whom he finds himself in complete approval - but those who at least offer a common ground for disapproval - who are, in particular, WILD WILD WEST, MOONLIGHTING, QUEENS, FANTOMAS, TWILIGHT ZONE of the 80s, TV program of Bradbury and SANDOKAN. Most of them I saw when I was 13 years and 14 years old; on some of them I wrote and execrably.
