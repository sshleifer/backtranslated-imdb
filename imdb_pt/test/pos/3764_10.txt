Some have said that this was a nose-glorifying film, but short of the original blend of Dr. Hyde, no drug has been developed so far that can provide THIS effect. If Viagra was the stage of mold, this sparkling white powder is the evolutionary step of Stephen Hawking (or at least the idiot pharmacist branch). This reality show is really about the sacred cows of medicine, seen as it was the emperor without clothes. Few of us want to question the health field; both because most of us would not have lived to our present age had we been born before "modern medicine", and because our subconscious hopes that we will continue to live if we have faith in the helping professions. Thus, the geniuses who produced this film made jokes with those of Calcutta Bessy, giving us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern institution of medicine. The timing was right, and many could see the commercial side of the healing companies behind the Oz curtain. A decade earlier, when George C. Scott was discussing The Hospital, my wife and I were sitting at the crowded premiere in Oklahoma City. Just as in the remake of Jekyll and Hyde, we were barely able to avoid falling from the seat and laughed and howled uncontrollably for the whole duration. The hundreds of other members of the audience were in deadly silence. They were shocked that doctors, nurses and hospital institutions were being ridiculed. It was as if Papa, Billy Graham, and Gandhi were sitting in the Animal House, beer-stained shirts and all, competing to see who could tell God's funny jokes among the belges. If the Hospital had been a comedy of clowning instead of a satire, they could see what was being shown to them. Unfortunately, they were like Republicans in a September 11 Michael Moore exhibit. Perhaps small gold parachutes had been given to corporate corrupt corporate leaders, health insurance companies would have had a harder time denying medical care, and health care providers would have been demystified earlier if George C. Scott had been in a tutu while delivered his terrible truths. But - forget everything I just said. Watch the movie, be consciously made happy and cheerful and full of laughter as the best satire on Saturday Night Live, and let the subconscious plunge into the documentary of the underlying reality. Just do not blame me when "Got to Got to Got" becomes one of your sayings, or when "Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide" occupies that part of your brain now paralyzed by "Its a Small World After All." Or when you start calling your local hospital, Our Lady of Pain and Suffering, instead of Our Lady of Eternal Construction. Even the Oklahomans were changing their terrible claim to victory: "Piss him off and leave him to die," to "Body in a hole, you're in it ....." The smell of death ... is gone! Chicken sushi! Maria. MARIA. MARYEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
