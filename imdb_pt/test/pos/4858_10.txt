The essential message - which Miller would certainly have wanted after seeing the Vichy war crimes trials - is that the hatred of someone without a rational basis is a waste of life. Meat Loaf's character, Fred, has known Lawrence for many years, and yet when the time comes, at the request of his fanatical supporters, he allows them to attack a man who is not in his "target" group. For me, this is the crucial message - no matter what Lawrence and his wife do from now on - they are tagged and have the chance to save themselves by using reason. Animal aggression and anger blinded the henchmen of Fred's Union to reality. A friend of mine suggested that I see "The Wave" to study how irrational hatred and the ideology of evil can dominate people without them noticing. I once conducted an RPG experience and was shocked to see how normal, good people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state - which would eventually threaten them all - because it infiltrated stages. Fred is the beginning, his Los Angeles friends and his idol preacher are the catalyst that pushes his neighbors into the violence without stopping to think that what they are doing wrong. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Lawrence and Finkelstein, the Jewish shopkeeper is fascinating, because Lawrence loses the point almost to the end: if the fanatics drive Finkelstein, where does he go? If her family ran away from the Nazis, they would be ironic to be tormented again in the land of "freedom." <br /> <br /> That big poster (a very famous piece of propaganda) about American families who enjoy the highest standard of living in the world is a very important detail. When you see this movie, watch the graffiti on the subway train and all the little posters. The message is also there. <br /> <br /> This film must be on the curriculum of all schools, especially in our time when unfounded hatred is being promoted so widely by "reasonable" people who are just extremists in disguise.
