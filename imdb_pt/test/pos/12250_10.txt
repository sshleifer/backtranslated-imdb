Not only do I think this was the best movie of 1987, but it's probably on my own amorphous list as one of the 10-20 best movies I've ever seen. For some reason, I actually hooked up with this movie, and it's one of the most personal movies I've ever seen at that point in my life (I was 26). For better or worse, I have strongly identified myself with the character Holly Hunter (and I am a guy!). She plays an extremely brilliant, loyal and intense woman who could not discover romantic relationships. There were so many things she said in this movie that were things I would say or would have told other people in similar circumstances. And the end of the movie I think is very, very sad. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this role was the great opportunity for Holly Hunter. Clearly, I was not the only one to think that well.
