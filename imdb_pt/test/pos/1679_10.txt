Rififi deservedly deserves much mention for the famous scene of assault, and, in fact, that scene deserves all the credit it receives. It is a masterful piece of suspense, character interaction and photography. But Rififi is not just a scene - every scene in the movie is so masterfully assembled, and as a whole, the film is not only taught with suspense, plot and character, but a cleverly told moral tale that set the stage for Cinema and technically, the sequence of assaults may be the most impressive scene in the film, but to me, it's the final scene that holds the greatest power - Tony le St√©phanois's hallucinogenic drive toward redemption.
