After "Fifty Feet Woman Attack" with Alison Hayes opened the door for women to be as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up the torch and what else a lovely actress Dorothy Provine from "Is a crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy world "to play the role. The reduced size is that Provine handsome and blonde can be just too sweet and innocent looking to get into size 50 Allison Hayes shoes. This role really needed someone with a latent amount of sex appeal; Provine is more the type of girl next door. She may have done it and done that role to prove she could be sexy, but the material disappoints her. Lou Costello, however, proves that he can make a film without Bud Abbott nurturing his lines and he even plays a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he does not turn to Gale Gordon as his joker-faced man. Gordon, however, states that all he can be is stormy, disturbed and aggressive, the same character he later creates in "The Lucy Show." Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does: a straight man and his time on the screen is limited. The special effects are compelling for the time, but I wish Dorothy would be a little more than cheesecake and dress and at least have been allowed to become dangerous. As the main character of the film, she takes the second billing to Costello, which is throughout the film with Dorothy several times disappearing as a sub-plot. The all-assembled film simply can not decide whether it's to be science fiction, a comedy or just a parody of the Allison Hayes classic. There are many good scenes, a very funny mood and a very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the movie. Still, I like this film for the empowerment of women; there are not enough movies out there like this. If this movie had a chance to be redone today, I recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely rewrite the original screenplay. Courtney tops my lists of actresses who, I believe, could and should properly play beautiful gigas; though, I have to admit that if any of the titanic beauties Allison or Dorothy came after me, I would be quiet !!
