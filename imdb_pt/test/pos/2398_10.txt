I just saw Eddie Monroe and was very impressed. The story was easily marked as the plot unfolded to an astounding ending. Soothing performances, action, humor and drama filled the screen. Topnotch acting for some talented Long Islanders. Great script. This is the best film that Fred Carpenter has done to date, he should be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's score is on the mark. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. Hard to believe this is an independent low budget movie. Imagine what Carpenter can do with a Hollywood-level budget. Paul Regina's last film and he misses a lot and is loved by all. He was a wonderful actor, talented and talented and a great human being. He will take care of us all and we will never forget his dynamic smile and spirit. Great work for all who participated in this film. Some prized scene stealing and humorous cameos to break serious content. You will enjoy this movie, go see!
