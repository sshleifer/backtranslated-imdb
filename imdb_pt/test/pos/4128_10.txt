"The Buddy Holly Story" shows the start of the famous singer in Dunk Lubbock, Texas, for his rise to stardom, his tragic death in a plane crash. Bolstered by the fact that Gary Busey, like Holly, plays his own instruments, this film is the biographical film in its purest form. There are some things that seem a little banal, that is, the people of Lubbock, considering rock 'n' roll as the music of the devil, but the masterful performances outweigh any weaknesses. If there is only one thing that is certain in our great world, it is that Buddy Holly's music will never be obsolete. Whether it's "That'll Be the Day," "Peggy Sue," or another of their songs, they still sound good after all those years. He remains one of the greatest singers in history. <br /> <br /> Just to show what Lubbock really thought of their most famous son, they did not name a street after him until 37 years after his death! What a bunch of ungrateful people!
