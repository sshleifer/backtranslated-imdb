We all like the movie. It's a very charming family movie with lots of fun appearances. It was fun to watch Austin musicians Charlie Robison, Joe Ely and Robert Earl Keen in the movie as well as the famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is especially cute in the movie, but all the kids are good. The West Texas scene is great, as is the Texas-filled soundtrack. The last half seemed a little strange to me, however, my son was interested in the whole movie that is not so frequent with him. Something in the plot was captivating for the kids. Having shown calves as a child, I really enjoyed the ending. Definitely not the way it works, unless you have heifers.
