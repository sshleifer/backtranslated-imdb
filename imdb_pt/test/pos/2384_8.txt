cool movie Nice to watch. I hope to see more of Fred Carpenter soon. I really like the location setting with all of New York's references. It was interesting the way everything unfolds in the end. the suspense factor was effective and the performance, while kept simple, was also effective in portraying the characters. There are a lot of little tricks built into this movie that make everything better. I think the supporting actress did a great job in her role. the cast and direction in this film seem to be stitched together and the quality of the shooting is quite impressive. the film is not without its soft moments, which gives it a good sense of balance.
