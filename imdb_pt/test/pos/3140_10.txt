There is a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford movies for the Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films, without box office names, that Ford did not have to adapt the film to the persona of a star such as John Wayne, Henry Fonda or any of the others he worked with. Not surprisingly, Ford considered all of these as favorites of one sort or another. <br /> <br /> Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. sign a couple of cowboys to guide a Mormon train to a valley in Arizona. Along the way they are first joined by a group of players trapped in a medical program and then by a family of lawless people named Clegg. Their stories fuse and what happens is the basis of the movie's plot. <br /> <br /> If Wagonmaster had been made, even 10 years earlier, with the strength of the two presentations made by Johnson and Carey, both would probably have had substantial careers as cowboys in picture b. In Johnson's case, it would be art to imitate life. Johnson was a true rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood with a series of horses for John Ford to use at Fort Apache. Ford was impressed by his presence and the rest is history. <br /> <br /> But B's western day was coming to an end and Johnson and Carey had great careers as two great actors. <br /> <br /> Ward Bond plays Elder Wiggs, leader of the Mormons. . Bond is a recent convert and has difficulty remembering not to use four-letter words. But he is the leader because of his strength of character, not his impeccable LDS theology. He turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader. In portraying the Cleggs, Ford only had to return four years to his Clementine My Darling. They are the reincarnation of the Clanton gang and pure evil. In fact, if Walter Brennan, who after My Darling Clementine refused to work for Ford again, was willing to easily see him being cast as Shiloh Clegg, the head of the family. As it was Charles Kemper did a good job, this is probably the role for which he is best known. Soon after this movie was made, Kemper was killed in a car accident. He might as well have worked for Ford in the future. <br /> <br /> Ford makes pacifist Mormons here and I do not remember that pacifism was part of LDS doctrine. However, it works here, the idea is that these people who do not carry guns are innocent when dealing with people like the Cleggs. It takes some gun cowboys to dispose of them properly. I think this movie after World War II is trying to say that pacifism is not always the best policy. <br /> <br /> Another broadcast of My Darling Clementine is by Alan Mowbray, who plays the same role he did as head of the medical show troupe. Part of this troupe is Joanne Dru, who is doing again as a woman of elastic virtues, the same as she did in Red River. Dru used to do so many westerns that she longed for fashion and some modern fashions. <br /> <br /> Wagonmaster is great entertainment and I'm willing to bet on the state of Utah, it's a pretty popular movie. .
