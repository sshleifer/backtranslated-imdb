When I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. and Boris Karloff in the cast, I was hoping to find a typical 50's horror film, "schlocky". The opening scene (a graveyard with a wolf howling in the background) seemed to confirm this. Once I started to watch, what I discovered was a little mystery about an Englishman (Richard Green) trying to find out what had happened to two of his friends who had disappeared in the Black Forest and, if necessary, got their revenge. the evil earl (Stephen McNally) who ruled the territory. Chaney, like the voiceless Gargon, had a rather limited role (one that reminded me of the Hunchback of Notre Dame, actually), while Karloff had a somewhat more substantial role as Dr. Meissen. In fact, Meissen was one of the most interesting characters in the movie, and it was difficult to know by the end whether he would be established to be a good guy or a bad guy! The setting of the castle was magnificent and even the limited representation of the Black Forest was real enough. It certainly was not low-budget compared to other movies I've seen anyway. The only disappointment, I thought, was the performance of Rita Corday as a countess. She looked a little dry and did not seem to put a lot of passion in the role. <br /> <br /> That aside, I thought this movie caught my attention, and there was enough suspense about how it all would happen. They end up making it worth watching. Definitely recommended, with a rating of 7/10.
