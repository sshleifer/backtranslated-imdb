Fascinating look behind the scenes on how a really good movie can be made if the producers, director and cast simply "refuse to leave". These guys encountered serious obstacles throughout the two years of the project (minuscule budget, problems with the script and with the screenwriter), so the finished product was not what was first envisaged, but it probably turned out to be more interesting than the movie set out to do, which serves to show that the punk mentality of "just do" ... with or without support, money or help ... find out in time and do what you want to do. I really enjoyed this documentary and I know that viewers will see and learn things they did not know before. This movie is truly "unique" ... it is difficult to classify because it has pieces of "science fiction" and "suspense" and also "how to make a movie". It tells the truth about how movies are made, what I can go wrong, and how to overcome. I especially liked the song written by Ed Ivey. These guys know how to produce a good movie on a shoe string because they are creative and know how to build props, dollys, staging, lighting with what they can clean ... amazing things.
