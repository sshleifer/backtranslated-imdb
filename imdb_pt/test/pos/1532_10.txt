I really love this movie. It has a very real feel to it. I believe it was never popular because of the subject, however, because of the subject, makes the film much more important. <br /> <br /> This is an "A" movie and I highly recommend it. . If you liked "1984" book or movie, I think you'll like this too. <br /> <br /> This is hard, to say the least, including mental and physical acts of torture, some very vile. Not for the week at heart or on the stomach. No blood, but his film is so good at projecting mental anticipation that it does not need blood and courage. <br /> <br /> If you are not a realist or a pestimist person, I do not think you will like it. This leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling about humans, about what they are capable of, and about the very real possibility that our government (s) do not necessarily have the best personal interest in their heart.
