I caught this movie at an OutFest screening in Los Angeles in July 2006. It's rude on the edges (the sound recording in particular is unstable) and often very funny. The script is somewhat episodic and ends abruptly, but Ash Christian infuses the film with a very genuine heart. It's also a refreshing change of pace to have a gay movie that does not strict models of underwear obsessed with partying and chasing heterosexual men. Props for a warmly friendly Jonathan Caouette as Mr. Cox, a keen spirit of Rodney (Ash Christian), the lively and lively Ashley Finke as Rodney's best friend, and Deborah Theaker as Rodney's mother, who is given the best one -liners in the script and steals every scene from it. Is the movie like your writer / director / star ??? irregular and a bit strange, but also very sweet.
