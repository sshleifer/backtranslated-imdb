This is an entertaining maturing comedy that comes from the later and more mature writing period of Neil Simon. Although there are many jokes, this is not one of those pieces by Neil Simon where each character makes jokes on a line for two hours as if they were invited stars in a Bob Hope special. There are also dramatic elements (some works, some are exaggerated) that give some weight to the story. <br /> <br /> The performances are good in every way, especially Blythe Danner as the mother (although she and Judith Ivey were strangely WASP-ish choices for interpreting Jewish women). I've never been a fan of Jonathan Silverman, but I will say that he plays the right notes as the narrator / protagonist of the teen story, nasty, clumsy and totally aroused. <br /> <br /> The film is very much like Woody Allen's "Radio Days," but the latter is far more imaginative and funny than this.
