The DVD jacket on which this movie came out describes it as "uplifting and good-humored." These are not the words I would have chosen - not at all. I would choose a word as "somber," sometimes even "depressing." Which is not to say it's a bad movie. In fact, it's a very good movie, with good performances from the leaders, with enough uncertainty everywhere about what will happen in the end that you keep watching. The uncertainty comes from the structure of the film - it seems to revolve around Ellen's reminiscences about her mother's slow death from cancer, as she is interviewed by DA. So we know from the beginning that something suspicious happened at the end - the questions are "what?" and who? "Renee Zellweger was very good as Ellen - the somewhat resentful daughter who has to give up her life and work in New York to return home to take care of her sick mother. another character - as he learns to deal with the strengths and weaknesses of his parents.His relationship with his father (William Hurt) is very interesting.My initial impression was that they were very close but the warts in the relationship begin to appear later Hurt was effective as the detached husband - detached not in an indifferent way, but in the sense of being unable to cope with what is happening to his wife, and seeking to escape her in various ways.Finally, Meryl Streep as Kate , who suffered from cancer, was very convincing on paper, trying to live what is left of his life in the most rewarding way possible, then dealing with the anger he feels about his growing debilitation. To watch a family dealing with this kind of crisis reminded me a little of "Ordinary people," although this film was much less emotionally intense. So not "uplifting and humorous" (with all due respect to who wrote the synopsis on the cover of the DVD), but very good in its own way. 7/10
