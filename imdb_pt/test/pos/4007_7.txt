I've been watching the Show Attack religiously for about 6 months (maybe more, but not much). I was very in love with Olivia and found Kevin very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately, though, it's starting to wear off because of too many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, which show 5 video clips that you would find on a site like YouTube, which are usually funny, or people inadvertently hurting themselves (some intentionally). Umm, this when watched 4 to 5 times a week shows the same thing over and over again, I have not really seen anything so good and I can only laugh at people actually breaking their necks and being paralyzed so many times. The show is like a late show wants to be with politics too, if you do not live in a blue state and it's not an automatic liberal, this mood ages too, McCain is old, yes, yes, whatever. Libs do not have the guts to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize they would be delighted with a sense of humor that they can laugh at themselves, so it's almost every show of McCain or Palin, sheesh. So we have the same vids of hurting people that we should keep laughing and then some leftist political humor that never laughs at itself for its own weakness. I'll keep watching since I watch work and that's all that's going on, hoping I'm entertained, but it's getting a little old. I enjoyed the host Chris and Alison, they were really a nice change of pace; maybe this show could do a rotating host thing. Olivia, who I thought sometimes was very funny at first, resorted to this constant response of pouting and getting old, lol. 7 out of 10; It will keep you in a youthful mindset, which is fine if you are a younger Baby Boomer like me (mid 40's). Maybe a cartoon of the day is another segment they should do, there are a ton of things available that they could use.
