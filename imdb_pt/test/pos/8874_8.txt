Owen is inspired by 'Strangers on a Train', exchanging murders, so Larry must kill Owen's horrible mother (Anne Ramsey, nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe). Larry was convinced that Owen killed Margaret, and also that he had to / wanted to kill Owen's mother, but there is a happy ending when months later Larry and Owen bring books, Mum died naturally, and they went on vacation with Beth Ryan.
