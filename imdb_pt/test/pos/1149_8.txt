In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans, in the early twentieth century, Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli, the Magnificent (Sean Connery) kidnaps American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), his son and daughter. His intention is to get some money and rifles as a ransom for them, to fight the corrupt sultan of Moroco (Marc Zuber). In election time, US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees. However, Raisuli is betrayed and Eden helps him to be released from prison with American soldiers. I do not like films about explicit colonialism and lack of respect for the sovereignty of other countries, but "The Lion and the Wind" is indeed a great adventure. The action scenes are very realistic. Candice Bergen, the most beautiful American actress of the 70's, is wonderful, playing a woman kidnapped as in the remarkable film Soldier Blue. Sean Connery is perfect, as always, as an honest and nationalist religious leader. Brian Keith is great as the American president. I do not know much about the history of Morocco to analyze if there is any truth in this story, but this movie is a worthwhile entertainment. In Brazil, it is only available on VHS. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'The Wind and the Lion' ('The Lion and the Wind') <br /> <br />
