Having analyzed 3 of 4 Perry and Croft series, I thought I would do them all now. Dads Army, is my favorite sitcom of all time. Not hot at all. Mom is also a classic as you are Rang M'Lord. I do not consider Hi De Hi as a classic, but it's still funny. <br /> <br /> It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, they are yellow coats. It is directed by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well-meaning man, but has the personality of a sock. The team includes the entertaining entertainment manager Ted, his helper Spike (he ended up being thrown in the pool almost every episode), the yellow coat Gladys, the careless maid Peggy who wanted to be a yellow jacket and the man from Punch and Judy Sr. Partridge who hates kids. Situations occurred mainly around the pool, where someone would be played in all episodes (with clothes there clear). <br /> <br /> It's not a classic, but still funny. Jeffery Fairbrother left halfway, so this, a bit like Only Fools and Horses, overcame his welcome. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat on Butlins. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Peggy's Big Chance, series 2, episode 2.
