First of all this film is a piece of reality very well done artistically. Some kind of combination between "American Beauty" and "As Good as it gets it". And of course, something specifically for all Russian films (of course the valuable, no dirty propaganda!): The problem of the loneliness of man ... Especially recommended for people who really want to see beyond all vindictive propaganda about communism (both positive or negative propaganda!). A film about ordinary people, their problems, lack of satisfaction - especially for young people, fear when they touch the real and very dirty face of society ... and about the false "solutions": alcohol and violence ... and probably the only one Of course, it is very well located in the space and time of the Russian perestroika, but it is valid for the whole society (except for a perfect one, but do not worry - you can not find it in the our land!). For the last time - definitely recommended ...
