This 1959 novel film takes us to the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years earlier. This happens in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange in her first role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and maintains his own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her boyfriend. Hard to believe that anyone could reject this beauty for any reason, but Louis Jourdan, with a throbbing heart, does just that. It kind of takes you back to Paul Neuman rejecting the pretty Elizabth Taylor in CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, does not he? Diane Baker, the third damsel in distress, meets and dates Robert Evans, before becoming the producer, and husband of Ali MacGraw, he is known for. Hope's boyfriend at home, played by newcomer Brett Halsey, promises to marry her. She also knows Stephen Boyd, a co-worker, who has interests in our hope. All three ladies have their drama ahead. Crawford almost steals the movie. Your presence and your usual strong and malicious self is fun to watch. Veteran actor Brian Aherne plays one of the bosses with a yen to pinch the back side of our top ladies. He is charmingly charming. Also in the cast is Martha Hyer, wasted on an ungrateful paper never really explored. It's a pity that I like this actress who never seems to get a role to distinguish her abilities. She has a crush on a married man in the office played by Donald Harron, with whom I had the pleasure of working on some Shakespeare plays in New York. He is a distinguished actor who is wasted on this film as well. <br /> <br /> All in all it's a lot of fun, in Technicolor and Cinemascope, directed by Jean Negulesco.
