Betty is as a substitute in a Verdi Macbeth production, who is asked to go when the diva is injured in a car accident. However, in the great tradition of "The Scottish Play", production seems damned to problems, among which some freaks divide the team. Unfortunately for Betty, the killer seems to have special plans for her ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the many unforgettable films of Argento, in this case primarily for the extraordinary photography of the great Britons. cameraman Ronnie Taylor. I did not evaluate it, but I think about two-thirds of the scenes in this movie involve pans, strollers, crawls or cranes - the amount of camera movement is simply amazing and makes the film ten times more exciting than a standard. thriller The imaginary is wild and dizzying - close-ups of heroin's eyes forced to open their fingernails, a slide around an opera from a crow's point of view, shattering killer brain shots, a bullet fired by a magical eye of the victim's trachea. Conceptually, it is simply incredible and could only be realized by this director. The movie is not without some shortcomings though; the cast is variable at best - Marsillach and Barberini are a bit insecure (and their dubbing in the English version is scary, even by Italian standards), although regular Argento is fun and Charleson gives a thoughtful performance on a role who is more than a little autobiographical (a director of terror very defamed by his distance and confidence in the technique). The material is a good blend of three parts of The Phantom of the Opera, Shakespeare and horror film, written by Argento and his usual collaborator, Franco Ferrini, with suspicious suspicions in abundance and the usual disdain for boring expositional scenes to explain what really is happening . Full of all kinds of different music - Brian Eno, Claudio Simonetti, Bill Wyman, Puccini and, of course, Verdi. The scenes of the beautiful opera were filmed at the Teatro Regio in Parma. For some bizarre reason the UK's imprint of this movie has the alternate title Terror At The Opera.
