There is no plot. There are no central characters. There are no mobile cameras or close-ups. In fact, this film does not follow any of the conventional storytelling techniques used by mainstream cinema. However, Du Levande by Roy Andersson is a remarkable piece of cinematic narrative. It is a touching look at the human psyche. <br /> <br /> Composed of a series of vignettes, Roy Andersson gives us an intimate view of what makes us human. In perfectly framed static photos, added to the perfect yet quirky music, Roy introduces us to a number of characters as they perform their daily existence. Some who are almost tragic, others hilarious, are taken on a Nordic journey like no other. <br /> <br /> It's a journey to the little things that make us human. Instead of exaggerated narratives or visual techniques, everything is kept to a minimum so that our only focus is on the characters themselves. It focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are; our dreams, our despair. It is through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals. <br /> <br /> The faded colors and pale makeup of the characters seem only to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that, unlike them, we are all alive. There is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this movie, but you leave the cinema with a sense of life. Much more affordable than his previous film, Songs of the Second Floor, Du Levande, is a truly inspiring piece of cinema.
