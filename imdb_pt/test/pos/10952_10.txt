Twins Effect, starring some of HK's most popular stars, offers one of the most enjoyable movie experiences to leave HK at some point. There's something for everyone, action, comedy, horror, romance and some drama. This movie can not be taken very seriously, otherwise you would go into dissapointed, but if you leave your brain at the door, and just watch the movie for fun, you are bound to enjoy it. <br /> Great special effects, great action, cute twins, cool HK actors, FUNNY movie! <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to everyone!
