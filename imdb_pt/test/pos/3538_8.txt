I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and could not see the original teleplay until a few days ago and that is much higher than the sequel. Okay, it's not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN, but it's still convincing. Much of my compliment has to do with the performance of Ken Stott as DCI Red Metcalfe a cop who seems to have taken a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret. It would be easy for Stott to overtake the top, but he plays the role rather subtly. Likewise, the murders are very shocking, but - unlike the sequel in which murders are carried out on the screen rather OTT - in fact, little violence is shown. <br /> <br /> My only criticisms are that the red herring also obviously, a red herring that meant I was not carried away by the shock (and you would probably see the turn of shock coming in, so I would not bother with a spoiler alert) and that when the real killer was revealed, it seemed somewhat distant sought and caused a few plot holes to appear in the story. If I remember correctly, the sequel had similar problems once the killer was revealed, so maybe it's a good idea not to do MESSIAH 3
