Miyazaki has done his best since the '70s and it was only recently that his films have made the American coast through Disney and the sycophantic fans of his great talent. Ponyo is no exception. Although some of his other films have been a bit more accessible to the American public, some may find this to be a little over the wall being kind of "Japanese" in their presentation. For the same reason that Pom Poko is VERY "Japanese" and does not make much sense to the American public, they are also * some * elements of Ponyo. This should not stop you from watching this fun movie of growth, hope and friendship. <br /> <br /> What really comes across is Miyazaki's very elaborate and magical animation and story that has elements of wonder and fantasy. This added to their characteristic use of character development and often using girls and women as main characters. He leaves his area a little with Ponyo as the main character is a little boy who lives in a small village by the sea with his mother while his father is away at work at sea. Although not lonely, Sosuke is like any other curious kid who enjoys adventure and sea lure. Similar to Spirited Away, we see the different worlds of humans and sea creatures and I feel that Miyazaki may be trying to draw viewers' attention to the vast and unknown nature of things that live under the sea and our acceptance of them and things that are different . <br /> <br /> I got to watch the subtitled version of this past year and I was happy with the story and plot. Miyazaki stated that "this is my last movie" for many years, but shortly after Spirited Away, he gave us Howl's Moving Castle. Ponyo is certainly proof that Miyazaki did not suspend his spurs and continues to delight, innovate and create the most creative animated films of all time. Watch Ponyo with an open mind and a fancy hat tip and childhood imagination and you will be transported back to when picking up Fireflies and secret hiding places are more important than adult and boring things and eating your vegetables.
