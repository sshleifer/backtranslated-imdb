Often, when TV shows are transferred to the big screen, they lose their appeal. Not in this case! The historical precision in costumes, equipment and art direction in general, such as the TV series, is excellent. A good example of comedy and farce, with excellent scripts and comedies in the right parts. Based on a classic TV series that stands alone in the history of the British TV comedy.
