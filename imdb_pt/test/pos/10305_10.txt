A very touching and thought-provoking film that raises issues of mental health, terminal illness and euthanasia. Sounds a little too heavy? It's a bit, but all of this is handled realistically and directly, within a history of the changes that occur in the family that has to deal with these things. This is a positive story of facing life and responsibility that is not subjugated by the subject. <br /> <br /> Afterlife is a beautifully filmed and worked film set in modern times and dealing with modern issues. It's a captivating, captivating film with a strong cast and some really good performances. <br /> <br /> Unhappy, it's not the kind of movie that always performs well at the box office, so take it while you can.
