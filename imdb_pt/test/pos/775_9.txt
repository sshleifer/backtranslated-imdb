I watched this movie at ITV and I really enjoyed it. It was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters gets a special mention as she creates an interesting and diverse character to watch. Ben's character is kind of shy and stoic, but the changes he goes through are beautifully portrayed by Rupert Grint, I would definitely say he has a future in acting after Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney is very good at it. As Ben's over protective mother, the only thing they missed was doing it too ... Villain-y. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother and, in the end, he is also honored. The only character I did not like very much was Bryony, she was a bit simple and unnecessary I thought. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch. one of my favorite movies of the year easily.
