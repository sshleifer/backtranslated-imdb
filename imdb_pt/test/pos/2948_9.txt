This movie is notable for how little remarkable it is. This is the true story of a woman and a man and their quest for happiness amidst the routine and dull life of a housewife and "man of the house." It could be any couple, any family, in any city ... but that's what makes the story so touching. It touches us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I could not stop thinking about it ... and what else could you ask for from a movie, really? Especially a documentary. This is an excellent film and highly recommended for those who like documentaries, stories about families like yours, stories about love, life, parenting, loss, expectations, soul searching, longing, wandering through life and finding the way or not.
