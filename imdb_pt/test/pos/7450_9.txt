Yes, I am a fan of FF7, but how many people watching this movie will not they? And so, I'm reviewing this movie from a FF7 fan perspective and without regret. (I would not know how to properly review the movie for someone who has not played the game FF7). Visuals - 10/10 I loved Advent Children. It's a sensory pleasure - a complete overhead of audio and video. The visuals were breathtaking: some talents were performed that I simply would not have thought possible with an animated feature. When the action scenes appeared, they were, for lack of a more precise word, a roller coaster. With the dramatic movement of the camera moving from range to range, perfectly integrated bullet-time effects at crucial moments, down to the detail level - it's all very hard to criticize. The animation looks like a big budget, the style and the images are amazing, and the effects sometimes made me forget that I was watching the animation instead of live action scenes. I could ramble for hours repeating myself in the fantastic quality of the visuals, but that simply would not do any justice. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10 The sound was fabulous. The voices of all the characters did not disappoint (no one seemed silly) and the sound effects were bold and clear. The music - of the game that (in my opinion) had the best soundtrack of the game EVER, transferred beautifully to the film. Most of the memorable themes of the game are present in the movie, though often using different instruments to fit in better with what is happening. There were some more daring rock and light thrash metal songs about the really intense action scenes from time to time, but it all fitted well with the situation of the movie at the corresponding time. <br /> <br /> Story - 7/10 story and characters would be the main flaws of the movie. Both aspects simply were not up to the game - but again, the game could spend more than 40 hours developing these points - the movie has only 90 minutes. As far as the story goes, the plot was not bad or anything, but not as ambitious as expected from someone who played the game. Indeed, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. The game was so extravagant with the intricate twists and turns / development of the story that the film never had a chance to compete in the same league. Instead, the film took a more sensible approach - to expand the action and try to put so many inner jokes and themes into it, instead of trying to recreate in an impossible way the enormous factor of the story, which originally was a driving force in the game. The lack of use of Matter also caused me some controversy - the story of the movie chose to use little (though not ZERO) Matter, and instead, a lot of supernatural fighting ability and ability. I would hope that if a sequel were made, it would incorporate much more extravagant and important Matter into the film. There were also many holes in the movie - all of this can be forgiven if you think of Advent Children as a random anime, but it seems ridiculous when you realize how it was based on a game that performed a plot tremendously well. Characters - 7/10 Characters, while all are present in one form or another, do not necessarily shine for their true potential. There simply is not enough movie time to spend on all of them. And so, all their stories and background skills are not fully displayed and, in some cases, almost never (Red and Cait Sith leave absolutely no lasting impression). Even Cloud, who is the focal point of the film, feels that he does not use enough of his familiar game skills. The question of matter is a strong reason for this. With that said, it's a joy to see the cast back in action, even if it's in a role that does not use them to the fullest. The new characters were the ones that caused me the bulk of the discussion - the Bad Guy Trio and the boy Denzel - there was a huge lack of explanation about any of them. Anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in the gaps with something reasonable and end it, but objectively speaking, the question is still there to be commented on and therefore is a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> Value - 10/10 The replay value of this movie is excellent - I personally want to watch it again in a bigger and noisier way - bigger screen, higher volume. <br /> <br /> Pleasure - 10/10 Whatever the flaws the movie, they just were not big enough to disrupt my pleasure, and I honestly think this will be the same case for most people. I enjoyed Advent Children tremendously and encouraged FF7 fans to come and see.
