This Fox show was a big hit when released in 1954. Sumptuously produced, with good music and scenarios, intriguing cast, it moves slowly but interestingly. Edmund Purdom is remarkably handsome as an Egyptian who becomes a renowned physician, juggling three stunning women: a passively adoring lady named Jean Simmons, the seductive Bella Darvi, and the sister of Pharaoh Gene Tieney who wants him as her pharaoh. The film's popularity has not diminished since it was re-shown on AMC (preferably on widescreen). Purdom is especially great, his character apparently attacking women and ending up never married and a "thinker". Darvi is incredible and tempting in her role as a femme fatale. Victor Mature, Michael Wilding, co-star of Peter Ustinov. Check out.
