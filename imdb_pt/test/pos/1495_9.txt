"Mr. Bean," starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson, was a huge success during the 1990s, and I probably saw him for the first time when he was about ten years old, shortly after finishing, so I was seeing reruns. I was certainly not a fan at the time and I have not seen many episodes. I did not really get into the program until the late teens, just a few years ago when I finally watched all the episodes. Unlike before, this made me laugh many times and since then has always been the case during repeated episodes! Mr. Bean is a mysterious, egocentric, antisocial and extremely naive buffoon whose best friend is his Teddy! He is virtually isolated from society, and life is not easy for him as he constantly struggles with very simple things! This is because he lacks some basic knowledge and has the mind of a child. He finds himself in various kinds of trouble wherever he goes, and comes up with very bizarre ways of trying to solve the problems he faces! Not only does it often cause problems for yourself, but sometimes for other people too, which he often does not usually notice! In other words, Mr. Bean is a walking disaster! <br /> <br /> The mood in this show is very visual, and there is very little dialogue. The jokes are almost always gags of vision, which is mostly about what the show is. Although there may be an occasional dull gag, I would say the vast majority of them are funny, often hilarious (there are many highlights)! Although "Mr. Bean" is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy of all time, it is still great for many who enjoy visual humor and because of the very limited dialogue, you do not even need to speak English fluently to enjoy the show. and that's why it has received a worldwide reputation! The show lasted a few years, but the episodes were made very gradually, so only 14 were made in total. However, it is a classic series and deserves its great appeal!
