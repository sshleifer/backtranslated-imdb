I absolutely love the Promised Land. The first episode I saw was while on my 2003-2005 mission. I really loved the rich family history portrayed on the show. Here was a family with their own struggles, but instead of insisting on them; they sought with love others who might have had the same problems in an effort to forget and go to work. That's what made me fall in love with the show. All actors; especially Gerald McRaney; had demonstrated the true meaning of "Family," which left an indelible mark on my life. I've been on the same road as them, but it's taken me a long time to develop this kind of character. I love this show so much, that I wanted to share with friends; but I was really shocked when I heard the sound was taken from the air. I thought and still think they should bring it back! So many lives can benefit from the media inspired by heaven. I sincerely believe that this show was divinely inspired; because it brings the spirit every time I see only one episode. This show really (in my book) really defined what a "promised land" is. It is the love that you hold in your heart for others; which takes you to a higher destination. The Spirit of Love is one of the most potent messages in this series, and all I can say is: Bring it back. -Robert
