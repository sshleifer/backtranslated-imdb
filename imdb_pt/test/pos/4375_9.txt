Mr. Carlin left our joint forum in June 2008, shortly after going to the hospital for chest pains (he had a history of heart problems). The media and comics covered the loss more than I would ever have expected ... but he was the grandfather of the comedy of observation. <br /> <br /> THIS recording was his last production and contains a large section. dedicated to the subject of death and the prospects of life thereafter. The filming of the project took place shortly after his seventieth birthday, which he was happy to have achieved (noted?). I followed Carlin's career from television days in black and white and enjoyed his current album albums. <br /> <br /> It is a privilege for any Carlin fan to at least see (if not have a copy) of this particular show. He was still moving fast and in good time even at 70! As he would say, he is NOT "smiling from the sky at you". If he is doing something, he is not taking harp lessons; maybe he's looking up !!!
