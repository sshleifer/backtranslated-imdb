You think the police are always right. <br /> <br /> You believe that "eye-witnesses" are always right. <br /> <br /> You believe prosecutors will not take a court case if the lazy police have failed to carry out 98 percent of a basic investigation. <br /> <br /> You believe that a city in the United States may have "some rotten apples" in law enforcement, but that "good cops" will quickly wipe out those who are systematically involved. no evil for evil for good. <br /> <br /> Do you believe that the possibility of a former soccer player being installed as a detective only because his father is the sheriff of the county, and being allowed to beat "confessions" out of randomly selected adolescents without absolutely no fear of negative consequences for oneself could happen in America in the 1930s, but not today. <br /> <br /> Do you believe a judge will NOT send a case to the jury if someone with a brain on their head can see the defendant is a totally random passer-by arrested by the police because it was hot, and they did not feel like they were working <br /> <br /> Do you believe that all innocent people arrested six months here or 20 years ago are "exceptions to the rule", and an injustice like that could never involve your family member, someone in the middle class, or someone like You. <br /> <br /> Do you think you are aware of all the terrible, undisputed 100% that have proven outrageous over the past 10 years in America - and have not yet seen this movie.
