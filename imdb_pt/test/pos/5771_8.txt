This departure of Knotts includes one of his best companions of all time, Frank Welker. Welker makes the movie. Knotts and Welker compete for laughter and both get plenty. Knotts works for a small town "no where" where the city is run by some of the most ignorant employees. When things go wrong, the town's parents let Knotts fall. The character of Frank Welker befriends Knotts and together they stumble together to clear Knott's mess and good name. This film shows the character of Scared to the death of Knott who made him famous for years on television and in the movies. This may have been the last good tour of Knotts. When you have an extra 90 minutes, grab a good old laugh and a great icon, Don Knotts.
