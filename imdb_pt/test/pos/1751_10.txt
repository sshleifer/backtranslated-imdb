Well I may be biased as I grew up watching a VHS copy of this movie that is now ready to snap and I just spent the last few hours crawling a copy of DVD as a birthday pressie for my dad. The film is so harmless and harmless that it caters to all ages .... much better than anything Disney has ever done in my opinion (and I used to work at the Disney Store !!!). The characters are nice and the best scene award is a draw between the broken marriage (especially the musical talents of Swat, the fly, and Smack the mosquito), and the incredible night scene. The musical numbers still make me hum for 20 years after watching it for the first time. there's no other movie I can recommend while babysitting, and in fact every kid I know (thanks to my loving parents of Hoppity) has seen this movie many times. He will always have the best marks for his fabulous love story, a brilliant mood and all the originality.
