A quick and fun noir fixed in Vienna shortly after W.W.11. Donald Buka is a refugee who can not find legal work because he has no papers. No document means work permit, which means there is no way to get a passport. He survives driving a friend's taxi at night. If he gets caught, it means three months in prison. One night he picks up a fare at a large hotel and takes the man to an airline office. Buka grabs the man's luggage and goes back to the car. There he finds his client acquired an unnecessary hole in the back of his head. What to do? Call the police? Without a work permit, they will put the claw on it quickly. No, he needs time to think that. He drives to an isolated spot, empties the man's pockets and hides the body. He now has an American passport and lots of money! He falls for a contact from the underworld to change the photo of the passport. Now he just needs to go to the man's hotel and get the man's plane ticket. Your ticket to freedom! Needless to say, it would be very simple. Waiting in the hotel is the lover of the dead man, Joan Camden. Camden is fleeing from her rather unpleasant husband, Francis Lederer, and Lederer is, of course, the pig that bumped into the man in Buka's cabin. Camden calls the police since she believes that Buka stole her lover. Buka shows off her new passport and gets out of the mess. Camden breaks down when her husband Lederer shows up at the police station. Lederer convinces the police Camden has suffered a mental breakdown and she is released to him. She escapes again, finds Buka and the two decide to flee together from the country. Lederer again makes an appearance and Buka must decide if helping Camden is worth his freedom. This movie is so much better than I'm making it sound. Buka is best known as the low-life cop killer in 1950, "Between Midnight and Dawn." The film was produced by actor Turhan Bey.
