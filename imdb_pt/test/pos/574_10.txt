I am pleased that this was the work of foreign filmmakers because it can not be accused of unfair prejudice. With absolutely no cause, Jacksonville cops rush to judge in this case and choose the first black suspect to accuse the murder of a white foreign tourist. They chose a 15 year old. A kid who is almost as close to a saint as you could find at random and then make fools trying to identify an unlikely case against him. In addition to the injustice resulting from blatant prejudice, there is the penalty of six months of unjust imprisonment of a completely innocent black adolescent. It asks a question if, as a society, we should compensate those who are accused, imprisoned and later considered innocent. This docudrama is well produced, professionally recorded and presented in a captivating package from which you will not want to take a 1-minute break. If you care about social justice, do not miss this one. He certainly deserved his Oscar.
