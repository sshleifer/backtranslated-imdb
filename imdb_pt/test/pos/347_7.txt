I love almost everything that the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career, but "Nurse Sherri's Possession" is upside down with fun Z-grade confessions like "Horror of the Blood Monsters" and "Dracula Vs. Frankenstein ". This movie is really scary! I'm telling you that you're going to jump out of your seat when you see "Nurse Sherri"? No of course not. But this pastiche of elements from "The Exorcist," "Ruby," and "Carrie" is one of those scary little horror movies common in the seventies. You can not put your finger on what is so scary, but the film drips with the atmosphere. Do not worry, I will not ruin it for you.) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really got it right, and it does not matter if "Nurse Sherri" was a calculated success or a happy accident. Jill Jacobson is nice but not remarkable as the unfortunate nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader (Bill Roy, who shines in his brief role). Geoffrey Land is just like her grumpy boyfriend. There are some blaxploitative elements here (after all, profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in movies), but they really do contribute to the plot rather than just being facade. "Nurse Sherri" was a production of Poverty Row, and sometimes shows (scenarios, special effects, etc.). Still, the film has heart, mostly decent acting and direction, and some genuine shivers. Sam Sherman also thought it best to use Harry Lubin's theme song for the "One Step Beyond" television series from the late 1950s and early 1960s in this film, which certainly adds to the scary atmosphere. The DVD contains two significantly different cuts from the film (the initial version features a lot of T & A that ended up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrible things) as well as the theatrical trailer, the TV spot and a great commentary. by Sherman. Does anyone know what happened to Bill Roy, by the way? Alongside John Carradine, he is the best actor I have ever seen in an Al Adamson movie, and he plays the cult leader as he meant it.
