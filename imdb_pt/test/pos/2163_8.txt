I just watched this movie and it's not bad; There are some tense moments and not many long sequences of dialogue. He comes as quite intelligent; fastpaced almost like 'documentary style'. This film will evoke some nostalgia and a bit of paranoia from the Cold War with cars, street scenes and life in the 50's. The acting is reasonably solid and, at 85 minutes long, it is moving at a good pace. A fan of atomic films should not miss this one.
