The art of the absurd is alive and thriving in today's Danish cinema! Well, at least it's in this movie. Nobody in this movie is fun. Everyone is upset or shocked, and if they are not, soon they will be! It is a story of idiots, murders, constraints, dignity and, ultimately, love and redemption. The uncomfortable humorous style is idiomatic and will not please everyone, but personally I thought it had exactly the fascinating combination of the bizarre and the absurd. You pity the characters in the distance, even if you do not like them up close and personal. But their story is so tragic that you think you forgive and are happy for them, even when they escape murder. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, definitely the best Danish film of the last few years. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
