When I was younger, I saw the end of hair on TV. I just watched the last 5 minutes of the movie. And I was really impressed by that. I shivered and told myself that I had to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> And I did, and I have to say: this movie is incredible. The songs are great, the actors are very good and the message ... The message of this film is one of the most important: "Make love, not war". This movie is a true work of art. Meanwhile, it's my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> The last song is one of the saddest and happiest I've ever heard. I could almost feel myself joining the crowd. All I have to say: "LET THE SUN SHINE, LET THE SUN SHINE"
