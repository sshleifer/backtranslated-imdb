What's fun watching random movies at random is that you never know exactly what to expect or where the next big movie piece will come from. Recently, my viewing took the form of staple classics like "Raging Bull" or "Raiders of the Lost Ark," but this time my VCR pulled me out of the modern conveniences and left me right in front of Lionel Jeffries. Children. "This is a film expertly directed at three young children, a mysterious event with their father, the move to the open fields of England and eventually the rewards inherited from just beckoning to the trains. seemingly simple does not seem as promising as it got lost in the rarity of VHS for some time, but in the first fifteen minutes of this film, it is perceived that it is more than just the commonplace children's movie. a time when purity was more than just saying "no," when the family meant everything and where the adventure was ready for you at every turn of the railroad.This is more than a lovely film, it has incredible cinematic techniques used, keeps the regular viewer glued to the screen with unanswered questions and gives three perfect companions to accompany this 110-minute journey. "Railway Children" is a lost treasure you need be seen by both families and movie aficionados. <br /> <br /> There are several times that proudly stand out in "Railway Children", which transform it from mediocrity to excellence? one is our three children; Bobby, Phyllis and Peter. Modern cinema assures us that these three children can not provide much darkness, laughter, and insight into the world around them, but the children of Jeffries prove otherwise. From smartly spoken lines (both acting and script), sincere kindness and dedication to this little village, until the final meeting on that train; these children are more than just children's stars advancing a story, they are taking us with emotion, persuasion and a realism not seen by children today. There is more imagination packed in this little VHS than I've witnessed in film for years. A favorite scene that could have been treated with generality, which I've seen in other movies, was Bobby's birthday scene. The way Jeffries puts it between guests and presents was exciting and refreshing, keeping our eyes animated about each scene as well as our mind. Another scene that caught my attention was when the children were working on gifts for Perks, when they asked for a gift for a man, Jeffries simply made him state, "No, I will not. I do not like Perks." Is the children's reaction hilarious? providing moments for children and adults to enjoy it all. Filmed in the 1970s, this little feature delivers genuine laughter than most modern comedies. It is a creative film associated with excellent choreography and direction. <br /> <br /> That means that as much as I loved this movie, it was not perfect. Jeffries does a great job at keeping us from guessing what happened to the father, but it seemed that the event occurred, the children were kept in the dark and suddenly settled in the end. More details for the father, not much more, would have solidified his character and given us the opportunity to see more of the children's reaction. In addition, there is a scene in this film, one of those grandiose panoramic images of the English countryside that is simply breathtaking, but when we look a little closer, we see cars in the background. It made me laugh, but it did not distract much from the overall picture. Cinema like this is really missing today, and strangely, it seems that only the British have the good sense to produce it. Films such as "Love Actually" or "Vicar of Dibley" demonstrate the power and enthusiasm of community cities, places where everyone knows everyone and we are not afraid to be neighbors. Is this one more subject that the American public could have more? more understanding of what is going on outside rather than remaining isolated to their own events. <br /> <br /> Overall, I loved "Railway Children". I did not know what to expect when I first put it on the VHS handset, but from the opening scene, up to the explosive train, to Perks' birthday, Jeffries proved that he could handle the most child friendly story with ease . His ability to make child actors look like real characters, involve adults less, and involve kids as if they were adults. This is a movie to be seen as a strong alternative to anything Disney launches. The ongoing themes of friendship, kindness to strangers, and forgiveness explode through TV with grace and power. "Railway Children" is more than just a children's film; is a feature that should be a milestone in the modern viewing of the public. Not only does it give a great look to the English countryside, but it also teaches (and shows) how life would be bigger with an emphasis on imagination and courage rather than fighting any CGI villain. <br /> <br /> Note: **** Â½ out of *****
