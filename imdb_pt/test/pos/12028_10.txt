Spending an hour watching this brilliant Dan Finnerty and his "Dan Band" play their Bravo special is the most enjoyable hour I've ever spent watching TV. This young man (Dan) is an incredible talent, as a singer, an interpreter and even a dancer. It can range from pop music to hip hop, rock, and also songs written for women. This guy can do anything. I saw him live at least 11 times, so I was not expecting how well his show would adapt to a television or movie format, but all reservations were gone instantly when the show started because of the quality of Dan. A favor and notice this, or better yet, buy.
