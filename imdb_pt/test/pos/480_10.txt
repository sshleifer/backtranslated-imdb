If you're tired of the same repetitive, unintelligent stuff that the film industry throws, you'll enjoy "You Are Alone." It's thought-provoking, well-filmed and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Without revealing anything you do not discover in the first few minutes of the movie, this is the story of a young high school girl at a school. middle-class environment that works as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor. The vast majority of the film takes place in a hotel room where he hired her to come. <br /> <br /> Through your discussion, you explore two inconstant visions of prostitution, depression, loneliness. However, the film is not depressing. He talks about obscure things without being depressing. As a spectator, your preconceived emotions and notions are moved around, but gently. You leave with much to think about. I like that in a movie.
