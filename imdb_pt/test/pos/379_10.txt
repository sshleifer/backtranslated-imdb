This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, and one of his most underrated. I believe it certainly exceeds a 'Psycho' or 'The Birds' by technical art and brilliance. It's a macabre, tense, darkly humorous product that will leave you impressed for some time. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcock's most memorable villains as the father who hates his mother (but is not he the majority of Hitchcock villains, the mummy boys?) Bruno. It's a disturbing and impressive performance that lights up the whole movie. His character is obsessive, seemingly homosexual (look at those deliberately effeminate ties and listen as he is described as "European"), strangely charming and dangerous to cross. Farley Granger certainly knows this when he wraps himself up in Bruno's sordid web after the duo finds himself on a train. Bruno, knowing some privileged information about the affairs of Guy, proposes the two assassinations of "exchange" among themselves. Walker will kill Granger's bastard and conniving wife who is inhibiting her marriage to the beautiful Anne, while Granger will kill Bruno's father, whom he hates so intensely. Everyone is happy, right? A win-win, as Bruno claims? Wrong. Granger forgets the indecent proposal, but an obsessed Walker does not. He commits his murder and is determined to hunt Granger until he completes his side of the bargain as well. "Strangers" becomes a cat-and-mouse game captivating and full of suspense in Hitch's capable hands. Hitchcock was absolutely amazing by creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes. We have the prostitute Miriam, Granger's wife pregnant for another man. She lasciviously sips a phallic cone of ice cream as she openly eats Bruno with her eyes. Barbara Morton, Anne's sister, is a deceptively sweet, intelligent and clever young lady who comes out with the cruellest remarks you'll hear from a girl with glasses in the 1950s photos. Senator Morton is overbearing and egocentric. This is one of the most daring films Hitchcock ever made, and it is, typical of a Hitch movie, subtly sexual in detail. <br /> <br /> This fits into the film-noir category with its focus on murder, lies and deceit and somber cinematography. Walker's nut is one for the ages, and Granger makes a troubled and compelling protagonist. Roman is perhaps weaker than the other two, and I never believed in his relationship with Granger. Still, the overwhelming positives nullify the slight negatives and it can be safely said that this is one of the best American films of all time. <br /> <br /> See what Hitch does here - originality, technical skill. . We see Miriam's murder reflected in her broken glasses. A tennis game turns into one of the most exciting and intense scenes you've ever seen. An innocent playground turns into a murderous place and dirty occurrences. A boy's balloon is snapped by Walker (Hitch obviously liked what he saw in "The Third Man!") The children's pleasure in riding on the merry-go-round turns into terrifying, glaring terror. Hitch subverts normal and everyday events like no other. <br /> <br /> The camera work here is among the best ever seen in a Hitchcock movie, and the premise is to die. It is slippery, emanates sophistication and devilish charm. The cross between the characters of Walker and Granger is magnificent - Morger's tennis match is as vital as the rescue of villain Walker from an incriminating piece of evidence lost in a drain. Engage again, build your villain in a nasty, repulsive, but sympathetic and strangely charming (Has anyone else found him strangely attractive, more so than Granger?) Work - we are as tense as Walker in our hope he can get the lighter out of the drain . We need it anyway. He holds the key to the story. <br /> <br /> You will never see a stranger approach the same way again after seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> Incredible. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
