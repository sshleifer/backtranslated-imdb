Apparently, this movie was based on a true story. I'm not sure how accurate it is, though. But it really reminded me of how when I see someone murdered on the news, it's amazing how much that does not affect me. Of course, I think it's awful, but honestly I do not care. I moved on. Looks like murder is trivial now. That's what River's Edge shows. No one seems to care about this girl and her death, not even with the killer. So what's the point? <br /> <br /> The killer in this story is John, and for the sheer amount of the film he hides with another assassin named Feck, played by Dennis Hopper. Feck is older, and you can see the generational difference. He says he loved the girl he killed. When he asks John if he loves the girl he killed, he simply responds, "She was fine." The film seems to offer only one solution: life is more important than death. The life of a character is spared, people have a second chance and a lost case is dead. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. After watching this movie, I only came to the conclusion that Crispin Glover is a brilliant actor or a terrible actor. I still have no idea. It was my main reason to see this movie, however. But the best performance is clearly given by Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> Although the fashion really is from the 80's and the characters sometimes mention current issues, I still think River's Edge is as relevant today as ever. <Br/> <br /> My rating: 10/10
