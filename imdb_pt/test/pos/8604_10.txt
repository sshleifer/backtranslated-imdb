This is a fairly faithful adaptation of Masuji Ibuse's novel, "Black Rain." Like the book, it's very touching and thought-provoking. The story revolves around a couple's attempts to see their niece married successfully. They are having trouble finding suitors because of a rumor that she suffers from radiation sickness after walking through Hiroshima on the day of the bombing. Well filmed, well represented, touching, tragic, creepy and entertaining.
