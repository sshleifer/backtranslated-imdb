A lot about this movie was beautiful. The acting, the setting and, without a doubt, the cinematographic scene of Aaron transpired in the beautiful scenes. It's definitely worth watching, because your attention will be captivated all the time, and it will end with the right note. <br /> <br /> The acting of rookie Jonathan Furr was superb, as if he would think he was a professional acting since he was born. He went on to star in other feature films, but this leading role will always be remembered. <br /> <br /> The movie has that gym prize at times, where it is slow and scenic and quiet, so there is a movie that adds children can sit down. However, the rustic feel of East Bend and Yadkinville worked well as a 1940s film.
