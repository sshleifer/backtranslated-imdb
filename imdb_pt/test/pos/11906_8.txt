The movie was better than I expected. I was working on the set for a short time when Damien was making this movie. The shooting, the stunt and the acting were very good in the editing tip. All of you, the music, was not that good. Best music would have this movie. Some of the songs sound like hippy days. Damien, remember that you have gang gangsters, or hip hop would have done it. It was more realistic than blood in blood. The cast was chosen very well. Suspeitentertaint did a good job in this movie. The movie has brought back a fill of a lifestyle I use to live. But in the end, you do not always win. And in my story that's how it was. I adapted to the movie the first time I watched it.Damien Congratulatoins in this movie.
