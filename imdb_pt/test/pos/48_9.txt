I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it happens. That brings back happy times for me. I grew up in a big city in the Midwest. It reminds me of when I was a kid, although my situation was a bit different, it looks the same. It makes me wonder if all of us will know about families being lost. The great mother of the day is under 55 years old. Do they know what it takes to be an inspiration to others? I hope I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past. The music was great in this movie. I really felt I should have gone to the theaters that I would pay to see. When I watched the movie for the second time, I found out who the life of this movie was. He did a great job writing and producing this movie. I think it's best to produce a movie based on your life other than you. As soon as I can, I'll get a copy for my home use. I always like black producer or directors who make this movie look like you were actually living at the right time. Thanks for such a good movie.
