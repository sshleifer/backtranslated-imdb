The stars and planets must all be in the right alignment, the day THRILLER was designed. Michael Jackson's album was finishing the charts, John Landis still had a lot of goodwill with his genre "An American Werewolf In London," and the choreographer Michael Peters (not to mention his classic comedies ANIMAL HOUSE and THE BLUES BROTHERS). Creating some of the most innovative and influential pieces for video clips of that period. <br /> <br /> Not before or since then did a single piece of film illuminate, exploit or highlight MJ's incredible talent or the more "supernatural" aspects of his persona as well as THRILLER, the most successful video of world (if not officially the first), and the most affectionately remembered. Also the most expensive at the time, but every penny and all the talent behind its creation and execution is there on the screen. And how come it would not be complete without the "rap" of the original song, provided by the late, great Vincent Price, to add even more cache to the chills that already existed? <br /> <br /> The glory days of one of the world's greatest performers have long since passed, but no one can take away the great achievements of man, of which this is probably the most memorable. If you do not think so, now, remember: Halloween is coming. I will not be at all surprised when, like other Halloweens before decades ago, it appears on some Saturday Night Creature special. <br /> <br /> What will it be next year, and next year. .
