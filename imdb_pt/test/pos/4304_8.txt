This is my favorite Columbus. Martin Landau (excellent!) Performs the twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning does not give you any clue as to which one did it! Peter Falk is in shape, as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favorite episode). The supporting cast are great, especially Julie Newmar (much underrated) and Jeanette Nolan as the guardian of the house that Columbus just keeps disturbing. The last name of the characters of Martin Landau is "Paris". This was the surname of Leonard Nimoy's character in Mission Impossible. Coincidence? Or a joke from Steven Bochco?
