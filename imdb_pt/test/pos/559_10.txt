I saw this movie last night on HBO and did not expect to get hooked - I usually fall asleep when I watch HBO. But it happened and so did you. It is a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar winner) about the murder of an elderly tourist in Jacksonville, Florida, and subsequent investigation, arrest and trial of a 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie today a sense of how we have progressed as a society. This movie was more deserving of an esteemed Oscar - you will be brought to tears.
