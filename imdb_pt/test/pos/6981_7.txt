Reasonably effective horror / science fiction Ã  la "Alien" is quite well done, given their limited ambitions. Some good special effects and well-paced action sequences correct the cracks in the tiring dialogue. When a spaceship falls on a remote planet, the survivors soon realize that a hideous horror awaits them in the dark of the total eclipse.
