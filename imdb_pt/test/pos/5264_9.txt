This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Neilson shine in this romantic comedy. One is a business executive who re-evaluates life based on the expectation of his death within a year. The other is a playboy who gets tired of golden girls and seeks a relationship with a vital and mature woman. If you have silver in your hair and / or romance in your heart, microwave the popcorn, curl up with your honey and prepare for a treat.
