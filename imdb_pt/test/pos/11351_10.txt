I will not bore you with stories and plots, as they have already been featured many times on this page then? It's been over time since I've seen a movie like that. Beautiful, elegant and restrained, with a narrative rhythm to match. A film with sensibility and underrated qualities that is rare in these times of clich√©s. The beautifully subjugated photograph, saturated with rich and luxurious colors, and for lack of better words, each painting is filled with an air of tension. Settings and locations are used repeatedly, but the movie succeeds in giving them new life every time they appear, there always seems to be a key piece, a lamp or a piece to understand the audience about where we are in the characters. world. <br /> <br /> The performance reminds me of "The Bicycle Thief," not the style, but the fact that you forget you're watching two actors involved in your craft. There is meaning behind every gesture and almost all movements attribute meaning to explain the inner world of the characters, the relationship, the feelings and the situation of the two lovers. The dialogue is sparse, but like the rest of the film, it is imbued with meaning. Speaking of meaning, the soundtrack is contagious. Used here, it becomes a storytelling device. And although the film is of Chinese origin, even a song sung in Spanish by Nat King Cole conveys the film with a subtle meaning. The orchestrated soundtrack is repetitive, but repetition is what makes it comfortable. It is used in conjunction with the story, not just a means to put the music into action, or to allow the audience to feel a certain way at a certain point in the plot. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone, I fear most people would be tired of the quiet flow of the story, but I would recommend it to someone who is looking for an alternative to the romantic problem that fills the multiplexes from our side of the world. I must say that I was completely impressed by this film and continued to watch it night after night. History takes time to present itself and brings repeated visions, since very few films of this genre are open to such a broad interpretation. A very beautiful film.
