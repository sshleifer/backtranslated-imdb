I saw this at the London Film Festival last night, apparently the shortest version. James McNally's summary of the movie's content is very good. Nossiter very skillfully combines his research on the wine business into broader concerns about globalization, homogenization, the effect of mass media, the power of capital and the need for diversity. <br /> <br /> The film is shot by hand. held DV that some might find offensive but that allows Nossiter to catch people off guard on several occasions that would probably not have been possible using more conventional equipment. <br /> <br /> Despite the film's extensive feeling, the editing is very clear, not only giving us a parade of the dogs of the world, but also weakening some of the interviewees' comments with somewhat contradictory visual images, and giving to others enough rope to hang themselves. To some extent, this evoked the recent work of Michael Moore (though Nossiter operates in a more subtle way), but probably the roots of the film date back to Marcel Ophuls' film "The Sorrow and the Pity," both in the way the film is built on the rise of "salt of the earth" French peasants as the stars. De Montille pere et fils were present at the LFF screening and subsequently answered questions. In fact, we all need a bit of disorder - brave Hubert! Overall, an excellent film with implications that go far beyond the world of wine, the way we build ourselves as people and organize our world.
