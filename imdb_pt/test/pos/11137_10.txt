This show was incredible !!! I've seen all three and this is the best. This movie has suspense, a bit of romance, mind-boggling acrobats (GO BOBBIE), great characters and amazing locations. Where was this filmed? Will there be more? I really enjoyed the story with her brother. Looking forward to Chameleon 4 and seeing how the world is saved again.
