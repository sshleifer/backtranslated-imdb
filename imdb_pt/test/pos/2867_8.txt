I love it. <br /> <br /> The camera angles are cool, not all nervous as a Blair witch. And I thought they did a great job with Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lot of fun. Many people were screaming at the screen! <br /> <br /> Kane did a great job with his various psychic emotions. He is much less one-dimensional than most horror heroes. <br /> <br /> Kane is far less scary and more believable than most movie psychopaths. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations. There are not many twists here, but it's clever and original in its own way. Good, creepy, movie slasher fare.
