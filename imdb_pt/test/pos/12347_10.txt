A well-behaved and well-behaved teenager Meg Tilly must spend the night in a chilling mausoleum as a beginner in a high school club. The problem is a powerful psychic named Raymar was just buried there that day, but he is not completely dead and he needs the life force of humans for his powers. <br /> <br /> Dark horror film offers lots of excitement and chills, a seductive and pleasing cast, and more superior special effects. My rating: 7 out of 10. A dark night is rated R for violence themes and adults.
