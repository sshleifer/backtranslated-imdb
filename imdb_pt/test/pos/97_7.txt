Well, I have to disagree with Leonard Maltin on this animated short. He loves it and claimed it was hilarious. I liked it, but I did not see any humor. He does not even like hockey or knows anything about it, and he still loved the story. Living across the Canadian border, I watched hockey for 50 years both there and in Buffalo ... but I did not think much about this cartoon. Oh, it was interesting and I know what would happen if you wore a Toronto jersey in the Quebec region - a disaster! This is especially true in the glorious years of Les Canadians. However, this does not make the story funny. In the 1950s, everyone in the Quebec provinces idolized the Canadians of Montreal and their ace, Maurice Richard, and everyone wanted to be like him. When his mother asks for a new sweater, he has the Toronto Maple Leafs emblem, so the kid does not want to be caught dead using it .. When he finally arrives and goes to the local lane, he is banished from the rest of his friends hockey. What's so funny about that? I could see the same thing happening to a kid in Boston who is the stubborn Red Sox and his mother gives him the Yankees shirt! Horrors! You could not use it, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Maybe for someone who does not follow sports like Maltin, this situation looks strange and funny to him ... but it's a fact of life or any sports fan in a short time and his favorite team. It was an interesting and totally believable story, but nothing that made me laugh. <br /> <br /> Art was fun to see, almost like looking at a long series of paintings by a talented school boy. . The French Canadian accent was good too. This film was part of the DVD "Favorites of animation of Leonard Maltin of the National Film Board of Canada.
