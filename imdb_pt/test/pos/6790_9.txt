First, let me tell you that I find movies like Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile, and most of Spielberg is absolutely horrible and twisting his stomach. Although the National Velvet on the surface seems to be in the same genre and has moments that should be worthy, I enjoyed laughing and screaming all through the movie. The premise of the plot, a young woman with an unknown horse from a small village entering the Grand National is certainly as implausible as it could be, but it's the only thing you have to accept for it to work like a fairy tale or allegory. The characters have depth and grow throughout history. Ann Revere gives an absolutely stunning performance as one of the wisest women ever described in an American movie. His interaction with the good heart Donald Crisp is funny and sweet. While Liz Taylor tries a little too hard to be even cuter than Margaret O'Brien (she succeeds), her passion and love for her horse shines on her face. Mickey Rooney gives a beautifully differentiated performance from the coach. <br /> <br /> This is far from perfect. Some of the situations and scenes are a bit mushy and dated (kids' antics, and Rooney's scenes on the dance floor and bar, for example), but that does not matter. The plot remains faithful to the characters and leaves a little unspoken. We do not have overly artificial moments and preachers - sometimes more is less. The final scene is a great example of this - the emotional dialogue is left for the viewer to fill. <br /> <br /> Moderate and strong presentations, rounded characters, expressive dialogues, intelligent and internally consistent plot. We believe in the characters and we are moved by their story. Yes, they just do not do it anymore ...
