Wow!! An incredible and lost Australian piece And a glam-rock movie lost from the 70's in one. This film deserves to be seen simply to see what can be done with almost no budget but much enthusiasm. As a rereading of Oz's story, the film limits itself by becoming overly obvious, but is saved by its eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse of how glam rock manifests in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This movie used to be presented in double with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is. Although not as frivolous or well built as the RHPS, it's hard not to have fun with Oz. Surprisingly, Oz has aged well - perhaps a byproduct of how determined he is in real Australia in 1976.. The passage of history shows that many of the ideas being explored would end up entering the mainstream. The film's willingness to focus on gay characters is remarkable, especially since it dates back to the 'revolution' period of the Australian gay rights movement. <br /> <br /> The performances range from a little amateur to a delicate brilliance. The direction is lacking in subtlety and much of the dialogue may have benefited from an extra draft or two. Somehow, these flaws increase the appeal of the movie, which is mercifully unpretentious. Like Australia in the 1970s, this film has a certain naive charm. <br /> <br /> There are several connections to the original Australian staging of the Rocky Horror Show, which will keep your fingers obsessive. <br /> <br /> Oz is certainly a minor classic and a potential cult worthy of criticism. Laugh at the outrageous 1970s fashion, balance with the AusRock soundtrack, leave ANY expectation at the door and Oz will probably delight.
