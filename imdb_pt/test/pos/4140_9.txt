This movie set the standard for all the rock biopics to follow. This was achieved through the energetic performances of the leads, the steady work of the camera (avoiding 'rock-video' clich√©s that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing and a nonjudgmental presentation of the star as human being, instead of symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are small holes in the plot and incidental details that are somewhat unnecessary, and there will always be debate among the families of those personally involved in the details. But the point here, as in the much more recent "I Walk the Line" or the famous Carpenter filmmaker, Elvis, of the same era, is whether the meaning of the artist's life, in its time and place, as a catalyst for ideals of fans and appreciation, is manifested in performance, and this is clearly the case here. We came out of this movie understanding not only how Buddy Holly became a star, but why. I do not see what else anyone could want from the movie.
