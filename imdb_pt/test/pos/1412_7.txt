Johnny Crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teenager who is maturing into a generation that was in the midst of cultural and spiritual turmoil. Billy Graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet, sometimes tacky, but all the way candid movie. It gives us a look not only at the social scene, but gives good and solid advice that is true about morals, decisions, the gap between generations, teen dating (some of the statistics presented in this movie are astonishing. of today). Just to see Billy in his youth is worth seeing. It's an incredible movie. It made me realize that human nature does not change, even if hair, fashion and language can change, humans are still struggling with the same problems they have been struggling with for thousands of years.
