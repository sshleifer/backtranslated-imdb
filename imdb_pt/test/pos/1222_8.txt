Watching the preview of Armored, I thought the film would be very bad or very good. Fortunately, the movie was fun, full of suspense and realistic. There is never the perfect crime, and Armored has shown why. The film shows perfectly when people go into stressful situations, they behave like animals. The last hour of the movie is a lot of fun. Matt Dillon is still a great actor. Hard to believe Dillon is 50 years old. I would buy this movie. I give eight armored vehicles in ten. It's not a Christmas movie. Did I write ten lines yet? Not! Anyway, there are not many action movies. Armored has a lot of excitement, which gives the movie goer a choice over another comedy.
