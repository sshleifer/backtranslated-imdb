It is 1969. Phoebe (Camilla Belle) is an 11-year-old girl who grew up with an idealized vision of her 19-year-old sister Faith (Cameron Diaz). Faith is the doer, the seeker of truth, the fixer of all the errors of the world. Then one day, Phoebe and her mother, Gail (Blythe Danner), get word that Faith is dead. Faith has killed itself. Both Phoebe and Gail are impressed by this news, and though sad, Gail laments. Phoebe can not let go. Phoebe decides to go to Europe and find out what happened. <br /> <br /> It is now 1977. Phoebe (18-year-old Jordana Brewster) decides to go to Europe because of her mother's objections to finding out the truth. When alive, Faith was inseparable from a man she called "Wolf" (Christopher Eccleston). Although Wolf claims to know nothing about Faith's last days, Phoebe persuades him to tell her everything. Within days, Wolf realizes that he had not stopped going into the past as well and joins Phoebe on her pilgrimage to Portugal. <br /> <br /> In the end, Wolf is able to talk about decent drug and drug abuse. his own fault for not preventing suicide. Though irritated, Phoebe realizes in the end how human and fragile faith really was. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. I'm old enough to remember the bank robberies of the Red Army, and I was 10 in 1969. This story was familiar to me. I still remember young men trying to decide whether to go to Canada or not to avoid recruitment. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but it probably occurred several times in real life during this period. Camilla Belle was fun and entertaining to watch as she portrayed the lovely young lady enthused by what was happening around her. Jordana Brewster easily entered into the role of the older Phoebe. Blythe Danner was the always supportive mother, a role she is very familiar with American TV, alas. I'd like to see her with stronger material to work on. Cameron Diaz interpreted the immature anarchist perfectly. Although, at times, his performance of a 1960s activist seemed to come off a newscast. Of all the characters, it was the wolf of Christopher Eccleston, who made the greatest growth. When we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the film, we can see that he is a worldly man. He is a patient and gentle man, full of anger for the injustices of the world. In the end, he realizes that the direction he and Faith are following is wrong and begins to "grow", deciding that he should fight injustice in his own way. Faith refuses to join him in this and this eventually leads to his death. The Eccleston wolf is the most real of all the characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It was pleasant and thought-provoking. "The Invisible Circus" is classified as TV-MA, but there is very little curse, sex or violence. The subject of the film is the reason for the evaluation.
