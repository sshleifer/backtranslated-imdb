Looking at the works of Jim Henson years after his death is like taking a look at another time. For, unlike most so-called creative types who try to sell or, even worse, exploit cynically, children these days, Jim never really seemed to forget what it was like to be a child. And if there was a time when he demonstrated that, Labyrinth apart, is the 1979 Muppet Movie. Shot as an allegorical story about how Henson came to work on children's television as a puppet manipulator and ended up having a half-hour show of his own in prime time television, The Muppet Movie ends with a more progressive assertion, the types of understanding would tell children who did not meet the standard expected during the 1980s. And while we enjoy the fruits of a time when we are gagged and imprisoned by talk about anything that might offend us, the open celebration of difference or diversity that formed a large part of The Muppet Show is on offer here. I have said this in other reviews, but I must say it here. A great light in the world came out the day Jim Henson died. <br /> <br /> The Muppets movie begins with their cast sitting to see the premiere of what they were about to see for the next eighty minutes. In short, precise strokes, we are introduced to top players as well as some of the smaller ones. And when the story itself begins, boy is given a great song to bring us to the moment. Rainbow Connection painted a beautiful and sad image of what the Muppets, especially Kermit, were. These were not just a bunch of felt puppets with unique personalities who combined to make a show. They were living beings based on a part of us all, just written with much more daring than we are accustomed to. As each Muppet was presented to us in turn, we saw another reflection on our part and of course the children in the audience would respond differently to each character. So we all had a favorite. When Animal appeared behind a battery and tried to eat a dish, I knew I had found one of mine. Nowadays, I'm more of a Swedish Chef fan, but what the hey. <br /> <br /> Complementing the characters was a series of musical numbers that developed their motivations and personalities. Can you imagine that? shared a vision about Dr. Teeth and his band as well as Henson's creative soul. But the most relevant song for me was Gonzo's number, asking what it is and where it came from. Many of us spent our entire lives staring at the stars and, like Gonzo, saying that we knew we would go there someday. Not that all the songs were so deadly, of course. Fozzy and Kermit share a number after deciding to match their talent (or lack thereof) and take the road. If any evidence was needed for current "musicians" to lose the ability to use the pop structure to create something that could be heard, that would be the number. Never before, and never again, did the group dynamics of a cast and music complement each other perfectly. With the puppeteers and voice actors so perfect in their game, the human cast had a lot to live on. <br /> <br /> What makes it even more surprising that the human element has also lived to the end. of the agreement. Cameos literally peppered the movie, with everyone, from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas, offering their support. Even Richard Pryor, the last man one would expect to see in a movie about the Muppets, seems to create a hilarious moment. Mel Brooks's cameo is as disturbing to me as an adult was when I was little, but I suspect it was because Henson knew why I would find it disturbing now. The great acting force, however, comes from Charles Durning, who, like Doc Hopper, incorporates everything that Henson and his audience have decided to resist. At each intersection, Hopper arrives to offer Kermit a chance to sell himself and betray his own kind. Or maybe the offer is no longer the right word when Hopper's attempts to ensure Kermit's fulfillment become increasingly blunt and violent. The whole thing is a great metaphor of how every artist has his heart broken by the world. <br /> <br /> Of course, Animal also appears to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and cuddly does not make them less of a friend. In fact, Animal ends up being the best friend Kermit has at that moment. And that's been the central message of every good show or movie that Henson has been involved with ever since. That avoiding or dispensing others simply because of linguistic or cosmetic differences could literally be the worst mistake anyone makes. There is no doubt that in today's world where a purple-suited idiot can tell my children that they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and are not yet investigated by child welfare authorities, the Henson's creatures could never get off the ground. To misquote the title of the album, daring to be stupid is one thing, but reinforcing choice over others is another matter. The Muppet Movie demonstrates how Henson dared to ask all of us to think, both inside and outside the proverbial box. There will never be another entirely like him, but he would never want us to stop trying. <br /> <br /> So, The Muppet Movie is the epitome of a ten-in-ten movie. If we were to send a movie into the cosmos to prove to the intelligent life that we are worth more than being obliterated, that would be it.
