Eisenstein describes his collaboration with Prokeviev as an equal partnership, where they worked together to combine image and music, scene by scene. Unfortunately, sound recording was a disaster, so for the first time, devotion to authenticity on Criterion DVDs did not work out. Fortunately, there is at least one restored version of the VHS film (BMG Classics) with excellent re-recording of the music (by the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir). <br /> <br /> It is interesting to compare this film with contemporary propaganda films in England, Germany and the United States. Eisenstein's film was made in 1938, in response to the fear of a German invasion; and Olivier in 1943, when a German invasion of England was still expected. Both films are long lasting, but in different ways. Olivier begins by showing a staged performance of the play at Shakespeare's own Globe Theater, and then takes us out of the theater into a more cinematographic (though still stylized) setting. Eisenstein's film is cinematic from the start, but dialogue and speeches are still influenced by the melodramatic conventions of the old Russian theater. This works very well for the speeches of Cerkassov as Alexander because part of his job as prince and military leader was to play a role in public. In Nazi Germany, Leni Riefenstahl's first major propaganda film was the boring one. Triumph of the Will, which recorded a huge political spectacle - crowded crowds applauding Hitler's speeches. Advertising in his masterpiece, the 1936 Berlin Olympics film, is much more subtle, with his adoration of the athletic male body carrying disturbing reflections of the myth of Aryan superiority. But German propaganda films in times of war can also be subtle. Karl Ritter's Urlaub auf Ehrenwort (Furlough on Word of Honor) is typical. It shows a young lieutenant letting the men in his company go on a 24-hour leave before returning to the trenches of World War I (and almost certain death). Against the advice of the veterans, he accepts his word of honor to return, although he will be tried by the court and thrown if he does not. Of course, they all return (although some of them berate themselves for it), presumably inspiring audiences to similar demonstrations of duty to their country. <br /> <br /> In the United States, one of the best propaganda films of World War II. was the Howard Hawks Air Force. In it, we follow the unmanned crew of a bomber as they bond with each other with the experience of battle and overcome obstacles to continue their part in the war. Usually, for Hawks films, their true loyalty is more between them than with their country. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein has to go far back in history to find any Russian military triumph. Ironically, Alexander (like the other Russian princes) is descended from the Vikings who navigated the Russian rivers to conquer and govern their own fiefdoms. So he is a conqueror repelling another would-be conqueror. Physically, they are not so different (although the actors who interpret the German princes were obviously chosen for their ugliness and dumb stupidity). But the real contrast is between ordinary soldiers. The Russian peasants are as tall and strong as the nobles; while the German peasants who leave the wall of shields to kill the wounded Russians are a little lower than their masters. There is some historical truth in this contrast. Russian servants in the Middle Ages were far better off than their European counterparts, because they could always flee to the desert and clean their own land. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein's film also gives us the first glimpse of Alexander as a fisherman. In battle with the Germans, he uses his fisherman's knowledge on the ice as well as his knowledge of his military tactics to defeat them. When Gavrilo breaks the shield wall, they are forced to regroup and mass on the west side of the lake where the ice is thinner. <br /> <br /> One of the other pleasures of Eisenstein's film (which most audiences miss) is the historically accurate way he portrays the politics of medieval Russia. Cities such as Pskov and Novgorod owed their growing wealth and prominence largely to commerce, which put merchants in power, and marginalized princes until their military knowledge and feudal taxes were necessary to repel the invaders. In the film, Alexander is shown not only as a military leader, but also as a political master, who knows how to wait for his time, and how to make the most of his popularity after victory.
