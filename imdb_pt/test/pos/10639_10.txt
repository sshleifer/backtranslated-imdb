Some users are confused about the identity of the armed men descending the stairs in the sequence "Staircase of Odessa". These men are not Cossacks, but regular army troops. <br /> <br /> The Cossacks arrive at the site a little later and it is the men on horseback who cut the crowd with their sabers. <br /> <br /> For experts in Russian history: Correct me if I am wrong. <br /> <br /> But there are some lines in the movie that apparently no one commented on. After taking Potemkin, someone in the crowd says, "Kill the Jews!" This is on the screen for only a few seconds, but it's there. How ruthlessly typical of history, not just in Russia, but in so many other countries, to blame the Jews for any reason, immediately, unthinkingly, and instinctively. domestic issues! <br /> <br /> Perhaps other parts of the film are not historically factual, but the outcry against the Jews is too real. Comments, anyone? <br /> <br /> Furthermore, why do not English speakers learn to pronounce the name "Potyomkin" instead of "Potemkin"? There is a need in Russian to distinguish the two possible pronunciations of "and": as "ye" or "I". Sometimes two points are used to distinguish these two pronunciations, but generally the difference simply has to be memorized.
