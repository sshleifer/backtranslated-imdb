I'm sorting this movie on a curve, in other words, it's not the biggest movie ever made, but it does exactly what it purports to do. This is a great T & A movie. I have no idea how many T's or A's were seen in this movie, but I saw a shot that had 16 T's at the same time, just so you have an idea. There are topless girls everywhere. There is a wet shirt contest scene. And the climax involves a touch football game between two girl-only teams and every time someone scores a touchdown, the entire opposing team loses one piece of clothing. I do not know why it gets so low here. Perhaps the people who gave low grades thought they would see Citizen Kane. I love this movie and hope to find more similar ones. If you are looking for a good campy T & A movie I highly recommend this.
