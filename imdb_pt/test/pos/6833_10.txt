Surprised to learn that the director (Sebastian Gutierrez) was a young Venezuelan (28) and bored with so many predictable films, I was delighted with the script showing so many little stories and clues scattered here and there. Run with black humor and good taste, I loved the tension between Boggart Rickman himself and the very natural but beautiful Thompson. Every member of the gang deserves attention, Gil Bellows at his best. Gugino is remarkable.
