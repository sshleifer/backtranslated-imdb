I own a video store with hundreds of documentaries. I've seen a lot of them and I love all the great information out there. Only a handful small, even coming close to offering information as important as this. I've been reading through other peoples reviews of this movie and I can not help noticing that the main things that people are criticizing are irrelevant. Like "It's too one-sided" Such pathetic criticism, everywhere in society you look, you'll see the other side, and if you still need help, go to globalpublicmedia.com. "They're the same people over and over." Uh, someone might be led to believe that these people are experts, so maybe they're the best people to interview. "Filming style is all the same, photos on the head with few exceptions" If you want to flash and dazzle, watch Micheal Moore if you want to watch actual documentations like this. As you can clearly see, none of these claims has any relevance to the information contained. My guess is that these people are just missing the point and do not want to give up SUV's. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: Watch. Learn from this and continue your education on these subjects. It is very important for everyone.
