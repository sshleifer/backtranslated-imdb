I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> No one I know likes it, but I like it. <br /> <br /> I did not like it as much as the first, but it was still good. The script and plot may not have changed, but the story was better than Caddyshack 1. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not like Caddyshack 2 is ... <br /> /> NO RODNEY DANGERFIELD! <br /> <br /> I think the film would be better if Rodney Dangerfield had the part of Jackie Mason. Although I liked Jackie Mason in the movie, it would be much better if they kept Rodney Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> Another flaw in the film, which I did not hate so much, was Dan Akroyd. The film was made 8 years after the first. Bill Murray, "Carl," could have left his job as a janitor and joined the military, you know? If Warner Bros. had thought of it, could have made the movie better too. <br /> <br /> This was my comment for the Caddyshack II. <br /> <br /> I give him 8.2 10 <br /> <br /> It could have been better, but good anyway. <br /> <br /> If you saw Caddyshack 1 and are debating whether or not to see Caddyshack 2, I say give it a try.
