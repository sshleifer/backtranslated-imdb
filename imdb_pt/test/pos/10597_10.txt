shot or even need to be rated since it was never designed to be rated as Oscar-winning movies and never intended to win an Oscar (obviously). if you just look at some of the things that Bam and Bran tried, like the quick camera shots, they appear as a movie that is something more than just cky or jackass (even if they are cool too). For pure fun I definitely give this movie a 10; almost all the scenes made me laugh until my sides ached, like the falcone trail film. If you have not yet, see and buy. Personally, my favorite character is brandon (falcone), he is so smooth and natural and random that he is hilarious, he freestyles great (with action figures) and makes things funnier, lol a diamond mountain bike? Smashed is definitely a movie that in general humor is only rivaled by anchor and Napoleon dynamite.
