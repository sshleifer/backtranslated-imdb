Sweet, rich valley girl develops passion for an alley punk and when her snobby friends disapprove, she is forced to choose between her heart and her popularity. The very fun romantic comedy combines elements of black comedy and cheese from the 80's that make it even more fun to watch. The film follows not only the valley girl's life and her punk; but her friends also shop, party and go to the mall. If the dialogue does not make you laugh non-stop for a week, the music goes. Songs like "Johnny, are you weird?" are found everywhere. In addition, Elizabeth Daily is a funny and existential character, and the Prom King & Queen's speech at the end is hilarious!
