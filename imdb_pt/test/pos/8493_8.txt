Let's get the wrong way done - the movie should have been much longer. Ray Charles was a brilliant and fascinating man leading a complex and challenging life. There simply was no way to fit everything - or even touch it all - into a standard length movie. Given this, the producers of this film did an admirable job (and I'm sure agonizing) of putting together a film that could not tell the whole story, but managed to present a representative sample of the man and his music. Ray Charles's forces were evident throughout the film and his weaknesses were neither amplified nor coated with sugar. We might have wanted another hour of narrating your life after 1980, but I suppose that would have been a tribute to the film and at the same time would allow for the resolution of several things that hung at the end. balance I think it was better as presented. <br /> <br /> Now, to the big question: what are the criteria for an Oscar? The wife and I have seen countless movies in our years, but we immediately agreed that we have never seen a performance like that of Jamie Foxx. The line between actor and character has not been blurred - but has completely disappeared. We had heard a lot of hype before watching the movie, but that was weird. Foxx was Ray Charles. You did not watch the movie with the feeling that you were watching Foxx do a great job of playing Ray Charles - you watched in some way believe or understood that you were watching Ray Charles himself. I do not know how to put it anymore. We were completely delighted. I admit we have not seen all the other performances for an Oscar this year, but that does not really matter. Foxx took it to a whole different level, which we have never witnessed before and doubt that we can see again. I can not think of any other films I have ever seen in which a person doing such a complete and compelling part would become the person portrayed. We salute you, Mr. Foxx. We understand that an Oscar award has a lot to do with performance, but whether you win or not, we want you to know that you've done something that is in an absolute class and you should be proud of its unmatched achievement. <br /> <br /> The music was naturally great. I commented with the wife that if there is a moment in the history of music that I would have liked to have witnessed, it would have been the genesis (in Kansas City, right?) Of What'd I Say? The movie did a wonderful job with this - I just wish I could be there!
