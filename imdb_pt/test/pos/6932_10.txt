Todd Sheets has created one of the biggest zombie movies of LOW BUDGET EVER. The story is great, the blood is great, the psychotics are bad! However, the film is defective because of its petty dialogues and sometimes slow pictures. <br /> <br /> Despite this, ZB2 offers what any Zumbi movie should do, good storyline, fast adventure on the noodles. If only MR spreadsheets had received a 100k budget, this movie would make every zombie movie even the almighty dawn of the dead. <br /> <br /> But as time goes on he gets better and gets more money comes in his pocket. So allowing this modern Genius man to create his vision better. <br /> <br /> Just remember that Zombie Bloodbath 2 was just one of your big steps when he's on top of Gore Mountain
