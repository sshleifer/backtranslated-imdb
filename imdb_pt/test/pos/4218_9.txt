The film was surprisingly wonderful, especially considering the last sequel. The third one was dark and semi-interesting, but it was not as fun or enjoyable as this. It is full of comic lines about Martha Stuart, doll anatomy, masturbation, and was actually done effectively during the horrific and disturbing images. The film was not scary or suspenseful and I'm sure it was not the director's intention. It was fun because of the nonsense, Jennifer Tilly's exaggerated and sexy performance. The doll dolls were so well handled, the movement of the mouth, lips, tears in the eyes, knife in the chest and the costumes. The dolls were wonderful and made the horrible deaths more stimulating, considering the fact that they were made by wonderful dolls. Chucky's new look was great and Tiffany looked really cute. Some scenes with Chucky hugging the human Tiffany even made my dad smile. Jesse and Jade were surprisingly attractive and the special effects were cool. The ending was so unsuspected and the fact that they could make another so good is quite unlikely. It may not be as full of suspense as movies like Halloween H2O or Urban Legend, but it's certainly more fun !!!!
