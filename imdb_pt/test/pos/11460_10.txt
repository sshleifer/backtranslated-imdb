I remember seeing this movie at the movies and liked it. It happened to stumble into the network of fear last month and watch it again and I found it better with age. First of all for those of you who describe this as 80's cheese if you compare it objectively with the horror films of the last two decades, it compares very well compared to films in your horrified subgenre that I would call action / horror as opposed to psychological horror, as "The Enlightened One" or "the Exorcist." <br /> <br /> In addition, by its budget, this film actually delivers the goods (or, in this case, is bad). The film actually has some character development and gives a lot of a story of the infamous hull house to get the atmosphere just before the characters step on the front door. The movie also has several hilarious liners and gives the appropriate mood that a horror movie must have. If you compare NOD to big-budget contemporary horror movies like "I Am Legend" (Vincent Price's version was much better), this movie really stands out. Modern horror flicks have become almost completely dominated by CGI. Most have no plot or character and are completely predictable. Special effects dominate these films from beginning to end and the characters are made of 24k plastic. If this is the horror cheese of the 80's, I'll take over 95% of the current entries in the genre. <br /> <br /> On a closing note, seeing NOD reminded me of the beautiful Jill Terashita and ask myself why I have not seen her in more horror movies or not. Jill on the odd chance that you read this, I think you're beautiful and should have been in more movies. Lastly, if you like action and horror movies, you'll probably like this movie a lot.
