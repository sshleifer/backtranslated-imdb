I can not believe how perfect this movie is. Great CG graphics, good plot and fights, oh the fights !!! This movie was great !! The characters. They seem real enough to be considered real. They definitely look like the ones in the game perfectly. The scene where ... well all the scenes made my jaw drop. Fantastic graphics from 10/10 The story. Perfectly explained. In addition, the way Aeris comes to help the Cloud in many different moments of the film. They explain this very well, and make their jaw drop from how perfect it is. But repetitive fights draw some history, but that is only a minor thing. History 9.5 / 10 Everything else, great. The movie was simply fantastic. I really do not know what else I can say except that this movie was pretty much perfect. I LOVED!!!
