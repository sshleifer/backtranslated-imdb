This 8-minute jewel is not just timeless, but it's a cartoon landmark. It's the third Mickey cartoon and one of his best too. It's a cartoon frame because it was the first one with sound. And my God, even after more than 70 years, is always so good, and gives real added weight to the narrative. The black and white animation is great and the characters' features are convincing enough. The music is wonderful, I love the soundtrack, this adds to the fun that the cartoon has, no matter how lean the story sometimes is. And the cartoon is funny! So many memorable moments, like cow teeth being used as a xylophone and his udder like a bagpipe. The characters are also engaging, Mickey and Minnie two Disney characters are well voiced by Walt Disney, and Pete serves well as "the villain of the play." All in all, "Steamboat Willie" is just a timeless gem that everyone should see at least once. 10/10 Bethany Cox
