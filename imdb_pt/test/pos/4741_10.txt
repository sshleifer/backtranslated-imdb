After watching "Waco: The Rules of Engagement" I was sitting in disbelief of what I was witnessing. A great FBI coverage, a massacre of happy government agents? I clearly remember Waco's standoff, I was seventeen at the time and watched it all on CNN. I remembered reflecting on all the children as I watched the Mount Camel compound burn in April 1993. I remember feeling sorry for the children, but I clearly felt that it was the fault of the evil leader David Koresh and the other Davidians. Gazecki's film clearly shows and beyond any doubt, even if it is biased, that the FBI has lied repeatedly. I think this film was a major contributor to the reopening of a new investigation of the incident in 1999. The outcome of this new investigation was somewhat predictable, the judgment was based on facts that were as gray as the facts that the Davidians presented. I was very disappointed in the verdict because, to my knowledge, it did not take into account the whole lie, misinformation, and cover-up of evidence from the FBI and other officials. Why can not anyone be sued for making the work of the Texas Rangers investigators difficult? Why were they allowed to contaminate the crime scene and intimidate the compound shortly after the incident? These are questions for which I have not received replies from the government. More importantly, and children? In this new investigation I was not informed about who was responsible for spraying the flammable tear gas of CS into a compound with many dangers to ignite this gas and found no answer to know if the muscles of the children contracted due to the effects of the gas while they were alive. If they did, I would certainly think that Janet Reno or who was already in charge of the attack should be indicted for mass murder or manslaughter. The question that was raised by Gazecki but not mentioned is: Was it a direct plan for the responsible people and their tanks to make holes and burn the building with intent? (a plan that would have been effected with 112% effectiveness) or were the officials responsible so incompetent that they were unaware of the consequences of their actions? Both are equally scary. Even if the Davidians set the complex down, the responsible officers certainly gave them the opportunity to do the job. If the responsible officers knew, as they claimed, that the Davidians would set fire to the complex, why the f? Did the tanks cut through all the holes in the building, turning it into a furnace, and why had they no plans to deal with the fire they knew would occur? Dark Questions Not Yet Disappeared The last and most relevant issue of this film is the way Davidians are demonized by government through the media, which only feed it to the public. I clearly remember the resentment I felt for the evil Davidians I saw on CNN in 1993. Now that I am older, I can see a clear line of communication coming out of the government every time they prepare for a massacre of civilians. with the intended targets. Demonizing people with words like; "They have different illegal values, so we" "do not enjoy freedom" and "they are a threat to our freedoms and way of life" makes it much easier to kill ????
