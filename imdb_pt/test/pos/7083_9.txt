I loved One True Thing from the first time I watched in the theater, and I cried my eyes out. I bought it as soon as it was available, and I lost count of how many times I watched. <br /> <br /> For me, One True Thing is the best family relationship movie. I love watching relationships in the family change and evolve into what they end up being. I can relate to many details in the film. My mother died of bone cancer, so she really comes home with me. Maybe that's why I love it so much. <br /> I like the relationships between children and their parents, and the relationship between brother and sister, but especially love the relationship between husband and wife. For me it's really beautiful. <br /> <br /> I recommend this move to anyone who likes this kind of movie.
