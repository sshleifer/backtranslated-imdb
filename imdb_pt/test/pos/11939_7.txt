- The Best Bit: When the dumb mafioso (Nicholas Turturro) calls the fugitive (Matthew Modine) "Shane! .. Come back Shane!" and when the older guy asks "What are you doing?!" he simply repeats "Enjoying My Time!" Actually like me at the moment! <br /> <br /> The Most Scary Part: I've been thinking all the time watching: where did I see that girl before? At where ? At where ? Until I discovered while the final credits .. OHH MY GOD! She is (Elizabeth Berkley) .. From the fiasco of the dancers! But I just could not recognize it with your clothes! To tell the truth, I felt a brief tremor. She is very cute and cool, but maybe Hollywood has no mercy! <br /> <br /> The sexiest: When (Berkley) says "You mean the stuff that gives you a horny?!". <br /> <br /> - The dullest thing: The retarded assistant after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy in the end !! In addition, the Mexican smuggler took 3 bullets (in the same car!) and he is not dead too !! ??? <br /> <br /> The Ugly Thing: All the murdered people, as well as the many (F) are kept in a boring situation! The most beautiful thing: The crazy intelligent script with all the funny characters and the tumultuous situations, the acting seemed sweet also especially of (Paul Rodriguez), who stole the show for (as he had the better dialogue too!). <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing: Although the direction has not spoiled the perip√©cia of the history, but at the same time did not give him a unique touch, an incomparable signature, some kind of insane hilarity like the one of the own history . However, perhaps the low production has harmed well! And of course the easy music without taste that could be so because of cheap production too! <br /> <br /> The most confusing part: (Matthew Modine) is a talented guy, but what exactly did he do to get out of the "A" list of Hollywood stars ?! What could be the thing that he did (or did not!) To end up in light play (The Shipment)? !! <br /> <br /> - The most absent scene: Where (Jose) the Mexican smuggler was finally?! I thought we would see him again at the end, smuggling once again as the surviving little criminal who, in a brief scheme like this, could materialize the continuing disorder of such a world. <br /> <br /> The Biggest Question I Had After The End: When Will We See (The Shipment - 2)? How I'm so eager to see that little comic and humiliating atmosphere again! <br /> <br /> These were my own answers.
