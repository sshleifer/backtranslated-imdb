Who is the man ~~~ what do I hear? A rumbling cry from Kevin? Well, if you have not shouted at the "usual suspect", I recommend changing your prescription drug. Anyway this is not a first class movie, just a very well produced story, which is almost believable. Considering your about an Alien your probably wondering what the? All acting is top and also the first time I saw a balanced and sarcastic Alien. Just pleasurable is all I can say and almost to the whole family (if not to the scene further on in the movie). SEVEN STARS
