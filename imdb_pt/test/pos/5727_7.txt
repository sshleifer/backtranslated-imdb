IT'S OK. Overall, this three-part documentary will bring people most interested in the world of physics and the last 300 years of discovery of our universe. If you've read Stephen Hawkings' brilliant book "A Brief History of Time" and understood, then you can benefit from the visual description of certain concepts ... which I did to some extent. Greene is bearable, but obviously for the sake of the masses, he tends to explain things in a slightly paternalistic way. This is obviously deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who attends this series. <br /> <br /> The invited scientists were good. (not hawking, but I suppose he has his own DVD (s)) I kept waiting for him to appear, but they roam through them for almost 3 parts ... (very American weighted here, with some Brits and an antipodean) the Nova 2 Disc edition (NTSC) and there were some inclusions that really detracted from the overall experience. <br /> <br /> 1. "This is brought to you by ..." at the beginning of each part was a necessary evil for the first part, but seeing it twice more before ending was very common. <br /> <br /> 2. I can not be helped, I suppose, but there is a bit of overlap in the beginning of 2 and 3, which made me pick up the FFW button a few times. <br /> <br /> 3. This set of discs went straight from TV .. (ie ads, what happened at the last show for those who lost, and frequent "goto pbs.org for more .... ") that appear throughout the presentation. (quite different from the BBC material that is incomparable to the presentation ... Planets, the Blue Planet, etc.) My 7/10 is based only on content. The niggles were there, but I overcame them. If that had been done with that classic British-accented presenter (you know what it is), it would be a perfect record in my opinion. <br /> <br /> If you've seen this and want more ... then I recommend Hawkings' book "A Brief History of Time" ... I wish it was a movie too. <br /> <br /> Happy viewing.
