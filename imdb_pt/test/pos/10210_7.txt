Escaping a bank robber, outlaw Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) helps Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), the Western Union chief engineer who is inspecting the Old West and had an accident with a horse. In 1861, Vance regenerates and is hired to work for Western Union with the team that is installing the poles and cables from Omaha to Salt Lake City. Vance and Harvard engineer Richard Blake (Robert Young) flirt with Edward's beautiful sister, Sue Creighton (Virginia Gilmore), and she chooses Vance. However, his past haunts him when outlaw Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) steals Western Union cattle disguised as Indians. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" is a good but predictable Western, directed by Fritz Lang. History shows the difficulties of brave and idealistic men responsible for installing the telegraph through the West, facing thieves and Indians. The fun story has action, drama, romance and funny situations, but with the exception of Jack Slade's identity, there is no surprise in history. Randolph Scott gives another magnificent performance with a great cast. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Conquerors" ("The Conquerors")
