The main achievement of this film is that, although racially unipolar, the film still manages to sculpt a picture of war portraits that leave a lasting identification with who can see it, and who was present at the moment. Although good films may have the ability to universalize their subjects, which is often difficult to do; great movies have the ability to universalize their unipolar affairs, which is what this movie does. <br /> <br /> Instead of sculpting a context of unity, the film portrays the Japanese in the cursed completion of the Philippine war front. February 1945, making signs of pacifism or war, but rather making signs of the feelings, death, destruction, victory and disease of war with the bloody hands of the defeated. Very different, and superior, for films like Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, both needed a satirical methodology to trivialize and depersonalize American troops, and to use all races as a struggle, which is good, but not as grandiose as a film that uses a race and vision, which would look fascist if it were created in America , to convey the horror of the war and to show how it really is. <br /> <br /> The only way the main character goes through this movie to the end is to be sick, hence inedible; So through this character, through his illness, his saving face, we see the end of World War II in the Philippines in February 1945, and the way the Americans, Japanese, and Filipinos gathered in bloody acts of war where you live to die. The film is patently influenced by a neorealistic mode of film representation, which is original and beneficial to a viewer, then or now, for the neorealistic techniques he employs convey all the horrors of war in the pictorial imagery. form a showcase for pacifism or "militaristic responsibility." Like Germania Anno Zero, by Roberto Rossellini, a story emerges of the environment and the conditions associated with it. <br /> <br /> The opening of the film, with the two-way discussion between the two Japanese soldiers, prefigures and remakes the events. Through this openness, we feel that the struggle is human against human and human for human; This shows that they relied on one another to confront the enemy in past battles, but now, in this opening, or "pivot" of the Japanese experiences in the Philippines, new information is passed on to the main character Tamura, giving a feeling of cannibalism if they want survive. <br /> <br /> The jungle is sandy, damp and dense, and the sky is not overcast and dripping. We walk with the wandering, though puddles and swamps, as sick as the earth around them. The nameless corpses are scattered everywhere. From time to time you can not tell if they are bodies, stones or corn. Apparently there is no difference here, everything is dead and sick. Everything is dying. All they have in order to feed themselves are rare monkeys and corpses of fallen comrades and / or nameless enemies. <br /> <br /> Often Tamura finds another near death fallen. Though crushed in spirit and crushing theirs, some offer their bodies for him to eat, but he refuses; he still, as Hiroshi Kawaguchi as Nishi in Giants and Toys, will not fall into the death of Japanese dignity and morality; for that is all he really has to stand for his survival, a dignity of himself. So when Nagamatsu is dissecting a soldier for consumption, he shoots him for it. Tamura may be accustomed to murder, but with the disease of killing and looting he can not decipher. He is neither good nor bad man. He wants to survive, but it does not go beyond simple murder straight. His self perished dead on the battlefield, he is not happy here to traverse and wipe the weak for his survival. <br /> <br /> The disease he carries he sees everywhere, in all; and unfortunately he does not have the ethical reasoning to think or think entirely about others, since he can not give up his body because of his contagious disease, or thinking entirely of himself, since he sees illness at all, though still kill them even if they do no harm. Seen in his attack on the two Philippians in the hut. He can not see anyone. No one can see anyone. The one sees an aversion of disease and an adversity to health, the heart of survival instincts. <br /> <br /> Often an arm appears pointing to the left of the screen, toward what should be hope, for there, so far away Thule lies his freedom. However, it is blocked by American soldiers, leaving the wandering Japanese to die slowly in this bereaved land. Even a church tower appears, reflecting the light of an invisible sun. But, on closer inspection, the crows flutter uncontrollably; Religion is also an air of poison. <br /> <br /> Nobi, the Japanese title of the film, gives more evidence to the themes or feelings of the film: the bondage to destiny, the weight of existence under the leaders and lives controlled by others. Its proper Anglophone translation has been the subject of heavy debate among historians, since non-Koreans translate it as "slave" and "enslavement", while many Koreans argue that the nobi was not a slave system but a servant-class system than criteria for slavery. A way to typically escape painful poverty. This improves the war theme and infantry symbolism. <br /> <br /> It is not important in the time period to ask ourselves what is the purpose of what will become our history gained? Should we feel free to let it unfold without conscious effort of change? It's not who we're fighting with, this old story matter, but why are we fighting? Fires on the Plain is with Eiji Funakoshi, Osamu Takizawa and Mickey Curtis; based on a novel by Shohei Ooka. In Japanese with subtitles.
