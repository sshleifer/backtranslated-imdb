An exciting, action-packed and interesting film telling the story of a group of men stationed at a naval base in Italy and their adventures aboard a Navy submarine during World War One. Tommy and Brick (played by Robert Montgomery and Robert Young) are two friends, and they are two very handsome officers, I must say. A new captain arrives on board, already known to some as "Dead Pan" Toler (Walter Huston) and he is a true supporter to follow the rulebook and a "code of honor". Soon Tommy and Brick are chasing after an attractive blonde in an officer's dance, Tommy insults the captain - and of course, the blonde is actually the captain's daughter. But Tommy wins anyway, as he and his daughter run away from the dance to a street carnival outside, and soon unite during an air raid - unfortunately for him, she reveals that she is married. Later, Tommy gets into serious trouble when he disobeys orders in an effort to save his friend. <br /> <br /> This movie is a lot of fun with an absorbing plotline that has kept my interest and performances high-level by all. A climactic death scene with Sterling Holloway is indeed astounding - the most memorable scene in this movie, I thought. Eugene Palette and Jimmy Durante add a bit of humor here playing a couple of fools - the character of Durante is actually studying to be a dentist via mail and continually has disagreements on the ground with a Brit who makes fun of his nose. Okay - if you're looking for a movie showing a man with a kangaroo, that would be the guy.
