Three children are born during a solar eclipse, and ten years later that somehow made them grow up without awareness. As the tenth anniversary celebrations draw nearer, they become smart and calculating cold-blooded assassins. Local girl Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin) finds herself facing such petty terrors when most others are falling in love with her angelic behavior. Returning to films such as "The Bad Seed" and "Village of the Damned," the premise of evil childrens movies may not be entirely original, but it is still very disturbing. All three children's actors - Elizabeth Hoy, Billy Jacoby and Andy Freeman - are convincing. Director Ed Hunt and his co-writer, Barry Pearson, keep the mood unappealing and attractive for the duration of the film; they get to the point of having the little girl charge for a pious unwittingly involving her older sister (the upcoming stand-up comedian and MTV personality Julie Brown, whose striptease is a true look). <br /> <br /> Name actors Susan Strasberg, as an ice teacher, and Jose Ferrer, with almost no screen time as a doctor, add to the process with his presence while KC Martel, one of the original youngsters "The Amityville Horror," is very nice as Joyce's younger brother. Other familiar faces like Ellen Geer, Michael Dudikoff, B's man-movie, Cyril O'Reilly ("Porky", "Dance of the Damned"), Joe Penny ("Jake and Fatman") and William Boyett Hidden ") can be seen as well. Touching such parental fears as children playing with guns they discovered and being locked inside old fridges, "Bloody Birthday" is little more than just a variation slasher with children as antagonists. Helped and encouraged by the soundtrack of Arlon Obers, this movie stands in the memory more than some of his siblings, without much courage to appeal (though that arrow through the gag works very well). Bleak, nasty and pessimistic, "Bloody Birthday" is worth a look at the curious. <br /> <br /> 7/10
