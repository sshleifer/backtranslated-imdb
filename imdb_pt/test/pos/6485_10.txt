"... the beat is very strong ... we are deaf mutants now - like them", Rex Voorhas Ormine <br /> <br /> I am surprised that this film has been uniformly beaten. Let me be the first to really discuss the virtues of "The Beat" and why you should see this movie now. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this movie is tacky and "bad" in the conventional sense: o the story is absurd, poetry is silly, and the acting is inconsistent. <br /> <br /> But these are the CHARMS of the movie - all of these ingredients form the recipe for one of the most submerged CHEEZY movies of the 80s. If the reference to "deaf mutants" does not awaken your interest, then maybe that means: What kind of name is "Rex Voorhas Ormine", anyway? It's such an unusual name (for the American public) that I said to myself, "Even the names of the characters in this damn movie are silly." <br /> <br /> Well, "The Beat" is so fabulously shocking that the "meaning" and "symbolism" behind "Rex Voorhas Ormine" is revealed not too subtly by Bart Waxman (the misguided counselor who you love to hate). I'm not going to spoil the revelation behind Rex's name, but please do not get too excited, okay? In general, the acting is inconsistent (John Savage - who plays the "worried teacher" Mr. Ellsworth is very good, as is the colleague who plays Bart Waxman, but the rest of the cast is not convincing ). That said, the acting does not hurt the film. Because? There is a SINCERITY in every one of the actors' performances that makes the characters they play are captivating. So while the performances may be bad, you still have the impression that the actors are really trying to do the best. As a result, the sincerity of the actors happens where their acting fails (which is quite frequent). <br /> <br /> The tribute to "beating poetry" in this film is bad, bad, bad. But that's good, well, good when it comes to entertainment. Would you really enjoy "better quality" or "more respectable" poetry - especially in a movie like this? <br /> <br /> Guys, this would be BORING (think of the way they made us read in high school) -anitized to avoid "corrupting youth," politically conservative and devoid of any critical analysis, etc.). you do not like poetry or "arty" movies (with all the "intellectual" posture this implies), you most certainly can (and should) appreciate LUDICROUS POETRY in a WANNABE ART MOVIE !!!! How can you not enjoy the following? <br /> <br /> "Do you remember the roar of the dinosaur? Craps of a scaly woman on the floor bad scots bad, oh the woman is so sad that she washes her hands and then wait for the door today, yes - today ! "<br /> <br /> Yes, this is an example of some of the remarkable poetry scattered throughout The Beat. But what about history, you ask? <br /> <br /> Well, the story is absurd. But again, that's the beauty of this movie. In addition to a few predictable plot cliches, stereotypes and plot points, there are genuinely unique enough elements for the plot / story to keep things interesting. Who is Rex? Where he came from? What the hell is he talking about? Deaf mutants? Illiterate Angels? Billy and Kate REALLY understand what Rex is saying? Should the public understand Rex and his possession of poetry? (I've seen the movie several times and I have not figured it all out yet.) <br /> <br /> Does bad poetry and high school talent really do away with VIOLENCE OF THE BEAT? <br /> <br /> I guarantee that you have never seen anything like "The Beat" - a perfect combination of brilliantly poor poetry, mediocre and sincere acting, and a plot of "mythopoetic conquers gang violence" that is still RIVALED BY ANY MOVIE NEVER MADE. <br /> <br /> Bonus for fans of classic NYC hardcore: The Cro-Mags make a rare movie appearance as the "Iron Skulls" and it's a joke to see them play multiple songs. I would like them to include more show scenes, but maybe this is an "extra" included on the DVD "collector" that I fantasize about. <br /> <br />
