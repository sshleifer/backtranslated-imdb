As one previous reviewer said, Travolta stole all the scenes in which he was. Recognize the character? It was Vinnie Barberino, all grown up and still a little despicable, but still nice, oh yes! <br /> <br /> Disappointing were William Hurt and Bob Hoskins, perhaps because their characters were poorly written, or they just did not care. I kept seeing one of the Baldwins (I never remember which) in the Hurt role, so Hurt's incredible talents were not wasted. <br /> <br /> Andie McDowell is sweet, but not very believable; in part writing. Character development was not a big deal in this movie. Just watch Travolta, sit down and enjoy.
