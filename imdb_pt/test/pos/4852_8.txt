This is a movie about a man that everyone thinks is Jewish. This is a movie about Lawrence Newman, who lives in Brooklyn in the 1940s, at the time of World War II. One day when he wears glasses, people start to think he is Jewish. And that's just because it looks like one. And he lives in a very anti-Semitic neighborhood. Then some people start treating it like dirt. They make this judgment, being Jewish, of Larry's new wife, Gertrude Hart as well. lives unbearable. Neal Slavin's Focus (2001) is a good look at anti-Semitism. This is a problem that will not go away. The film is based on the novel by Athur Miller, which, I admit, I did not read. film is really good, so I'm sure the book too. The actors do a good job. William H.Macy is always good, and his work as Larry Newman is brilliant. Laura Dern is Gert Hart and she is magnificent. almost frightening as the neighbor who wants to keep the Jews out by any means necessary. David Paymer's character as a Jewish shop owner Mr. Finkelstein is the most sympathetic in the film. Paymer is the perfect choice for paper. One of the biggest scenes is at the end, when Mr. Finkelstein and Newman fight against Nazi people with baseball cues. They come together to fight the Christian and the Jew.
