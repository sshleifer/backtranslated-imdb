The idea of ​​comic book pioneer Alex Raymond, "Flash Gordon" was the great father of all science fiction epics. This series is the first time Flash has been brought to celluloid life. Despite its low budget, this is a great space opera. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Earth doomed to apparent destruction, when Planet Mongo has been running through space on a collision course. The scientist Maverick Dr. Zarkov is going to the planet that approaches in a rocket, convinced that he can do something to stop the escaped celestial body. He gets some last-minute recruits in the form of the ingenious Flash Gordon athlete and the handsome Dale Arden. When they get to Mongo, their problems really begin. They came into conflict with the emperor Ming, the ruthless, conqueror of his world, who has some ambitious plans for Earth. <br /> <br /> The rest of the series revolves around Flash's desperate attempts to save Earth; the varied alien cultures he encounters; the allies he makes; spaceships he flies; the battles he fights, and the monsters he kills. <br /> <br /> Brightly designed by Raymond, "Flash Gordon" presents classic archetypes of legendary myths and fables of antiquity. Echoes of famous tales such as the sagas of Troy and Camelot and Sherwood Forrest are seen here. You have the heroic and beautiful hero on a mission to save the kingdom (Flash); The evil king (Ming); The old sage (Zarkov); The lovely damsel in distress (Dale); the seductive mermaid (Aura); loyal allies (Thun, Barin, Vultan); In addition to monsters, dragons and various bugs. <br /> <br /> Flash is a modern Robin Hood, Jason or Beowulf. Ming is Prince John or Agamemnon. Dale is Helen of Troy or Gwenevere or Marion Maid. Zarkov is Merlin or Odysseus. (Or Gandalf) Thun / Barin / Vultan are the Merry Men or the Knights of the Round Table. <br /> <br /> You have the idea. <br /> <br /> You can not help noticing how many ideas of "Flash Gordon" would later reappear in STAR WARS. The cloud of the city; The ice world; The moon of the forest; The scrolling text (From the second serial); There are others, but you get the gist. The entire sci-fi genre owes a great debt to this timeless classic. <br /> <br /> Buster Crabb is the perfect action hero, and I personally think he is better at this kind of role than any of the current processes of action. stars. He also played Buck Rogers and Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton is the embodiment of diabolical evil as Ming. Of course, he sounds a little melodramatic today, but that's what the public expected of their bad guys in the 1930s. Jean Rogers is our hero's love interest, Dale Arden, and I had one I fell for it when I first saw it as a boy. I can readily understand why Flash has always rushed to its aid. She is the good girl par excellence, to counter the seductive manipulations of Aura, the quintessential bad girl. The supporting cast seemed perfectly chosen to emulate their comic book counterparts, and despite the now silly looking FXs, there was a very exciting action in this groundbreaking series. <br /> <br /> A fun joke and the beginning of the genre of science fiction in the movies.
