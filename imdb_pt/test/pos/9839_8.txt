Frankie Darro was a wonderful young actor who excelled in playing against the unconvincing toughs with gigantic tokens on his shoulders. He appeared in some of the major films of the early 1930s - "The Public Enemy" (1931), a crime drama and "Wild Boys of the Road" (1933), a film about the time of depression about children walking on rails . . He was essentially a younger version of James Cagney. Despite his short stature, his willingness to do his own acrobatics kept him employed by a number of programmers, when the larger studios were no longer useful to him. "Crime School" was supposed to be a remake of "The Mayor of Hell," but it was much more humorous and relied on The Dead End Kids and Humphrey Bogart as a very laid back Deputy Commissioner. "The Mayor of Hell" is actually a combination of "Hell's House" / "Crime School" / "Boy's Town". Even though Cagney did not appear until the 25th minute, his impact (as always) was immediate. He plays a hot-headed gangster on the payroll of a mafia-led political group. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Smith (Frankie Darro) and his gang (including "Farina" from "Our Gang") drive washing the racket out of the car, but biting off more than they can chew when stealing a general store and pushing the owner through a glass window. They appear before the juvenile court and are ordered to go to the state reform school. It is painted in brilliant terms - a model school where boys have a chance to learn a trade. In reality, it is a hellish place run by a sadistic director, Mr. Thompson (exceptionally played by Dudley Digges). The only compassionate person is Dorothy Griffith, the resident nurse (played by Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> "Patsy" Gargan (James Cagney) received the post of new deputy commissioner as a favor. . Upon arriving at the school, he witnessed a failed escape attempt and, after talking to Dorothy, realized that the school needed radical reforms. He is soon running the school and brings a system of "self-government" - unlike the "Boy's Town" lines. Even though Cagney does not have much to do, the image is brought to its climax by Darro's energy. After "Patsy" is temporarily out of the picture (he accidentally kills a mafioso and has to leave the state), Thompson returns and his brutal treatment, resulting in the death of a boy ("Skinny"), turns the rest of the boys into a angry crowd. They burn a barn and Thompson falls to his death - "Patsy" returning on time to calm the crowd with some serious talk. Of course, all the boys seemed to have a hard talk for their crimes, but I disagree with one of the reviewers - Thompson was more than just a meanie. His sadistic treatment resulted in the death of a boy. There is a scene in the beginning when the boys are served with some inedible meat - Thompson orders ham and eggs and continues piling the butter on the bread while talking to Dorothy. Allan Jenkins plays "Uncle" Mike and Sheila Terry, despite being considered a "blonde" and having one of the most memorable phrases when she says "I thought there would be boys here where they They are? "!!! <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
