So well done, no crap CGI. Has anyone ever been to the Darwin Jumping Crocs tour of Adelaide River before? Agua Negra was realistic; Rogue was a bit annoying. <br /> <br /> I thought the blonde girl was excellent - I have not really seen her before. And the other girl is a cat, she's always excellent. V. suspense - I would compare this to Jaws over any other man-eating movie. <br /> <br /> I got the Aussie thing down, without using OTT with struths and crikeys, too. <br /> <br /> I loved it!
