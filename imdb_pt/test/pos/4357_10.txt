With documentaries, the question of realism always comes up. How much of the film is real and how much is it manipulated by the filmmaker? IN A LITTLE DIETER NEED TO FLY, Herzog is too absorbed in telling the story of a man telling his own story to address the issue of realism versus formalism. From the beginning, Herzog's role as storyteller is obvious. Fortunately, he is a master storyteller. LITTLE DIETER is the most interesting and engaging documentary I have ever seen. The story of Dieter is captivating, and Herzog's depiction efforts, putting Dieter at the pace of reliving his story on the spot while filming, are very effective. The story that Dieter tells is real, but Herzog is always present, drawing absurd comments from realism. This film is a must see for any documentary student and / or Werner Herzog.
