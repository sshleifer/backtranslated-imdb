I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it as one of the best ever. I just got back to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines on a business trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed and then asked the butlers to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The performance of the entire team is top notch and especially of Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but of all the cast, in fact, the acting is superb. I love the whole cast, they're so funny. There is a difficult advantage in the King of Queens that I love and is rarely seen in today's TV comedy. Both Leah and Kevin have so much fun that every situation is believable and fun. I just bought Season 2 while I was at Az this week and plan to buy the full set the next time I'm in the US. My son who is 20 years old also loves this show and his brilliance is that he has the magic to reach different generations. I would like to thank everyone involved with this incredible show - it is so much appreciated to see this kind of TV show in what is in my opinion a bad TV show era in general these days, with the exception of Seinfeld reruns and such as ... Thanks for a great show ..
