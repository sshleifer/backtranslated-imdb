Even if Voskhozhdeniye was his favorite film, it would only be possible to watch it at most every ten years. It is very emotionally strenuous. Widely regarded as Shepitko's best film, THE ASCENT is the story of partisans operating in the Belarusian forest in the dead of winter in the Soviet occupied by the Germans. <br /> <br /> While the public was attacking the physicality of the war experience, particularly the deprivations of the cold and the snow, the real struggle for survival against nature and the fascists, there is always a subtle subtext, little inferred from moral judgment and the question of whether a man may be moral or immoral in one context, but otherwise in another. <br /> <br /> A party group that hides in the forest is attacked by a German patrol and loses its food supplies. Two men, Rybak, who knows the area, and Sotnikov, a Jewish teacher, have the task of going to a small village in search of food. They find the village burned to the ground with nothing edible and nothing more than carbonized woods and foundations in which in a cubicle there is a hidden child's mirror. The overwhelming feeling is that whoever brings the brutality of war to a land and a people becomes truly cursed. I thought the war the Americans and the British brought to Iraq and how to bring the horrors of war to people is the act of a degenerate nation. <br /> <br /> The two move to a nearby larger village, where they get, under duress, a lamb from the boss of the coworker. The Germans arrive and the two supporters escape under fire. Sotnikov is struck on his foot and holds the German while Rybak runs off with the lamb. Sotnikov becomes so desperate that prepared not to be taken alive, he removes his boot in order to put a bullet in the head. Only then Rybak returns and drags Sotnikov out of the line of fire. <br /> <br /> Rybak drags Sotnikov through the forest, meter by meter, all done in one long shot. Every meter is an agony, and yet it still pulls him through the deep snow, through depressions, through depressions, to stumps of black bushes that crack when they fit under the weight of men. There are several similarities to Tarkowsky's film vocabulary here - the long time documenting a process, the effect of using repetition, and the resulting emotional stress that increases the duration of the shot. In the background, unnoticed because of the action, there is a question - Rybak committed an immoral act returning to Sotnikov? Whether under the moral standards of Marxism-Leninism or merely the common imperative of group survival, was it not their duty to return food to their hungry band and leave Sotnikov to cover their escape? Sacrificing a man to make the group survive? Which leads to the question - Can a man who is immoral under a philosophical system be expected to be moral under a different moral system? Supporters come as if it were another war curse for a farmhouse that contained a woman with three small children. She is embittered by the scourge of war and barely able to cope with her three children. They hardly rest when more Germans appear. They make their way out and are directed to the attic to hide. <br /> <br /> Sotnikov's cough gives them away. When a German appears to take a look and no one responds, he threatens to shoot the attic and Rybak's nerves break and they are captured. Now who has the moral responsibility here? Sotnikov for coughing or Rybek for cracking? The two partisans and the mother are tied up and taken to a neighboring town, menacingly under a wrought iron arch at the entrance. They think the boss and a little girl are already in custody. They are interrogated by a Belarussian turncoat interpreted by Anatoly Solonitsyn, Tarkowsky's favorite. Sotnikov keeps his head during interrogation and torture and only asks what the interrogator's prewar occupation was? He did not respond, but from his ease of standing behind a desk, the likely response was 'teacher'. <br /> <br /> Rybak on the other hand begs for his life and even offers to join the police. The defect of character previously unnoticed, making a "wrong" moral decision, the ambiguity (sentimentality) of which he disguised it as judgment, now becomes obvious, disturbing and very ugly. <br /> <br /> The five sit in a dark cell. . They are all scheduled to die the next day. From here, the elements of a Christian parable become stronger. Rembrandt Genuine enlightenment and compositions are used as other poses of the Old Master of Christ are depicted. He decides he can save everyone if he takes the blame for everyone. He must be kept alive until the morning so he can save them all. He apologizes to the mother and the boss, knowing what is happening, does not feel as desperate to die as before. <br /> <br /> The morning comes. The Germans do not care if Sotnikov assumes all the sins of his companions or not. They will all be hanged. They march up a steep inclined street which is a virtual Via Dolorosa. A bank is taken to the execution site which is the gateway to the city. Five strings are hanging. The bank only has three, so Sotnikov is in a tree trunk that Rybak kicks under him. They're all hanging. As Rybak walks down the road with the Germans, someone in the crowd calls him Judas, an unnecessary allusion, Shepitko's only misstep. Rybak often imagines being shot in the back trying to escape, dying an honorable death and unsuccessfully tries to hang himself in the shithouse, but leaves with the Germans as the beaten dog that he is. However, if Rybak was morally right in returning and saving Sotnikov's life, is he wrong in trying to save his own life?
