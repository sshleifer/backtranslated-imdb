So it's important to talk about the DVD release rather than just the movie. Tales from the Crapper is a movie that only one studio in the world could offer. The one who brought us innovative and original REAL independent films for more than 30 years now: Troma. This is really a very special movie because it is certainly not my favorite of Troma productions but released on a disc which, because of what I just said, is one of my most valuable and favorite DVDs. Not only counting the numerous Troma records I own, but counting my entire collection of movies. The film itself is the result of an ill-fated plan to produce a television series being directed by a director with a substantial amount of money (especially to Troma) to do something wonderful and deliver a bunch of unfinished and incomprehensible material before giving up (or being fired, I'm not sure which one at this point). In order to avoid having to push a huge investment into the bathroom, Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz decided to put together a team of directors and actors and use the material as the backbone of a movie. A movie that really consists of two, in the beautiful and old fashioned Tales From The Crypt, presented by Crapkeeper, played by Mr. Kaufman himself. But like I said, it's not exactly my favorite of all your movies. This is largely due to a strange sense of discipline in the various scenarios, forgetting the harsh Troma rule of "no booze on set" that was discovered by a furious Lloyd and other less respectable officials than Troma had at the time of filming. of the scenes added. All of this made it virtually impossible for Mr. Kaufman to make a worthwhile product in the editing room. But Lloyd Kaufman is a genius and, with the complicated scenes added to an already misshapen product, he did not create much less a masterpiece. The film itself is as good as the circumstances allow the brightest filmmaker to divide and is certainly very entertaining, totally confused, loaded with the elements that have made the Troma excellent and certainly unique and unique. As a film in itself, however, not as brilliant as many other productions of Troma. The genius of Independent Film, however, has made the DVD of this film much more than a movie release with a few extras. The film is, at the moment of the push, just part of the whole DVD which, in its entirety, is a document of the difficult situation that serious filmmakers encounter in order to survive in a world that is monopolized by the few Big ones that really do not allow any other player in your market. A document of the problems one has when one trusts that people are on the level, only to find that freedom is sometimes difficult to live by and realize that access to a Film Budget when the Chief is not around can corrupt even those who should really know better. The brilliance of this DVD is that the film is not perfect, and that Lloyd KNOWS, and does not want to make anyone think he believes he is. The complete commentary is a spectacle in itself (as is often the case with Kaufan's audio commentary), blending humor, mocking those who deserve it, and highly interesting information to anyone interested in making independent films in such a way that they watch the movie again with this comment shortly after viewing it on its own merits is so interesting that it is difficult to stop. The feature documentary THE THICK BROWN LINE takes us backstage at the various places where Lloyd visits the sets only to sometimes take over and make the most of what he finds there. We see him a bit disillusioned at times, unlike his appearances in other Making Of Documents such as Fart of Darkness and Apocalypse Soon, both to be found on the Must-Own DAMN MOVIE box set. <br /> <br /> The scenes added with James Gunn (who began his career at Troma just to find success as a writer and now director in Hollywood) and Trey Parker (again someone to start with a work released by Troma), to then being a national hero with his South Park series) are fun and probably (as is a lot more in this release) a reason to get this record alone for anyone remotely interested in the work of these two characters. Loaded with a lot more than I could mention here (including a second audio comment) this is one of the best releases of Troma-DVD.
