A vehement, cynical, sarcastic, and intense movie, mocking and imitating the style of Pulp Fiction and stylized gangster movies, Thursday is a fun, bewildering and hilarious ride. An incredibly eclectic mix of exaggerated characters and bizarrely entertaining situations, this gunslinger's day-to-day life trying to move on proves to be a valuable addition to the series of films that try to imitate Tarantino's genius. Black Humor Masterpiece Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br /> Nick (Aaron Eckhardt) to Casey's (Thomas Jane) home to reclaim the old days. Casey was a former drug smuggler who has since retired, became an architect, married a successful businesswoman (Paula Marshall) and is now considering adopting a child. Nick, who still has ties to the gangsters underworld, leaves a suitcase full of drugs at Casey's house while he borrows his car to do some errands? a.k.a unfinished business. Angry and annoyed with the introduction of drugs into his house, Casey sinks them into the kitchen sink. That's when, in turn, Nick's accomplices, the Rastafarian drug messengers and the corrupt cops come to the forefront of the unsuspecting Casey, who is about to have an unbelievable Thursday. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a hilarious sequence at a gas station in which Nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee. After pondering the size of the cup, a fiasco begins with the box when it asks for a free snack cake and uses a $ 50 bill to pay. Resulting in comically bright bloodshed, the situation goes from bad to worse when a police officer intervenes and is caught in the most unusual circumstances. This opening segment sets the perfect mood for the rest of the film, which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters who seem self-conscious about their very existence in this senseless gangster movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into segments based on various events and times during the course of a day. This effect is very similar to Pulp Fiction, which is a similar chapter, although Thursday does not mess with the chronological order except for the occasional flashback. Also like Tarantino, the song magnificently presents each scene and each character. Strangely good-natured creatures, like the Jamaican pizza deliveryman who sings on the phone and shares his hashish, and Dallas' narcissist Paulina Porizkova, who tries to rape Casey, add humor to every event, no matter how gruesome and unnerving coincidences are. When Mickey Rourke's cowardly, calm cop, Kasarov, is introduced, careful organization and intricate setup is fully assembled, and Casey's complicated situation becomes even more daring and commendable. <br /> <br /> Definitely an aspiring Pulp Fiction, with enough violence, witty dialogues and extremely scary antagonists, Thursday does some right things, but other tribute attempts may be going far enough to suggest stealing. A flashback sequence that shows Casey shooting at bad guys and displaying a hairstyle that matches exactly that of John Travolta in Pulp Fiction is easily one step further. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie, www.MoviePulse.net
