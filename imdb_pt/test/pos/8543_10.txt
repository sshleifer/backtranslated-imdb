I saw this movie for the first time in Papua New Guinea in 1967 and I remembered it ever since, although I have never seen it since the first time. <br /> <br /> How easily the lives of good people can be destroyed by the pure evil that existed then and still does is a memory that will haunt me forever. <br /> <br /> The film is funny and immensely sad at the same time and the role played by Anthony Quinn is superb. <br /> <br /> This film should be in all university studies about the inhumanity of man to man.
