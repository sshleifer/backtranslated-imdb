It's my favorite movie because there's so much going on that you do not see at the beginning and so many things that make you wonder, "Did Kieslowski mean it or are you in my head?" For example - does the judge claim to be God or some supreme being? Irene Jacob as in Veronique's The Double Life is excellent, there may be some superficially prettier actresses, but none who can convey The beauty of the spirit with physical beauty the way it does. <br /> <br /> Tritingnant is also magnificent without really saying much and the things he says are excellent, like his response to Valentine. . . "Be".
