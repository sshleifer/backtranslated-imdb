In the early 19th century, a young woman with a hare suffers from her family's ambition and the superstitions of the local community, but she knows a man who can see her differently, and can change Pru's life forever. <br /> <br /> Precious Bane is an adaptation of the British Broadcasting Corporation's highly acclaimed novel Mary Webb. It is a beautifully shot piece that is represented to an incredibly high standard, the story (Maggie Wadey's script) is excellent, and the detail of the period and the use of the dialect is unparalleled. It is a pity that this film has not yet been released in DVD, one would think that with the rise to Clive Owen's (Gideon) stardom, the BBC would do that, but unfortunately not, so the only way to catch it is on rare occasions that MTC shows. Pru Sarn is simply brilliant, courage and genuine emotion go hand in hand as McTeer gives it all. Pru not only has to deal with his facial disfigurement but also the constant mockery and hurt of the ignorant villagers. people believed that if a hare ran in front of a pregnant woman, she spelled misfortune, a time of Bull Baiting, a time of superstitions and conversations about witches. and even his own family overthrows his dreams without realizing it, but this road can be terribly bumpy, but hope is eternal, and Pru has hope in abundance. <Br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
