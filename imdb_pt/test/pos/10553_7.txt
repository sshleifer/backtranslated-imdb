I have a problem with film snobs who consider the Americans half-greedy semi-skilled, unable to appreciate the subtlety of the more sophisticated Europeans, les Francais, les Italiens ... of any person from le Continong to whom English is a foreign language. If the mood in "My Father the Hero" is different from that in "Mon Pere ce heros", it is because the French sense of humor is different from that of the American. Not better, not "smarter," just different. If you think it's rude to Hollywood to "borrow" from French cinema, just consider how much French cinema borrowed from Hollywood in the first place. Where did Belmondo and Delon go without Bogart? Truffaut without Hitchcock? Jerry Lewis - not known for his subtle and cerebral style is idolized in France.Figure ........ Monsieur Depardieu is exceptionally good as the unhappy divorced father of a precocious 14-year daughter together in the Bahamas. Unknown to him, she introduces him to the other people in the hotel as her lover, so as to become more interesting to a boy she's watching. It is not surprising that complications arise. There is "hommage" to "Green Card" and "Cyrano de Bergerac" playfully inserted and M.Depardieu goes along with everything very good - of course. He makes a good impression of Maurice Chevaler with "Thank Heaven for Little Girls," who is actually funny and somewhat moving as his audience, all of whom believe him to be the lover of a 14-year-old girl, get up and leave two - for - two as he flees, happily unaware of what 's going on. When he turns at the end of the song to acknowledge the applause expected, the expression on his face is invaluable. Without it, the film would be very medium. With its huge figure dominating the screen, it's a lot of fun.No pecs, no six pack - just a real human being - kind of being.Formidable!
