"Crossfire" looks like an underdeveloped masterpiece - it's well represented and beautifully filmed, but little written and too short. As it is, it's just a decent police procedure with evidence of film noir (at its heyday in 1947) and social commentary (also fashionable at the time) thrown in for good measure. It is remembered today as one of the first two Hollywood films to deal with anti-Semitism, and as being much better than the Gentleman's Agreement, which has the same theme. But its real issue is the difficulty that WWII soldiers, as trained killers, were having in making the transition to civilian life. (For a gentler approach on this subject, try "The Best Years of Our Lives.") A man is beaten to death in the first few frames of the film. We do not see his attacker. The film is about investigating this murder, which is actually quite simple, but it takes some unnecessary detours, like when the main suspect, a depressed soldier, ends up in the apartment of Gloria Grahame, a strange pimp dancehall prostitute played by Paul Kelly. There is also a civic talk in the middle of the movie that delays the process, and the end is neat enough for a police program. But on the other hand it's a pretty decent mystery. Still, what a great noir it could have been. Director Edward Dmytryk leaves some hints of the subject of the original novel - homosexuality, not anti-Semitism - as when the ruthless sadist Monty stirs up the image of his friend Mitch talking to a strange man in a bar. And the cast is excellent. Robert Ryan creates a very believable cretin and even becomes a bit sympathetic in his final scenes, not unlike Peter Lorre as the killer of children in "M". He deserved an Oscar, but lost to Edmund Gwenn that year (you can not beat Santa). Robert Mitchum is a soldier friend of the accused killer. Was Mitchum a great actor or a big star? Someone may discover this, but their sleepy eyes and half confused smile work very well here, since they imply that your character knows something that everyone does not know. (And he does.) And Robert Young, as the designated detective for the murder, is surprisingly brave, dismissing his usual overwhelming affability, even when he has to deliver the civil rights sermon in the middle of the picture. There is no doubt that Bogart or Tracy would have been brilliant in the role, but none of them were in the RKO in 1947, so you will only have to deal with Dr. Welby. Still, Young is good enough to make you wish someone put you in a detective drama instead of "Father Knows Best," which he hated and that led to alcoholism and suicide attempts. The man deserved better than Smarm and Sanka.
