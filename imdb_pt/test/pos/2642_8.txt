There are a lot of people who put on 80 type movies but these people may not have come of age during this time. I was just starting college when this movie was released, so I really enjoyed it at the time and my friends and I still, even today, occasionally joked about certain lines in the movie. As much as I've enjoyed Sean Penn's character Jeff Spicoli in "Fast Times," I really like Chris Penn's character, because he's the main character with more than one speech speaking as opposed to just a series of liners like Spicoli. Chris Penn should probably blow this movie into his VCR and use it for motivation to lose some weight. Yes, the subplot with the character Randy Quaid, veterinarian from Vietnam, seems a bit out of place, but he does a compelling job on paper. If there is anyone out there who has not seen this movie, but I liked other similar movies, like "Fast Times", etc. I strongly recommend.
