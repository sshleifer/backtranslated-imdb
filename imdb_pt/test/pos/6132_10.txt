I watched this movie "miniseries" on television in 1989 and it was an incredible movie. I'd love to find a copy of it just to watch it over and over again. It's been 15 years since I've watched it and it's still in my head. From the beginning, you attract you. The characters and the plot keep holding you. The ending was excellent. The feeling and anger that the son demonstrated when discovering the truth about his father are unforgettable. The suspense over how this will happen and how it will confront your father is really intense. <br /> <br /> If you can get a copy of this movie, you'll love watching it. <br /> <br /> Then send me an email and let me know where I can get a copy.
