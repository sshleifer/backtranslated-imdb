Kannathil Muthamittal was simply one of the most touching and heartfelt films I've seen in a long time. the story of an adopted girl who on her 9th birthday learns the truth about her fatherhood. She tries to find out more about her real mother and discovers that her mother is now a terrorist. <br /> <br /> The greatness of the film lies in its simplicity. Mani Ratnam usually has a tendency to create surreal and pompous characters unreal in this film, each person seems real and their interactions are touching and sincere. this is the reason why this is one of his best films. <br /> <br /> The film is emotionally draining and pulls the heart of the viewer, keerthana as the 9 year old amudha and simran as his adoptive mother. simply brilliant. their relationship is the cornerstone of this film. there are some notable failures here, particularly the scene in which Amudha discovers that she is an adopted child is shocking and seems totally unreal. it's hard to believe that sensitive parents would break the news the way they did. Another flaw is, surprisingly, the brilliant songs. they again seem forced and stand out, not harmonizing with the rest of the script. <br /> <br /> That said, this is still one of the most poignant and beautiful films in India in a long time. . this beauty is not only in the script or in the characters, but also in technical brilliance, ravi chandran's camera work is pure poetry. all the characters play with credibility and realistic humor, especially in flashback scenes, are fun. <br /> <br /> A sincere 9 !!
