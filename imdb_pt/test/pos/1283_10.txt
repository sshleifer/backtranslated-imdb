Christopher Nolan had set his sights set on moving in a very narrow direction, and in that direction he drew something that reminded me of Ullmer's sort of big 'poverty-line' movies in the 1940s. Only this time he touches of honor - things like black and white photography (a die due to shoe string budget but also essential for the dark crevices that these characters inhabit) and cast of actors (the leader John Doe, the male counterpart and the beautiful femme fatale) - keeping it in the realm of the 90s where for several thousand dollars and specific choices in places and music and such a thing could be possible. This, and also in the movie-noir mood Nolan also brings together a cunning web of a plot, perhaps even more than Memento. Where the latter was a work of a psychology unfolding through a plot enriched by looking at the past inch by inch, here the nonlinear structure serves the purpose of showing how far someone like Bill can go through a dark path like Cobb. , just in an environment where keeping toes is not for someone who is not really fuzzy and for the deeper mind games that Cobb is. <br /> <br /> Of course, any act of following someone becomes the main thrust of the game. story, and going there I was not even sure where that would take, if it could be some kind of stream of consciousness, ala Slacker, where Nolan would take his character from one British urban person to another. But the establishment of Bill's ties to Cobb is done in a swift and excellent way, as we see when Cobb approaches Bill in the cafe to ask what he is doing following him and tells almost everything we need to know about this and that . the first robbery he brings along. What appears to soon be a good trail on the horizon is actually a whole grand arrangement of Cobb and his lady (just called "The Blonde", perhaps an obvious homage to the noir, but why the tents). But this is revealed in a way that really made me guess, since the manipulation of the narrative worked even more to raise questions not so much of why, but of how. The density is brought out even more because of the actors' understanding of their essential points as characters, with Alex Haw being brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely mask his "deep" ideas about what it is to actually take pleasure in a robbery, and Theobald with that behavior of someone who can never be as clever as he is at what he actually does, but he is smarter in that naive way that has no chance in the damp environment like this; Russell almost makes it very easy, even with a face that would send Ana Savage shaking her head. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Nolan is also in the ball with his style of camera operator, saving nothing on it. add to the environment and suspense, with fade-in / fade-outs not too fast to leave a lasting impression, but enough to add to the logic of the 'this-could-lead-anywhere' script. He follows in the form of a hand as if he knows where his limitations lie, and still it's fantastic to keep the essentials: close when needed (one I loved is Russell's face in a small mirror), and a reasonably simple techno. track that never decreases. Sometimes, as mentioned, the line between seeing something in the 'present' and seeing something that is as eternal as a solid history of low-level criminals with mental games and moral ambiguity is never quite clear, which to me is practically irresistible in his dark path. Put simply, this is one of the great calling cards I have seen in a filmmaker in recent years, and I hope it's something that future fans of Nolan's other work can hope to find out. Or even for those who think that the noir was for the fast editing dogs and big weapons of the mainstream (even in independent films) are a brilliant 71 minutes.
