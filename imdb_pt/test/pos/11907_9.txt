I think it was a really good movie. This shows how one grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful man, but unfortunately because of his ambition and the people around him, this led to his destruction. This shows that you can not trust anyone, especially in a world that deals with a lot of money and envy. The character I liked the most was Sebeva. She was another ambitious, powerful, relentless woman in the world of a man who loved and respected Kilo. She also knew that business was dangerous and business. Everything she did was risky, but she got the job. She helped Kilo get rich with his connections. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and have it in my collection and waiting for The Godfather 2.
