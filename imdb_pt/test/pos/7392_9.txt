I think this movie is different from most of the movies I've seen. It was exciting in a way, and no matter what others say, I say, I was surprised by the final solution. Certainly did not see this coming !! Although it's sad, it's worth watching .. I can not think of any movie that would be like this! The actors knew what they were doing. If you say that this movie sucks, it probably says what most people would say. But if anyone says that this movie is common, I absolutely do not agree. And Norman Reedus should be more noticed. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm crazy, but I really enjoyed it. It was kind of messy, but who cares? I'm tired of boring ordinary movies.
