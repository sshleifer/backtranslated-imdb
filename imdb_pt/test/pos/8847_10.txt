For me, a ten-star movie is one that never dies in my memory, and can still be seen repeatedly with the same pleasure the first time. This could be a technically flawed film; pleasure has nothing to do with spitting and polishing (my personal top ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). "The Thing" by John Carpenter is one of the few films that fit this criteria. I've been a science fiction fan since I was a child in the 1960s, and I read John W Campbell's short. story in which the film is based ("Who Goes There") before I see the original, black and white movie Howard Hawks (as with many people, that viewing was illicit on TV when I should have been in bed This movie, like so many others you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed almost perfect: the suspense, the unexplained nature of the alien, the photograph, everything seemed to work, I watched many times in the following years (and still do, when is seen on TV.) Because of this, I avoided Carpenter's version for years - seeing the remakes of the favorite movie is, I always thought, a mistake. When I finally watched it on 1988/9, again on TV because there was nothing else , I realized that I needed to change "always an error" to "usually a mistake!" Carpenter produced something different from the original film, closer to the original story and truly wonderful. (sorry, there are no spoilers here!), I was hooked. Only the soundtrack lives with me - all I have to hear is a resemblance to the bass beat and I'm in the final scene again ... Seeing "The Thing", I had Carpenter as another monkey gore, based only on comments and criticism in the mainstream press. Since I've seen "The Thing", I think I've seen most of his films - I did not get out of my way to do it, but if someone shows up, just seeing his name as a director is enough to make my mind watch this . He is considerate and knows how to build a movie so that it reaches a point where something will stay in the memory. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen "The Thing", and like science fiction, do yourself a favor - sit in a dark room, warm up and get ready to improve your memory !
