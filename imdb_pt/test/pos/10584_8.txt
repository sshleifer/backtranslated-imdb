I bought this movie just to see Bam because I was really loving it, but after seeing this I did not really like it. I mean, his acting was good and all I think about, but whenever I showed the totally unnecessary skateboarding I was saying to myself, "All right, we know you're a professional skateboarder, now can we get back to Ryan Dunn? " Dunn, Rake and Brandon actually made the film from my perspective. <br /> <br /> I noticed that Jenn Rivell, (obviously), and Missy Rothstein were both in Haggard, but whom Bam was dating at the time? Anyway, I really liked Haggard and I think it's really like no other movie I've ever seen. It is a kind of its own category.
