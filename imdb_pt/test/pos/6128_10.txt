My rating of 10/10, of course, applies only if you are willing to fully and completely receive *. Because you know that only John Waters can do it. In "Pink Flamingos" (his directorial debut), he portrays two families locked in combat to see who may be the most filthy person alive. What Divine does notoriously do at the end practically answers the question. But in addition, the film is basically an excuse to shock people beyond what anyone imagines. You'd better have a very strong stomach to watch this movie. Even some of the lines are pretty mind-boggling. <br /> <br /> * Otherwise, avoid this movie as you would with the ebola virus!
