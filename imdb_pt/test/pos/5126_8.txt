In "Hoot", a young boy arrives in Florida from Montana. He first faces the usual problems of mingling and dealing with the local bully. Soon, however, he becomes aware of a bigger problem: a chain of franchise restaurants is trying to build a place in town, exactly where some bourgeois owls live. This movie looks like a family movie, but it's a lot more radical than it sounds, as it shows sympathetically how Roy and some friends do not shy away from breaking the law (including the vandalism of private property and kidnapping the film's manager ). chain of restaurants) in the name of environmentalism (to save owls, not less). Now, you can agree or disagree with these actions, but at least the film has the courage not to depart from their convictions. A good solid movie, though.
