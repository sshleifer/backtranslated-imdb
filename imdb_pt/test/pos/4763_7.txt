I think the cinematic lineage can work like that. Pay attention, please, because I had to look for this. In 1967, Peter Yates, a former car driver, directs the movie "Robbery," the most thrilling part of a car chase through the streets of London, where there are throngs of kids playing and all. It is a success. <br /> <br /> A year later, Yates directs "Bullet," starring Steve McCool, I mean McQueen, featuring yet another spectacular car chase up and down the San Francisco Hills with engine sounds incredibly authentic. which seem to include dual clutch, full-duty chambers, no dampers, twelve-cylinder engines under four-meter overloaded, supercharged, and all five thousand horsepower engines running at full speed. Many shots of McQueen's face peddler frown as he tries to pull another car off the highway, though a passenger in the other vehicle has a shotgun. The chase is staged by Philip D'Antoni. Bill Hopkins drives the criminal vehicle. <br /> <br /> A year or two later, feeling a good thing, Bill Friedkin directs "The French Connection", featuring a chase between a police car (Gene Hackman) train in New York. Many shots from Hackman's cursed face as he handles the battered car through the streets. The chase is staged by Philip D'Antoni. Following are the Academy Awards. Feeling good, another year or two brings us "The Seven Ups," with a chase between a car driven by Roy Scheider with many shots from Scheider's cursed face. he tries to hit the other car, which is directed by Bill Hopkins, off the road, although the criminal car will surely carry a passenger with a shotgun. No hill in New York City just knocks, but they're still sharp enough to lift the cars a few feet away. The chased car squeaks around a corner and runs down a street in which a dozen children are playing. Photos of the boys screaming as they scatter the sidewalk and allow the car to zoom in. But once is not enough. The kids immediately run back down the street and must repeat the retreat to the police car that leads Scheider. <br /> <br /> Once, I witnessed a high-speed chase on the streets of Philadelphia. Both the criminal and the police crossed the streets at about 25 miles per hour, reaching stopping points at every stop signal and red light - a very annoying thing compared to this movie. <br /> <br /> Talking about this movie, it's very good. "Robbery" and "Bullet" were cool. Everyone dressed perfectly. But New York movies are filthy. There is rubbish everywhere and the subway cars are covered in graffiti. Shoot outs and beat ups take place on vacant lots surrounded by crumbling brick buildings, or on dumps for industrial-sized freezers. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good too. Roy Scheider looks elegant. The other actors have faces made for the camera, especially Richard Welsh. And the story is engaging, if not totally unfamiliar. What is best about the film is how it captures the city of New York in its almost total indifference to human depravity and nobility. At a funeral, the limousine drivers stand up, their collars up, ends coming out of their mouths, kicking their cold feet together, completely bored with the events of the ritual. The film wants us to believe that the Seven Levants are an elite group of untouchable cops who do nothing to get the job done, and here it's a little exhausted. They always seem to be threatening to do something unethical and illegal - take the hell out of a suspect or physically damage a hospitalized and helpless neighborhood - but they always manage to avoid doing so. (If they really did, their characters would become real and ambiguous and we'd rather have our heroes and villains of a more biblical nature.) Very nice, even if you've seen it before, and you may well have one or other of your previous incarnations.
