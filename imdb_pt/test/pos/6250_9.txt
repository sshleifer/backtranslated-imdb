I love this movie! When I saw this movie on TV when I was a kid, it scared me a lot. Probably because the mannequins give me shivers, too. Jocelyn Jones (Molly) is an excellent actress. She uses her facial expressions, especially her eyes, to play terrified. Connors is great as Mr.Slausen. I was happy to see him play such a different roll. The other actors in this movie are great too! Tanya Roberts (Becky) and Robin Sherwood (Eileen) are great actresses and I hope to see them in future films, especially Jocelyn Jones! <br /> <br /> So if you like horror movies but are tired of seeing the same thing, take a look at that movie!
