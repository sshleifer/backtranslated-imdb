Sometimes a movie is so bad that it's good. This movie was made in Germany and is nicknamed in English, so you have to go through it. The performance was also forced and forced, in addition to what was done by the real rats, that the IMO did an excellent job in playing the role. Snaps for the Rat Wrangler. Anyway, the mayor of the city decided to cut costs and local garbage collectors go on strike, thus leaving large amounts of garbage everywhere. This plot was used before, not to mention happened in real life (often, unfortunately) and the public is not in for any surprise. But it's alright. We know what's going to happen and when, and sometimes, an audience needs a movie where many brain cells are not needed to move on. We have our hero, up to the chiseled face and body, the semi-hero (s) and, of course, our heroine, who is the doctor but still in training, even though she's the one who discovers what's really going on . when so many people end up sick and dying, not just a rat bite. Of course the villain must die (okay, all the villains, ie the rats), and the final scene is one that reminds the audience that a sequence is in progress. This is one of those movies that you simply sit and enjoy what you are and what you are not.
