People with aversion to gore may find some difficult scenes, but The Thing is far from simply a horror classic. The fact that the extraordinary special effects faced by most modern CGI's is only a small part of the reason why this film is ultimately legitimately considered a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in his superbly scripted and acted editing and camera work, one of the best openings, one of the best endings, tension and sustained paranoia everywhere (with countless visions), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and analogies, there simply are not enough superlatives to do justice to this movie. Absolutely essential vision.
