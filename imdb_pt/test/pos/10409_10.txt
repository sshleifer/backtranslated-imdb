Anyone familiar with horror movies knows that most of them are not scary at all. Some people like gorefests with traits of story and character development. I personally like horror movies that focus on interesting atmosphere and concepts (eg A Tale of Two Sisters, Kairo, etc.). Whatever kind of horror movie someone likes, there are only a few that really scare you. Noroi is one of them. <br /> <br /> This is a documentary-style film, which means that the whole movie is a compilation of video clips that are linked by the legend of a demonic entity called Kagutaba. The premise is that a journalist filmed his own images interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with Kagutaba, and then compiled images from other sources linked to his research. The result is a sweeping experience that seems very real and very disturbing, despite the fact that the story itself is false. <br /> <br /> Some have compared Noroi to The Blair Witch Project, but the only similarity is the documentary. style. One obvious difference between the films is that Noroi frightens the viewer by linking events to each other using different sources. For example, the journalist checks the exterior of a house that is searching and sees something strange on the porch. Later in the movie, a clip of another character's home video introduces that same strange occurrence. The memory of the spectator links the two incidents and shivers begin to run down the spine. Another example involves a television program with a psychic child that answers all questions correctly except for one. In fact, her response is so wrong that the viewer can imagine what the filmmakers were thinking. Later, however, this wrong answer turns out to be linked to an extremely disturbing event. This is, in fact, an intelligent film production. <br /> <br /> Another difference between Noroi and Blair Witch is that Noroi offers not one but two very long finals, the second of which is placed one minute after the credits start rolling. and is the biggest scare scene in the history of horror movies. I do not say these things lightly. It totally destroyed me in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> Other aspects of film production are well made. Kagutaba's legend and ritual backdrop are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job. The only exaggerated performance comes from a guy who should be crazy anyway, which is expected. Cinematography is intentionally violent because all of the footage supposedly represents videos recorded on camcorders. Japanese movies are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were incredible. In some cases, they create a sense of another world (eg, static interference or the first ending), but in other cases they are alarmingly realistic (eg, the second ending). <br /> <br /> When all is said and done, Noroi descends like the scariest movie I've ever seen. I would say there is not a movie that provides such pure terror from start to finish as Noroi does. See now.
