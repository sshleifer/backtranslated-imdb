I watched it last night and again this morning - that's how much I enjoyed it. There's something about this movie ... When the movie was almost over, I was about to cry. I would strongly recommend "Last Days" to my friends - it is definitely worth seeing! I agree with those who say that some parts of the film do not look very realistic. For example, the two main characters are totally cute and in perfect physical shape (although round is also a type of shape :)). I rarely meet people as well as singles and have never encountered any in couples. Other parts of the film, including all "coincidences", also do not look very realistic. BUT, after all, it's a MOVIE, not a life story.
