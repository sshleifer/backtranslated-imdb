The direction of Wayne Wang may be the ingredient that made this film far more impressive to me than "Beverly Hills Slums", which covers a remarkably similar terrain. The interaction between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is fascinating. Real chemistry there. This film has managed to bring me into the dysfunctional life of these two women without making me depressed. Susan Sarandon's character pounds all the nerves that a narcissistic father is capable of touching an insecure teenager. She can do this surprisingly without being insolently insane or intentionally sadistic. And Natalie Portman deflects every attack on her character's ego with the resigned grace of an intelligent codependent child untainted by the smug cynicism of Natasha Lyonne's character in "Slums of Beverly Hills." Portman's character is a teenager with dignity under stress, an unusual creature in modern movies. The film reaches a very satisfactory resolution without trying too hard. I highly recommend this movie to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained.
