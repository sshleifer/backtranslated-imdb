A beautifully photographed and rhythmic short film. Evocatively captures the sentiment of this family and much of the country during the period immediately preceding and after Pearl Harbor. I liked the look of the movie - naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great doctorate, David Boyd. <br /> <br /> Despite being a family movie, the story never becomes sentimental or saccharine. We understand and believe in the motivation that drives the boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and I do not question why he proposes to do what he does. I understand that he is moved by a deep desire to be with his brother in this time of crisis. The kid is tough, and Jonathan Furr's performance is superb, as is Ron Perlman's veteran performance.
