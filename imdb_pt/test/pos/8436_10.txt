This movie is definitely the best Fonda movie. The plot is incredible, the acting is incredible, and the direction is incredible. A classic of all time, this should have won the best image, not the Kramer Vs. Kramer. Although not even named. Jack Lemmon and Micheal Douglas are also at their best. One of the best finals of all time. If you have not seen this movie, do not go to rent it. Should have been in the top 100 of afi. He sees not only Fonda, but everything. <br /> <br /> **** out of **** 4 of 4
