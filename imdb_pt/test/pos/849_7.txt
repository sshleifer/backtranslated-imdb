The Earth's Final Conflict began as a new world, a new vision of the creator of the Star Trek, something new and unique, full of great elements. A very good cast with an extremely credible Kevin Kilner as William Boone, a good former police officer begins to work as a sort of ambassador for a mysterious alien race (Talons) after the death of his wife under strange circumstances. But soon the character of Kilner joins a group with the mission to find out what the real intentions of the aliens are, because they seem so cool and care about the human race. Soon this resistance group begins to discover the sinister plans of the Talons using humans in their own problems to survive their own destruction. As I said before, the show started great, everything was almost perfect, including characters like Da'an, the original Da'an was a great mystery because he seems to be a cool creature, but at the same time he has his own evil plans . manipulating some people on earth. Soon came Zo'or which was not bad, but ... marks the beginning of the fall of this show because he became the first great enemy of humans, the embodiment of evil, killing what could be something greater in Da'an. The first seasons end in a good way with the dead of Boone and the second shows a new main character (Liam), a hybrid human being and Kimera (another alien race) with very interesting powers. He replaces Kilner's character in a good way for other stories to make him better, including the conflict with the Jaridians and the atavistic ones. But as I said lines before the wickedness of Zo'or begin to have more importance for the new conflicts were less realistic as the same Talons. Over time the whole great plot of Liam's alien roots, where he almost totally erased it with other things from previous seasons. So when the final season began, the original Earth Final conflict was just an almost-forgotten dream, all the magic was missing, just to leave some vain intentions to keep the show alive, including Kilner and Liam's return for a few episodes. The final episode was just the evidence of how bad the show was with so many bad changes (thinking the writers of some episodes knew nothing about the first stories), it was one of the worst moments I've ever seen on a TV show. It was a shame, because Earth Final Conflict started as something unique, new, the stories of the cast, after so many US shows, something from the mind of the creator of Star Trek was wonderful, but in the end everything has changed for the worse. I hope someday someone will do a remake of this show, of course not using anything from the fourth and fifth season (except the cast, everyone was perfect in their work). I can still dream of better things.
