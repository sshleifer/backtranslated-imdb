In a previous review I mentioned how much I liked this movie - second best time. I do not shy away from this opinion. Strangely, I can not find anyone who likes it. <br /> <br /> My mother was going to see, but several friends said "no chance". My sister and her family saw and half of the theater left halfway. <br /> <br /> My wife's suggestion is that Australians see the characters as ordinary, normal Americans and therefore not funny. But, hey, most Americans think all Australians are like the Crocodile Dundee, so it's good to have the boot on the other foot for a change.
