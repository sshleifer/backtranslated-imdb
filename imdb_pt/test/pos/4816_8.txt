This simple and eloquent film makes a remarkably clear statement about a teenager and his father. Despite being a theatrical version, it has a quality "made for TV". We can attribute this to director John Frankenheimer, who learned his craft in the early days of live television in New York. In fact, he directed the teleplay on which the film is based, "Deal a Blow," on the CBS drama "Climax." "Young Stranger" represents his Hollywood debut. After a four-year hiatus, during which he would do more television, he returned to "The Young Savages" with Burt Lancaster and, a year later, "All Fall Down" with Warren Beatty and Angela Lansbury. The cast is competent with James Daly and Kim Hunter (particularly well) playing the parents of the title character played by James MacArthur (his first film) who played the same role in the television version, which was his first appearance on the small screen. Look for James Gregory and Whit Bissell in supporting roles.
