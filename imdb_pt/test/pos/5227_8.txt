No one said that in "The Big Trail" and I thought it would be natural. However, this was one of the best westerns I have ever seen and I am a big fan of horses and gunsmoke movies. The reach and feel of this image is simply stunning and, as someone mentioned in her commentary, it has the feel of Napoleon's 3-camera triptych (1927). Nowadays the cost of production, and especially the cast of thousands, would be prohibitive, but Raoul Walsh succeeded. <br /> <br /> The cast was excellent, although John Wayne was better off when he had no lines and I just paced. In particular, Tyrone Power, Sr. was a perfect villain - I had never seen him before and this was his only picture spoken. Ian Keith was a snake, but El Brendel is an acquired taste as the comic relief. It can be funny or annoying, but especially the latter - and it shows up at the most inappropriate times. <br /> <br /> It's a little too long and it took a while for the Indians to appear, but this is as close to a documentary on Manifest Destiny and as true to life as you'll ever see and a must for movie fans , regardless of gender preference. When the settlers arrived in California, I was exhausted.
