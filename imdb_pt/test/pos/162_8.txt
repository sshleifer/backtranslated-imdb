Three children are born exactly at the same time, during a lunar eclipse. Just before the 10 year anniversary they embark on a kill. "Bloody Birthday" is a typical slasher from the early '80s. It's a very average thing with lots of nudity. evil children never generate any threat and there is almost no suspense. There is also no blood or scare on "Blood Anniversary," but the film is mildly entertaining. Unfortunately, no real explanation is provided for the sudden homicidal mania of children. quite awful, for example, we have death by gun, baseball bat, jump rope and shovel. So if you are a fan of early 80's slasher movies give this a look.
