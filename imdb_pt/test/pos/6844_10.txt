Of course, there are things here that the Coens and Elmore Leonard did before, but so what? If you want fun, sensual and intelligent - "Judas Kiss" is almost perfect. Prudes offended by cheek pornography do not understand (talk about getting their sex and violence out of the way - it keeps their investors happy. As for the British making a package, I highly doubt it. This film is clearly a labor of love and the budget is probably not half the salary of Mr. Tarantino. Maybe guys do not like them as much as women. I thought it rocked. Go Coco!
