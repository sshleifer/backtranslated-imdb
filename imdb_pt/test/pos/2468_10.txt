I was lucky to have found this movie. I have tapped into Walmart's $ 5.50 DVDs because I watch a lot of movies (and I rarely watch television). I graduated high school in 1968 - so I have family and many friends who served in Vietnam. This movie really illustrates the pain I've seen in my friends dealing with what happened to them over there. I wish more people could watch this movie - I think maybe more people could understand what happened to our Vietnam veterans by watching these excellent actors in the portrait of a family harmed by that war. The story seemed realistic - not cheesy, but it made me feel what they were going through. I think it helped Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez to play father and son - it made their relationship more convincing,
