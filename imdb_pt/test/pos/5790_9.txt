This documentary was my first introduction to the Peak Oil theory. A fascinating concept that has many frightening consequences if it is correct. I had absolutely no idea that the effects of oil depletion would come so soon, they literally took my breath away. This movie will probably open the eyes of how the American way of life depends on the "abundance of cheap oil" - term used throughout the film. Many of the topics are simple common sense, and they do not go into a huge amount of depth about any of them. But you've probably never put together all the pieces like this movie does. Interviews with authors and energy experts are very interesting. I do not think this movie is to scare people. It's just to let people know what to expect in the next few years, and perhaps to encourage you to think twice before you travel 100 miles to work and leave your lights on all day. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie I was no longer able to look at cars and buses whizzing in the same way. Great documentary, everyone should see.
