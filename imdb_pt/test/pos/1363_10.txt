Simply put, there are two parts of this series that made me cry until my eyes fell. First: the part where he was ready to wash the bathroom, but ended up drinking the water from the toilet while imagining that it was the hot director giving him a gold bath !!! (I laughed so hard!) <br /> <br /> Second: The part where he tried to prove himself worthy of a swimming school instructor. He seemed to be a professional diver but, as expected, he could not swim (at least ^^). However, the funny part of it was when it finally came to an end and said "how was it" or something like that. This was so hilarious, I could not stop laughing. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this anime, I highly recommend it. One of the best I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Definitely the funniest!
