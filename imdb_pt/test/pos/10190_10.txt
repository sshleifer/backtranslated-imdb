This program lasted a brief period when I was a kid, I remember watching it while eating fish and chips. Walking on the back of the Tron hype this series was much in the style of streethawk, manimal and the like except more computing. There was a nerdy kid that is the computer somehow created this guy - automan. He was out there solving the crimes and the plot. <br /> <br /> All I really remember was his chic car and the little cursor that used to call the car and help him in general. <br /> <When I mentioned this to anyone, they can remember very little too. Was it real or maybe a dream?
