This film marked the end of the "serious" era of Universal Monsters (Abbott and Costello meet the monsters later in "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankentstein"). It was a rather desperate but fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the Wolf Man, the Frankenstein monster, and Dracula a "last" time. <br /> <br /> I say desperate, because in the previous film, "Frankenstein's House," both Dracula and Wolf Man are killed according to the legends of the vampires and werewolves who should be (Dracula by the light of the sun, and the wolf by a silver bullet). However, somehow they return to the House of Dracula without any explanation. This movie could have been interpreted as a kind of House of Frankenstein prequel if Frankenstein's monster conspiracy did not continue chronologically in House of Dracula's House of Frankenstein, and if the werewolf were not healed. So there would be no holes in the plot. But as this is not the case, the plot of Dracula and the Wolf Man makes no sense. <br /> <br /> However, bypassing these holes, House of Dracula is a classic atmospheric horror movie that is fun to watch. It has many high points. Especially watching the wolf heal. I know I just said this should not have been included, but it was cool to see him heal after all this time. And the scene with the girl playing "Moonlight Senada" on the piano and suddenly playing a scary melody when under Dracula's spell was very sinister. Dr. Edleman's transformation into the character "Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde" was also very well done. <br /> <br /> And it's great to see Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man together, a "last one." time. out of ****
