The Best of Everything is a high-gloss soap opera that follows the careers of four career women, Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, Diane Baker and Martha Hyer at a New York publishing house. What is best for some women is not necessarily best for everyone. Presiding over this young group is the wise old mare Joan Crawford, who has been on the road a few times on screen and in real life. She looks good at home as the lady boss so she should have this time. <br /> <br /> By the time she was doing her best, Joan Crawford was a widow when her fourth husband, Alfred Steele, died. It was a particularly traumatic event for her, she woke up one morning and found him dead in bed next to her. She inherited all her actions at Pepsi Cola, where he was the chairman of the board and during the same period when Best of Everything was being made, she wiped out the queen bee at Pepsi Cola. Life sometimes imitates art. So this authority as she utters dictation orders and coffee into Hope Lange's rings is really true. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the women here, with the exception of Lange, are willing to ride a sleigh. It's hard for Lange too, but she literally does the best of everything. <br /> <br /> What a collection of stinky men are in this movie. The best of them, Stephen Boyd, is a heavy drinker. The other Louis Jourdan, Robert Evans and Brett Halsey, are a collection of rodents as sticky as they have ever come together for a movie. <br /> <br /> I can not forget Brian Aherne, or who is the fanny pinching head of this publishing company. Half of the office would now have the possibility of sexual harassment. <br /> <br /> Some cool pics of New York in the fifties make the movie a real treat. Take this by all means.
