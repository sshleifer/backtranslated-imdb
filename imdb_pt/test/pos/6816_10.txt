For a film by a director for the first time, this is a simply amazing little film, although I have to admit it's a bit difficult to watch and probably offend the sensibilities of many who watch, since the film takes a definite stand in favor . of assisted suicide. However, what I loved about the movie was that I had no idea what the movie was like until the film was more than complete and by then I was already addicted. <br /> <br /> In addition to the excellent film As the subject was presented, I was amazed at the very professional style of the film - with some of the best cinematographies I have ever seen in a short film. In addition, this camera work was combined so well with music and pictures that made the film simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a controversial movie. I even struggle with what I think about this debate, but the film managed to make a statement in such a learned and intelligent way that I really have to respect the team that made this film.
