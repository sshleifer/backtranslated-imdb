I just received this in the mail and was positively surprised. As a big fan of 70's movies, it does not take much to satisfy me when it comes to this kind of movie. Despite the obvious low budget in this movie, the acting is good and you can already see why Pesci would become one of the greatest actors of all time. I'm not sure how authentic this movie is, but it sure is a good contribution to the Mafia genre .....
