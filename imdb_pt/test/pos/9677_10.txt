When I first saw this program, I was 9 and it caught my attention immediately when Stewie was trying to call Lois on the hotel phone. I laughed and kept watching. When the episode ended, I wrote the name of the drawing and watched it regularly. This separates from the Simpsons and other programs, say Cartoon Network because the jokes are more mature, not much, but it's the TV-14 for a reason. The fast movie cuts after each punch line and cute and funny moves and character behavior make it special. The talented Seth Macfarlene is the creator and voice of many characters in the show. A good theme song, and a crazy family that always has something funny, makes this my favorite drawing along Sealab 2021 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Check out this is funny.
