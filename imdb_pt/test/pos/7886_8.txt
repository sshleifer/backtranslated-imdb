I remember so many things about watching this movie back during its original theatrical release - the Woodstock post afterglow of peace and love, coupled with the pre-Watergate tension of fear and paranoia. It's hard to believe it's thirty-seven years later, and I still remember the thoughts that go through my head as I watch the movie with my best friend. How to marvel at Peter Boyle's characterization of the ultimate hick, would certainly typify the rest of his career (Oh, what a mistake!), And how counter-culture has shaken the sensibilities of most of the country. To this day, my friend and I still use Joe Curran's speech from my above summary when we face a dilemma; curious as a simple line like this can stay with you for decades. <br /> <br /> It is curious to read comments about other people's film in this forum, particularly those who claim that the film has a dated quality and how the top of the characters were. Still, if you were around during that time, the picture would show a fairly accurate picture of the polar opposites that existed then, practically side by side, as the events of history reveal. If you really want to be dated, when was the last time you heard the words Macy and Gimbel in the same sentence, or a phrase like Joe's - "Come on, stick with the Pepsi generation." For historical perspective, you have that great Nixon poster in one of the background scenes - "Would you buy a used car from that man?" With little twists like these, director John Avildsen captures many of the subtle, but ever-present hints of what life was like four decades ago. <br /> <br /> Today's screening was only the second time I saw the film, and I have to admit that I do not remember Susan Sarandon in one of the lead roles, but again, this was her first photo . The nudity and free-love scenes were something really new and dashing at the time, shocking indeed when the filmmakers began to experience their ability to push the envelope of property and convention. "Joe" made a big leap in that direction, particularly because it was a "mainstream" portrait. <br /> <br /> Over time, what struck me most about Peter Boyle was how he overcame the stereotype of Joe Curran to appear or star in some of my favorite works. I mean, how do you go from "Joe" to that hilarious rendition of "Puttin 'on the Ritz" in "Young Frankenstein"? And my absolute favorite episode of' X-Files' has Boyle as Clyde Bruckman in a tender portrait. who is a tragic, funny, and serious character who turns the table into Scully and Mulder more than once.And as a professional, Frank Barone has to be one of the funniest characters in television history.Even repeat episodes in syndication are funny like him - whenever the old Barone gets loose with one of his observations. He is an actor that this spectator already misses.
