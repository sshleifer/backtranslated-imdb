I recently started attending this show in syndication and find it a bit hit and miss. Some episodes are silly - Doug is upset about something trivial / juvenile and acts stupid, etc. <br /> <br /> Still others are very fun, and sometimes touching. These include the episodes that face the complexities of the characters. For example, the theme "overweight guy overweight sexy house guy" is found in several sitcoms. (Carrie also has something about her, just the way she is, not just a sexy girl at the factory.) But Carrie has an edge - she may look cool in the eyes, but she has many personality traits not far away. different from her father. <br /> <br /> And she readily admits this - for example, an episode revolves around her lack of desire to be gentle with co-workers. I personally find the ass sexy, but you have to be the right kind of person to be able to live with it. Kind Doug is a good match. And, deep down, seeing likes the simple things as well. Maybe, not as much as Doug, whose nirvana is watching TV and eating a big snack next to his big screen, but without culture it. This lack of an overly sensitive side is one reason why the two do not have children. <br /> <br /> Of course, the simple pleasures of a guy are nothing to scorn, and they add to the charm of the show. They live a common type of working-class life in Queens - it's realistic in that sense. And in general, comedy fun and enjoyable, esp. if you just want to relax. It gets a bit tired in the end so it's probably good that it's ending. Had a good race. See also Becker.
