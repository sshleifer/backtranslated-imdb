I love this movie. The cast was fantastic in the portrayal of its various characters. Judith Ivey portrayed so well a weak, fearful, dependent, aggressive and passive character in her complaint and self-involvement that it was a relief to see the character's metamorphosis. Blythe Danner was equally attractive in her role as a judicious Jewish mother, devoted wife and loving sister. Jonathon Silmerman, Bob Dishy, ​​Stacey Glick and Lisa Walz played their roles equally well. <br /> <br /> If you like related movies to go through difficult times without losing your sense of humor and hope, you will love this. movie.
