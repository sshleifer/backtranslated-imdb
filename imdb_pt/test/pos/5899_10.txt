I watch this movie every time he plays on TV. A simply brilliant film. Three men return home from the war and try to return to civilian life with great difficulty. All three took opposite lives during the war (Executive Banker became an army corporal, a soda jerk became a captain of the Air Force and the high school hero loses his arms in battle) and now each one must rebuild his life and connect with a new reality. The homes to which they return, with grown children and self-employed women, together with a depressed economy, only increase the conflict. It's the off-camera scenes and the unspoken dialogue that resonates louder, though. The strange intimacy of Frederich March and Myrna Loy and their struggle to return to their place as leader (both at home and at work) are heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is fascinating as the handsome and decorated captain who struggles to keep his life together without the uniform. <br /> <br /> The film is full of honest characters and each is portrayed by a talented actor. <br /> <br /> This film, however, took on an entire other level after seeing, "Saving Private Ryan". The reality and magnitude of what these men lived for love and country ... and obviously did not end on the battlefield. <br /> <br /> This is essential for any collection. <Br/> <br />
