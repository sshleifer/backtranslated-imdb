I would recommend this to anyone who is an admirer of the late John Cassavetes. And for those who have never met Cassavetes. It's a great movie. I really do not have time to go into the details of why this is my opinion but if you are looking for something brave with lots of scenes to think about then this is for you. Cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film, as well as the story itself. This review does not do justice to the film. It is an experience that we should see for ourselves. MANY CHARACTERS. VERY GENUINE
