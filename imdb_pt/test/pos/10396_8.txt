This is a special movie if you know the context. Antonioni, in his eighties, had been crippled by a stroke. Dumb and half paralyzed, his friends - who are by far the best in the world of cinema - arranged for him to "direct" one last significant film. The idea is that he can summon a story just by looking at it. So we have a movie about a director who invokes stories by simple observation. And the (four) story issue is about how visual imagination defines love. <br /> <br /> The film emerges giving us the tools to bring it up through our own imagination. The result is pure cinema world: every person (except the director) is adorable in appearance or movement. Some of these women are ultralightly, and they exist in a hazy and dreamy world of sensual encounter. There are no nuances, there is no evidence that there is anything other than what we see; no desire is in action beyond what we have created. <br /> <br /> I do not know of any other film that successfully manipulates our own visual yearning to make us create the world we see. He understands something about not touching. Nobody understands Van Morrison visually like him. Morrison's Celtic space music is based precisely on the same notion: the sensual touch that implies, but does not touch physically. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's red-headed wife appears appropriately as the merchant and she also runs a dull production. 'movie that is on DVD. <br /> <br /> Ted's rating - 3 out of 4: Worth seeing.
