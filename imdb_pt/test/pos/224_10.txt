I still have "Police Squad!" like the funniest TV show of the '80s. Somewhere in BetaMax no less, I have all six episodes. I knew that such a good show would not last and that I had to preserve for myself. How stupid was ABC? They were quoted as saying that viewers did not know that "Police Squad!" it was a comedy because there was no clue of laughter! Right! When Drebin has a phrase like "You risk just getting up in the morning, driving to work, or stick your face in a fan", how can this be comedy!?!? I've seen all the episodes at least ten times and I still see something new that I missed before. Even deep bottoms always have jokes going on. Do not miss it if you get a chance to see an episode, but if you're reading this then you probably already have copies hidden somewhere like I do.
