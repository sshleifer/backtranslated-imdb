The frogs who wanted a king or a frogland is Ladislaw Starewicz's most cautious story about people wanting the government to solve their problems I've seen. The irony is that they pray to the god Jupiter for their answers. Jupiter answers first by sending a stump of a tree and then a stork. It does not work and the stork is especially dangerous for amphibian creatures! Frogs have some human qualities when we see them dressed in the latest fashions of the day and we see some taking pictures or using a movie camera when the stork arrives! As I said, this short is much more a political allegory for adults than for children. In fact, I saw this for the first time in the Rhino VHS that had Bambi Meets Godzilla. That alone should tell you what to expect here!
