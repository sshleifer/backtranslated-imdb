I really do not know what it is about Dirty Dancing .. there is some kind of absolute magic in this movie .. I can not count the hundreds (yes, hundreds) of times I watched, starting from the end. but every time I see him on TV, I get fascinated and confused and sit down and there I am for two hours, loving the movie as if watching for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray have hated each other throughout the production of this film, they have a beautiful chemistry on set ... makes the viewer enjoy much more, see this passion and commitment .. and I can not help tearing a little bit in the when Patrick arrives at the Houseman family and tells his father, "Nobody puts Baby in a corner." (classic moment) To all those people who believe this film is tacky and sentimental, maybe in a way, but it was the pot of the 1980s movies, and put Patrick Swayze right on the map; his performance was immaculate. <br /> <br /> Three compliments for the dirty dance !! <br /> <br /> Ps- The soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece
