The flagship of all the movie series, the good guy - Flash Gordon - against Bad Guy - Ming the Ruthless. Although special effects look terrible by today's standards, by 1936 they were top notch. But the essence of the story is the battle between Earthman Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe) and Emporer Ming of Mongo (Charles Middleton). Crabbe and Middleton are great in their parts. And the supporting characters who play Dale Arden, Dr. Zarkov, Princess Aura, Prince Barin, Vulcano and the rest are all very good. This series is far superior to the 1980 movie, basically because Crabbe is far superior to Sam J. Jones as Flash Gordon. <br /> <br /> This series is the flagship of all series of films. No question about that.
