Such an incredible film - I was paralyzed all the time and so emotionally overcome in the end! The two young male actors in the film were more than convincing in their performance, as their friendship and mutual support was quite convincing and I found the comparison / contrast between their respective home lives versus health situations to be so real between they. The success in bringing this film to life was obviously a team effort for actors, EP, producers, writers, directors and the entire production I say, "WELL PLAYED!" Having lost credits early in the movie (it was being shown on HBO), I was so surprised that I had to search (albeit briefly) the internet to find the title of this movie - something so good. should have been known to me - a clear indication that this movie should be re-released!
