Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is not much different from previous games (excluding Tony Hawk 3). The only new thing that is featured in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, is the new selection of levels, and adjusts the graphics. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x offers a new career mode, and that's the 2x career. A 2x career is basically the career of Tony Hawk 1, because there are only about five challenges per level. If you've lost Tony Hawk 1 and 2, I suggest you buy Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater, but if you've already played the first two games, you should still try this one. Overall, there's really nothing new, but it's still a lot of fun to get through the game. I hope this review will benefit your needs. Graphics: 7 out of 10 Overall, clean visuals are not really one of the main features of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x. The atmosphere has changed a lot since Tony Hawk 1 and 2, and the character models look a little better. When you look back at Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 on the old PS1, the thought that these old graphics are ugly goes through your head. In Pro Skater Tony Hawk 2x, the graphics are much better. The character models are no longer populated with jaggys, the textures are softer, but not to the greatest extent. The visual effects of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x do not compare to the graphics of Tony Hawk 3, but Activision probably did not want Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x to have extraordinary graphics. Overall, the graphics deserve an average score of 7 because they did not put all the power of the Xbox to use here. The graphics are cool and clean, that's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Sound: 8 out of 10 Sound effects do not go far to the imagination, but skates popping up from the ground sound great. . The main reason I gave a sound factor rating was because you're not required to hear Tony Hawk's soundtrack below average because there's a custom soundtrack. The sound effects sound so much better than the sounds of Tony Hawk 1 and 2, mainly because it's clearer, and just because everything looks great. One of the main reasons why I bought this game is because of the personalized soundtrack. The sound effects of grinding still sound the same as the first two games, only a little refined. One of the main problems of the sound factor is the fact that if the song is over, it will NOT proceed to the next track, the song you just heard will only play again. I do not like the soundtrack of the game, but like I said, you're not required to listen to it. Controls: 10 out of 10 The controls are the best part of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x The control setting is wonderfully comfortable and easy to get used to. On Playstation days, people thought the controls were the best of all time, but it seems like 2x did a better job with Xbox control. Surprisingly, it is very easy to use the joystick to perform tricks. Activision did a great job with the controls of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x. They have made Xbox control the best for Tony Hawk's games. You will not be disappointed with the control style, and this is a guarantee. <br /> <br /> Game: 10 out of 10 Excluding the fact that Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater is basically Tony Hawk 1 and 2 together, the game is still unbelievably fun. The game factor has been slightly modified. This time you get a lot more air than in the first two games, and it's a lot easier to perform tricks. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, each character has three career modes, consisting of Tony Hawk's career 1, Tony Hawk's 2 career and 2x career. Tony Hawk 1 career is fairly easy because in the first game, you have nothing to air. The career of Tony Hawk 2 offers the same difficulty as the PlayStation version. The only difficulty that applies to 2x career is finding out where all the items are, but once you have done it, 2x career is not at all difficult. In the 2x career, there are a total of 3 levels, and the first two levels consist of finding the secret tapes, collecting S-K-A-T-E and doing whatever is needed for that particular level. The third level of the three is the level of competition, where you have to get a certain amount of points to get the gold. In the first two levels, the secret tapes and the letters S-K-A-T-E are shown in both. Overall, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x still retains Tony Hawk's old Pro Skater vibe. <br /> <br /> History: - <br /> <br /> Fun factor: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x is now the most fun Xbox game today. I played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2, and at that time I did not like them, but for some reason, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is really fun. There is not much to be said except that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is by far the best Xbox game these days. One problem is that if you've gone through the game once, it will play a few more times, but it will be repetitive. <br /> <br /> Replay value: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk 2x Pro Skater offers a high replay value. There are many tricks to unlock and many character videos. Overall, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x has a lot of replay value, mainly because it's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Best feature: You are not required to listen to the low quality in-game soundtrack. Worst feature: The custom soundtrack is a bit confusing. <br /> <br /> Final Statement: Many people have complained in the past that they did not like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x because there is nothing new but they should stop complaining because you are getting too much game for $ 50.00 . <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10. Sound: 8 out of 10. Control: 10 out of 10. Game: 10 out of 10. History: N / A Fun factor: 10 out of 10. <br /> /> Overall rating: 9 out of 10.
