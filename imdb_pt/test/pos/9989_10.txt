I thought this movie was awesome. I just loved it, though my brothers did not like it very much. The special effects were great, and this movie is about my favorite sport; golf. The only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it's hard to watch it twice or more in a row. This movie simply surpasses everything I've ever seen. It was all I would expect from a movie. I just loved it. Also, it was very good for kids. This film has helped me realize that when you put your mind to it all is possible. I would give a 10/10 pure! It was better than The Legend of Baggar Vants, and the two Pirates of the Caribbean films together. Absolutely amazing. Loved it.
