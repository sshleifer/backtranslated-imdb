If you do not mind subtitles, you like comedy and really cool characters, along with the taste of something different from American cinema, so take a chance and rent that movie. <br /> <br /> Two contrasting friends, (a very neurotic sweater, the other strong and solitary and quiet type, working for a butcher in a small Danish town, decide to attack together and open a butcher shop. , they incorporate something new into the recipe and become an instant success with the village. <br /> <br /> Being such an interesting story in itself, this clever and humorous film contains even more (friendship, romance, crime, death, personal tragedy) that makes this movie so funny but full of countless subtle interests that make it so interesting, yet warm and vague. We should mention the created characters and actors making them believable. You can have the best script yet, if the characters are not believable, you can sink a movie and with that, the direction, performance, credibility of the character and the story combine so well that they make it a very entertaining movie. So , if you're in the mood to stretch a little, I want to see something very good, but done in a slightly different way, so I suggest you rent this movie while I'm going out to find more by director Anders Thomas Jensen. .
