I remembered this design for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. He ranks up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was glad to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot for them that today's designs for kids do not have. Today's cartoons seem to stimulate the idea that someone needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against bad or dangerous circumstances. Although the early cartoons did not treat much of evil - it was a much smoother and safer time - they allowed us to develop our own talents and character.
