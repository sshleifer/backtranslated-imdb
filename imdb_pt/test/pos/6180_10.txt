The comments of the planktonrules must have been written on Topsy-Turvy Day, because everything expressed by this simple way of life is the opposite of the real truth! 'Bluebeard's eighth wife' is hilarious in every scene, in every way. - the chemistry between Colbert and Cooper could not have been finer ... the support cast is superb. <br /> <br /> Writing and directing are magnificent !!! <br /> <br /> Like so many other comments in this picture again, I'm sorry, "Why can not movies be like this?" <br /> <br /> This is the classic classic Paramount comedy 1930 at its best, folks!
