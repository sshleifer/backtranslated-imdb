It is quite revealing to see this today and appreciate how far we have come in what we expect from the films and at the same time appreciate how many fundamental notions have been established. <br /> <br /> Here we have an abstract narrative speaking film - the audio and visual are pushed to the edge of the period. The framing is limited to about high belt and up - no face close-ups. <br /> <br /> The compositions are remarkable; there is an early transverse scene over the shoulder to show the dialogue; there is a treacherous descent into a gorge with some distressing angles; a sun-blasted skeleton lies in the dust when the wheels and legs march on the top of the frame; the tension in the confrontation between the hero and the villain is visually captured by filming over the long axis of a large tree that sits between them; and so on - the first visual delights are abundant. <br /> <br /> Today, it is disturbing to see young Wayne carry a movie, ego-free or mannerisms. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if Walsh recognized self-reference: the subject is the journey of a different group of pilgrims; those who appear onscreen are a disparate group of theater actors, vaudeville comedians, shell-playing artists, and probably ten-in-one veterans and rent thieves. They all travel together to show how the movies would be made. <br /> <br /> This is worth at least one visualization to appreciate the source of so many visual ideas borrowed in later films.
