I saw the Korean version of Daisy first. It came as a simple love story that flowed very well from beginning to end. I've seen this three times while waiting for my copy of the director to arrive. <br /> <br /> So I took the CD and watched it. Wow!! I think this is the REAL REAL director's first cut I've ever seen. Amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions! The DC is presented as a hardcore thriller, with the love story in the background. It moves at a slower pace than the Korean version. The variations between the two versions are so drastic that they look like two totally different films. I thought I'd be worn watching the movie again, trying to figure out the added scenes. That was not the case. It really felt like I was watching a whole new movie. <br /> <br /> Although the CD is 20 minutes longer than the Korean version, you will have difficulty identifying where or what has changed. 2 seconds cut here. A second added there. A whole scene added here. Another erased there. In both versions, scenes were added, omitted or cut and reordered. In some scenes, entire lines of dialogue have been replaced or reordered - while the scene itself has not been played. Even simple sound effects were added / omitted from each version - having a big impact on the mood of the movie, and sometimes even changing the outcome of a scene. What appears as a moment of tenderness in the Korean version is sad and gloomy in DC. The endings of both versions leave room for interpretation. As far as I can tell, both versions end up VERY different, and were planned that way. <br /> <br /> I'm assuming most people will be getting the cut of the movie's director, and they'll find the movie pretty decent, but a little long and boring. If this is the case, look for the Korean version. Same movie, but different feeling. I think there is a deluxe version of 3 DVDs that contains both cuts of the movie - I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> The versions complement each other so well that as a couple, I watch Daisy more often than any of my other favorite Korean films. Alone, I would say that the Korean version is a good love story that I would observe from time to time. The director cut, I'll watch maybe once or twice, then never again, since I think the pace is annoying. But they go so well together! For what I consider the best experience, I would say watch the Korean version first. Then watch the director's cut to help fill in the gaps in the story that you were curious about. <br /> <br /> The issue is the true star of the movie.
