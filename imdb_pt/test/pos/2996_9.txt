When I first saw this video movie in a department store ... that intrigued me. Considering the fact that I thought I was in love and I was the same age as the youngsters of this movie at the time (although I know they are now old enough to be my parents) plus the soundtrack being written by Elton John & Bernie Taupin just before "succeeding" here in North America ... I realized I had nothing to lose in buying it. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> So far, I have shown to many guys that dating since then, and to my current boyfriend ... obviously, they did not find it as adorable as me. .. preferring to call it "girl" movie ... but I still laugh and cry. This movie was largely forgotten. It's good to see you're available to rent at one of the local video stores here so that other people can share the magic. <br /> <br /> So, maybe it's a little improbable ... but it gives you a carefree sense of innocence ... and renewed faith in love.
