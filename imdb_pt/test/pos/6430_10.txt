It's an amazing job. It's only ten minutes long, but I would rather pay ten dollars at the movies to see this, than see any full-length movies currently in circulation. is a simple piece of reflection of a man. A young man arrived at this place and was hypnotized by a room and the music coming from him ... and now here he is, dying of old age in this place that he connects with so much affection to his youth. the music is brilliant, the guitars have that jazz room sound like the music of neil young in dead man. If you get the chance, watch this movie. If it's worth it. If rutger hauer made more films like this, I think he would have more respect than he gets. As soon as you hear it, put phrases like "everyone's favorite psycho." Of course that's not what the rutger would like to be remembered as an actor. He also directed this film, so this shows that he is a very artistic actor / director. A change from the b-level films he has been doing since the early days. 90. I hope to see more of this rutger hauer as he is one of my favorite actors.
