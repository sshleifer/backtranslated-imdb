Affable cartoonist Hoops McCann (a wonderfully engaging performance by John Cusack) and his best friend George (the delightfully blank Joel Murray) head to Nantucket the summer after high school graduation. Hoops, George and several newcomer friends come to the aid of Cassandra (Demi Moore in her loveliest charm), a family home of singers who is being threatened with demolition by the greedy Beckersted clan. Writer / Director Savage Steve Holland offers an uninterrupted and entertaining barrage of admittedly broad and stupid but still very funny jokes. The crazy and constant madness has a vertiginous vitality, of good nature and contagious, that is impossible or not to like or to resist. In addition, the lively and enthusiastic performance of a game cast adds immensely to the crazy joy: Bobcat Goldthwait as the spasmodic Egg Stork, Tom Villard as his goofy brother Clay, Curtis Armstrong as the sweet Ack Ack Raymond, Mark Metcalf as Rich Idiot evil Aquilla Beckersted, Matt Mulhern as the middle Teddy, Kimberly Foster as Cookie, Joe Flaherty as General Raymond, William Hickey as the old Beckersted, Jeremy Piven as the proud Ty, and John Matuszak as the cyclist Stan. The slippery cinematography of Isidore Mankofsky, the hip soundtrack, the cool soundtrack of Cory Lerios and the lively animation are all uniformly excellent. Funniest single scene: Egg in a Godzilla suit terrifying an elegant dinner. An absolute joke.
