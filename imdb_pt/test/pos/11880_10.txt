Critters 4 is a good movie. A bit of a twist to the series, as it does in space, not in an earthly community. Good Effects and Performance make this film a must see. I would recommend this to fans of Horror / Science Fiction everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this must check out the Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp, Slumber Party Massacre and other Full Moon Pictures movies.
