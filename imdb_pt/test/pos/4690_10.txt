Used to watch this when I was very small, so I used to watch my videos. Now I watch the DVDs, I love it. Ray Winston is 'The Dude', the rest of the cast is good and even with the change of Robin Hood, everything works. Great stories, twists and the way it was filmed - for the untrained eye (not for which my own is trained) can be misinterpreted as being rude, but add to the absorption of the films by the audience. With the green slopes and the contrast of the lush forest lit by the dark corridors and dungeons of the castles - it's great. Personally the definitive interpretation of the Robin Hood legend. I can not stress how much I think you should watch this, if you have a chance, then you should watch it.
