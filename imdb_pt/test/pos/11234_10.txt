It is evident that many of her nights were spent alone. If you watched 5 minutes of the show instead of watching the commercial, you would have seen one of the biggest television shows in Canada's history. Too bad you would have seen it alone. Probably the reason you hate ... there is no game. The VIP keys are hilarious, light and fun. The guys are going to eat this show. My game is tight and I can not wait to get into this show. The girls were HOOOOOT and the clubs beat up. I'll be watching every week. It makes me wonder why such big shows are not being made. It is now clear that talent in Canada has the ability to produce American quality television.
