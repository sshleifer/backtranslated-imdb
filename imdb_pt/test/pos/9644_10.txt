The crew of an American submarine finds that it is well below while fighting in the Adriatic in 1918. Although almost forgotten, this excellent war film still offers solid entertainment thanks to a literate script, superior performances and highly credible. action scenes. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery and Walter Huston interpret undersea underwater police officers who are quickly in conflict with each other with dramatic and tragic results. Since Montgomery is in love with Huston's daughter, Madge Evans in a well-played role, the situation becomes even more complicated, both on land and under the waves. The spectator is divided between the two strong characters, one of whom is governed by his heart and the other by rules. Robert Young makes an effective appearance as a friend of Montgomery. Sterling Holloway creates a brief and vivid portrait of a doomed sailor. <br /> <br /> Eugene Pallette as Master of Torpedoes and Jimmy Durante as the sub cook makes for a very funny comedy team and provide the story with a lot of laughs. Durante's nose comes in many veins and his obsession with amateur dentistry leads to some chaotic encounters with the British Tartars. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize Babe London as an obese Italian; Maude Eburne as the wife of a British admiral and Paul Porcasi as an Italian admiral - all uncredited. <br /> <br /> MGM gave the film absolutely first-class production values, with especially well-produced underwater sequences. Both the claustrophobic compression of the ship and the inevitable tension associated with submarine warfare are accurately portrayed. Other moments of unexpected drama (Montgomery & Miss Evans picked up on a giant Ferris wheel during an air raid) and hilarity (during a kangaroo's boxing) are skilfully lined up in the fabric of the film to provide a totally satisfying visual experience.
