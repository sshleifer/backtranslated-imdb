The Falcon and the Snowman is based on a true story. Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee (the titular traitors), played by Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn, were given their KGB code names. Because? Boyce was an avid falconer and Lee was a head of cocaine. The film is based on a true story. It is based on the book of the same name. Another reviewer asked what their motivation was? Disappointment is not. Ideology is not. (Forgive my bad grammar), but I'm making a point here. What if it was not disillusionment or ideology? In a word, greed. At the time of the Boyce-Lee affair, money became the great motivator and not the ideology. Do not believe me? Then look at the Walker Family Spy Ring, which was broken in the late 1980s. Three spies did the worst damage to our national security in the 1970s and 1980s. John Walker, who began his spy career in the 1960s, Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee. All three sold this country for thirty silver coins. If you are not familiar with this phrase, I suggest you read the Bible.
