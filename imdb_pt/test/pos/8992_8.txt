I am a big movie enthusiast and also an active rugby player who believes that rugby is the biggest game ever played. Forever Strong is a mix of Carter Coach and sloppy rugby. This movie is full of great performances, well-developed characters and action scenes that will make you dodge and dodge in your seat, but with more laps than pee and almost all shots are cut off as soon as a player touches the ground . shot to almost seem like football. If you want to bring your kids to see a movie that will build the character inside and can inspire a blind man to see again I can easily give 9 out of 10 if you want to see a great rugby movie that really shows the sport you will have to wait for the next because Forever Strong is mostly practice, race and a movie ruck, so I give him 7.75 out of 10.
