THE STUDENT NURSES is not a typical sexploitation film. Of course, nudity and sexual openness are present, but it's not all for laughter. Stephanie Rothman has written a socially convincing and well-written tits and ass movie that confronts the themes of racism, socioeconomic inequalities, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health issues, human rights, Vietnam War, free love, LSD and drug experimentation . Four sexy college mates are doing their nursing internships at the same time. Sharon (Elaine Giftos) is assigned to the terminal wing, Lynn (Brioni Farrell) for the public health administration, Priscilla (Barbara Leigh) for gynecology and Phred (Karen Carlson) for psychiatry. These four beauties have ample opportunities to undress and fornicate, which they enjoy, to the delight of male viewers. These are women released at the height of the sexual revolution, after all, and are as smart as they are excited and beautiful. Visceral, but low-budget action sequences are interspersed. There is a very bloody shooting at the resistance movement headquarters in which two policemen are shot and killed along with several members of the group. A war protest against Vietnam, made up of young costumed men of all races painted like skeletons, becomes violent, with policemen beating the demonstrators. The effective travel sequence on the beach consists of beautiful, strange, confusing sensory and memory montages with hyper-sensual tones. In short, THE STUDENT NURSES is a thoughtful and convincing reflection of the times, expressed through real perspectives of women (since it was written and directed by a woman). But, it's still fun and exciting, despite its moderate handling of the subject.
