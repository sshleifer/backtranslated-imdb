We just ran the El Padrino screening in Australia. A phenomenal work of film. We look forward to seeing many more Mr. Chapa films in the future. It was wonderful to see such a well-assembled film with so much suspense and a story that should remain an instant classic. Seeing a movie with great quality truly describes Chapa's serious potential and skill as a writer, actor, director and filmmaker. Plate has impressed many with his triumphant performance in "blood in blood and blood" and now he has proven to everyone who has seen his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed filmmaker with genuine artistic control. With his main role Kilo Vasquez being a perfect match between Milo Velka from "Blood in Blood Out" and Al Pacino from "Scarface" the movie will do wonders for us here in Australia.
