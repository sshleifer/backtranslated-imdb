This film is a knockout, fires in the plain referred to is, (the burning at the end of the harvest season) A happy memory for Tamura, He revives this in his mind many times, and at the end of this dark film, as A man dying of thirst , he believes that he is at home and this last illusion is all that he left. The big carnival of Billy Wilder (Ace in the hole) is the only film (which comes to mind) that is as bleak as this little masterpiece by Kon Ichikawa. While I think the whole movie is brilliant. Two scenes that come to mind are when a platoon of Japanese soldiers trying to escape (Creeping there in the belly) are ambushed by Americans and massacred, True Horror, And as an American soldier and a beautiful Filipino girl soldier is having a cigarette on the side of the road, she smiles as she shakes with the pull, then her face turns to rage as she sees two Japanese soldiers trying to surrender, she picks up a gun and kills them with joy, the American soldier tries stop it, but it has no chance, for me this speaks a lot about the atrocity committed by the Japanese in the Philippines, usually a great movie if you have the stomach for it.
