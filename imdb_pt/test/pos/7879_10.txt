Peter Boyle was always a great actor and he proved this by his performance as a gun fanatic, making me hate him every time he used the word "N", I watched him and his big mouth and wanted to turn off his lights. (Just think, Peter Boyle was a Monk once) (now a supporting actor in "Everybody Loves Raymond") Susan Sarandon making her first debut needs a shower right away and enjoyed sharing it with another person in her own dirty water. I noticed that a large Raggerty Ann Doll (creator, John Gruelle) was the only thing Susan could really trust and love and the doll appeared in some scenes. If you really want to know about the 70's exit with drugs, free love and pipe dreams then take advantage of the excellent direction of John G. Avildsen ("Rocky and" The Karate Kid ") I always thought Peter Boyle should have Been This is definitely a cult classic that is worth seeing and sharing with others.
