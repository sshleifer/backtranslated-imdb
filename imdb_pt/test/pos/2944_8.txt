This movie was fun and thought-provoking. I recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, direction - and it's Canadian to boot! It's a movie that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locals in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the time. With so much junk and superficial hype selling these days it's great to see that someone could support an independent movie. For any family that has overcome a challenge or an obstacle - financial or illness - this movie makes a resounding chord! It addresses the idea of ​​afterlife in a contemporary way - without capitalizing cheaply on all the "gohst" and supernatural themes that have become essential in Hollywood and TV networks.
