Last days is the best gay film of the homosexual genre. Do most movies feature sentimental stories one night, and let's not forget infamous baseball teams? The last few days really do contain male affection beyond kissing in the dark, and a pretty graphic material that made me wonder if the movie belonged to Blockbuster or badpuppy.com. The emotional journey of films is what puts it above the rest of the genre. Not until this movie had I seen a story of intense passion and love, and the torture that this can bring. I think that when people cry during the movies, they must be beaten, but I find myself crying during various scenes because of the realistic nature of the world we live in. I suggest that every gay man see this movie, and if you have a boyfriend, thank him ...
