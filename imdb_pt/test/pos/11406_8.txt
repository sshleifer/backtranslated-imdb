People say this movie is a 'typical teen horror movie' ... well, it's a horror movie with a teenager ... what do you expect! It's a good movie, I counted 3 real screams in the audience while the movie was passing and it was a very scary movie. I was not bored in the movie at any time and I was even on the edge of my seat at one point. The only thing that was a bit bad was that it was a bit slow to get into the actual plot, but all this led to why it was where it was and why what happened happened. The performance was good, the setting was good and the plot was good as well, I hope to see a 'When A Stranger Calls 2' in a few months! Good movie!
