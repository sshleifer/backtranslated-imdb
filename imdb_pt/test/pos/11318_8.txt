This movie was really interesting ... it's also quite shocking, as the movie's similar events occurred only 10 months after the movie's premiere. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see the problems that could be found and sufficiently realistic. to show that no matter how prepared you are - you're not. if this were done for an American audience - it would be different because they would have used it as a full-fledged propaganda film and not as an alert the BBC did! is still propaganda to some extent - no film today with these themes can not be - but has dealt with the issue successfully. <br /> <br /> a film that should be screened in all courses of terrorism / counterterrorism, but not because it shows flaws that can not be recognized! A great film in which the BBC took some risks and unfortunately London no longer needs a fictional tale due to the reality of July 7, 2005.
