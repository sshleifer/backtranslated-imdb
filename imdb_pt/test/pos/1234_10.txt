Heya Denver fans! The animation is a cartoon classic and one of my favorites too (and yes, it was broadcasted in Europe too.) Including my little Central European country, Slovenia! :) :) Oh, how I miss the cartoons of the 80's !! Honestly, they were much better than toddlers programs today. More imaginative, creative, full of fun with good morale, more substance, great plot and excellent character voices. Today's computer-animated shows lack all those features. So, all of you, who agree and want to bring back all the shows so that the children of today's generation can see the entertainment that these cartoons brought to us, please go to the bottom and sign a petition for a reprise of the 80's best cartoon <br /> <br /> http://www.thepetitionsite.com/ 1 / We-want-a-80-child-cartoon-kids-show-channel <br /> <br /> Carpe Denver! =) <br /> <br /> Lejla
