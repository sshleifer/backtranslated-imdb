A True Thing rises above your potentially dangerous material to give us insight into a family of complex relationships and imperfect and real people. Opens with Rene Zeleweger discussing his mother's death with the District Attorney; saving us from the cheap cinematic shots of "shocking" illness and death. From there, one looks at a familiar system in which everyone plays with a set of unexamined rules, and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. <br /> <br /> William Hurt as the most important parent, and Meryl Streep as the mother of Suzy's housewife are superb; nuanced and not what they appear to be. Zeleweger is boiling with rage and surprise at herself. Tom Everett Scott does not have much to do, but he does it well. <br /> <br /> The story is predictable, and it takes at least a bad turn that it need not have, but the performances, and the vision of the family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed, make it worthwhile.
