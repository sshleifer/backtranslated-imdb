Commissar Mattei (André Bourvil) is a single with a small gun that loves cats and his boss in the Paris police department is a philosopher who knows that even the police will sooner or later be guilty. That's what the movie is all about. And a jewel theft in the Vendome place. Corey (Delon) brings the prison plan, Vogel (Volonté) joins him and helps him against two tough guys, who are behind him, because he took mafia Ricos (Andre Eycan) money, while Rico already took girlfriend Coreys and left him very alone for five years in jail. Corey and Vogel meet a third man, Jansen (Montand), a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by firing special handmade ammunition into a hole. A perfect plan and cooperation, but they have to sell the estate and there Mattei in the role of a buyer in disguise. The circle closes. Running to help each other, they are shot by the cat who loves Mattei and his little pistol. It took Melville 20 years to make an assault movie after he failed to get a contract for RIFFIFI. Melville wrote the screenplay and filmed in southern France and Paris in the past. The great Henri Decae is, as usual, the lighting cameraman. It is the last picture of Melvilles who died after another film with Delon in 1972. Melville really wanted Belmondo instead of Volonté, he did not like that Italian, but Volonté-Vogel is an excellent fugitive and gives to Bourvil the most convincing performance. But remember: Melville notes that Volonté is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very tiring and absolutely impossible in a French set. Melville did not like him at all and did not want to work with him any more. <br /> <br /> Melville is wrong. Volonté gives the most animated character in the nothingness of so many interesting characters. You can see what he is being chased by Mattei and his little dangerous weapon and all the dogs of France in winter 70. A wild actor. <br /> <br /> Also André Bourvil, who died near the time of filming. It was also not our first choice, but definitely a great substitute. He carries the instinct of a lone hunter all through the movie and has in the end his chance to become guilty once again. <br /> <br /> Jansen came into the night at the jewelry store with a rifle and a tripod, but risk freehandedly a successful shot. When he meets Delon the first time, we already know that the elegant Jansen has a serious drinking problem. After the robbery, Montand resigns to take his share of the loot and mentions to Delon, who looks at him, that he only entered the red circle, because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe. Delon does not understand what he means. The audience recalls seeing Montand in a big scene in his haunted house battling impotent nightmare creatures who come out of the wardrobe and attack him. At that time, a very rare scene, one remembers a long time later. I bet it was very difficult to organize and direct these things at once, no one imagined the next days of digital cinema. Great work of art when art was done by hand. <br /> <br /> Surely we will remember a team like the actors, it still looks even after 33 years, this is the least popular of the six thrillers of Melville. What's wrong with that? I'm afraid there is not much interest in these three actors (showing three criminals) and the police hunter. We learned very little about Corey and her five-year estrangement from her beautiful girl (Anna Douking). Montand is still a great sniper, but what made him become a man drinking with funny creatures in his wardrobe. Delon acts as if in a previous samourai adventure, Volonté is the man in the trunk of the American car Delons and superbly in motion and Mattei is swelling to look, a great actor at the edge of his life. But how could he doubt that all are guilty? <br /> <br /> In an interview, Melville says there is no woman in the movie. Not in the very red circle, but I remember well that pretty female Anna Douking (no future career). It's the 1970s. In fact, a woman emerges from the bed of an old mafioso who uses nothing and walks slowly to the door to hear the voice of her former lover Delon. Bardot did something like that ten years earlier. This time, Melville was driving. Well done. <br /> <br /> RED CERCLE certainly added some gems, but not many, to film the story. The theft at Place Vendôme and Montands is a wonder that killed the wardrobe inhabitants and Volonté escaped from Bouvil in white underwear and carefully loading his trousers down a stream. That's very little for a great gangster movie and assault. But the 110 minutes never bothered you and it's a top-notch game. And there are probably some secrets you learn when you watch the movie several times. None of the secrets is that we are all guilty and the late François Perier is also prominent. <br /> <br /> Michael Zabel
