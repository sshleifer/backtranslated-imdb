Had the chance to see this at a friend's house today and was impressed with what he achieved with such a small budget. Not that it bothered me anyway, since I love low-budget science fiction like Dr Who, Blake's 7 and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland was not a big budget issue, so as long as money helps, it takes more than throwing money at things to make them good. <br /> <br /> The story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries. paid to escort a prisoner through space. Your ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. They then find out that the prisoner also did it, it's a very crazy case and that's just the beginning of their problems. <br /> <br /> The effects, with the exception of the shootings, are minimalistic and add to the film without overloading. this. The effects of the computer seem a bit dishonest at times, but they serve their purpose well and increase the story, giving a futuristic feel to the proceedings. Movies like me, Robot, could have benefited from this approach, instead of being largely style over substance and replacing special effects with a plot like many of Hollywood's offerings. <br /> <br /> While none of the actors get Oscar material, it's well scripted and filmed, and in an hour and ten minutes, it's no more than welcome. The characters do not develop much, but neither did they in Predator, which resembles sensation. The great man Mike Mitchell is a good candidate for Arnie and is a good combination of intelligence and strength. <br /> <br /> Some people may get bored with the lack of explanation for the ending, but I like it. Unlike many movies and shows that leave things unexplained, it's not so obscure that you can not handle it, and I'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further. A small film by an enterprising team, done cheaply but fun to spend an hour. If that's what they can do with a little money, I'd like to see what they'd do with a little more money, and I hope the film industry and the critics of untalented armchairs will not take their creativity all the way first. /> <br /> Recommended.
