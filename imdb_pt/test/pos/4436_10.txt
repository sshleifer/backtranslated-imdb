When Nathaniel Kahn embarked on this trip, he hardly knew who his father was. At the end of the film, he met him and accepted the strange life he lived as a child. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn was the father. He was an architect of architects. His designs might be too complex, as he tried to create buildings that were not in keeping with popular trends of the day. It is ironic that he has never achieved fame that was so easy for some of his contemporaries. He had a vision and never turned away from it. We can see characteristics of his unique style in the buildings he left behind as a legacy to mankind. Each one of his creations is unique, because they do not imitate works of other architects. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn's life was quite complicated. He was married, but had cases with two of his assistants who produced a girl and a boy, in addition to the legitimate daughter he had with his wife. As a boy, Nathaniel Kahn's life was lived in an isolated area, far from his father, who only visited late at night. Louis Kahn never recognized these children, although it is very clear that they all knew of the existence of others. <br /> <br /> It is tragic that Louis Kahn died alone in Grand Central Station when he was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children he never recognized as his at his side. He probably cared a lot about all his kids, but he remains a distant figure throughout the film. We never know the man, although in the end, Nathaniel, in his quest to discover his father's life, finds most of the missing pieces in the puzzle. <br /> <br /> This is a personal account of life. of an artist. Thanks to this son, who has the courage to tell the story, we are almost intruding on the lives of Louis Kahn and his extended family.
