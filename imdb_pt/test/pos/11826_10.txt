And I do not understand why the show is so beat up. In my opinion, this show is really great. Well, the first two episodes were not so good, but it gets a boost in the third episode. What seems to be typical of a sitcom by Steve Moffat. I would rate it among the best sitcoms that England has ever produced. <br /> <br /> The show itself is a farce at its best; it is not along the lines of Fawlty Towers, but you can definitely rate it as high as a black adder, or the young adder! I'm watching the first season, and all I can say is I'm glad I bought the DVD! <br /> <br /> The problem probably with this show is and why it was so hard, according to the internet, that the original press release compared this to Fawlty Towers and everyone was disappointed it was not! Well, even the Green Wing is closer to Fawlty Towers than this show, all I can say is clear your mind of all prejudice, give the show at least a run up (including episode 3) and then decide for yourself same! <br /> <br /> All I can say is thank you Steve Moffat for writing it and thank you for the whole team taking it out!
