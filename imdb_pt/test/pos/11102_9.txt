This movie does an excellent job of taking us through the dark tunnel of espionage, from the beginning to the last calculation. The impact of the film goes even deeper with the realization that it is based on a true story. Timothy Hutton offers us a quality performance and Sean Penn demonstrates why he is one of the best actors in America. As with "Midnight Express," this movie should make us think twice about doing something we should not be doing in a foreign country.
