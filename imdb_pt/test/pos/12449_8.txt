This is one of the nicest teen movies I've ever seen (and I wanted it to be released on video). It was released the same year as another great comedy in which Tim Matheson played a role "Animal House" (which is probably because it was forgotten). <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable parts of this film would definitely be the soundtrack, which could and should have been a formal release of the label. The soundtrack features a lesser-known act of the '70s called High Inergy, whose song "We Are the Future" played a major role in the film's prom scene. I remember buying the group album "Steppin 'Out" as a child, mainly because of the girls' look and not necessarily because of their musical talents. <br /> <br /> Closing music is one of the best ballads I've ever heard, and I can still hear it in my head. I would like to know the name of the group so I could look for it somewhere in cyberspace. <br /> <br /> If you like movies like "Over the Edge" and "Rich Kids", I think this is one of your likes too.
