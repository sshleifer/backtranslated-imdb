A young Frenchman is uprooted when he becomes an Erasmus exchange student in Barcelona and returns as a better man. Does it look annoying? No way! The film is filled with colorful people, all stereotyped (the British vulva and his racist brother, the sexually liberated Dane, the ultra-organized German, ...). In this case, however, the stereotypes are brilliantly made. You feel like you know people like that (I know an arrogant doctor and his wife trophy, and they are like the characters in the movie!), They feel like real people! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and enjoy the subtitles!
