This is one of the best and funniest comedy series I've ever seen! All the characters are brilliant. Mr. Slatt (David Bamber) is a very angry man, irritated by everything and anyone. <br /> <br /> He wants to do things and deal with situations in the best possible way, but he never hits and only gets deeper and deeper in trouble. He is not supported by his wife Janet, who just tries to get him deeper and deeper into the problem he's getting into (and really does not need help at all!). <br /> <br /> All characters are played / portrayed brilliantly. Imagine sending your child (ren) to a school like this. <br /> <br /> It's unbelievable that people do not like it (maybe some do not get the many pieces with words, which are often presented per episode). <br /> <br /> It is also unbelievable that there is still no DVD release. There are only 2 series! <br /> <br /> So please, let it go, let it go! So fans can and will have fun! <br /> <br /> Try it, you might like it! <br /> <br /> Just a few names and words from the series: Pumpman, Man Helmet, Hot Bitch, Mount Suzy, Travis Fellatio, Cockfoster, Arshead (and many more).
