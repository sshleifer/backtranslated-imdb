This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to watch on TV, scaring me to the impressionable age of 12 years or more and condemning me after that to a life of obsession with horror movies. This is a great movie, and it's living proof that there were realistic effects before the CGI. Defined on an isolated basis in Antarctica, this version almost seems to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) stopped. American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base a few miles away. Everyone is dead, and only the charred remains of something unidentifiable left to burn outside the complex can offer any response to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, scientists realize that it is alive and deadly. The Thing knocks and is off, not just killing someone and anything that crosses their path, but also absorbing them, making themselves into who and whatsoever. The film then turns into a brilliant piece of paranoia. Everyone is suspicious, anyone can be The Thing, and no one else trusts anyone. It was the strength and safety encountered when humans unite, despite their differences, to fight a monster. The group shatters and fear governs supreme. Who is the Thing? <br /> <br /> The bloody effects are absolutely amazing and confusing. I could have done without the dog's head if it opened like a banana peel but this is just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the humans you want but leave the kittens and dogs alone. Sanity and reason disintegrate quickly when, one by one, humans are taken by the alien who changes shape. The power of this film is in its paranoia and, although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat is inside, and it is more frightening because it can not be seen or easily detected. When you are forced out of hiding, the anger is enormous and the results are horrible. <br /> <br /> This is one of Carpenters best movies, along with The Fog and Halloween. All the actors give strong and realistic performances, and the special effects are so powerful that they stand out as main characters. This movie has something for any lover of the horror genre. Do not miss it.
