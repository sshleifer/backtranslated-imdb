I just watched it last night and it was great. I can see why some people have bad feelings towards this from a rugby fan and Maori culture point of view but other than that I have no idea what is so negative about it. The movie is great. There's a lot of heart. Very inspiring and encouraging for all ages. Great family movie! They did a good job considering it was a budget movie. I love movies based on real stories / events. I was raised around rugby all my life, it's a great game, but I've never really been led to this because (please forgive me if I offend someone, nothing personal is so I've seen) I thought, your trainings do not are so relentless or hard, players are not as disciplined and did not seem as serious as other sportsmen and it seemed that everything was just muscle and blooming attacking each other etc. But after watching Forever strong, I was like, wow! I was proud! He did good things for rugby (well changed my view of rugby) and also the New Zealnd Haka. I really cried. I'm not even a New Zealander, and I was proud of his culture. I did not even know what singing meant until this movie. The movie is not about rugby or rugby techniques, not even about New Zealand All Blacks or the Haka or etc ...... Mother of pearls !!!!! hahaha SHUX! <br /> <br /> So for all of you beautiful and negative people, you're missing the point! I'm sure if they had the means, it would have been better, the haka is there because that was part of the Highland Rugby culture, tradition or whatever you want to call it. <br /> <br /> So any new members on this site like me, please do not get discouraged with these negative comments. See for yourself! Must see the movie! There is a lot you can learn from this movie, ppl of all ages. It definitely makes you want to be a better person and be humble! This movie reminded me of many things I already know and was created, but kind of lost along the way! Loved it! Happy reading ppls and all the best! <br /> <br /> Muawha!
