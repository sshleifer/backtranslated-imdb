I first saw it when I was a teenager in my senior year at Junior High. I was riveted to this! I loved the special effects, the fantastic places, the experimental method and the flashback method of telling the story. <br /> <br /> Several years later I read the book, and although it was interesting, I definitely could see what Swift was. trying to say, I think, while not as perfect as the book for social commentary, as a story, the movie is better. It makes more sense to have a long adventure than to have Gulliver returning after every trip and profiting by selling the tiny Lilliput sheep or whatever. <br /> <br /> It's much more interesting when everyone thinks he's crazy and sheep make a cameo anyway. As a side note, when I saw Laputa I was stunned. It looks a lot like the Kingdom of Zeal from the videogame Chrono Trigger (1995) that also made me like this miniseries even more. <br /> <br /> I saw her again about 4 years ago and realized that I still liked it so much. Really high quality material and started a great series of mini-series Sweeps for NBC that followed with the solid Merlin and the interesting Alice in Wonderland.
