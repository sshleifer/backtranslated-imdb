This was one of the best movies you could find as a child. I lived with The Chipmunk Adventure from 4 years to 8 years old. The story of this movie was: Dave is going on a business trip to Europe and punches the boys with Miss Miller. While playing in the video game Around the World in 80 Days, two villains, Klaus and Claudia (brother and sister), surround the Chipmunks and the Chipettes in an adventure in which children must make hot air balloons around the world. What they do not know is that the "game" is actually a diamond smuggling ring. And when found at the airport by the villains, there is a chase! And ending in Klaus and Claudia went to jail and Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor hold with Dave and Miss Miller. But I'm warning you now, this is a musical and very good at it. Most people hate music, but I'm not one of those people, I love musicians like Rocky Horror, Grease, Sound of Music, Cats Do not Dance, and just about anything (except My Fair Lady). If you see this, share it with your children (if you have any)!
