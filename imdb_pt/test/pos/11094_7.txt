In the movie "The Hawk and the Snowman", when they showed Christopher Boyce around the complex, the satellite in the background was the actual Ryholite satellite that is now in space. TRW allowed photos inside. TRW also allowed internal and external images of one of the original Star Trek TV series. (The episode is one in which Spock becomes blind when a sequence of satellite lights is activated to kill the aliens.) Christopher escaped from prison (Lompock) and was featured in America's Most Wanted. He was drinking in a bar when the show went on the air. He said, "Hey, it's me." Needless to say, he was captured and transferred to a maximum security prison.
