Many of us who are dedicated to the "art" of the film will disregard or forget that movies are also commercial ventures. Most of the time, they are too expensive to produce anything else. In view of this, it often seems like a miracle to me that really great ones are done from time to time. Once in a while, filmmakers go so far from budgeting in the making of a film that the entrepreneurs responsible for financing the company will be severely financially hurt and, of course, they will be very annoyed by it. I'd like to know exactly how this happens, which often took both the big studios and some big critics to "shoot" for the photo when it was finally released. Terrible expectations are generated and often what people expect to see clouds their perception of what they are seeing. <br /> <br /> You can see this phenomenon in action in the imperfect but magnificent '62 remake 0f 'Riot in the Bounty', and you can definitely see it in the reaction to "Heaven's Gate." Cimino took a long time and it cost a lot of money to United Artists to make that picture.The company was fatally wounded by its excesses and undoubtedly powerful people were out to see its reputation ruined forever when this strange and gigantic epic was finally released. like Stanley Kubrick, Cimino often prefers not to state the specific statement he is making with a particular scene, instead he draws so that the viewer feels as if he or she is living in the moment, allowing time for his own imagination to participate deeply in what is being presented. s do not react favorably to this approach. They want the story to move quickly and clearly and they easily become impatient and confused by this type of film. These factors undoubtedly contributed to the box office failure of "Heaven's Gate." <br /> <br /> By nature, a movie editor, I am deeply frustrated with two problems with this movie. Here and there, a scene is clearly too long and could easily have been trimmed without harming its effectiveness. Then we came to the huge battle scenes at the end of the photo. Where this is concerned, the clarity of the narrative is indeed damaged. If you liked the movie to the point where it occurs, your understanding of what is supposed to be happening will probably be uncertain and this is really frustrating. Not having seen all the raw images, I do not know whether actual re-filming would have been necessary, or whether some critical elements of the plot might have been clarified with a careful re-editing of a few moments. Given the time and money that have been poured into this picture, more care and thought should have been given to this problem. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, some occasional weak performances, some dialogue that does not sound true. , but these are really minor concerns. The reason why I am so disturbed by the problems mentioned above is that, like many of these days, I also feel that in all the "Gates of Heaven" it is so splendid to see and so magnificently deal with important historical, political and sociological issues that is just before a work of art. Despite its shortcomings, it's so dramatically and visually powerful that it's above most other Hollywood movies I've ever seen. I'd like to re-mix a lot of the sound. I would like to redirect and reprint the scene in which Ella is dead, but the grandeur of this image is such that these considerations really become trivial when compared to the value of total production. I must add that it should always be seen on a giant big screen to achieve the glorious effect it is so capable of delivering.
