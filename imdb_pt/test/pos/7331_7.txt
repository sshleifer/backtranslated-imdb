Flipper is a good movie for the whole family. Obviously not a great movie, Free Willy looks much better on almost every movie component. Possibly, sometimes, this becomes a bit naive, and writing and screenplay are not the best part of the film, but it's a fun movie with very good photography (including underwater photos) and some important moral messages. Elijah Wood proves himself once again as an incredibly talented and underrated actor. It can make a bad watchable movie, good movie - good, good - great and great movie becomes all the classic time. The performance of Paul Hogan was also very good and he is completely fit for his role. As I said above, the whole cinematography was very good. But underwater shots are definitely the best parts. So Flipper is a perfect way if you want to see a nice, sweet and fun movie. If you like me getting sick and tired of the modern garbage of Hollywood, full of sex, violence, vulgarity and profanity, you would probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7.7 out of 10.
