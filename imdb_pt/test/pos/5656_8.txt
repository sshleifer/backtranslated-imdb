This is undoubtedly the most harrowing black-and-white war movie I've ever seen; in fact, the only Western director during that time to remotely address his level of intensity and his absolute visceral power in his work was Samuel Fuller. By the way, I had watched a retrospective of Kon Ichikawa at the National Film Theater in London in September 2002, but could only get some of his work done between 1960 and 1973. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly so depressing as it is reputed to be; however, he also displays welcome touches of black humor - the "dead" man who wakes up to respond to a soldier who asks and promptly "dies" again, the sequence of shoe exchange deliciously ironic, a dying eccentric telling the hero hungry one that part of By chance, the script was written by a woman - Natto Wada, the director's own wife! <br /> <br /> Ichikawa is a versatile and prolific filmmaker whose reputation may not be as high as it was during his peak years (1956-65), but his direction here is often impressive - the astonishing sequence of pre- (the hero is violently reprimanded by his superior officer for being dismissed from the hospital sooner than expected!), the death of a Japanese handing himself over to an armed Filipino woman, the bombing of a hospital (with medical staff fleeing to save himself, leaving the wounded soldiers behind to crawl out of the shack at his own limited pace). marching in the rain of the disillusioned soldiers (who also involve the above mentioned business with shoes that actually resemble a similar scene in ALL THE FALL OF THE WESTERN FRONT [1930]), a hill full of bodies of soldiers trying to climb it , the end Certainly one of the film's main features is the stunning cinematography of the relentless and desolate muddy landscape. <br /> <br /> The film is notorious for treating the taboo of cannibalism (almost 10 years before it became a commodity). of horror movies), but Ichikawa's approach is not only subtle but highly effective: the meat is referred to as "monkey meat" while the hero is seen participating only once (and promptly spits the piece along with most of your decomposed teeth!); Conversely, when the fragile junior soldier (played by Mickey Curtis who, despite his name, was a Japanese pop idol of the time!) Is indignantly furious, the spot nearby is spattered with blood. In the supplements Ichikawa recalls that the protagonist of the Method Eiji Funakoshi (whose portrait is unforgettable, by the way) arrived at the set in the point of hunger - with the result that the production was forced to close for two weeks until let him recover! Donald Richie's insightful interview favors the film's nihilism over the underlying patriotism behind such a recent Hollywood rapture as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998). <br /> <br /> THE FIREPLACES ON PLAIN are universally regarded as one of his films. The principal efforts of the director, and among the various Ichikawa films I have seen, the closest in spirit are THE BURMESE HARP (1956, another character-driven but spiritually-oriented war film which is also available in Criterion DVD) and ENJO aka CONFLAGRATION (1958; which actually received a locally limited theatrical showing as part of a week of foreign films a few years ago). Personally, I also have a special crush on the director's stylized colorful extravaganza, AN ACTOR'S REVENGE (1963), which I already caught twice on the NFT in 1999 and the 2002 retrospective.
