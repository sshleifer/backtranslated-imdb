Ben Marshall, a teenager of religious background, is told about the financial situation at home by his domineering mother, Laura. She suggests that he find a temporary job to contribute to the family. In fact, the family took a widower to board with them. Robert Marshall, the father, is pastor of the local church; he preferred to be on the field watching birds than caring for the souls entrusted to his church. <br /> <br /> Ben's job is with an older actress, Evie Walton, who wants him to do things for her. around the house. "Lady" Evie, as she calls herself, is a woman of a certain age, whose career died perhaps because she was not so good. In fact, the only memorable apparition seems to be in a soap opera that was popular, but she preferred to forget it. Evie, who is a compulsive liar, tells Ben that she is dying, only to forget her properly, later, when she comes clean to the boy. <br /> <br /> Ben is obviously impressed by the personality bigger than the life of his employer. He's been taking driving lessons. Evie asks him to take a camping trip, which he does against his best judgment. He knows that this will provoke his mother's fury. Not content with this, Evie decides to go to Edinburgh, where she was invited to read at an arts festival. It is this journey that solidifies your bond. Ben gets to know and enjoy the pleasures of the flesh with a nice Bryony. <br /> <br /> When Ben returns, everything collapses at home. His mother, who has had an affair with a parishioner, decides to leave the family in favor of the young man with whom she is having an affair. Ben and Evie's relationship survives the test of time. He also begins to see his own father in a different light. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Brock, the writer of "Driving Lessons" and other memorable English films, makes his first directorial work with this engaging comedy. The mix of show business and religion, loyalty and friendship, are explored in their screen treatment, making it a fun moment in the cinema. We have seen the similar situation before, as in "Billy Elliott," where Julie Walters plays a loving role with a younger man. We read that the film was based on Mr. Brock's own experience while working with Lady Peggy Ashcroft when he was young. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, who plays Evie Walton, is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie. She always delivers. Walters is a welcome presence in any movie that she appears and does wonders with her faux "lady". Laura Linney, a bright player, does not get our sympathy for her icy mother. Rupert Grint, famous for his Harry Potter films, plays Ben, the young man who sees Evie as a kind soul. Nicholas Farrell is the betrayed father. Michelle Duncan has a small role in which she shines.
