A fascinating documentary of life about husband and wife and their marriage told by the eyes of their son. We all like to think that our parents lived happy lives, that their marriages were filled with joy, love, and memories. Unfortunately, many of us know that this is not the case with their own families and their parents. This wonderful documentary is told through the camera lens and emotional perspective of the son of a family who has just passed through the death of his mother. The son of a documentary filmmaker filmed his oldest family for many years, for he claims "posterity." Three months after his mother's death, his father remarries with his longtime secretary. The rapidity of this occurrence stuns the family and leads the child to dive into the past lives of his mother and father. What he reveals is a fascinating glimpse into the lives of two very ordinary people who, like many of their generations, got married early for the wrong reasons and found themselves trapped in a family life where they found they needed to "survive." A wife who sometimes saw herself bitterly lonely and unloved and a husband who buries himself in his work. She is intellectual in her heart, he is a much simpler individual who seems to find most of her pleasures in the quiet solitude of work. They are obviously wrong for each other, of course. However, they stand out, for what? Well, that's part of the mystery, they clearly show affection for each other sometimes, if not always much love. You will not find any truly shocking revelations here, other than infidelity on both sides, which, in large part, is what makes this jewel. You truly feel that these could be your own parents if the circumstances were different and in fact asks the life of your own parents a question.
