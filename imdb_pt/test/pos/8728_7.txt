Anyone who has ever doubted Ingrid Bergman's ability to play comedy just needs to look at "The Bells of St. Mary's." Okay, she's a nun with tuberculosis who's probably in love with the priest. O'Malley, (think what Luis Bunuel might have done with it), but she also demonstrated a wonderfully crafty sense of fun that made you wish the directors had put you into comedies more often. In "Cactus Flower," she is a starlet dentist nurse, (Walter Matthau is the dentist), in love with her boss, but keeping her buttoned. When she is forced to act as his "wife" to deceive her lover, (do not ask), she lets go and the buttons burst. And she is a joy to behold. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a tougher than usual translation for a successful Broadway screen, (you can see that it's three acts). It's a French farce, (it was originally taken from the play 'Fleur de Cactas' by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Gredy), and reaches all the right spots. Matthau uses his great expression with a wonderful effect and a blond newcomer, as it was then, called Goldie Hawn, almost steals the movie as the crazed lover who decides to give up his meal because he feels sorry for the "wife." even though "the wife" is having a ball. Hawn made such an impression on the paper that what she stole was the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
