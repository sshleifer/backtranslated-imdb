Years ago, when I first read The World According to John Irving's Garp, I was amazed that most of the younger adults I had contact with did not like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was something of age and experience. I tried a bit of déjà vu by reading some of the reviews on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Enjoying fully Separate Lies is certainly a matter of age and experience. In this movie, the viewer sees a seemingly upper middle class couple - he's a good lawyer - she's the perfect wife of a successful lawyer. They have a house in London and a house in the country. All is well until the "villain" enters under the guise of the richest man's son in the village. This guy seems to be an idiot for the word "Go". He scorns everyone and everything, including his own children. In the traditional form of legal guys who finish last, the lawyer's wife gets involved in a border case. You see that the lawyer is really a nice guy, but with the trait of killing a marriage of an organized perfectionist. Even though he really does love her, he's boring his wife to death. The bad boy is much more exciting. <br /> <br /> All this is entangled with the death of a man in the village, in which all the facts point to the fact that the pilot is the driver of the vehicle. <br /> <br /> It is easy to determine that this film does not build a happy ending, however, leads to a very satisfying ending in which the man and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and are likely to be able to lead their personal lives in a more successful way. <br /> <br /> Three excellent actors interpret the main characters of this film, and that's where the performances make it a pleasure to watch. Tom Wilkinson is perfect as a husband. His portrait shows us a gentle man who has so much control over his emotions that he has lost contact with the world. Emily Watson shows us a woman who got so caught up in the role of perfect wife that she almost lost her knowledge of passion. This passion is reborn by the character cleverly played by Rupert Everett. <br /> <br /> If you have reached this point in life that you understand that everyone has feet of clay and that everyone - even with the gifts of intelligence and Opportunities - makes many wrong decisions, then you will probably like watch these excellent actors creating the lives of three of these people. This is an adult movie beautifully portrayed and directed about realistic adults.
