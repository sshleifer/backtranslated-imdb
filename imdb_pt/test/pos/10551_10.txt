This is one of my favorite EVER movies ... I've seen it about a million times and would never refuse the opportunity to watch it again. In fact, I love it so much that I really wanted to see the resort where it was filmed on my next vacation ... does anyone know his name? If so, please send me an email !!! I watched this movie for the first time when it was first released and I was Nikki's age and for a long time I called my father to take me somewhere because of course I expected the same thing to happen to me! It's such an incredible setting and a love story so cute. This is a definite must for a DVD collector!
