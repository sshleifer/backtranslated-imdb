'In The Line Of Fire' tells the story of the game between a former presidential bodyguard and a former government assassin turned psychopath. The Secret Service Agent / Bodyguard (Eastwood) is on the defense and the killer (Malkovich) is in the attack. The bets? The president is alive. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie ... I've seen it several times on TV and recently bought it on DVD. However, it is not an excellent movie. The plot is very thin and the attempts to thicken are frankly ridiculous. The whole love story is not very plausible and the way they've brought an extra character into the story, just to be able to kill it, is a kind of insult to the more or less intelligent viewer. Although I find that these mistakes can not be forgiven, I can easily go through them for Mr. Malkovich's exquisite performance. I always thought he was a great actor, but in this movie he's really on fire. There is a reason why he received an Oscar nomination. Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were fine, but I do not consider their performance memorable. They are never in the best of their abilities. <br /> <br /> If you do not expect too much, you will surely like this movie. It's not a masterpiece, but John Malkovich is really extraordinary and I do not think anyone can enjoy his performance. It really worth the watch ...
