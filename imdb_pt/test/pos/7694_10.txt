I've always been a fan of this almost invisible footage of Gershwin's opera since I last saw it in 1959. As many of you know, it was not available on video or DVD; in fact, the Gershwin family sought to destroy all existing engravings. <br /> <br /> However, for some reason - hopefully signaling the end of their opposition, the Gershwin family recently approved the display of a copy of a collector at the Museum. of moving image in Astoria, Queens. <br /> <br /> Well, the Technicolor wide-screen printing was excellent! (Not perfect, but excellent.) The sound was excellent, in quality road-show stereo. People who saw this in their original version would not have seen a much better copy. (The program notes include the original Variety review, which warns that people can refuse the high price of $ 3.50!) <br /> <br /> And, as much as I liked it, PORGY AND BESS was better than I remembered. It's simply wonderful. Sidney Poitier as Porgy was at the point where his career was starting to catch fire, and his charisma shines. Dorothy Dandridge as Bess is spectacularly beautiful. Brock Peters as Crown is aggressively masculine. Pearl Bailey as Mary offers some comedic moments, although her role is small. And Sammy Davis, Jr., like Sporting Life, steals every scene he's in; he is especially fascinating in his two big numbers: "It's Not Necessarily So" and "There's a Boat That's Leaving to New York." (That last one got applause from the show I saw). <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS are connected, but it does not really matter when the set is as beautiful as this. The costumes are also excellent. <br /> <br /> The voices of Sidney and Dorothy are dubbed, but are dubbed very well. The exquisite "Summertime" is sung by Clara, played by the young Diahann Carroll; his singing is also dubbed. (Actually, only Pearl and Sammy make their own vocals.) <br /> <br /> The music is sublime, of course, but what struck me the most this time was the excitement that Preminger left the story. People were actually snorting in the audience several times - once when Bess sings that cute "I Loves You Porgy." And I got a kick from the audience, laughing loudly from the lines in "It Is not Necessarily So." Have they never heard this song before - or have they never heard? I believe that much of the emotional impact of this film is due to the performances of Poiter and Dandridge - you hope for your love to win. <br /> <br /> A minor complaint with the 136-minute length - one or two slow slots and a stereotyped kind of Amos-n-Andy scene about Bess having seen a divorce lawyer divorce from Crown, even though she nor be married to him. (I would have cut it.) And the beginning is a bit confusing - both characters are introduced awkwardly - they are part of the movie before you know who they are. <br /> <br /> And I do not think Preminger used a single close-up in the whole movie. Everything seems to be filmed in 3/4, which I think was his way of working with the wide screen. <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS has always been a cult movie for those of us who saw it, for those of us who love the soundtrack, and for some of us who have only heard about it. Let's hope they find a way to relaunch this and put it on DVD. He deserves the widest possible audience.
