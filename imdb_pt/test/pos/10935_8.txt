A revisionist and unusual western, which is worth noting. Despite a slow start, the movie builds? with almost no dialogue and no captions ?? a portrait of the almost enveloping and intense, almost existential life in the hostile environment of the Western Desert. The growth of the main characters is worth waiting for, and the strong central cast brings a real sense of desperation to the struggle for possession of the all-important horse. How interesting that this was done by a British director. I hope he is smiling now: I have the impression that the film was largely ignored by contemporaries; but time works its usual alchemy, and the hidden gold shines as it inevitably ought. One note caught my attention: revisionism is only taken so far. Sam Waterston as an Indian? - Granted he does his part with real excitement and intensity, but really, could not an American Indian actor be found to do the job? But her scenes with Caroline Langrishe have an intimacy that contrasts very well with the immense landscape around her. <br /> <br /> Forget the great versions of Hollywood's past, men with big chins and hectic music; this is all about a primitive struggle between the protagonists who, stripped of all the trappings of "ordinary" life, come to understand why it is worth fighting. Impressive.
