I think this is a very good movie, but one thing makes it very interesting for me. It's blatantly obvious when you look out: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bullies of The Simpsons. Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney and Tony is Dolph. There is even an episode of The Simpsons where Jimbo uses the line "I poked her with a stick". <br /> <br /> The Jimbo-Layne connection is most obvious with the knit hat, long hair and voice. Kearney has a shaved head, unlike John, but he's the big one and ass. The connection with Tony-Dolph is quite obvious, with the long haircut and second-level status.
