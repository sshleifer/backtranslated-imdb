This is the classic case of an excellent movie being seen by the American public simply because it does not have Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenneger as the protagonist - Adrian Quinn does a better double performance, that is even though you have heard performance in this film than any one of them has already had success in their careers! Well, anyway, now for review ... <br /> <br /> The Task is loosely based on the story of Carlos Chacal, a radical of the 1970s who terrorized Europe for years before being finally apprehended by agents French. In this adaptation, a US Navy officer (Adrian Quinn) is off duty in Israel when he is arrested by Mossad (Isreal crack crack counterintelligence and intelligence agency) and questioned because he looks EXACTLY like the jackal. is the extremely stuffed part of the film, but believe it does not detract from the great value of this film). When it is discovered that Ramirez is not the Jackal, however, he is recruited by a CIA agent named Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, who does his usual and mysterious routine of governmental authority, but in a terrific way). spent a lifetime chasing the Jackal, and the series of events that follow will captivate anyone watching this movie - it is packed with great performances, without all the clich√©s and common action phrases, and a great plot that will amaze anyone. . The top three men - Quinn, Sutherland and Kingsley - take this film a lot further than their modest budget would have allowed with anyone else filling their shoes. Also commending the director and his staff, the camera angles and cinematography are top notch, especially in the action scenes. The task is better than anyone you can expect, it's a shame that the movie has performed poorly at the box office, otherwise we may see a sequel to this stupendous espionage thriller. <br /> <br /> 9/10 stars, this reviewer HIGHLY commends all potential viewers!
