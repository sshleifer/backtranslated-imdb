The funniest British movie I've ever seen, "The Supergrass" is a tale of sex, drugs, teas, and seaside murders. Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmonson), a common idiot, wants to impress his longtime girlfriend, Andrea (Dawn French), because she thinks he is very respectful of the law. So to get her to accompany you on a romantic getaway, he creates a scheme that might impress you and entice you to spend some time with him. The problem is that Dennis's lie is that he somehow got involved with an international ring of drugs and, while telling her, some cops listen to his ostentation and tell him. And so begins this witty movie, full of comedy and gross jokes. Dennis is beaten on the spot, and to the great apprehension of the officers, there seems to be no way out (Andrea's earlier attempts to explain that everything was a lie were dismissed by a hilarious melody of "Stand by Your Man"). by the two officers'). Next comes Commander Robertson (Ronald Allen), Chief of Intelligence, Scotland Yard. He makes a deal with Dennis, that if he helps pick up the drug dealers, then he will be released and allowed what he wants. Dennis agrees and joins Harvey Duncan (Peter Richardson) and Lesley Reynolds (Jennifer Saunders). The rest is an unforgettable experience, with Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Troy adding comic color to the film. His walk along the dry harbor against "Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Two Tribes" is superb and probably the best scene in movie history. The two officers who are nicknamed Dennis are wonderfully played by Michael Elphick and Patrick Durkin, and Alexei Sayle as the motorcycle cop is a laugh! If you want something good to watch on a Saturday night, then I suggest you rent it. You will not forget!
