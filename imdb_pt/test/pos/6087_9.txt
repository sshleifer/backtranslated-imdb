'The English Patient' may be rightly compared to David Lean's films whose storylines such as 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Bridge on the River Kwai' must have inspired director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed and, like "Lawrence", is set in North Africa, but during World War II. The story is complex but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas. <br /> <br /> The story, based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is told in flashbacks by Count Laszlo de Almasy of Fiennes - the titular character. The fact that his name does not sound like he is English plays a fundamental role in what is unfolding. He was badly burned in a plane crash, occurring exactly when the film opens, and is being cared for in Europe by Hana, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this epic story is the sweeping sweep of place and time, and the development of characters beyond the two ill-fated lovers. The film makes clear that true love and passion, even with terrible consequences, can make life worth living or worth dying for. If you have a romantic heart and can enjoy a movie without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes, you may find that "The English Patient" speaks directly to you. <br /> <br />
