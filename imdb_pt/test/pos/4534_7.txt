I do not think I have much to add. I found the comedy even funnier after more than ten years since she left. <br /> <br /> The only thing I noticed was that the music during the dialogue was a distraction and often made the movie a lot should have been. The use of songs is good during the movie, but the background of the orchestra is very busy, very artificial and if the movie were edited for DVD, I would seriously recommend that the background music be reduced to an almost inaudible level. He devalued the overall feel of the whole movie and I can see subconsciously why so many people went through it. <br /> <br /> The film had several levels working on screenplay, plot and comedy. level. It's a shame that the producer and director felt they needed the musical rhythm to improve the mood. Now knowing this, I find it difficult to watch and silently curse who was involved with the music edition in the film. It had all the subtlety of a jackhammer.
