36. THE HOSPITAL (comedy, 1971) A series of emergencies took over Manhattan Hospital. Patients are dying left and right due to overcrowding conditions and an inept team. When a resident doctor is caught up in the death count, the chief coroner, Dr. Bock (George C. Scott), is called to investigate. Having worked as a doctor for many years and going through a crisis of his own life, Dr. Bock finds it difficult. He decides to commit suicide. But then he meets Barbara (Diana Rigg), a young hippie. Whose deep insights into life help the depressed Bock. <br /> <br /> Criticism: The comedy of dark humor features a tour-de-force performance of veteran actor George C. Scott. He is good at playing serious, rigid characters whose strict morals are severely tested. The first half of the movie unfolds like a melodrama, giving a good account of the hospital life and the chaos that sometimes are. But then, when things seem to be about to reach a dramatic climax, it turns into slapstick comedy. If Paddy Chayefsky's script maintained its dramatic feel, I wonder if Scott would have come out with another Oscar for best actor (he had already won, in absentia, the previous year). His (suicidal) collapse scene is one of the deepest and most real in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> QUOTE: Dr. Bock: "... Last night I sat in my hotel room reviewing the chaos of my life." life and contemplating suicide I said 'no Bock do not do this You're a doctor, a healer, you're a necessary person, your life is meaningful' So ... I discover that one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses ... how can I sustain my sense of meaning in this?
