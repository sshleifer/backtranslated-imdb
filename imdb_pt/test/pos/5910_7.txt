Everyone knows that Lindburgh got the first transatlantic flight. So how can there be any suspense or intrigue in this movie? Well, there is. Do not ask me how, but it does exist. Partly because the director has told the story, but mainly because of Jimmy Stewart's engaging performance, we are drawn to the story as if it were unfolding for the first time before our eyes. Despite the fact that half the film is filmed in a tight cockpit, it is as dynamic as any flick action out there. So if you're anxious to see this movie because you think you already know the story, try. I think you'll be impressed.
