It was recorded that John Ford made the "big blockbuster movies" to be able to make the "small" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best if not the best of his little films. The filming location, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the Indian plains are trademarks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great influence of the Russian director is seen in this film. The supporting cast, including Ward Bond, Russell Simpson and Jane Darwell, are excellent, as are the many supporting actors Ford has used, including his brother (the drummer). While Ben Johnson won the well-deserved Oscar in support of The Last Picture Show, Harry Carey, Jr. did not reach those heights. Although his father, Carey, father had become one of the western protagonists in Ford's first films, Carey Jr. spent most of his career in supporting roles. For fans of John Ford, and for fans of Western movies, this is a must.
