I agree with the posters before the characters were exceptionally strong and believable and all the actors at their best. I particularly loved David Boreanaz stretching into such a different part from anything else he touched by proving once again his incredible gift for comedy. The first part of the film was light and funny, the blackmail part was a bit surreal but interesting - and it was all downhill from there. <br /> <br /> I found it frustrating that at least two of the three girls (Keira and Lisa) get out of blackmail and betrayal without a trace in their psyche. I know the movie changed the darkest ending of the play - and I'm not saying I missed the murder part. But I certainly needed to see those two getting their punishment somehow and I was moaning in frustration at the end. (That's why I gave only 9) <br /> <br /> But definitely an interesting movie.
