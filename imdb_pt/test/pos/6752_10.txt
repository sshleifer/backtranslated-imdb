The mascot is the masterpiece of Ladislaw Starewicz. It tells the story of a plush dog looking for an orange after he hears his mother telling her daughter that she has no money. The dog is chosen with other toys to be sold. In the truck, after the others jump as the vehicle runs, the dog stays and waits to be picked up at the store before leaving alone. He can turn orange after biting the woman's leg while she was holding and selling the fruit. As he runs, he finds the devil and accepts his offer to stop at the nightclub. There, he finds the other toys that jumped from the truck. The cat next to him in the vehicle is especially determined to get the dog's orange. I'm going to stop here to mention that other wonderfully bizarre things happen at the nightclub that you'll have to see for yourself. Suffice it to say that if you love Starewicz and are interested in all the animations of the past, I would definitely recommend you look for this!
