"Manna From Heaven" is a delightfully convincing film. <br /> <br /> Within the fickle paradox of values ​​in middle-class Americans from 40 years ago to the present day, the plot adjusts the concerns and hopes of an interesting range of 'Damon Runyonesque' characters. His struggles with moral dilemmas, punctuating "what could have been," in the hope of still fulfilling youthful dreams, romantic yearnings and "great success" combine to make a more entertaining film. Instead of relying on "in-your-face" sexual explicitness, the burgeoning relationship between Inez and Mac / Bake is classically subtle, but clear. Untying the knot in the lace at the Art Gallery and his warmth in his poker game is excellent. <br /> <br /> The script's clear writing is cleverly played by an excellent star and supporting cast. One of the few films I've seen twice in its debut, 'Manna From Heaven' definitely guarantees national distribution. <br /> Conrad F. Toepfer
