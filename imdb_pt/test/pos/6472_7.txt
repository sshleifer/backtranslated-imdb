Knute Rockne has led an extraordinary life and his story is told very well in Knute Rockne All American. We followed Rockne's incredible journey from the young Norwegian to the iconic American football legend. Produced in 1940, the film can sometimes seem like a dated touch and sometimes downright cheesy. And the filmmakers put things a little thick, sometimes, as Rockne is portrayed brightly and affectionately. You may leave thinking that Rockne should have been appointed to holiness, when in fact he was, after all, just a football coach. But it is undeniable that he had a great impact on the football game, in addition to having a tremendous impact on the lives of many of the youngsters he trained. This film shows the great impact he had and gives you an idea of ​​why he is so revered to this day. <br /> <br /> Touching Rockne, Pat O'Brien has an impressive performance. It's unquestionably O'Brien's film to take and he makes the film and his character. Rockne's real life has been recognized as a great inspiring figure and O'Brien's performance will make you understand why. The only complaint comes early in the film when O'Brien, in his mid-teens, is playing college student Rockne in his early twenties. All the makeup in the world would not make this believable and the effect is quite shocking. But as the character Rockne ages and begins his legendary coaching career, O'Brien fits in perfectly. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, a name jumps and it is clear that Ronald Reagan plays the young, charismatic but ultimately doomed football star George Gipp. In the big scheme of the film is not really a big part, with Reagan appearing for no more than 10-15 minutes. But the performance became legendary thanks to Reagan's famous "Win a Ripper" speech on the deathbed. It's a brilliantly played scene, full of emotion. Reagan may not have been onscreen for a long time in this film, but he certainly made a tremendous positive impact on a winning performance. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film strikes a balance between football and life in general with Rockne having great lessons for his youngsters in both areas. For football fans (and history buffs), there is a rare surprise, as the actual filming of archives of the games of Notre Dame of the Rockne era are interspersed throughout the film. It's a rare opportunity to see how the game has evolved over the past six decades and an opportunity to see Rockne's legendary strategic innovations put into practice. If you're a fan of Notre Dame, you'll probably like the fact that Notre Dame Victory March offers a seemingly constant soundtrack to the film. If you're a Notre Dame hater ... well then you probably are not watching this movie anyway. Knute Rockne All American is an inspiring, uplifting and emotional film. Maybe a bit overly sentimental, but that's not such a bad thing. It's a very nice film, it's worth a look.
