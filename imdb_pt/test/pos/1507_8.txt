In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the decline and death of independent video companies such as Vestron and Media effectively isolated Italian horror movies for much of the American public. Coincidentally (?) Italian genre films have also fallen in quality and profitability. Occasionally, films like Primal Rage, "sequences" like Beyond The Door III, Troll 2 and some films of Dario Argento stamped on video. but most remained unreleased (until the DVD) in the US for almost a decade or more. The films of these lost years have become much sought after and talked about among horror fans. <br /> <br /> Of these films, Cat In The Brain is probably one of the most sensationalists of all due to the legions of Lucius Fulci fans and the fact that he was not only directed by but also starred in his idol, Fulci. <br /> <br /> Although not the best of Fulci, it is still better than most of his later efforts. Your fan base fan base is probably going to love it. Italian horror and giallo aficionados may also like it, depending on their tastes, but I'm not sure about anyone else. People who only watch Hollywood may not want to take the word out of the many brilliant reviews here. <br /> <br /> One thing I personally found fascinating was the scenes depicting probably the only lasting contribution of Benito Mussolini to Italy, Cinecitta Studios. The name is instantly recognizable to any fan of Italian films. Until I saw it here, I could only imagine what it looked like.
