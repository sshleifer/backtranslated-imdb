Considering that this movie was released eight years before I was born, I do not feel very badly for having seen it for so long. In January of 1998, however, I attended the Second Annual Quentin Tarantino Film Festival, held in Austin, Texas. The particular theme of the movies tonight was "Neglected 70's Crime Films" and the boy was his right. "The Gravy Train (or The Dion Brothers, as this print appeared)" was an absolute gem. Wonderful performances, quirky characters, clever plot, hilarious comedy, and just a great time around. Rarely do you see a crime movie that is so fun and cool. Margot Kidder in one of her first appearances in movies is extremely sexy as well. I hope some cable network gets this movie and lets many more see it. Meanwhile, go to an indie video store and hope they have.
