I must admit, when I first started watching this movie I had no idea what was going on. So the beginning was a bit confusing for me. However, this did not diminish my enjoyment of the film. The characters turn out to be more complex than they may first appear, and that's what makes this a memorable movie. At first I heard it was a real Hollywood movie. While obviously lacking the stereotypical element of "guns and fists," the compelling performances of such talented actors as Martin Sheen and Sam Neill more than make up for it. I'd rather see a movie with more substance than shooting any day.
