Since Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern English poetry, I expected a film that was prone to a hagiography of the subject. On the contrary, the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, a bad father, a liar and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward. Of course one might argue that all these things are an advantage when one is an artist and especially a poet, since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality, but still do not think that a positive model of such a beam of personality traits. Anyway, I met the other male hero in the story, Captain Cillic, a more captivating character. The two female roles were played by the actresses Knigtley and Miller and were really charming, especially the first when she sang songs in fine clothes to inspire Londoners bombed during World War II. Another positive point is the role that sexual jealousy plays even in relatively progressive media that think that older conventions can easily be overcome. The Blitz atmosphere was also compelling, as was the portrait of the distinct perspectives among people who experienced war. unlike those who talk about it theorizing about their possible political outcomes. I think one would recommend such a movie.
