Absolutely one of the 10 best music films ever! A totally essential educational experience for any music fanatic - Especially young rock / punk fans today ... understanding the beginning of any "artistic" movement requires an understanding of the roots of music as well as the mentality and musical environment of music. times ... not to mention the political and social factors involved at the time. And besides all this, this documentary is an F-N rock-n-roll !! Do not miss it !!! That said, can anyone tell me when, if ever, "the decline of Western civilization" ... part 1, (not part 2, the metal version) will be made available again ... hopefully on DVD?
