It often happens, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a young man. Not only does it last a lifetime, but it inspires you to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled "The Egyptian". The audience was impressed by the sets, costumes and great performance of this film, so much so, other movies soon followed in vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian who was left father less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not difficult to imagine why he will spend his life asking questions. The Sinuhe boy, who means "The One Who Is Alone" (Edmund Purdom) grows into adulthood and continues to ask why, even when he graduates from the School of Life to become a doctor. During his formative years he acquires a lifelong friend named Kapta brilliantly played by (Peter Ustinov), and Horemheb (Victor Mature), who rises from a simple guardian officer to the Commander of the Armies. His life offers everything from a rapid growth in social status to a condemned criminal, an exiled healer, and eventually a life station he never expected. Fine acting goes to Jean Simmons as Merit, Michael Wilding as Akhnaton, Bella Darvi as the seducer, Nefer and John Carradine as a memorable Grave Thief. Tommy Rettig, plays Thoth, the son of the Egyptian. In his later years, "The One Who Is Alone," he finally discovers the response he has sought throughout his life, which begs his son, now in the care of his longtime friend. Great Movie! ****
