Although I have seen this film in Korea, in Korean, and therefore have not understood the language, the images certainly say more than enough. From what I have been able to do, this is the story: two superb swordsmen become friends in their service as guards of the king. One of them finds himself opposed to the ways of the king and begins to assassinate important men. The other has to hunt him down. This movie is visually great. Sword fighting is great. And the film has an exciting ending. I just hope this movie is marketed to Western movie goers. And be released on DVD, of course.
