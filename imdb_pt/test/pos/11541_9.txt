I will put this as clearly as possible for those who do not know the legacy of Bill Hicks. He was simply the greatest stand-up comedian in the world, almost certainly in my opinion the largest that ever existed (his stand-up idol is the great Richard Pryor, whose battles with addiction he paralleled). His death in 1994 was barely noticeable in the mass media, only weeks after Kurt Cobain committed suicide. His tragic death at such a young age overshadows any sense of injustice that he was criminally ignored during his lifetime, of course. But the hard truth is as clear as the day: no one came to claim his robe. There is not a comedian alive with almost skill and invention. <br /> <br /> The remark is made in the affectionate tribute 'It's Just a Ride' that stand-up comedians often see work as a step stone-rich pursuits - lame movies and sitcoms of moral behavior, made to occupy - but never enrich - the life of an unimaginative public. That's all Bill Hicks said against. His sermon has always been a war cry for people to think for themselves, to scrutinize authority, to unite as a race. <br /> <br /> His appeal continues to grow with each passing year since his death. Your star will continue to shine long after so many smaller lights have gone out. Once you have been exposed to your brilliant, intelligent, but ultimately compassionate, you will be enriched and rewarded. The man himself liked to quote Dylan: "To live out of the law you must be honest," he said. Bill Hicks was honest, moreover, he was the funniest of them all.
