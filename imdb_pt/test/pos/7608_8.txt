Of course, seasoned reviewers who like things like Star Wars and crap will definitely drag this movie and say very bad comments about it. But, in fact, it's a nice teen comedy, with an incredible story and good acting. <br /> <br /> Josie Gellar (played by Drew Barrymore) is on a reporting team and has received a 'job offer' - she has to go back to school and find out how teenagers are nowadays. Well, that goes well, until Josie remembers her horrible time at school and gets scared. But it was never cool, never cool, never popular so far! <br /> <br /> Sit back relax and enjoy with Never Been Kissed! <br /> <br />
