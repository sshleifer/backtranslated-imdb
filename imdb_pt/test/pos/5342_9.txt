Wallace and Gromit have been around for some time, but this was their first foray into the silver screen. Fans of the British TV series, like me, were eager to see them and the film did very well in theaters. Much of the reason is that the film is fun and quite original. In a world of computer graphics such as SHREK and TOY STORY, this stop motion movie is a good alternative to the trend of children's films, as well as being totally different from a cartoon. In addition, compared to older stop-motion films (such as KING KONG and Ray Harryhausen as SINBAD), the characters' quality and movement are better in light years - very fluid, natural and more vivid. <Br/> <br /> In addition to the quality of the animation, this film also deserves praise on all other levels. First, the voice actors do a great job. Secondly, the script is very simple, but also very cute and pleasant - with a few connections that should probably go beyond the children's heads. Third, they can make it not just a kid's movie, but people of all ages, since the film is neither saccharine nor aimed only at younger audiences. In particular, I was captivated by the incredibly cute that the movie was - and especially by the adorable bunnies. I especially liked them on the final credits - which made me very happy that I stayed to watch the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The main point is that, unless you're a real dick, you'll enjoy this movie. It's fresh, fun and incredibly clever. I expect to see a sequel - and that's saying something, since I usually hate sequences.
