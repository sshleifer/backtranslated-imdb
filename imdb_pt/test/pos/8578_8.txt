I love this movie. There is something for everyone. It's funny, sad, passionate and dramatic. The mixing of two completely different cultures creates a whole new world that the viewer can not help wanting to be part of. I must admit that I am slightly biased, since Colin Firth is my favorite actor and so nothing he does is wrong in my eyes (!), But in this film his tremendous talent in acting is apparent and is further enhanced by the beautiful performance of his co-star Nia Long. The problems his love affair makes ironically more believable and the simple features, such as the contrast between the colors of Matthew and Nimi's clothes, make this film even more charming. I challenge anyone who can not be moved by that story. I find that charming and watched at least ten times since I bought the movie a week ago!
