The only reason I decided to see this movie is because of the great acting talents of Karen Sillas, (Alyson Haywood), "Bad Money", 99, who is deeply involved with Gary Cole, (Dave), "Cry Wolf" , '05, who is a great war hero and has all sorts of ways to make money and never seems to stop telling LIES. Alyson and Dave are trying to rebuild an old house and restore it to comfortable living conditions. The relationship becomes problematic and Alyson decides to find out what is happening and the plot becomes very mysterious. If you are a big fan of Karen Sillas, this is the movie for you. I just wanted Karen to appear in more movies, I miss her great talents.
