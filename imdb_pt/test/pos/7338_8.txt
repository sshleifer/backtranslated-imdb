"The Gymnast" unfolds in short scenes and short scenes, revealing their characters and messages over time. The spare edition is accompanied by a simple and beautiful score. This intimate approach is wonderful to feel that you're on the path to discovery just as much as the characters. <br /> <br /> The overhead approach is also its disadvantage; There are some scenes that are confusing because they do not have enough context. There are some decisions made by the characters that seemed to go by until they saw the interviews that were on the bonus materials. I'm glad I did, because the actors' descriptions of their motivations gave me a much more complete understanding of the film in general. <br /> <br /> Beyond the story itself, it was wonderful to see women so comfortable and strong in their own bodies. The shooting was done with great taste; very trivial. You have the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfolding, not a voyeur film. The athletes' physicality - their reality - is a stark contrast to the sometimes ethereal nature of the plot. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie that I'll need to see again so soon, since the plot is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time.
