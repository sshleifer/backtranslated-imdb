This is a very solid Western Randolph Scott. He plays Bat Masterson and goes to Liberal, Kansas, to clear the city. He becomes a good friend of Robert Ryan, who played a very prominent role. It was only after that that Robert Ryan began to play much darker roles. In fact, in 1947, Randolph Scott made another film that was not Western and never did anything other than Western after that, until retiring in 1962. This film has a good rhythm and steadily rises to climax. I can not say more because it would set the storyline. Do not miss this one. 8/10
