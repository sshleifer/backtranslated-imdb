I saw this movie for the first time about 3 years ago. I was shocked at how stupid the FBI was not to avoid such a tragedy. It could have been easily avoided. This movie was unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Now, after September 11, I am shocked and I can say that this could have been avoided more easily than most people would like to know. <br /> <br /> This movie is 100% true. <br /> <br /> In the final scene of the movie, when the mentor of the 1st attack is being taken to jail by helicopter and flying over the towers, he makes a remark chilling, which was ridiculed when he said it. "Next time we'll bring them down." This was said by Ramzi Yousef after his arrest. <br /> <br /> This film reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were performed under the noses of the FBI and the NYPD. It shows how the 1st and 4th Amendments are partly responsible for the attacks. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie now and know that both attacks could have been avoided.
