MICHAEL, 1996, is a warm and winning fantasy comedy that features one of my favorite performances from the John Travolta library. Travolta gives one of his more enjoyable and enjoyable performances as Michael, an archangel whose quiet existence at the home of a lonely innkeeper named Pansy (Jean Stapleton) is interrupted when Pansy reports Michael's presence at his home to a newspaper "National Enquirer." and the editor (Bob Hoskins) sends reporters (William Hurt, Andie McDowell, Robert Pastorelli) to the motel to take a look. Hurt, McDowell and Pastorelli are very good as bored journalists who have a hard time accepting that they have found an angel, but this is Travolta's show and he rules like the potbellied, sugar eater, smelling of biscuit and pie. loving, loving Aretha, chasing bulls Michael, an angel who simply is not what you think when you think of angels. And you have to love the scene in the bar when he and the ladies dance to "Chain of Fools". I love this movie more and more every time I watch and it's mostly because of John Travolta's completely winning performance.
