Well, the film is basically about the last days of a specific Russian regiment stationed in Afghansitan before the main troop was withdrawn in 1985. The film accurately portrays the gloomy realities of the Russian army that made it infamous: "dedovshina" (officers and NCOs (you can negotiate with your enemy one day and kill you in the next), life of women on the front lines, documentary footage of helicopter robberies and coffins being soldiers and sent home in heave C-130 Hercules class Russian cargo planes with tracer to bog down Stinger missiles, fatigue, boredom, anti-war sentiment, emotional side simply put. There are some action scenes, but they are poorly made, and often illogical, like Major Bandura's suicidal walk and the back of a 10-year-old kid armed with AK-47, the father he just killed . Also the fact that in the middle of the gunfight in the heavy grenade launcher appears out of nowhere (and anyone half bright knows that it is practically impossible to walk 40-50 lns launcher anyone). But at the same time, movies show that war is a dirty affair, where murder is sometimes forgiven, the arbitrary destruction of entire villages for little or no reason is normal, the indiscriminate killing of civilians is neglected as an inevitable collateral damage during the war ... to think why the war in Afghanistan lost. Not the best war movie ever made, but deep and clever enough to be worth watching.
