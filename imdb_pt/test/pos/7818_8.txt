A lovely film reinforced by the musical and vocal background, especially during the competition. My understanding is that there was never a soundtrack, but you could, through your sources, tell me where I could get information about the singer and the likelihood of getting a copy of the song he sang. Your help would be appreciated. The music really touched me and my wife and we would like to secure a copy whenever possible, so that we could play as background music when we have our family and friends for our "Italian Nights". If you are able to get this information for us, we would be eternally grateful. Even if you can advise on the contact of the studio so we can go straight. <br /> <br /> Regards, John Payling
