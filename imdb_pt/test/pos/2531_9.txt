This was really a "nightmare" of a movie; I saw about nine years ago on cable TV and I have not forgotten that since. Pixote is a 10 year old boy who lives in the streets of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil) and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends Lilica, Dito and Chico; they rob, pimp, sell drugs and murder to survive each day ... In the first half of the movie Pixote is caught by the police and sent to a sadistic foster home where he witnesses all kinds of abuse of the older prisoners and guard for the rest of children; one night, Lilica's boyfriend is killed after a beating, so Pixote and his friends decide to escape during a riot. The rest of the film shows Pixote's descent into a criminal life; he shows no feeling or remorse after killing someone, perhaps because he knows that good feelings are of no use in the world in which he lives ... But there is, however, a gentle scene in the middle of the film; Pixote and his friends are on the beach, missing (and wishing) one of their reform school friends to be there. I thought it was a poetic and melancholic scene in the midst of all these horrible events ... the boys are obviously yearning not just for their friend, but for a better life. "Pixote" by director Hector Babenco is a brave and depressing film that does not avoid showing the harshest reality that many people - including me - tend to ignore or misunderstand. This movie will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person.
