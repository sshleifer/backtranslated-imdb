The title comes from a change that a teenage recluse in a correctional facility does on the front cover of his government book titled "The United States"; it adds "(your name)". Many characterizations in this film work well - scenes between Leland (Ryan Gosling) and Becky (Jena Malone), Pearl (Don Cheadle) and father Fitzgerald (Spacey), as well as with Leland, Becky and sister Julie (Michelle Williams), among many others. <br /> <br /> But the central thread of this film - the fulcrum on which everything stands - is Leland's character and motives. He is a somewhat shy, passive, and friendly high school student who boldly introduces himself to Becky whom we (we think) is going to an alternative school because of a past history of drug problems. In Becky's family, she has a sister, Julie, who has just graduated from high school and prepares to go to college; Julie's boyfriend, Julie's age (and whose parents had recently died) is also living with them. <br /> <br /> Leland lives with his mother; his father (Kevin Spacey) and his mother have long since divorced and his father is a famous novelist. Leland is very perceptive. The boy in "The Sixth Sense" saw dead people; Leland sees teenage lovers and acknowledges that years later they will divorce, that pain will accompany the current experience of happiness of many people. BUT, for reasons that are never made explicit, your prescient gift seems to work sometimes for some people, some relationships, not for others. ??? Parts of the film look a bit like a quilt derived from "American Beauty," "The Sixth Sense," "The Graduate," and possibly others I did not. to recognize. That would not be bad if only Leland's character worked. <br /> <br /> I think Gosling did a great job playing Leland, but the script and the story imposed limitations. Would a young man so meditative and observant be a murderer? Even for altruistic reasons? Nothing in the movie gives a reason for this. I am a retired therapist with a lot of experience working with families and teenagers; while many of the reactions shown in the film work - this part, this most essential element certainly does not. <br /> <br /> And there is at least one other element that, in my experience, would not fit the real. life, although it is not so critical. The reason for the differences between the sisters, Becky and Julie, are never hinted at, but okay. Once two siblings begin to take on different roles (one is the good girl, the other is troublesome), the roles themselves may begin to lead one another to more extreme positions. For the problematic, Becky, it's kind of "what do I have to do to be loved around here - give up being me and become Julie?" And the pressure to become the All-Good child, which appeals to parents, is no less intense in Julie. So why would she break up with her longtime boyfriend and whom her parents obviously approve of? Don Cheadle was good as Leland's teacher; all others were good in their parts. 98% of the scenes were good. What was missing was that crucial slip in the understanding of human nature. <br /> <br /> Good acting; history and psychology; Worth seeing; not a total loss.
