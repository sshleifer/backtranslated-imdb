Over the years, I have watched this movie many times on seeing it on "HBO" and now I have a DVD copy. I must say it is very memorable and fun, though it is interesting and educational as well. As any TV fan can relate to the era of the early 90's, when it came time to replace Johhny Carson, the living legend of "The Tonight Show" TV, who will be Jay or Dave? This original HBO movie "The Late Shift" remains true to form and depicts the actual events showing very well the backstage battle between the heads of networks of NBC and CBS and even of ABC, they were all fighting for the services of Jay and Dave. The acting makes it look real, since very few actual TV images are shown with real-life people, while the actors who play Leno and Letterman make it look real. I did not read Bill Carter's book, so I do not know if he stayed true to the pages, but I really enjoyed this movie over the years. From the moment it begins to show CBS entertainment heads watching Leno sub to Johhny and they decide they want to get into the game late at night. However, when Carson announces his unexpected retirement, NBC wants to remain loyal to Leno, but the conflict comes when Letterman also wants a breakthrough in the industry at 11:30. It was fun to watch the crazy meeting with Michael Ovitz (Treat Williams), which makes all networks want to consider Letterman for a show. It was interesting to see the Johhny scene telling Letterman on the phone in a direct way to get off NBC and consider CBS. And by the way, Rich Little was great like Johhny Carson, his portrait could not be matched. And many tense moments were provided, showing the fight and the resignation of Leno's talent manager, Helen, whom NBC pressed him to do. Overall, a great movie that showed how the TV really is and proves that the networks are loaded with energy and money, while demonstrating that it is a cruel business. Clearly there is no business like show business. Very memorable HBO great work and a watch whenever it showed the true story of the wars of the dawn.
