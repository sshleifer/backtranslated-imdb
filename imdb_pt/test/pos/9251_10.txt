Although there were some tough spots and some plot lines that were not exactly true to the character, this was the classic H: LOTS. The characters, outside Mike Giardello, were true to form, and the meeting scenes of Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as deep and well-represented as anything to spruce up the little canvas. "Homicide: The Movie", also known as "Life Everlasting", is a fan film, but it stands alone, just like any 2-hour episode of the series. Fontana, Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a wonderful job of pulling the loose ends of 7 seasons and all the top cast members of "the best television show" together for the finale of the series that NBC never bothered to give. True to the form of "Homicide," there were no happy endings, such is life. That's what has always set this show apart from the stupid cop who cuts cookies on television. Congratulations to writers and cast for creating something throughout the series period and the film that challenged viewers and producers. <br /> <br /> I call myself "Homicidal Maniac" if it is not more than anyone else. reason to keep my co-workers in a cooperative climate. **
