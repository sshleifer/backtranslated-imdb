Another decent offer from Vince Gilligan's pen. A prequel to "Malcolm in the Middle" by Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Crump, a troubled man who eventually steals Mulder with a gun and takes him west at high speed. . It has something to do with your strong touch on the head (& possible deadly combustion - your wife has just tried it), and the pressure only seems to ease off heading to the left shore. Only Mulder could relate to this guy's situation, and actually join his captor before the night journey is completed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Scully seems to have settled the case with a possible remedy for Crump, and will find them in the ocean. Check to see if our Dynamic Duo can connect to the Pacific and somehow fix Mr. Crump's big problem.
