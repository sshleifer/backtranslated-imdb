Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini (The Church, Sleeping, Demons) Photo: Ronnie Taylor (A Chorus Line) <br /> <br /> History: Betty (Cristina Marsillach) is the Lady Macbeth scholar of a very stylized staging of Verdi's Macbeth opera. Betty's time to shine comes when the star diva breaks her leg before opening the night when she is hit by a car running away in a tantrum. The famous curse of Macbeth takes a more sinister and calculating course when the count of the body begins to rise. It seems that Betty gets her first fan through a stalker who ties her and records needles in her eyes to force her to witness the terrible murders of the people around her. Story: 3 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Performance: Acting in many of these Italian films can sometimes be difficult to judge. English, Italian, French, German, Spanish, sometimes may all be in the same movie as they usually speak their native languages, making it dub golden rule and difficult to judge. I usually cut a little slack in the area as a result. Acting: 4 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Direction: Giallo maestro Argento again enters the genre helped pioneer. 'Opera' shows you at the top of your game with an exquisite blend of blood, tension and beauty. Direction: 4 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Visual: This should be one of Argento's best movies. Gorgeously filmed by Taylor, 'Opera' features some stunning and inventive camera work that keeps the movie running fast and hard and holds the next eye-candy. The camera always seems to have notion whether it is a wonderful photo of the camera climbing a spiral staircase or a sequence at the end of an aerial view of the said bird circling the crowd in the opera house. Visual: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Audio: Argento Simonetti (through his various bands Goblin, Demonian and solo) complements the screen action with zeal as his score plays from the classic (Verdi) to the metal. (with a little help from Brian and Roger Eno and Bill Wyman) and lends muscles to the bloody screen's cartilage. The sound design gives you everything you need, stabbing the shots, shouting fire and masterfully remastered on the Anchor Bay disc in glorious 6.1 for each crunch and quack. Audio: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Technique: The editing keeps the movie flowing and moving beautifully. Combined with camera work, editing help keeps the dreamy surreal images flowing. The exquisite opera house is a hell of a place and perfect for staging Macbeth's horror version. You can not finish a review of an Argento movie without having to comment on the killings. Argento dispatches characters with joy this time with a brilliant sequence of stabbing, spider-eye and the highlight of a gun firing through a keyhole in the eye and the back of the head shot that once again sends the ex - wife of Argento, Daria Nicolodi. to the morgue of the movie. Priceless! Technique: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Closing: A near-perfect giallo that suffers from a slightly unnecessary epilogue in Switzerland that provides all the visual thrills Argento fans want. <br /> <br />: 4 out of 5
