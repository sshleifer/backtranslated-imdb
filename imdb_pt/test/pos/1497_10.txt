STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson ) is in this world, but not of this world. His mind simply does not seem to understand things in the same way that a normal person and his life is a long disaster because of this, putting himself in constant setbacks and extreme situations, which he is left to solve alone as he does not seem to mingle with no one and rarely speaks. But he never gives up and although the simpler task is a constant struggle for him, applying his own crazy methods of solving the problem is always worth it to him in the end. To see the apologies modern British mood state with all its focus of sex and general vulgarity, you would be forgiven for forgetting that a program like Mr. Bean was done in one go. There is nothing improper going on here, just good, clean U rated Tommy Cooper-type humor and the like made in the 50's. And I think it's funny to laugh now in his 20s as when I was a boy in the early 90's . <br /> <br /> Although I might look a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than meets the eye. There must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to go wrong for him. As others have noted, it looks like he may have a type of autism. In fact, I'm so convinced of this that I really think if I were a professional psychologist to analyze it, I think Mr. Bean could be the first famous fictional character to be diagnosed with something like Asperger Syndrome. <br /> <br /> If you'd like to see some genuinely hilarious British humor at its best, before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity, then this would be highly recommended. Shows such as Little Britain work because they are well performed, but they are just as vulgar as the rest. Shows like this show that we've been more restrained and civilized once, and hopefully we can start putting that kind of mood on again soon enough. *****
