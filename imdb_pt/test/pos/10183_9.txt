Meticulously constructed and perfectly touched, To The Ends of the Earth is a simply amazing journey out of our reality and into another era. Based on William Golding's trilogy, these three 90-minute films chronicle the journey to both Australia and the experience of young aristocrat Edmund Talbot (Benedict Cumberbatch) aboard an elderly man from the war in the beginning of the 19th century as it moves to a suburban governmental position. <br /> <br /> Among the crew and hopeful emigrants sharing their passage is a stormy and ominous captain (Jared Harris), a politically radical philosopher (Sam Neill), a shrewd lieutenant who worked from the bottom up (Jamie Sives) and, fleetingly, the first touch of love in the form of a beautiful young woman (Joanne Page) whose ship literally passes at night. <br /> <br /> Beyond the surprising degree of physical and historical accuracy, director David Attwood and writers Tony Basgallop and Leigh Jackson have a smart eye. and it is by the rigid etiquette and manners of an earlier time, devising a totally convincing microcosm of the Napoleonic era. <br /> <br /> Life on board is a brutal, monotonous cycle of seasickness, misery, and danger after another, and as Edmund becomes entangled in the loves, hopes, and miseries of his fellow travelers, he experiences a delirious whirlwind of life's difficulties, inhumanities of man and his noblest sentiments. <br /> <br /> Those who liked Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World or Would Patrick O'Brian's series of soap operas rely on it? for everyone else, it's a whole new world to discover.
