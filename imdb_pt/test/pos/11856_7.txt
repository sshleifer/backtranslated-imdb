Sophisticated sex comedies are always difficult to perform. Watch the Blake Edwards movies, which is unquestionably the master of the genre, and you'll find as many flaws as the hits. For if such a film ever fails to function, it can never resort to the tried and true hygienic humor of a teenage sex comedy [i.e. "American Pie," or warm the audience with the sentimentality of a romantic comedy [i.e. The whole career of Julia Roberts]. It can only keep a push to the end, and expect the public to appreciate the almost necessary irony of its resolution. <br /> <br /> Written by Wally Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, husband and wife, "Seeing Other People" opens with the newlyweds Ed & Alice [Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson] just seconds from finishing the car at in front of them. As the picture freezes, we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters. From now on, we welcome that the story that is about to unfold will enjoy a point of view of both sexes. <br /> <br /> Two months before their vows, Ed & Alice already look and act like an old couple. In an early bathroom scene, their actions only show us how comfortable they are with each other and how long they are together. So when the line to propel the plot is uttered-expected from the less likely of the two-it is as if the relationship itself were calling for a change, even if it meant its own destruction. <br /> <br /> Once all the basic rules are set [Ed can not sleep with his mother or, incidentally, Salma Hayek], the two depart in their separate directions hoping to find some nonsense sex for strengthen your relationship. At first, everything seems to go as planned, because their daily encounters only help to arouse the passion between them. But predictably, as the deeper emotions of repentance and jealousy begin to emerge, they soon find themselves separated and about to separate. All of these actions lead to a resolution that you may or may not like - depending on your own degree of cynicism. <br /> <br /> For a comedy like this, you need a solid cast with supporting characters as strong as you lead. And director Wolodarsky does not disappoint. Here he has released two of my favorite actresses as sisters - Julianne Nicholson & Lauren Graham - and lets them play with their strengths. For Nicholson, who has always reminded me of a young Shirley MacLaine, she brings an air of naivety and vulnerability to Alice even when her actions seem less than that. And as for Graham, an actress who proved she could outdo an entire set of Howard Hawks, she steals every scene in which she has a "BS-free" nervous personality. <br /> <br /> As for the guys, Jay Mohr is helpful here, as is Josh Charles. Byron Cranston, from "Malcolm in the Middle", has to be applauded for having a British accent and letting everything out. But the real pleasure here is Andy Richter and his sub-plot involving the single mother, Helen Slater. While their scenes almost seem to belong to another film, they are by far the funniest and their sneak delivery steals the show. <br /> <br /> For an independent production, "Seeing Other People" takes a more personal and introspective approach. feeling - something that would be noticeable in the absence of such a great Hollywood movie. Not to mention that this movie also has some genuinely funny moments - unlike, say, most Hollywood comedies in general. <br /> <br /> Rating [in a 5 star system]: 3 Â½ stars
