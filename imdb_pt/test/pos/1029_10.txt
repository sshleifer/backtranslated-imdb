Insanely well-crafted miniseries. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing most of it twice when it was shown at American Playhouse on PBS. It was heavily promoted at the time. I think it may have been one of the first miniseries shown on PBS outside of the Masterpiece Theater series. <br /> <br /> Complete production was displayed I believe only once during your first broadcast. It was 6-8 hours total. This length was reduced to 6 hours. Cut some interesting but slow scenes. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that the people who hold their current rights will follow and restore a full, unedited version of the DVD. It's not worth creating a VHS version right now. <br /> <br /> It would fit nicely in the mini-series or dramatic story genre.
