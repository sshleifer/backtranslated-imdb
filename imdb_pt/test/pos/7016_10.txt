I first heard about this movie from a friend. She loved it and always watched. When she told me about it and how old I was, I immediately decided I did not want to. I was so wrong. Dirty Dancing was an amazing movie! I love music and dancing. I bought the soundtrack and the DVD immediately after watching it. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray were brilliant at it. They captured the emotions and feelings of the characters so well. Both were good dancers. After watching the movie, I would like to be able to dance like them and, hopefully, I will start dancing to Ballroom and Latin soon. I've become a fan of this type of dance and now I'm addicted to all the movies and shows about it. Dirty Dancing revealed my passion for dance and music. My favorite part of the movie is when Baby comes into Staff headquarters and sees them dancing and obviously the last scene where Baby and Johnny dance together in front of everyone. I believe everyone should watch Dirty Dancing at least once in a lifetime. If not, it's your loss !!
