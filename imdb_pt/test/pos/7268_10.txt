I am amazed to have a real affection for this, in that I am not lover of action and adventure. But hey ... It's very hard to go wrong with a Robert Carlyle movie. I read several bad or tempered comments about this movie, separating it by its period errors or improbable plot development, but no one seems to mention the rather intriguing character transition that characterizes as a hardened, unlucky bastard (Carlyle) turns into a rather noble and selfless hero, and how the handsome, cowardly boy (Miller) develops a real taste for the life of a man on the road when he "realizes it." Filled with a lot of bad-boy humor, sumptuous scenes (particularly the use of "fireworks" by the former Plotkett apothacary) and a charming ecclectic soundtrack, Plunkett & Macleane is a fast, very enjoyable movie making film. Certainly worth your viewing time FOR THE CLIMAX SCENE ALONE! Shoot them, boys!
