30 years after the original movie, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" was created as a musical. Peter O'Toole and Petula Clarke starred in this wonderful remake of beloved Professor Chippington, known as Chips for his beloved wife. O'Toole was excellent here and received another Oscar nomination. You have to know what Peter O'Toole has to do to win an Oscar. He lost the coveted prize 8 times now. You should also imagine that he lost in 1969 to John Wayne for "True Grit," which was really a testament to Wayne's long career and popularity. This year was also marked by great performances by Richard Burton, "Anne of the Thousand Days" as well as Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight for "Midnight Cowboy." <br /> <br /> Surprised to see Petula Clarke climbing as Mrs. Chippington. However, as this was a musical, a beautiful voice came out well and she did a good chunk of acting too. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the scene when Chips remains in class, despite the news that his beloved was killed in a bombing. He never even told her the wonderful news of his pending promotion. <br /> <br /> Beautiful cinematography and music just added to a truly memorable experience.
