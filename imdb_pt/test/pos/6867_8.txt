I was very curious about Anatomy (also known as Anatomie) and if I went to see it, I would have to buy it, since no video store in my area was carrying the film. Since it was not a cheap DVD, I took a chance and thought I'd take a look at other IMDb reviews. Many of the reviews did not give me enough hope to give a lot of money for a movie I had never seen or had clues. Basically, I had the idea that it was a sensual teenage play, compared to many teen movies. Well, something in the back of my mind told me to ignore these types of comments and buy it! I did, and was pleasantly surprised! <br /> <br /> If it's going to be compared to any other movie, I'd say it's a variation of Coma and Extreme Measures. I could not see any comparison with movies like Scream, Urban Legends, et al. Yes, the cast is young (this is because they are medical students!), But some are vigorous (basically the character played by Anna Loos is, and is treated but Anatomy is well built, there is a tense atmosphere everywhere, the sets are amazing, the makeup effects are a wow, and Franka Potente is very credible in her role. I found myself enjoying all this despite some holes in the plot! The story of a student discovering a sort of secret society doing autopsies on patients still alive is a pretty scary scenario and what happens to those patients afterwards is quite clever. Of course, you could ask why she did not just leave this city? Okay, but the movie would be over in half an hour. <br /> <br /> This was the first effort by the German side of Columbia Pictures, and it's really impressive. There was a bit of care in producing and actually delivering some genuine emotions is an achievement. It is a bit mature in mind as it does not resort to constant opportunities for sexual encounters (a breast feast) or juvenile drug jokes. The character of Anna Loos, while often making sexual comments and looking for fun, was actually a nice touch - having a character who was a smarter woman than any of the school men. She discovered that sex was really only a distraction to her and to the men she lacked. <br /> <br /> The important material: watching this movie in the original language in German with English or French subtitles is the best way to take advantage of it. I saw the theatrical trailers nicknamed in English and I was disgusted by the change he made in the tone of the film. I've never seen a movie properly dubbed in my life - they can never find voices that fit the actors or characters in the movie. Sure enough, I tried watching some of the Anatomy dubbed in English and the intelligence level dropped dramatically, making it look like a comedy. A good example is when a guy got scared to be open and shouted to be sewn back - listening to him in German, he sounded frantic, but nicknamed in English, he sounded like a comedian. Frankly, I'm sick of hearing people say they can not read subtitles or watch a "letterboxed" movie. Anatomy looks silly with dubbed voices that look too high for any of the people you see in the movie, and Anna Loos's sexual comments sound like terrible comments from Fast Times At Ridgemont High. I wonder if the negative comments about Anatomy are from people who watched this dubbed, this just does not seem to be the same movie! This is not a cheap horror movie and deserves to be seen as it was created. It is interesting to note that some of the English subtitles are different in the scenes of the long and the "making of" supplement. <br /> <br /> As it turned out, I played and won with Anatomy. It's a competent thriller, with friendly characters and does not tempt cheap thrills.
