One of the best films of the 1980s, this fact-based film tells the story of a troubled high school student who kills his girlfriend, leaves his naked body on the bank of a river, and then boasts about it with his friends. . What is so bad is your inability to feel anything about it. <br /> <br /> Disturb but unbelievably attractive to look at aimless and apathetic children who have no respect for their parents or any kind of authority who seem almost doomed to living lives of rebellion and recklessness. This drama hits hard and it is impossible to forget. The young cast does a meritorious job - even Keanu Reeves, in one of his first roles, is better than normal. Of course, there's no reason for Layne's character (Crispin Glover) to be as crazy and crazy as he is, but it's just Glover being himself. Veteran Dennis Hopper has a particularly good role as a loner who, despite his own sordid past, is saddened by the attitudes of this group of children. I would like to emphasize the chilling performance of Daniel Roebuck as the young killer; he is an underrated actor and, in addition to Hopper, is probably the best performance of the film. <br /> <br /> I saw "River's Edge" for the first time long ago, when it started being featured on cable TV movie channels; however, I did not get it all; I saw it in its entirety for the first time several years later, and now I have seen it again by what is probably the definitive moment. <br /> <br /> Some moments with strong impact include Madeleine (Constance Forslund) collapse where she moans that maybe she should leave her children as well as their worthless father. I also liked the scenes in which Matt (Reeves) meets up with his troubled younger brother (Joshua Miller) and when the teacher, Mr. Burkewaite (Jim Metzler) deplores the fact that the girl died and that none of his students seems to care I'll never forget this movie, not while I live. It's very sad for that. <br /> <br /> 10/10
