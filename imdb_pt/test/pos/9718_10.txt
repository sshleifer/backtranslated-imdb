Jim Henson always seemed to launch wonderful television shows. This was, unfortunately, one of the shortest lived. It was nice to hear every story with its delicious morality. Each episode was a new story, with new characters. John Hurt did a wonderful job of playing the Storyteller, and Brian Henson's sarcastic tone as the dog was always enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The costumes and costumes were very well made. The work of the Muppet, when required, is the classic work of Jim Henson. You know you're a Muppet, but you're more attractive than you forgive. You find yourself delighted and compelled. When each episode comes to an end, you realize that you were quite entertained. An entertainment that is rewarding, not the kind that disappears after a few moments. You sit and think about each episode, realizing that each story is indeed timeless, and presents a strong tale of morality. <br /> <br /> I still have to show it to my own children, but this is indeed a series. this is more than just family entertainment. I beg you to find it on DVD and pick it up. If you can not do this, then just find it somehow.
