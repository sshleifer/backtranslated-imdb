Why all the bad reviews ??? You did not expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece, would it? What we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and worked for me. It is not a competitor of oscar, just entertainment. You can actually see how the movie has aged, especially with everything the internet has to offer nowadays. I still remember when it was first released and the network was still so new. Crazy and scary thoughts when I first saw it; I was 15 years old and seriously thought anyone could get their information on a computer and destroy you. But, who will say that can not happen ??? I'm not the kind of person to analyze a movie to death, analyzing it until it has a blue face. This is not my style. Average acting, suspicious and again, very funny. Sandra Bullock as Angela Bennett is so cute. This is my favorite movie with her because she is like the computer genius, which I find very attractive. Of all the films that were released in 1995, this would have to be my favorite, although I have not seen it until 1996. My rating, 9/10 because it has decreased somewhat.
