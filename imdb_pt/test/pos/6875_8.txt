Matthau is a widowed hospital doctor who enjoys his unique status and the nurses available on the team while colleague and friend Richard Benjamin watches with amusement and amazement. His boss is difficult to audition, going to the senile chief of staff, Art Carney, who is ready for re-election to the post. <br /> <br /> Matthau is happy to play in the field without commitment until he meets his single mother Glenda Jackson. who insists on being the only woman in her life while she is in her life. At the same time, he is under pressure to respond to the amorous advances of a possible litigant in a negligent process, and to support the incompetent and incompetent Carney in his bid to be re-elected Chief of Staff. <br /> <br /> This is an old-fashioned romantic comedy awarded by four A-grade actors and an excellent supporting cast working with a dry, caustic and sarcastic first-class script. Carney steals every scene he's in and, in IMDb language, makes us roll on the floor, laughing loudly every time he appears on the screen. Otherwise, we were entertained with the on-off relationship of the two leads and various subplots. <br /> <br /> Lacks the ambition to be a great film, but remains one of the best of its kind and watchable. -watchable for its comic value alone. It deserves more attention than it appears to have received and is worth the cost of the DVD or VCR.
