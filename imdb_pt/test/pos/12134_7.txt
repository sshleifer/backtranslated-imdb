Has anyone read or heard comments from Scorsese or David Chase (Soprano Executor) about "Death Collector / Family Enforcer"? I bought the DVD after not having seen it for a while on the cable (like 20 years), but having seen "Goodfellas" and all the running "Sopranos" to date. In retrospect, the two guys must have seen Death Collector / Family Enforcer and absorbed the taste, perhaps inspiring the tone of their masterpieces, both of which are the opposite of the romanticized Godfather trilogy. Being a Jersey guy, it's interesting to see how the Jersey prairies have evolved since the mid-1970s. It's not the swampy garbage dump it used to be, though from time to time a body appears on a local waterway. Also, it is a bit bittersweet to see a newly built World Trade Center on the other side of the river in the opening and closing scene. Who could have imagined?
