I watched this movie, never having read the book, and got the characters by face value, but having already been introduced to them, I watched it again recently. I have a completely different point of view from the movie. <br /> <br /> Without the burden of having to focus intensely on each character, learning their peculiarities and weaknesses, allowed me to focus on the cultural issues exposed in the film. . The Iowa farm families are as intimately interrelated as in the Indiana area where I grew up in the 1940s and 50s and immediately recognized the stories behind and the motives behind the characters. Perhaps Jane Smiley meant for us to see beyond the superficial world they had to live with, but viewers are so caught up in the "hollywoodian" aura of individual actors who miss a richer lifestyle layout that exists less. and less every decade that passes. Another film with these characteristics is the "Bridges of Madison County". Try to watch these two movies again with an eye on the whole picture.
