What can I say? I could not sleep and I came across this movie on MTV. I started watching it with all the intention of changing the channel, if it started to get lame, as many anti-drug films do, but I got sucked into this movie and could not stop watching. Nick Stahl did an incredible job with his character, and in my opinion he really made the movie worth watching. I was interested in buying the film's soundtrack (or even the film itself) and MTV.com did not help at all, but believe it or not, Amazon.com is pre-ordering the August 5 launch of the film. movie on DVD. . I know I had a hard time locating it and I'm sure other people may have had the same problem. I'm buying my own copy so that I can drool over Nick Stahl while screaming my eyes at the same time, thanks to the emotional plot!
