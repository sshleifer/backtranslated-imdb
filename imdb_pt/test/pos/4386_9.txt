I've seen almost every Coen brothers movie right now, and I have to say this is one of their best movies. I would not dare say it's better than "The Big Lebowski", but it was pretty good by itself. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was very interesting and hilarious at times. I loved all the characters, especially Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete). <br /> <br /> There's really nothing bad I can say about this movie, but this movie is not for everyone. It may be safe to say that if you liked the other Coen brothers' films then you will hope that you also enjoy this movie. And if you liked what you saw in the trailer, I think you'll like the movie, but do not hold on to it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope you enjoy (d) the movie as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br/> <br/> -Chris
