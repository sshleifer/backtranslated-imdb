As another poster mentioned Ch. 56 (a local Boston TV station) has shown this several times over the years on Saturday afternoons. They matched him with the first sequel "The Return of Ginat Majin." <br /> <br /> Now I have not seen him since ... but it never left me. In addition to the dubious dubbing and faded color, this was a very good fantasy. Technically it is not horror ... until the statue comes to life in the end. It's just about a village ruled by a bad man. There is a gigantic stone statue that the villagers continue to pray to help them ... without success. But things go too far, the statute comes to life and destroys the bad guys ... but then starts to go after the good guys too! Well done with some cool special effects in the end (I LOVED how he got rid of the main villain). There was also an elaborate enchanted forest in which it was also interesting. <br /> <br /> No masterpiece but an unusual combination fantasy / horror movie. Worth getting - but not if it is the dubbed copy.
