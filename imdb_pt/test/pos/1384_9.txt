Every now and then you stumble across a movie that takes you by surprise and this is one of them. On the surprise scale, this would be like splitting a whirlpool with Jessica Alba, while a band consisting of Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Phil Lynott and Keith Moon play music for the night. The reason this movie will surprise you is that because of the meager budget they had (Â£ 8,000) and that this was done by a group of friends who just wanted to try it, they produced something very smooth and it easily looks 100 times bigger than your budget. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple: a crew of mercenaries carrying a dangerous prisoner through space is attacked and is forced to fall on a nearby desolate planet. After a few checks, not only does the planet not exist according to the stellar maps, but they are not alone as it seems and something very hostile begins to choose them one by one. It seems like a very common Sci-Fi fare mixing elements of Aliens. Predator and Pitch Black, but he takes it all and turns it into something that looks fresh and original. <br /> <br /> The filming location is fantastic, using Balmeddie's beach in Aberdeen to the fullest and you really feel that you are an alien world. The seemingly endless sand dunes and clever lighting effects give a very somber feel, you really think the crew is stuck in an alien world. In addition, the action sequences are superb, the opening attack on the freighter a large showcase of special effects that can be achieved on a budget and the shootings, as well as the dazzling ending, show the film's inventiveness. <br /> <br / <br /> As for the mercenary team, the cast stands out. For an independent low-budget film, the cast here was done through local media and they seem to have picked some possible stars for the future. Mike Mitchell, a local body builder, is not a natural actor, but enters his role as the leader of the Arnie-Esq mercenaries. From the rest of the cast there are two outstanding performances Patrick Wright as second in command McNeal and Scott Ironside as the rough and ready engineer Vince. Both have some of the best lines in the film and Scott injects a good mood in the film with his performance. Patrick gives a well-balanced performance as the cold as the second in command. <br /> <br /> Director Mark Stirton can be very proud of what he has achieved and shows that Scottish cinema does not have to be all 'Kilts and Ceilidhs' or Scottish Slums and Drugs films can be new, creative and, above all, very fun. This film is Scottish (with a northeastern flavor) to the core and praise to the actors and directors for keeping the accent intact, which enhances the charm of the piece. Although budget constraints show from time to time (the only flaw I could find) that is to be expected. This film, the cast and crew deserve all the success they receive and more. I, by a wish, Mark and his team, all success and theirs is a career to keep an eye on. <br /> <br /> Rating - 9/10 The first Scottish sci-fi is bold, innovative and inventive. triumph. <br /> <br /> Movie reviews, news and reviews like no other, plus the release of bi-weekly podcasts. <br /> <br /> www.fightrunner.co.uk <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Contact@fightrunner.co.uk
