Created in 1928, and originally called Mortimer before Walt Disney changed its name (because his wife convinced him), Mickey Mouse became the staple product of the Disney brand. I always found that this cartoon was the first cartoon to rely on Mickey, in fact he is the third, but it does not matter, for a short six-minute is fun. The story shows Mickey piloting a steamboat until Captain Pete takes him off the bridge, stopping to pick up the cargo, and Minnie Mouse has lost the boat. Being raised, she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them, Mickey helps the crank is tail and play the melody, and getting some other animals to percussion, until Pete appears again to stop him, making Mickey peel potatoes . Mickey Mouse was the number 53 of the 100 best pop culture icons, and he was number 31 of the 100 best cartoons. Very good!
