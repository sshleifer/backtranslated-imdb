ABC's version of the late pope's life: they put it just a little ahead of the CBS version and may have suffered from it, but the program itself was excellent. He moved fast, having only two hours (with the commercials also taking the time) to cover the long life of this great man, but Thomas Kretschmann was admirably challenging. He did a remarkable job in conveying the emotions and conflicts that John Paul had. He, unlike the biopic CBS, played the role of youth in old age and managed to appear "realistic" at both ends of the scale. His credibility never faltered. It has amazing range and depth. It's a pity that the program could not have been longer and more detailed but working within the timeframe they had, I think they did a great job bringing it to the small screen.
