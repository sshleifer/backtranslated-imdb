Ok, so there are always people who seem to make a point of not liking movies because they are good but prefer to enjoy movies based on how depressing or boring they may be or whether they are from a foreign country. . All that aside, One Crazy Summer is the perfect example of what a great American teen comedy should be. The jokes are a good mixture of Bobcat Goldthwait, surreal (Bobcat under the inspired direction of Steve Holland) and dry (John Cusack, one of the most vaguely dry and funny actors in American cinema), and there is no character in this movie that has not made at least one funny phrase (okay, except Demi Moore). <br /> <br /> Yes, it's immature, yes, it's bolt ball, yes, Bobcat dresses like Godzilla and trashes a scale model of a seafood restaurant. It's also funny as hell. Watch.
