This was the first cartoon of the released Mickey Mouse and the first cartoon with sound. In the cartoon, Mickey still does not wear gloves. He still does not talk either. All he does is whistle and play music. The song he plays is "Turkey in the Straw," using various farm animals as musical instruments. For example, he touches the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and pulls sucking piglets like an accordion keyboard. I recorded this Disney Channel drawing and I think it's wonderful. It was based on a silent film starring Buster Keaton titled "Steamboat Bill, Jr."
