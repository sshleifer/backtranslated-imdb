Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is in love with a novelist (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a stupid chauvinist who is trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he is brutally murdered while Betty watches secretly. It leaves her unbalanced, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his ex-fiancee from RN. She heads to Los Angeles to find her lost love, unaware that stolen drugs are in her trunk. In search of her are Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, respectively), the killers who inadvertently killed Del before they discovered where the drugs were hidden. They chase her around the country, while Charlie gradually falls in love with her image of her. <br /> <br /> And in Los Angeles, things get totally bizarre, since no one notices that Betty is deluded. Alternatively funny and moving, this movie is almost perfect. Stop reading reviews and go see.
