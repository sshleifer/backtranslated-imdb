A very good film, focusing on a very important issue. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious congenital defect that is completely preventable. If more families saw this movie, maybe more kids would not end up like Adam. Jimmie Smits performs in one of his greatest roles ever. This is an excellent film that takes into account a very special family with very important needs. This is no different from the thousands of families that exist today in the United States. There are kids struggling with it all over the world. The really important point here is that everything could have been avoided. More people should see this film and take what it has to say seriously. It is well done, with important messages, graciously handled.
