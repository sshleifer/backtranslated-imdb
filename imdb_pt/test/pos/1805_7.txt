I've seen this movie a few times and every time I watch it, the funniest and funny it gets. Maybe it's the lack of research on the punk character of Nicolas Cage's character or just the joke factor because it was a typical 80's movie ... even so, it's a cute love story with extremely funny and unique characters. I think it's up there with "Fast Times" and "Weird Science!"
