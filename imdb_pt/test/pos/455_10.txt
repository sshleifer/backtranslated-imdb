I really like this movie. The first time was at Turner Classic Movies. All the actors did very well, but Brynner steals the show again as always (he's so sexy!) This is one of the movies that you see Brynner's emotions. In fact, this movie is the first I've ever seen him laugh at, because he plays very strong, grandiose and serious roles in other films. In this movie you see a masculine, hard and sensitive side of Brynner. Brynner seems to be a "ladies man" in this movie. It's amazing how Brynner eats the glass and speaks in her Russian tongue that drives me crazy. love. I do not understand when Brynner and Kerr (both have very good chemistry) star in a movie together and then Brynner always dies in the end, it kind of resembles "The King and I" in a way.
