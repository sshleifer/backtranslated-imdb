*Notice! Some spoilers! * Matt, a wealthy writer, is actually still just a boy in his behavior. He cares for no one but his own needs and could not care less about the consequences of any of his actions. Just as he knows Nimi and his ties to his family and community, he begins to feel that something is missing in his life. <br /> <br /> He begins to realize that he is indeed lonely and imprisoned in impersonal. structures that are only convenient, but lack heart and commitment. However, he eschews any responsibility and is reluctant to change his life. But will he be able to settle back into his old life and ignore the bonds he already is - unconsciously - formed? <br /> <br /> Nimi's situation is the absolute opposite. She is pressured into the regulations of her Nigerian community, her prejudices and her medieval values. Being a single mother, her position is difficult and it gets even worse when she falls in love with Matt, a white demon (as the Referendum would say), a man who can not compromise. The women in the community plan to marry her with Referend to end her unique status and give Sammy "a name." But that would mean for Nimi to give up all independence and self-determination. But is there an alternative for her if she wants Sammy to be accepted and herself become a respected member of the community? <br /> <br /> This film has it all: a very sensitive and sensual love story (with VERY sexy scenes of Matt and Nimi) and a captivating child who is eagerly pairing, a beautiful landscape in bright colors. <br /> <br /> Colin Firth (* swoon *) and Nia Long show great chemistry. It's just great to watch them. And Fissy Roberts as Sammy is just to die for. You simply want to adopt it. I just love the way Sammy and Matthew talk to each other. Both are on the same level in many ways. Especially when Sammy asks Matt about sex. This scene is absolutely adorable !! <br /> <br /> Almost nothing to complain .... wait! This is not true. One thing is not good: the movie is not long enough! (Well, maybe the Referendum is too bad and too silly to be convincing ...) 10 out of 10, by all means!
