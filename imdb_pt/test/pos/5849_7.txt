This thriller has so many twists and turns that it left me on the edge of my seat. I saw it on video, some of the landscapes in the "bluff" may have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen. Cast has Sandra Bullock, Ben Chaplin ("The Truth About Cats and Dogs"), Michael Pitt (Henry Parker in "Dawson's Creek") and Ryan Gosling (???).
