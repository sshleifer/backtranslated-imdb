OK, OK, I must say I was impressed. It's hard to say what I'm most impressed with: my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch, not to ruin my eyes or the movie itself. Anyway, "Hitch" was very good. Hey, it was good enough for me to watch it twice. Will Smith was funny and good. Kevin James was simply hilarious and absolutely essential to the film. As much as this film has focused on Hitch (Will Smith) without Kevin James is not the same. <br /> <br /> The story is: Hitch is a match maker who helps the guy win the girl. Her job is to create a chance for the girl to notice the guy when she would not. After the meeting, the rest is all for the guy to make or break the relationship. It works only with references and remains largely unnoticed during the process. Albert (Kevin James) is Hitch's project this time, and Albert has eyes on Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta), a Paris Hilton-type figure. As the plot unfolds, Hitch himself is eyeing Sara (Eva Mendes), a sharp, independent, smug gossip columnist who wants nothing to do with a relationship. <br /> <br /> Both stories create some fun and funny moments. they unite for a quagmire. Of course, no love story is complete without the lack of communication, misunderstandings, or mandatory setbacks to get the guy running after the girl. Fortunately, they are brief and unsatisfied. Hitch was a funny and funny movie that went very well and rolled smoothly.
