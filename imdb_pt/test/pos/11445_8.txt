Kevin Tenney's "Night of the Demons" is a nice horror movie that reminds me a little bit "The Evil Dead". On Hallowen's night, a group of teenagers party at Hull House, an abandoned funeral home on the outskirts of town. Led by Angela, they perform a session-like ceremony and accidentally awaken the evil spirits that inhabit the place. One by one, the uninvited evil force possesses the teenagers, turning them into bloodthirsty demons. "Night of the Demons" is a perfect horror It's scary, bloody and quite atmospheric. The characters are well developed and Steve Johnson's blood is very good. There is a horrible impalement, a tongue being bitten, fingers in the eyes, etc. The scene where Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) pushes a tube of lipstick across her nipple is a whistle. Give this a look. Followed by two sequels.
