The first thing I wanted to do after watching this movie was watch it again (because I had lost a lot with all the laughter I did). I am European and I studied abroad and I lived with Spanish, French, Italian and German people. The movie was full of stereotypes, which, most of the time, put people out, and reading some of the other reviews, I see people did not like it. But this film leaves the stereotypes so certain that I can not blame them. Except perhaps for the way the French guy became a drunken party animal. The English guy was the perfect "old man" stereotype. Drunk, annoying, insulting, but it shines in the end. Like stereotypes, the film also has the emotional aspect of studying abroad right. At first he is shy, knows no one, feels homeless, does not know what to do. As time progresses, it becomes your home, and when it comes time to leave, it is extremely difficult. A feeling that people can only understand if they have experienced it. I highly recommend this movie.
