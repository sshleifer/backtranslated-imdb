The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene of the French "Emmanuelle 2". This incredible woman did not go unnoticed, and soon was chosen as protagonist in this new Italian series, where she is the centerpiece; a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism the world had to offer. In this first installment, Mae Jordan / Emanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph people as well as stunning scenery and exotic wild animals. Much like the character of Sylvia Kristels, Emanuelle did not stand alone when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality. This first film is basically about how it becomes the "Emanuelle" that most filmmaking fans are familiar with. Filled with stunning cinematography, beautiful people and a heady score from the legendary Nico Fidenco's 70's, this one will surely please. Those who like the story-driven style of the original French "Emmanuelle" should also like this. The main story here is an interesting cat and mouse tale of a playboy womanizer who comes to the conclusion that he fell in love with a woman who is the female version of him! Sexy, fun and totally fun everywhere; a soap opera, of course, but with enough skin and eye drops to keep male viewers entertained. For some reason, this is the hardest part of the series to find on DVD. there has never been a legitimate DVD for this, which is very strange. The bootlegs that sometimes appear online will have to be made until someone gives this movie diamond a suitable release.
