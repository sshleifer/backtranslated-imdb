1904. The North African nation of Morocco hangs in a tenuous Independence, as the various European powers - France, Germany, Britain, Russia, Spain and now the United States - are competing for influence in the region. The Sultan (Marc Zuber) is a weak puppet; his uncle, Bashaw (Vladek Sheybal), who is being manipulated by the French and Germans, is the true power behind the throne. Enter Berber Chieftan Raisuli (Sean Connery), the leader of the Rif tribe and "the last of the pirates of Barbary", who kidnaps an American missionary, Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen) and their two children and takes them hostage. Back in the US, President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) threatens to go to war on the subject: "Pedecaris Alive or Raisuli Dead!" - seeing the issue as the perfect way to exercise his "Big Stick" diplomacy, although Secretary of State John Hay (John Huston) is not so confident. However, the Raisuli has fewer claims plans for the Pedecarises, who are more than capable of handling themselves in any event. <br /> <br /> John Milius's great historical film, loosely based off of a true story (ie, Pedecaris was a middle-aged man), is a wonderful escapism. There are some incredible action scenes, a witty, well-written script, a handsome cast having fun with the material, and it does not go over as much as, say, "Pirates of the Caribbean" or "Lord of the Rings". It's not really an "epic" movie in the strictest sense, but it's one of the best pure action movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Although the historical context is unstable, the plot is interesting, and as some critics point out, it is even more pertinent today than when it was made. As President Roosevelt says, "America is like a grizzly bear" - fierce, strong, but sometimes a little blind and reckless. At the time of the film's set-up, the United States has just been brought to the world stage as a superpower after its resounding victory in the Spanish-American War - and Roosevelt takes advantage of this incident as a way of proving America's value. In real life, it did not work out that way, but allegorically it works fine. While written from a right-wing perspective, Milius's script is accurate enough to assess America and its place in the world. He admires Roosevelt and his "big stick" diplomacy method, and correctly recognizes (in Roosevelt's words) that although America can be feared and respected, they will never truly be "loved" by the world, no matter what they do. . And there are some scenes - such as Roosevelt's pursuit of European leaders and the almost comical surprise attack of the Marines at Bashaw's palace - which show the reckless and violent side of the United States, while others - the decisive confrontation with the Germans - show their heroism. The historical / political context of the film is, of course, merely flesh on the bones of what is essentially an exciting action / adventure film. There are some brilliantly done action scenes, such as the Raisuli rescue of the Pedecaris from double-crossing tribes, which features some of the best sword games in any movie. The opening entrance of the Raisuli and the marked march and attack of the US Marines are brilliantly made with pieces of bravery. And the final battle, combining elements of "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Wild Bunch", while a great historical fantasy (a three-way battle between Germans, Americans and the Rifs), is a superbly staged adrenaline rush. sequence. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast gives some wonderful performances. Everyone seems to be having fun with the movie, and it shows. Sean Connery is surprisingly convincing as a Berber with a Scottish accent, but manages to take away his interesting, well-drawn and chivalrous character who comes to respect his hostage and abhors the modern and uncivilized war. Candice Bergen, an actress I've never liked, does a great performance like the moody Eden Pedecaris, who is as tough as her captor. Brian Keith is incredibly compelling TR - you really feel like he must have been like this, an athletic, noisy but practical and clever man with a sense of self admirable. The Roosevelt boxing and shooting scenes while discussing foreign policy are some of the biggest bad moments in movie history - and who can forget phrases like "Why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality?" John Huston provides solid support as the weary and cautious Hay, acting as a stark contrast to the much more impetuous Roosevelt. Among the best talent, the best are Geoffrey Lewis as Samuel Gummere, the cynical ambassador caught in the middle of political intrigue, and Steve Kanaly as the enthusiastic Marines captain who cheerfully defends (and does) "Military intervention!" as the overwhelming and simple solution to the whole complex situation. Other familiar faces like Vladek Sheybal, Nadim Sawalha, Roy Jenson, Larry Cross, Marc Zuber and Darrell Fetty also do a good job no matter how small their role. Spaghetti Western fans will recognize Antoine Saint-John ("A Handful of Dynamite") as the German general and Aldo Sambrell as one of the members of the Raisuli tribe. <br /> <br /> "The Wind and the Lion" is around, a wonderfully made adventure film. There is something for everyone: wonderful weapon and fencing, a lot of humor, a strong and moody heroine (and her two cute children), a nice novel (if not consummated) and an interesting (if fanciful) political / historical context. It's not a masterpiece, but hey, he was not trying to be. I give "The Wind and the Lion" a hectic nine stars and my highest recommendation.
