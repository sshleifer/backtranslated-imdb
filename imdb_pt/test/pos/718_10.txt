Jennifer Montgomery's Art for Teachers of Children is an impressive and disturbing masterpiece. Montgomery's camera work and cinematography, along with the brilliantly non-emotional performances she evokes from her cast, underscore the raw, shocking realism of the autobiographical story of a 14-year-old Jennifer seductress from her married marriage counselor. The scenes between the incredibly strange actress who plays Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually dubbed by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful I have ever seen captured in the movies. The lesson finally learned here? "There's nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art." Well, I highly recommend this remarkable "Art" article for anyone interested in insightful independent film.
