This movie is a bit slow at first, for the first 10 minutes. But once you enter, you can not turn it off. Adam Beach and Rose McGowan play the best parts and are great at acting. You would never be able to guess who the killer is. I gave this movie a 9 because in some parts Adam Beach needs to talk a little bit so you can hear what he's saying. <br /> <br /> 9/10
