This movie is great I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This film is about a cat mother named Dutchess and her 3 kittens. T Dutchess and the kittens love music. They have to practice the piano every day. But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and his kittens, he tries to make them sleep. But he fails. The Dutchess find a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats begin to sing. With music everyone wants to be a cat. Thomas manages to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and I like cats!
