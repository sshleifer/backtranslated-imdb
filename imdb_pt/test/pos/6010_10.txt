This film is a wonderful example of the quality dramas that Channel 4 and the BBC have produced over the years. Ted Danson delivers a powerful performance of a man tormented by memories that no one will accept, and a society that believes he is insane. It's a remarkable performance from a man best known for his role in Cheers, a comedy sitcom on TV. The supporting cast are all very well chosen, not least, Mary Steenbergen, wife of Danson, who plays the role of Gulliver's wife in the film. But above all, it is the seamless and very delicate changes between our world and the world of Gulliver that make this film. The difference of perspective between giants and dwarves, all represented by real actors, is beautifully captured. A rare treatment of cinematography and direction.
