Even for a 17 year old student who loves the story and had glimpses of excitement and excitement in his childhood years in this series, his coming to the DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South are truly a series about friendship, love, honor ... you name your own list of feelings you receive while watching this series. I still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this TV series when I was about 8 years old. I think this sounds exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in Holland. When the third book was released as a late-night series in Holland in the summer of 2004, I only knew I had to see the other two series. For most people booking three was a big disappointment as far as I know. Well, since I saw the book one on DVD, I must say that so far is the best of all 3 books. For all young people who only watch extravagant movies like The Patriot "Oh America for Freedom", there is a more realistic view to see for them here .....
