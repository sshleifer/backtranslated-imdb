This show has everything you could want from a prison drama. There are twists and turns until the season finally comes. The characters are very strong and give the show a lot of power. By watching the show you feel not only for the prisoners but for the prison staff. The actors who interpret prisoners in this program did a great job portraying a prisoner. Also, if you like law and order svu or law and order criminal intent there are many actors in this show that appear at these shows. The only problem with Oz is that it was not long enough. This show could easily have nine to ten seasons without getting old. Even after the end of the season I still find myself watching Oz all the time on DVD. This show is easily one of the best shows on television. Do not be a fool, go watch Oz.
