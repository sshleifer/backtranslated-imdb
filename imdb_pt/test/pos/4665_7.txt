As a movie, ITALIAN WORK is ok at best; good (not great) acting <br /> <br /> nice visual and rhythm, a mediocre plot, but nothing bad enough <br /> <br /> to leave. But as a commercial car for the new generation of MINI Coopers, this movie is spectacular! Okay, it's a typical assault movie with the odd twist (the underwater safety breach was good, if not unlikely), and the cast was pretty good. solid <br /> <br /> (with the exception of a putrid Wahlberg), but when it all came <Until then, the real "stars" of that photo were the three MINI Coopers in all their high altitudes , racing speed, ramp-jumping, bullet-taking, gold-trailing, bright new glory. The audience I was sitting between actually "ooed" and "aahed" when Theron's small red number hit the screen (strangely, neither she nor Wahlberg got the same reaction). <br /> <br /> The movie starts promising. Mos Def, Seth Green, Donald <br /> <br /> Sutherland, Edward Norton and Jason Statham start as an interesting and comical band of characters with the only true <br /> <Uninspired performance is that of the good Mark Wahlberg. Why does he say that this is his best film I can not imagine; his character is completely on a note, and he interprets it so softly that it was as if Mr. Rogers had come back from the dead and was living <br /> < your body. Charlize is good as Sutherland's daughter, though nothing magical. The character of Seth Green is perfect and the Napster jokes (including a special participation of the founder of Napster, <br /> <br /> Shawn Fanning) are hilarious; he and some of the early lines of Mos Def add some much-needed mood sparks. Unfortunately, Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland do not get close enough to screen time. <br /> <br /> You can see most of the plot coming from a mile away, and the dialogue is filled with jugglery and giveaways, but I doubt the filmmakers were out to reinvent the wheel here, then taken as a typical action / thriller, works out fine. Worth seeing on cheap night which I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 7/10. Not worth it's weight in gold, but makes for nice fillings.
