After years of waiting for a definitive collection of Led Zeppelin's perfomances on video, fans have finally been rewarded with what is arguably the biggest video show ever! Much better than the sombre "Song Remains the Same," this video includes performances from no less than 5 different locations spanning a decade. Also includes rare interviews and TV appearances. The sound quality is amazing considering the source material used. And the quality of the video is even more impressive. This is an absolute must for any Led Zeppelin fan.
