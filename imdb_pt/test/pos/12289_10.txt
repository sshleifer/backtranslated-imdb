I tried to reconcile why so many negative reviews about this movie, while the vast majority of reviews received a rating between 7 and 10. The reason may be that this film is kind of hard to describe in a positive review, although few have done it very well . This movie is confusing, depressing and does not have a happy ending. I still gave Pola X a grade of 10, because it is basically for me literature and art combined into film. That's really my favorite kind of movie. I only saw two of Carax's films: this one and Mauvis Sang. As with this movie, I'm being a little pretentious when I call it one of the best Carax films - but I am. Carax has a minimalist style. If that kind of movie does not interest you and it's boring, then you'd better not watch it. But Pola X was less minimalistic than Mauvis Sang, so it had enough intensity for a thriller - at least for my taste. I found it very interesting and absorbing. The two leading roles did an excellent job of acting. (I mean the leader and the young man he thought was his half-sister). Catherine D. is always great, but her role was not very big or significant in history. But everyone did a great job. I thought the cult material was great. It may not have been very believable, but this is due to being quite abstract. There's a lot going on between the lines in this movie. This is a very Freudian psycho.
