Visconti Masterpiece! I admit that I'm not familiar with much of your work, but I can not imagine your other work overcoming this fabulous film. Last night I watched Death in Venice after an absence of about 25 years and I was totally captivated by everything I saw. This captivation was a pastiche composed of many elements: the extraordinary shots directed by Visconte, especially his love for long and languid doses of people dining, swimming, walking and containing a significant character passing through this mass of people; the brilliant interpretation of the cinematographers of the selection of films of Visconti; acting through the principles without dominating the dialogue and transmitting the complexity of the scenes only through facial features. <br /> <br /> It's true: young people watching this movie for the first time should be aware that they are watching a unique movie. film, a film that could not be made in 2006. A film whose time rests in those brief years in the 1960s and early 1970s when artistic license was passed on to filmmakers and money men took on secondary roles. As many of the IMDb commentators wrote, this movie, in its judgment, is long, boring (very little) and pretentious. I suppose by Hollywood standards, these comments have merit. Unfortunately they tragically minimize the incredible beauty and depth of this work and others like it from those years. <br /> <br /> Please, if you have not yet seen Death in Venice, rent a copy and immerse yourself in a movie and a story. from another time. You will be rewarded.
