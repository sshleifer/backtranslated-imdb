Billy Wilder continues his strong film career during the 1950s with a biopic of Charles Lindbergh, the young American pilot who became the first man to fly solo by the Atlantic in 1927. Jimmy Stewart plays Lindbergh, and although he may be a little too old for the part, it still brings the sincere warmth and necessary confidence as well as his earth-to-brand kindness that makes him an iconic movie star. Wilder drives solidly, balancing the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear picture of what Lindbergh was up against when he decided to accept that challenge. It's certainly not his or Stewart's best work, but it's a gem of a movie. He raises his spirits with the plane and makes you proud to be an American. Overall, it is simply good.
