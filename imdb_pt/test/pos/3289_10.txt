I saw the Chomps during the - approximately - two days of their theatrical version. It's a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji', though much improved and more focused on actors than dogs. The simple portrayal of the difficulties of life in a humorous way, followed by the aggressors and villains who end up having their mere deserts, is both sympathetic and comforting. It's also thought provoking. With clever subtlety, this movie affects the conscience of cruelty, personal behavior and bullying. Movies have different purposes and different genres. This film, which is wonderful for all ages, offers an interesting humorous look at our own experiences. Everyone will recognize the types of personality and behavior of themselves and others. Everyone will see the humor. Humor makes movement pleasant and brings understanding of life situations to a new level. <br /> <br /> For a carefree laughter and a 'feel-good' movie Chomps is an excellent choice. Memorable.
