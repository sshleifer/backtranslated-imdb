I liked this movie for the most part, but I have to say that if there was anyone other than Bill Murray in the lead role, it would not have been so good. It brings an energy to the paper that puts this film in a notch of what would have been otherwise. I mostly liked the pranksters pulled on an advisor and there are other funny things in this movie too, like the hot dog eating contest. This film also set the stage for summer camp movies with the competition at the end. Almost all camping movies have this or the undisciplined or problematic infantile plot, or a combination of both. This series would also take a rather strange change in tone as this one and two are both family films, while part three and four are more adult oriented, more like the old adolescent sex comedies of the era. Kinda did the opposite of the Police Academy films that went from R to PG-13 to PG movies. This series goes from the opposite side to R. Yet this first and only good one is worth a few laughs mostly due to Bill Murray.
