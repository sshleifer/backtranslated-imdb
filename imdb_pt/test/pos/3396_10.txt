Maybe one of the best movies ever made. The friendship of Orry and Goerge is deep, and the war places strong pressure on their strong friendship. As a southerner, I can honestly say that this epic is as accurate as it sounds. Brothers fighting brothers. Can you imagine what life must have lived through these times? The best part of the movie, for me, was when The South surrenders; General Grant is asking President Lincoln to really put him in the South, he says, "Mr. President, a lot of people want the South to bleed what they did ..." President Lincoln turns to him and in a voice very tired says: "The South has bled enough ... and so have we ..." I began to cry and took a deep breath. What a president! It's like a father saying that his son was punished enough, and despite his anger, he realizes that his point was made. This war was a very dark period for our young country, and this had to be fought. President Lincoln knew that. I'm asking everyone to read this to watch this movie and add it to your DVD collection. So thank God our country was preserved. As Jesus said, a "house divided against itself can not stand."
