I'm not sure how I can do ten lines for that question, but I'll try. <br /> <br /> When Julie went to the ball and they were dancing to slow down the music. What was the name of the song that was playing and who played? <br /> <br /> I love this song! And I watch the movie several times just to hear that song. <br /> <br /> I did several searches online and even looked for the soundtrack, but still could not find the song. <br /> <br /> It may be because the music they were dancing was not a complete song and only partial. <br /> <br /> I would appreciate it if someone out there knew the name of the song and the group that sang Thank you. <br /> <br /> Frank. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
