"Best in Show" is certainly the most entertaining and profound film of Christopher Guest. The characters are excellently portrayed and the pet connection to owner adds a new level of comedy to the film. I've been a fan of Guest since Spinal Tap, but in this film he really got what he intended to do in "mock-a-instinct," a genre he invented and now perfected.
