This must be one of the funniest Danish films ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are hilarious as they cross Sweden. I do not know how Ulrich Thomsen does it, but somehow he gets mad in a very sensible way. BUT if you do not understand Danish (I'm not referring to your pastries here) do not waste your time on this ?? I do not think it would work with subtitles.
