After the 1941 business deal, Max and Dave, the Fleischer brothers were removed from their own studio by Paramount Pictures Corporation. Former employees such as Seymour Kneitel and Izzy Sparber were in charge of the new operation, now renamed to Famous Studios by Paramount. At the outset, Famous's finished product was indiscernible from Fleischer's recent production. The existing series (Popeye, Superman) continued as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> Today's subject, JAPOTEURS is one of the first SUPERMAN Shorts from Famous Studio. <br /> <br /> As usual, the SUPERMAN Cartoons were a great combination of fine, appropriate music on the soundtrack. This goes for the theme (opening) as well as for all background music (incidental) of various environments. It was as if each short film had its own background music, since everything was kept fresh, apparently recording it again with each photo. <br /> <br /> With regard to JAPOTEUROS, we must remember that this was filmed during the first year. The involvement of the United States and the characterization of the enemy were very stereotyped, short-lived, and absurd. The dialogue and personality of the Japanese saboteur villains were strictly the characters of the old stories of the magazine, with every word being spoken in a sarcastic, utterly insincere politeness, while the characters sported their cold blood while doing the most demonic of all. threats and outrageous acts against the Western world. <br /> <br /> JAPOTEURS is visually bright and uplifting, incredibly organized and makes use of some multi-plane or table animations to give your flying sequences a real depth. MAKING good use of the tie-ins among the cartoons, the SUPERMAN Radio Show listened to the Mutual Broadcasting Network; the cartoon bears a strong resemblance to Comics Page and uses the same talents from voice actors Bud Collyer and Joan Alexander from the radio show. <br /> <br /> We rate it with *** stars. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
