The wind and the lion are wonderful moving movies. It is a monument to what the cinema once was, but it is not anymore. <br /> <br /> Connery, despite the strong Scottish accent, plays Raisulu very well. It inspires the viewer in a way that many main characters can not. Candice Bergen, in one of her early roles, is wonderful as the socialite kidnapped Mrs. Pedacaris, showing courage in the face of adversity (and humor too). A wonderful movie, rent or buy and you will not be disappointed.
