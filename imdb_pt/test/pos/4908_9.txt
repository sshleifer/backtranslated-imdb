Directed by Michael Curtiz, four daughters is about four sisters endowed with musicality, their suitors and their father, a minor maestro. Playing sarcastic, fast talking Mickey Borden is John Garfield in the role that made him an instant star. The film is also starring Claude Chove as Adam Lemp and the sisters Lane, Lola, Rosemary and Priscilla, and Gale Page as their spirited daughters. His definitive scene happens in the Lemps room. Cigarette hanging from his lips, Borden is playing one of his own compositions. Ann Lemp, by Priscilla Lane, says the piece is beautiful. But he says, "That stinks." He continues: "It has neither beginning nor end, only means." Ann asks him to create a beginning and an end. Borden replies: "For what? Fate is against me. They threw an expensive coin, I am poor, crown, I am rich." But they threw a two-headed coin. The audience loved the way Garfield, in his harsh voice of the town, said he stinks. This scene created Garfield's screen persona as the eternal outsider. Four Daughters is a slice of Americana with Garfield in a compelling performance, providing more than a touch of darkness. <br /> <br />
