This movie is one of my all time favorites. I'm sorry that the IMDb is not more positive about it. I hope this does not prevent those who have not seen him from watching him. <br /> <br /> I've always loved this movie. I watch it once a year and I'm always satisfied with the film and especially with the stellar performances of the whole cast. <br /> <br /> I've always wondered if Jean Stapleton would actually dance with Travolta ??? ? If anyone knows this excerpt, please leave a comment. <br /> <br /> Thank you and ENJOY!
