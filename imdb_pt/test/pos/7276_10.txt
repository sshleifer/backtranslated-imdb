If you like subtle psychological dramas / thrillers, this is a movie for you. Those who want to see an erotic sex and sex thriller certainly will not understand this movie, as Colin Firth obviously did when he called it "junk." But Jennifer Rubin is the true star of the movie anyway. She is such a brilliant and beautiful actress! Along with the twist and turn storyline, it gets more and more psychological and makes you think of yourself, the wonderful direction, photography and especially music make this film a masterpiece. Also the small portions are very good, especially Belinda Waymouth is great in her little scene. I hope it will be released on DVD soon, and a soundtrack album would be a dream come true!
