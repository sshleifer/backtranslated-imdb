This is an account of events that were printed several times, and I read two books - 'A Journey to the Crazy' and 'The Strange Last Trip of Donald Crowhurst' before seeing the film in Sheffield just before Christmas. I must say that he surpassed all expectations by telling about the Sunday Times yacht race in 1968 at the Golden Globe. These men began to do something that had never been done before, with no support vessels, wooden boats, no satellite phones, no GPS, and only their intelligence and ability to put them around the world. Not to mention the months of solitude, the thundering southern ocean, little sleep and boats that were literally crumbling around them. <br /> <br /> This documentary is excellently organized in my opinion, well edited, well paced. with superb narration. The archive and interviews are fascinating and bring history to life. Clare Crowhurst's interview footage is especially revealing and touching as she recounts the events leading up to her husband, the departure of Donald Crowhurst from Teignmouth, the doubts and fears in her mind and her reaction as the subsequent events unfolded. <br /> <br /> I was moved and even shed a tear or two when the credits began to be released, and I heard others expressing similar sentiments. <br /> <br /> The two books I mentioned above are useful for more detail and background stories. which could not have been ridden in the 90 minutes and I would recommend them too. <br /> <br /> This is, ultimately, a true story of human courage and human frailty. A must see for anyone interested in sailing, adventure, human endeavor and real life heroes.
