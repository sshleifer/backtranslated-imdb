I had never paid much attention to this film until I knew that Paddy Chayefsky - author of the brilliant "Network" - was the screenwriter. His work there instructed me about his genius, so when 'Hospital' appeared at TMC, I was eager to see it. I was not dissapointed. Looking at both this film and the "Net", it seems that its great theme is the absurdity, inanity and sheer cruelty of large human enterprises (eg hospitals, networks) against the sanctity of individual experience and the human spirit, and everyone was delivered with a completely black sense of humor. "Hospital" is as black in a comedy as "Network," and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable Scott, does his job with full justice. This is a guardian; definitely not to be missed.
