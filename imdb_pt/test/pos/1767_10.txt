This is the kind of unknown and forgotten movie you dream about discovering when watching old videos. It's an excellent comic slang with brilliantly entertaining writing, encrusted with the marvelous variety of characters, a wonderfully inventive and entertaining soundtrack, and a clever and light Montgomery's own direction. This is one to watch over and over. Montgomery is a small actor who is assigned by his military reserve division to infiltrate a young debutant's home and discover the identity of his ex-boyfriend, suspected of being a jewel thief. Although the premise is absurd, the results are hilarious. Montgomery is the messy plant, Ann Blyth is a wonder as the romantically obsessed, terribly sincere debutant and veteran drama actress's parade, Jane Cowl's mother for Lillian Randolph's maid - are all fabulous. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, it only won an Oscar for Sound, when it earned the best regards for direction, screenplay and score. <br /> <br /> DO NOT MISS IT - it's one of the best in Hollywood.
