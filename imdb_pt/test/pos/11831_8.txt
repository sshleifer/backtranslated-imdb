This speaker of Warner Brothers, "Son of the Gods" (1930) deals with the racial intolerance that the American Anglo-Saxons demonstrate towards the Chinese. Chinese Americans are treated as second-class citizens, and whites do not consider them despicable. The prolific setting Bradley King based his script on Rex Beach's novel about an impressionable young Chinese man, Sam Lee (Richard Barthelmess of "Only Angels Have Wings," who experiences racial prejudice first-hand when the girls his college classmates bring to a party reveal their racist feelings about Sam, once they learn about his heritage. Sam goes to his father, Lee Ying (E. Alyn Warren of "Gone With The Wind"), who is a wealthy Chinese with offices not only in New York but also in San Francisco, Sam is deeply hurt by racial slurs and wants to leave New York and go where he can not be hurt by Americans. a fact of everyday life and that the only solution to racism is tolerance.He still needs to learn this lesson.He refuses to take more money from his father and picks up a ship to London, England, peeling potatoes while he is is on board. <br /> <br /> During the voyage, he meets a British playwright, Bathurst (Claude King of "Arrowsmith"), who needs help writing a play about the Chinese. Sam and he create a friendship and Sam provides cultural information about Asians. While they are relaxing in France, Sam meets a beautiful young woman, Allana Wagner (Constance Bennett of "Two-Faced Woman"), who falls madly in love with him. It seems like Allana and her rich dad are on vacation at the same motel. Everyone at the motel knows that Sam is a Chinese except for Allana. Sensitive about his racial heritage, Sam holds Allana at bay until she convinces him that nothing could change her mind about him. They fall madly in love together. Allana's father throws the bomb at her when he reveals that Sam is a Chinese and all the memories of living in San Francisco and dealing with coolies flood Allana's mind. She storms into the motel's dining room and publicly puts Sam on a whip in front of a room full of spectators. <br /> <br /> Of course Sam is terribly devastated by this reversal of events. He thought Allana loved him, but she did not love him. At about this time, Sam's father, Lee Ying, falls tragically ill and Ying's kind of secretary, Eileen (Mildred Van Dorn of "Iron Man"), sends a telegram to Sam about Ying's disease. Predictably, Sam runs home in New York to be with his father. Since his public humiliation, Sam has promised not to show kindness to Anglo-Saxon Americans; Eileen is an Irish Catholic and probably one of her few white friends. Lee Ying dies and Sam takes control of the business and he practices his anti-white racism until he discovers that he was a maddening Anglo-Saxon that a San Francisco cop gave Lee Ying and his wife to educate. The cop forgot about this until two types of white, burly social workers wanted to get Sam out of the Yings. Sam learns this revelation at the same time that Allana comes to New York and gets sick. During her illness, she pronounces her name repeatedly during her sleep and her dedicated father goes to meet Sam and asks Sam to visit her to help her recover. Without Allana's knowledge, Sam visits her and she improves, but she has no memory of her visit, just a hazy notion. Eventually, Allana discovers the truth about Sam not being a Chinese and they marry and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> This year's Warner Brothers / First National Pictures Release, which is socially conscientious, frankly and inflexibly contests the race issue for the first time. hour or so, before the revelation that Sam does not have Chinese blood running through his veins, takes both him and the audience by surprise. The reconciliation between Allana and Sam extends to credibility, despite the immortal love of one another. However, in the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that came before, they end up in each other's arms. <br /> <br /> The capitulation of the racial issue with the revelation that Sam is not The Chinese undermine part of the moral power of the film. Incredibly, "Son of the Gods" is a pre-coded film that almost seems modest; for example, Sam is an American, not Chinese! Constance Bennett gives a wonderful performance as a petulant beautification and she catches his attention when she whips Sam with his riding whip. Claude King is good as Bathurst, and E. Alyn Warren is convincing as Lee Ying. Curiously, Warren has made a career of portraying Asian characters. Richard Barthelmess is impeccable as Sam; It offers a highly nuanced performance. Despite his age, "Son of the Gods" is the son of a good movie!
