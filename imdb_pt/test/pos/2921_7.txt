Maybe it's just a personal affection for this film version of Mika Waltari's novel, or a fondness for Egyptian things (I grew up loving to visit the mummies at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston), but I think Maltin is a little hard on it. movie. The production values ​​are great in relation to color and cinematography, and it seems that there was some effort in historical authenticity (much of the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a little harsh in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of the character of Sinuhe. Victor Mature is, well, Victor Mature. Peter Ustinov is a delight to watch in this kind of role, which he has always done so well and so witty. The performance of Bella Darvi as Nefer is classic, and I think even the dry portrait of Akenaten by Michael Wilding has its own appeal. The historical uniqueness of Akenaten's monotheism, a brief departure from the theological history of ancient Egypt, is interesting, as is Akenaten himself, and is worth reading about; The religious wars portrayed here have a basis in fact. An interesting footnote on Darvi, whose birth name was Bayla Wegier: she was a Polish emigrant that producer Darryl Zanuck and his wife Violet took under their wings (I believe they may even have adopted her). His screen name Darvi is formed by the names of Zannuck and his wife. She continued her acting career in France, but never achieved great success and, after a somewhat unhappy life, died in her own hand in 1971. In all, this is an interesting and enjoyable film to watch by the visual. values ​​alone. American Movie Classics occasionally shows this in the mailbox, which is essential for capturing the scope and sweep of the story.
