Columbo is a guest lecturer for a criminology class. Students invite you to their post-class meeting. Transiting the next garage, they discover their regular teacher, next to his car, dead from a gunshot wound. (No, Columbus was not behind the man's work.) As a class project, Columbus involves the students in their investigation. <br /> <br /> Two students, tentatively identified by the spectator as guilty, were in the classroom the whole class. In addition, tapes of garage surveillance cameras show that no one but the teacher entered or left after he was last seen, unexpectedly, leaving the classroom. Reversing the normal routine, Columbus is who is plagued by evil (?) duo, eager for progress reports and an ear for his theories. Forensic evidence is almost nonexistent. The solution of the case depends on some good luck and interesting. <br /> <br /> The first time, it seemed that Columbo had swallowed the guilty guilty wrong; however, in the repetition of the preview, small details revealed that this did not happen. <br /> <br /> This reviewer has not gotten tired of "Columbo Goes to College."
