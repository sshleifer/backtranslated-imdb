I just attended the 08th MS Gundam again for the 2nd time. It is much better than Gundam Wing. I can not wait to get the DVD and see what was edited out of the series. This is great to see the Gundams moving awkwardly across the land. Someone really thought about writing this change script. <br /> <br /> See this today.
