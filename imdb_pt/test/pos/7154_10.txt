Wow, I just got this Blockbuster movie and I love finding gems like that. Although it was filmed on a budget and lacks a little bit of awkward editing (for example, accidents, hospital scenes, scenes from the second to the last extreme), for a first effort of direction, I give this 10 stars! I loved the instigating concepts generated and, if you are a free thinker and open to ideas out of the box, I highly recommend this movie. I think the director and screenwriter, Jay Floyd, should get attention and more opportunities in the film industry. Based on his credits, he may be another Quentin Tarantino.
