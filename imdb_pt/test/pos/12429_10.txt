If you took a good jack black movie, add some jeepers creepers, and then a dash of joyride with a dash of chainsaw slaughter in texas and home to 1000 corpses ... you'd get MONSTER MAN! I got into this movie, not really expecting much, but I ended up really enjoying the movie. The whole premise is really corny, a monster man in a monster truck chases people, but it's so funny that the writer / director does not expect you to take it seriously. justin urich is a comic book and must have a very promising career. it is identical to the black jack. the only problem with the film is the unbelievable role of hero played by eric jungmann. but overall if you are looking for a really fun movie that will drive you crazy until you are rolling in the hallways and at the same time scare you ... check out this movie.
