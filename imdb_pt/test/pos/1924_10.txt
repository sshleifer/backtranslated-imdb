Waterdeep (2006) **** "It's indifferent ... it's there waiting for you to make a slip up." These (paraphrased) words may be the best sum of the nature of the ocean I've ever heard whisper. His fury is limitless, no less than his loneliness. These words come from the mesmerizing and moving documentary Deep Water. It's the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur mariner who participated in the 1969 Sunday Times Race around the world. If you do not know his story, maybe you should stop reading now. Do not read this or any other information about Crowhurst or the Race. Find the movie and just watch. <br /> <br /> After the first circumnavigation of the ocean in 1967, adventurers and adventurers began to look for the next. This time, the journey would have to be made without landing or stopping along the way. Having fallen on hard times, Crowhurst saw the race as a great chance to recover the family. He had been through financial difficulties as a child and wanted to participate in such a life. Then he set off to find sponsors, and soon did on Stanley Best and Rodney Hallworth. The two men spelled the potential cow in cash and granted Crowhurst a boat, with the proviso that if he gave up the run he would be forced to pay the expenses. His boat, however, was in serious need of repairs, and feared that he would not be ready in time for the final day of departure. He was informed however by his sponsor that he simply must go? after all, they devoured the mass and hoped it would come back many times. <br /> <br /> The details of the story are infamous: Crowhurst's boat began to drink, and his progress slowed to a trail. Faced with the decision to try to circumvent the Horn of Africa (certain death on such a boat) or go back (financial devastation and destitution), he sought a third option. He chose to hide, alone on his yacht, waiting for other competitors to encircle Cape Horn in South America. From there, he would join the race. He reported false positions and hit speed records. Then he stopped all communication for fear that his position would be donated. He also had to meticulously build fake books for each day of a journey he did not. Finally, the loneliness, the guilt, and the realization that he would probably be caught weighed too heavily on Crowhurst. His last notes make a Kurtz's thoughts seem totally sound. Just a few weeks from home, he turned the boat away from home, and it is reported that he jumped into the sea soon after. Crowhurst's odyssey is fascinating, and its ending is bleak, but it is inevitable. Our dreams often turn into fears, and the consequences of our actions often leave us with few options for a happy ending. It is a story of a descent into madness, brought about by the infinite abyss of the cruel seas. Filmmakers do a wonderful job of telling this story. It's ridden with chilling audio and video recordings made by Crowhurst and narrations of his increasingly mad log notes. The story begins slowly and may distract some viewers, but the rewards of the story are worth it as it goes. <br /> <br /> There are also inquiries about some of the other competitors, such as Frenchman Bernard Moitessier, who was on the same level to win the speed contest, only to leave and start a second trip around the world. Also in the film is Robin Knox-Johnston, who was the winner of the competition. He donated his cash prize to the Crowhurst family. <br /> <br /> Reading briefly about the Crowhurst saga simply does not do it justice. It's interesting, of course, but quick navigation overcomes the raw emotions and strangeness presented here. The final moments of Deep Water are genuinely heart-breaking, listening to the thoughts of your widowed family and the worship and understanding of your friends. This is a fascinating story, and this is what brings the documentary to great channels.
