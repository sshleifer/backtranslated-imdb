If you think piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) in Michael Haneke's film "LA PIANISTE" is the ultimate degree in the embodiment of derangement, perversion and darkness, I have news for you: the piano teacher in Elfriede's novel Jellinek "LA PIANISTE" (on which the film was based) is twice as "repulsive," "disgusting," "demented," and even more fascinating - though there are not enough words to translate the level of artistic proficiency that Isabelle Huppert achieved here , above all other deadly actresses in action today. And who else could have played this character with such emotional power, complete with the best piano playing / dubbing an actor could deliver? In the novel as in the film, there are two great antagonists to the "heroine" Kohut: his own mother (Annie Girardot, with a wonderful wreckage voice, in a part originally intended for Jeanne Moreau) and herself Austria. The mother embodies Jellinek's perception of her native Austria as a country that deceptively and perversely encourages racist / fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional repression, and, let us say, the Ã¼bermensch ideals that are impossible to maintain today without the danger of a mental breakdown. <br /> <br /> "La Pianiste" also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue: how dangerous it is to reveal your most intimate fantasies to the one you love. We tend to think that our own sexual fantasies must be as exciting to others as to ourselves, which can become a huge, embarrassing, and sometimes tragic mistake. Here, Kohut learns (?) The lesson of the most painful and humiliating of the ways. It should be mentioned that Elfriede Jellinek is one of the most well-known and praised authors in Austria and Europe (well, now she has a Nobel Prize!) and autobiographical passages can be inferred in her novel, already that she herself was a pianist and had a supposedly difficult relationship with her mother. The novel also includes long passages about Kohut's childhood and adolescence, so you kind of understand how she has become who she is now. Haneke chose to hide this information in the film, forcing us to imagine how it could be like that (do not we all know an Erika Kohut out there?). But he preserves very well the fabric of the book in his film: unbearable honesty, to the point where painful "horrendous" feelings arise - envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hatred, misery, sadism, masochism, selfishness, perversion, etc. All of them unmistakably human. <br /> <br /> I thought "La Pianiste" was a deeply moving, very disturbing and thought-provoking film with a handful of unforgettable scenes, and that's all I ask. movies. He also made me buy and be happy for the book, discover a fantastic author I had not read before, and listen again to Schubert - so, thanks to Haneke, Jellinek and Isabelle !!! On the other hand, if you are looking for light entertainment, please stay away. My Rating: 9 out of 10
