I was a big fan of Asterix comics when I was a kid and watched them all. I've never heard of this movie when it was released, but I watched it with my kids last night. I remembered the comic enough to know that much was added to the movie's story. Some of the changes I thought were a bit chinky (like the nephew's 'modern' dance, and the viking chief's daughter - almost everything about it), but I found it more fun enough. More importantly, seeing the reactions as my kids watched it, confirmed that the movie pleased their target audience. As a family movie, it works better than other Asterix titles I've seen. Many of the names that were not in the book I found had the same appeal as those that were. Overall a nice family movie, regardless of whether you are a fan of asterisks or not.
