"The Love Letter" is a rather pleasant, very discreet romantic comedy in which the use of the few right words in a mysterious love letter reveals the passions and secret yearnings of the sleepy city dwellers by the sea. <BR> It's not for everyone. "The love letter," I feel, benefits from its simple, quiet tone. Never intentionally crazy and fake as most romantic comedies are quaint, quaint and comfortable. However, for these same reasons, many viewers will be bored and disinterested. <br /> <br /> The cast is cool. It's great to see Tom Selleck again, and it's such an understated role. And it's hard to believe this is the same Kate Capshaw we met 15 years ago in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Destiny." She is naturally good here; improving on all the roles I've seen in her since Indy's nerves. And is it possible that Capshaw is getting more adorable and adorable with age? (What is it about Spielberg?) <br /> <br /> It does not amount to much; but after another noisy season of summer movies, I'll probably look back with a brief fondness for this light-hearted novel.
