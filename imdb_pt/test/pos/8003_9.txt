Tim Burton, the man behind the original Batman movie and Beetlejuice, brings to the world the sequel to Batman, which exceeds the original in more ways than one. Firstly, Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batman's enemies. The dark, deadly, sexy Catwoman works well to shock a few heads inside the story and penguin works the same way the joker worked on the original. The sets are impressive and immaculate. The city of Gotham has so many dark alleys that you could never know what is happening at one time or another. The only thing that gives you a bad name is your script, which sometimes seems to expire and then not recover for the time being. Tim Burton's direction bring superhero movies to a new realm. Beat all Superman movies and other Batman movies by a mile. Although in terms of accomplishment, the new Batman begins has a bite where this one lacks, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.
