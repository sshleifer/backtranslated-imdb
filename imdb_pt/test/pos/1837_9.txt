I love this movie. At first, I had not expected much from this movie since I did not hear anyone talking about it and it looked like it was on video right after it was opened in theaters. I also did not think David and Minnie would make a good couple on the screen. (I've been expecting a lot from couples onscreen since I've seen "You've Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan). Personally, I think Joely Richardson should have played the part of Minnie and vice versa. I do not know, I just think Joely should have stayed longer in the movie with David. They looked perfect for each other. But that only shows that in a movie, the girl next door always catches the face. :) (as in "While You Were Sleeping"). I was very wrong. This movie was fantastic !!! Everything was done brilliantly. Bonnie Hunt did a great driving job. The lines were perfect with the wispy cracks everywhere. <br /> <br /> *** ATTENTION: AHEAD SPOILERS !!! *** I love how everything intertwined with each other. For example, at first, Elizabeth and Bob were talking about going to Italy and, in the end, Bob meets Grace in Italy. Sydney (the monkey) doing the hand thing with Grace as he did with Elizabeth is an example as well. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING: SPOILERS END NOW !!! One thing I did not like about the movie was a bit unrealistic. Well, I just do not think a man could outdo his wife in a year when she was the only woman he's ever been with all his life. You would think that he would isolate himself from the world for years before he ever left his home to talk to anyone. Instead, he goes out on a blind date a year later and falls instantly in love with a woman he has never seen in his life but feels a connection with. <br /> <br /> Above all, it was a splendid movie. It made me cry two or three times, and it made me laugh countless times (the scene in Bob's picky restaurant for bottled water was hilarious!). It's definitely up there with great romantic comedies like "You Have Mail," "Sliding Doors," and "While You Were Sleeping." <br /> <br /> WILL RENT IT TODAY !!
