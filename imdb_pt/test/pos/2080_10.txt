I saw several Hamlets, and I taught the piece. As I observe Jacobi, I am tempted to think that he is as intelligent as Hamlet himself, so alive is he to all the nuances of this character's intelligence. He deepens, instead of solving, all the puzzles relating to the character of Hamlet. It illuminates line after line, word after word, illuminating this sparkling mind. At the same time, however, we shrink from the horror that Hamlet feels for his betrayal - much more than any other actor - because Jacobi feels the pain more deeply than anyone else. And we tremble at Hamlet's own betrayals, because Jacobi is not afraid of the baseness with which Hamlet can descend. In short, Jacobi gives us Hamlet in its entirety, and Hamlet in its entirety is the greatest character in literature. That's why I'm convinced Jacobi's Hamlet is the best performance I've seen for an actor.
