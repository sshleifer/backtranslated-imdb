Coming into this movie, I was a bit wary. I've always been a little dubious about claymation movies. I've always enjoyed decent animated movies, but claymation has always been different to me. But this one took me by surprise. Wallace and Gromit are extremely adorable characters, and it's a great story with jokes for all ages. There are joking jokes / silly fart for children and subtle ones, but on the heads of young children, play for us older people. Very well organized and while the story had holes, it kept my interest starting to run out. <br /> <br /> It is so rare to find pure and uncorrupted humor these days, this movie was even more refreshing. Wallace and Gromit will do what is normal, which HUMANLY exterminates the insects that ruin people's vegetable crops. But this time they find themselves struggling against some form of a huge rabbit that their humanly constructed traps can not keep under their flaps. Great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun. If you have not exposed yourself to Wallace and Gromit, I highly recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I rate him as 7 and not as major is because it is still a family movie and I do not have kids. . I liked it, but if I was watching with some carpet mice and my wife, it would be at least a 9 for sure! Give it a try!
