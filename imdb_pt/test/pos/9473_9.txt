I just took my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this movie and I can not remember a movie where I laughed a lot - literally loudly, laughing because this movie is hilarious. Granted the plot is predictable, but the ride is so extremely enjoyable no matter what you know how it will end. The comic timing senses of the actors were impeccable. The actors were perfectly cast. My children have mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be the last of the young actresses who are not ruining their lives. She is so refreshing. My kids said this is now their favorite movie of 2006. Our money was well spent on this movie.
