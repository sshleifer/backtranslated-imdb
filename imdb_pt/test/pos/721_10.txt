This is a cult classic for sure !! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's hard to follow, but it's also a movie like the Jacobs Ladder or even the Fight Club. If you want normal fare, then I think I'll rent the movie Care Bears or maybe an old Disney classic. But if you want to "see the world differently," then I would say that you open yourself to Enigma and to the film that challenges what we see and think. <br /> <br /> For me, the key is that the film was original and made me question everywhere. So while I saw some complaints, though I would say get the movie for what it is and enjoy.
