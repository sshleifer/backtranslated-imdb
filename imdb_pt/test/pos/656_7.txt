This is an interesting and hard-to-find movie from the early '70s, starring Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who does not cut like a Marine. Dressed in 'baby blue' outfits to humiliate them while they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent away. Vincent stops at a bar and meets a young Richard Gere, who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a "Raider" of the Navy. Gere's character is already tired and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of Vincent's innocence, stealing his 'baby blue' uniform after leaving him drunk and hitting him in an alley. Vincent's character, whose name is Marion, takes Gere's clothes and is suddenly transformed into a Navy Raider. Marion enters Wyoming and stops in a small town of Norman Rockwell. At the local caf√©, he meets Rose Hudkins, who immediately catches his eye. Staying with Hudkins' parents, Marion attracts all sorts of attention from the city's residents. Mr. Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Navy 'Raider' can still be so innocent. The story also brings the Japanese International Camps, as the people of the city will "hunt" 3 fugitives. Marion is accidentally shot during this hunt. But there is still a happy ending that has confused me a bit. I would have preferred a bit more drama! Anyway, this captures the VMY at the height of their performances in the 70s. BUSTER AND BILLIE, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid-70s were incredibly good performances by the VMY. He was both an action star and a beating heart at the same time !!! He made a lot of quality movies during his career, and continued to do so in the mid-'80s with the great TV show Airwolf. He does a pretty good job at it as 'Hedge', quietly observing the way people treat him (in his uniform) as he travels across the country. He must have performed some of the stunts too - there's a harrowing scene at the end of the movie - and it looks like he's the guy being thrown downstream for me! But really, at the height of its popularity, this movie could have done a lot more with the talent and the appearance of VMY. Innocence can only be so interesting. The evil, as explored in "Buster and Billie", is much more dramatic! Anyway, Glynnis O'Connor is as gorgeous as Rose. The whole look of the film is like a painting by Norman Rockwell. The outdoor scenes are beautiful - they must have been filmed in Canada.
