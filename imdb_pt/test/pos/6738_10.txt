One of my favorite movies. Great cast, led by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious drama situations with bright comic punches. An exact blend of character and story. Real people with real problems, and everyone has a different relationship with each family member. Sensitively moves from a little sad to amusingly fun. Read the quotes. This is the best adaptation of a Neil Simon piece. <br /> <br /> If you want to see more of Eugene, make sure Biloxi Blues (starring Matthew Broderick, who played in both versions) is OK, a little more somber. Get away from the made for TV Broadway Bound.
