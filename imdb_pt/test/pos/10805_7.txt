I was very curious to see this tour of Wajda-Depardieu, and the time period is definitely fascinating. Being a fan of Wajda, I was disappointed, and this may be a euphemism. The film never really had a movie flight - there is no basis for the animosity between Danton and Robespierre, etc. <br /> <br /> Basically, the script was weak (adapted from "The Danton Affair"). And yet, the direction was masterful ... it's Wajda, after all! In addition, there were some incredible actors, but they never draw the public's attention as they should. Depardieu is a Danton almost goofy and indifferent ... not exactly the image we have in mind. Woijech Pzsoniak is incredible as usual, but again the script puts limits even talented actors can not break. Andrzej Seweryn and Bogoslaw Linda arise ... like Bourdon and Saint-Just ... and if you're familiar with Wajda then you'd know them. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was disappointed by this. much praised film. Great cast, great director, but no quality base. Bad script, not dynamic. We need to get into the mentalities of Danton (Walesa) and Robespierre (General J) ... what are your motivations? Uh ... who knows? One likes women, the other gets along? Riiight Ok, so if you're looking for a great French Revolution film I recommend "La Revolution Francaise" ... it's in two parts and oh-so-great! Great performances, intricate script, juicy bits of tid ... definitely a satisfying experience !! Klaus-Maria Brandauer is a much better Danton than Depardieu ... the wonderful Andrzej Seweryn apparently took some notes from "Danton" and is BRILLIANT as Robespierre. LOOK! NOW! As for Wajda fans - you're better off with "Man of Iron / Marble," "Promised Land," and stuff like that. Cheers!!
