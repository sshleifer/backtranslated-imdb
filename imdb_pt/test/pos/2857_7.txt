As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by revenge killers Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her sense of reality is totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite opera soap. In a state of complete denial and illusion, Betty physically and mentally escapes from her unhappy and small town life to search for "Dr. David Ravell" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of "A Reason to Love," a novel set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles. Immune to reality, Betty arrives in Los Angeles and becomes "Nurse Betty" while trying to belong to the hospital world of her dream lover. Meanwhile, the angry Charlie and Wesley trace Betty, convinced that she is a dangerous witness who also knows about her compromising relationships with Del. <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty creates comedy and suspense in contrast to extreme innocence and optimism of the main character. with the obvious hypocrisy and violence that surrounds it. By clearly defining the difficult life of the protagonist, Nurse Betty justifies the character's tendency to move away from reality. So, while offering a commentary on the novel's popularity within the film, Nurse Betty also commented on the widespread addiction of television and its celebrities. In addition, Nurse Betty benefits from the effective manipulation of her protagonist's mental state, particularly in those scenes in which she can not distinguish between "Dr. David Ravell," the character, and George McCord (Greg Kinnear), the actor who interpret Betty's inability to recognize George as an actor leads to funny misunderstandings, which emphasize the magnitude of her delusional state. However, despite these successes, Nurse Betty suffers from the worrying characterizations through which narration evolves. For example, while Charlie and Wesley are consistently portrayed as a comic pair, the brutality of their actions weakens any sense of appreciation or acceptance that the viewer may have initially experienced. Likewise, although the early scenes establish Del as an obnoxious man, the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers outweigh all the humiliation and violence he inflicted on his wife Betty. <br /> <br /> Finally, at the end of the movie Charlie undergoes awkward transformations while developing an obsession for Betty; an obsession that results in noble feelings of love and that ultimately destroys him. Consequently, since the roles of the characters as victims are inconsistent, the processes of victimization in the story seem random and not substantial. All in all, Nurse Betty's indeterminacy - instead of creating suspense - weakens her characters and pollutes her plot. <br /> <br />
