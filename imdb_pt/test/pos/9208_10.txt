I would like to vent my displeasure on NBC Canceling Las Vegas. The show was Top Notch in the last 5 years. Tom Sellecks was great too. He really brought a new addition to the show. What does NBC have now? Lame reality and night game show. I mean, let's keep the old, tired law and order? Not even putting Jack McCoy as DA can keep the show interesting. Are we going to keep quality programs like Deal or No Deal or ED? ER should be placed for pasture. NBC is worse now than in the days of pre-Seinfeld Cheers. With cable and the internet, NBC can not afford to fall flat on the floor. PLEASE, TAKE BACK VEGAS! I remember when Homicide Life on the Street ended the way it happened. At least they had a final two hours. Hey, CBS, are you listening? Please, get Vegas is a great show.
