This relic from before the days of the Production Code and the Hays Office is good fun, not great, but fun. <br /> <br /> Based on a song by Rogers & Hart that was a huge success at the time, the story revolves around the ballroom girl Barbara Stanwyck, who is dated by the wealthy businessman Ricardo Cortez (who was indecently handsome) , but whose heart belongs to his neighbor of free-scholar, Monroe Owsley. She and Owsley get married, but keep it a secret while she fires Cortez, who still has hope. She helps her husband get a job at the Cortez company, but married happiness quickly sour when Owsley develops a taste for high life and goes out with a college boyfriend and bets on the high stakes bridge (yes, I know, it's pretty funny ... ..). Finally he deflects $ 5,000 from Cortez, and is about to go ahead, when his devoted wife goes to Cortez ... and I will not reveal anything else, although the ending is certainly a surprise. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the best thing about this movie; in one of her early roles, she is well accomplished. Owsley is the weak spot; He is unattractive and whiny, while Cortez is incredibly soft and sexy, while his performance is sincere, but it is not noteworthy. <br /> <br /> Although it is a drama, it is full of laughs, many of them inadvertent, since some elements of this film have aged a lot. bad. But there are many good spirits; at one point Stanwyck tells Cortez, "My brain is at my feet while yours is at ..." This is very suggestive for 1931! There are a lot of obscene and suggestive things in this movie in the last days before the Code close and bleach it all. A fun antiquity, a good reminder of how far we have not come in 70 years ... that story could easily be changed to fit in 2003, but could keep the basic plot, with the original ending, in place.
