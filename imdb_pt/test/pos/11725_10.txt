I am a fan of B 80 degree movies in which the hero is a bad guy, a strong man who finds love - and this movie delivers! <br /> <br /> In the end you do not know how Sharky will not be killed (and he does not take a beating! Realistically portrayed I believe). However, it does and is not through some stunt "Die Hard" exaggerated. The 'past' team with whom he works comes together, hence the title. Your team is made up of all the characters - people at the front line at work because they do not fit well. These portraits are funny and friendly - they have a real feeling for them. They are up against an ice man from a killer, with a good team of his own. The result is a great film noir.
