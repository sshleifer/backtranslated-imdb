For me, Storm and its characters (like the admirable ones) are like old friends. Since I began to experience the piece through acting classes (I played Ferdinand) I found myself immediately involved in the fantastic world that Shakespeare created. I can clearly remember a student who decided not to play with Ferdinand, so I took the stage and had the honor of playing an excellent Miranda. <br /> <br /> One of the virtues a great friend has is that you can never know them completely - there is always something you can discover about their character. A film production of The Tempest of Quality is thus like a visit to an old friend, loved by the heart: each visit presents a new perspective on the memory we had of work. With Prospero's Books, the ritual and elegance of the play was emphasized, the exuberant celebration of art within art. Here we see a vision as esoteric mysticism, with carefully crafted interiors, filled with candles and chalk diagrams on the floor, more Aleister Crowley than the nobleman of Naples. It also made me reconsider - why was Prospero expelled from Naples? Its magical power is so palpable in this production that it makes one wonder whether it was only the policy that condemned Prospero to exile, but rather the fact of his difference from his peers. Then in the real world he suffered. He was expelled, impotent to change the wrong to the right. All the villains in this play, whether they realize it or not, act according to the creation of a hell of a world full of pain - it is always in the interest of the oppressor to make life on Earth closer to hell. But Prospero manages to bring these earthly villains to his island, the realm where he has dominion (absolute). <br /> <br /> Shakespeare brings his audience to the theater, the kingdom where Shakespeare dictates the events, the words, the results. Shakespeare is of course Prospero - but what this film adaptation really honors the text is to make Prospero so sympathetic to such a figure of reason, despite the fact that he is surrounded by what society calls irrational (astrological texts, alchemical symbols, diagrams magicians, etc.). Is it more rational to be a man of cloth and murder, or to be a heretic and work to correct the mistakes? Prospero is a heretic because he abandons his magic not because books will lose their value in Naples, but because they are no longer needed - the world itself - has become the magic of books. <br /> <br /> In Hamlet, Hamlet presents a play to his peers. The play accuses his companions of conspiring against others by their own advancement. The audience's reaction varies: while Ophelia is perplexed, Claudio reacts with a stunned shock. It happens inside the play, and then Shakespeare plays the part for the men of his time. Was Shakespeare aware of their reactions? In the storm, Prospero lives the piece he is building and we live with it. How do we react? Do you react with simple pleasure to the happy ending? Are you upset and shocked by the strangeness of this production, which is entirely appropriate given the source material? Do you feel sad that this little life, the play, is rounded with a sleep, as transient as eternal? The tragedy is that Shakespeare creates a paradise of reason and hope for the life of mankind on Earth, but man is weak and unwilling to realize this in favor of small power struggles. We have Claudius. <br /> <br /> As a good friend, this movie is not flawless. I do not agree with the choice of painting some scenes entirely in blue. The sailors dance is quite tangential. But deep down this is truly the storm, and one of its many faces.
