If you have not seen it yet, look for it. It is available on DVD. It is a production of channel 4 (uk) possibly together with the German and Danish TV. If you've seen the movie, it's basically the same plot. Several interspersed stories are connected through the drug trade. The story jumps between the housewife (played by the excellent Lyndsay Duncan) trying to conclude an agreement on behalf of her husband, who to her surprise is an international drug dealer (and usually a dangerous man). <br /> <br /> The minister, who is involved in his work to the detriment of his family, is investigating the state of affairs with international drug trafficking. He opens a few eyes to the reality of the heroine when his daughter ends up having a "problem". He then visits Pakistan officially where he seems to be taught that abuse (not simply the drug or his casual use) is the problem and also manages to prove some products (an excellent scene where he simultaneously perceives what the attraction is and why is and why this is a problem). In Pakistan we see the other side. The desperation of farmers who can barely survive, turning to opium production and crime lords. The useless attempts of subsidy, resulting in the system getting rich. And a country so drenched with drugs, but only a relative fraction of the abuse we have in the West. Around all of this, a customs / interpol agent attempts to capture the 'Dutch' connection in smuggling heroin. Seeking justice for his murdered partner. This really is a work of art. Super, unobtrusive performances by all the major actors in a way that only European cinema can really do. A must see. Especially if you've seen the movie, they complement each other and feature some subtly different opinions / attitudes on both sides of the pond.
