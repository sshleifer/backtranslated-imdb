While I completely agree with drvn below about Mary McCormack releasing a sack of milk on TV, the rest of the show is fantastic! Phil Hartman was great in a professorial way, teaching celebrities the intricacies. Foley is crazy, but in a good way. You never know the derogatory mood that he will invent. As for the game, it's fun, full of witty jokes and great for any beginner who may have even an interest in the game. Too bad you're not connected anymore :( I just checked the timeline all the way through August and it does not seem to be scheduled for any time in the future.
