I was just looking up "who's going to love my kids" to buy when I came across this site and an entry made by a British colleague! I'm a big fan of this movie and would recommend it to everyone. What I find reassuring is finding someone who also finds solace in the goodwill of others. I also have a child with Aspergers (among other things) and it is also a fear of me to think that if something happened to me and my husband, that someone would not just want to stay with my beautiful 'normal' daughter, but my special and talented son also. Missing yourself at home and being able to relate to people created with the same values ​​that I have more meaning than you imagine. Living here in the US, I have not met anyone who has seen this movie yet. So for all of you who are reading this, if you have not seen it yet, make an effort to do so. It is a very touching experience, especially for any parent, or even if you have just a nice bone in your body, you will cry and beg. After that, you will count your blessings, And for anyone who has ever had an experience like this, or close to it, my heart goes to you. It makes me realize, no matter how difficult or stressful it is, just remember that there is always someone worse than you. An incredible movie and what makes it more powerful is the fact that it is based on a true story. Do not be discouraged by how sad it is, at the same time as this movie is the warmth of the heart, and makes you feel encouraged by the strength and kindness of humanity.
