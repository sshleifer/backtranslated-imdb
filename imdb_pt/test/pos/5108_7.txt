Thirty years after the classic 1939 film won an Oscar for Robert Donat and made Greer Garson a star, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" overcame a myriad of problems before stumbling to the screen in this musical version. The original stars Rex Harrison and Samantha Eggar were replaced by Richard Burton and Lee Remick, who in turn were fortunate in favor of - thankfully - Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. Andre Previn's score was rejected, and the one that ended up being used was - unfortunately - Leslie Bricusse. First director Herbert Ross received the monumental task of turning a simple love story - that of a man for both his wife and his students - into a big-budget extravaganza. The fact of succeeding, despite the many obstacles in its path, is a proof of its two stars. Arthur Chipping is a Latin teacher at Brookfield, a boys' school on the outskirts of England, where he himself was educated. Introverted and socially unfit, he is dedicated to his students but unable to inspire them. Before the summer break, a former student takes him to a London music hall to watch a show starring Katharine Bridges, the young woman with whom he hopes to marry. The post-performance meeting is unpleasant for everyone, and Chips - as it is commonly known - leaves to explore some of the ancient ruins of Italy. Unexpectedly, he encounters Katharine, who booked a cruise in the Mediterranean to give her time to mourn a failed love affair and reflect on the direction of her career. In the time they spend together, she discovers a gentle and gentle man beneath the confused exterior and, upon returning to London, pursues him seriously. When the fall period begins, Chips returns to Brookfield with his young bride, and the two settle into a quiet domestic life. Complications arise when aspects of Katharine's past surface, and again when World War II intrudes into their lives, but Chips is reinforced by the support of his wife, and his newfound confidence makes him a favorite among students. <br /> <br /> In addition to some musical interludes - the delightful production number of the music hall "London is London" and Katharine's declaration of love, "You and I" - most of Bricusse's songs, some of them with narration as the characters explore their songs. emotions, are easily forgettable and in no way improve the film. Eliminate the score completely and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" works great as a drama. Terrence Rattigan's script retains elements of the original as it expands and updates in a few decades. He created several scenes between Chips and Katharine who beautifully outline their mutual devotion and infuse some with comic relief, courtesy of Katharine's friend and cohort, former actress Ursula Mossbank (delightfully played by Sian Phillips, O'Toole's real-life wife in time). He also captures life in a British public school - the equivalent of a private academy here in the United States - with infallible perfection. Ross does well as a director for the first time, generously sprinkling the film with breathtaking photos. moments - the sequence of opening credits, during which the school's anthem echoes in the school's vast stone corridors, perfectly defines the tone of the film. Costumes and sets are true for the period. Students, interpreted by non-professionals who were enrolled in school as Brookfield, deal well with their various small support functions. <br /> <br /> The highest praise is reserved for Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark in the lead roles. . O'Toole has long been established as a first-rate drama actor, so his Oscar-nominated performance comes as no surprise. Clark, a veteran of about two dozen B movies in the UK and last year's "Finian's Rainbow", is absolutely luminous as the music hall soubrette who abandons a theatrical career in favor of life as a teacher's wife. Her golden voice enriches her songs and almost allows us to ignore just how insipid most of them are, and she more than equals O'Toole in their dramatic scenes together. The chemistry between the two is palpable and leaves us no doubt that this is a very passionate couple. <br /> <br /> This version of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is not a classic like its predecessor but hardly the disaster that many critics described when it was released. Ignore punctuation, focus on the performances and enjoy the atmosphere Ross put on the screen. It's a nice way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love.
