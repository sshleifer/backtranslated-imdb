Forgive the Franklins is the best movie I've seen in years. The acting was fantastic .. especially Mari Blackwell, who was truly remarkable in the role of Peggy Lester. She brought Peggy to life with incredible skill and made her as real as my neighbor. I also liked Robertson Dean in his father's role ... he's a true professional, and managed to pull even the most intimate scenes with a rare grace. The performances of the whole cast were very good, excellent indeed, but the role of Peggy as played by Blackwell made the film. The cinematography was very well made and was very impressive. The only criticism I have to offer is a slight weakness of the final scenes, which were overly prolonged, repetitive, and somewhat focused on the wrong character. I would like to see him finish with a pardon note ... but despite this little flaw, it's well worth watching and applauding everyone involved in the process.
