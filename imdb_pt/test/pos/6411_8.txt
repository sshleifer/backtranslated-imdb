In the middle of The Hole, I sent an email to a friend of mine to summarize it. Not sure if the movie would break into a series of submissive gestures, I felt a little not-easy to recommend it, but then I saw the end. Is perfect. I've been living in Korea for 6 months, and this movie could easily sum up the strange boredom and frustration of any Asian metropolis that faces Taiwin here. He uses the myth of Hong Kong musicals in the same way that Godard or Hartley use Western musicals, but takes it to the extreme, it's the gritty world, and occasionally Kafka-esquire logic makes it all better. I really feel that the closest comparison to The Hole is Hal Hartley's Surviving Desire, but it has a bleak edge to what are hopefully and metaphorically weird movies. Anyway, that's what I wrote to Esther. I hope you like The Hole too. <br /> <br /> Hey, watching a movement called a hole. Taiwan, I think it seems a bit strange for China, unless it's Hong Kong. Worth seeing so far. It's about a guy and a girl in an apartment complex. the roof of the face collapses and the girl starts to get irritated and well, it is kind of a strange metaphor for the pleasure, the disintegration and the pain of a very intense passion. there's also a kind of virus-zombie sub-plot and lots of weird scenes where the girl acts on her desires through pretty innocent, half-fun doo-wop sequences. worth a look.
