As with all of Haneke's films, make your own decision - do not be influenced by what you read and if you are interested in someone who uses the medium for their own unique purposes, see for yourself. Isabelle Huppert is awesome in this movie - combined with Haneke, these two never pull their punches. Haneke engages us with the attraction of the golden boy, Benoit Magimel, but this is an anti-romance, as far as Funny Games was an anti-thriller. You will have to force yourself to observe much and the catharsis is much more in reach of constant anxiety than any kind of emotional release, but it is incredibly nervous and thought-provoking; Haneke continues to mirror in how desensitized Western civilization is or has become. People can turn their noses at this, but just get what Solondz did in Happiness a few steps further on. Although grounded in reality, much of what Erika (Huppert) does can be seen as an emotional metaphor. I'm not recommending this, but I would not dissuade you too ... it definitely divides people, but given that it's largely about repression - this comes as no surprise.
