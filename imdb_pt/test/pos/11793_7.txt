ALICE is the kind of movie they did in the '30s and' 40s. It never tries to be an 'event'. Just want to entertain. And that happens. I was surprised by Kiefer Sutherland. In a role that could be a clich√©, he made it real. The plot makes allusions to ALICE IN WONDERLAND. A guy dressed in white goes through a hole and Kiefer falls. Like ALICE, the plot revolves and turns, but with a freshness you do not see in small movies. I loved the direction, Sutherland, just a very fast and interesting film.
