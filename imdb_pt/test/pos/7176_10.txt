This is a documentary unlike any other. It has so many layers and shows us so much that trying to analyze everything at once is almost impossible. Documentary filmmaker William Greaves shows us the process of making films from a different perspective. We see the fights of the actors, the director, the sound crew and all the others who try to stay there and make this film successful. If this was just about a movie being made, it would be ordinary. What Greaves does is make it more complex to have a team filming the actors, and then this will be filmed by another team, just so that another team films the whole thing. Three cameras, each with a different goal. It has an almost vertiginous effect on you, but at the same time it is exciting. I like the parts where the team organizes itself and discusses what is happening. Even they are a bit in the dark as to what Greaves is trying to do. Half sees this as an experience, while the other half views it as a chaotic and confusing flaw. No matter which side you choose, you can not argue that Greaves does not involve you in this process.
