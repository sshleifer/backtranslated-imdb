If you want to see a real thriller, rent it !!! Not the director or screenwriter of "Scream," which does not feature exaggerated and overly paid "TV" actors as "stars," and it's not a special effects bargain from the factory. Instead, you will have a high-level, nervous, very strong (in violence), but exciting nailbiter.
