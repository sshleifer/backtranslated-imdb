It would be great if a discussion of this medium-sized movie was started with a brief tale about the hypocrisy of the Hollywood people. It was in 1988 that Chuck Norris watched this movie at the Cannes International Film Festival. He made a foolish remark by saying that The murder described in Dekalog 5 is far more effective than deaths that were filmed in his Hollywood movies with him as a potent action star. He was talking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in Kieslowski's film by a reckless psychopath who strikes it. There should be no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human society. That's why Chuck Norris's statement appears as a cruel joke that defends violent media in a society that is becoming increasingly restless. An honest reviewer would not be making a mistake if he said that Kieslowski's film "Dekalog: Dekalog, Piec (# 1.5)" has universal connotations. the events described in Dekalog 5 can happen anywhere in the world. The best lesson Kielowski gives us concerns the levels of violence that are acceptable in a just society. That is the reason why the brutal murder of an innocent taxi driver is capable of causing a sense of repugnance in us. We would not feel the same hatred for the homicide when he appeared in films with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme, because they look very artificial. It is easy to understand that special effects and modern studio techniques can enchant only children, but it does not make sense for serious movie enthusiasts. Kieslowski also advocates the helplessness of humans in rescuing fellow humans from the clutches of death and misery. particularly interesting as time and time again has been proven that strict laws and capital punishments have not been able to prevent homicide.
