I read the book before watching the movie and it made me emotionally exhausted, but I felt that it really transported me to Afghanistan, a culture about which I know very little. I had high hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint. I watched this with someone who did not read the book and he liked it too. They had to shorten a few things in the movie, but it was a well-executed and well-filmed movie. It leaves you thinking about the movie long after you finish. You feel for the characters and their difficulties. I highly recommend this movie for those who enjoy emotionally draining drama and want to experience the Afghan culture. There are some disturbing scenes that are not suitable for children to watch. It is a heavy drama portraying the horrors of life under a restrictive regime.
