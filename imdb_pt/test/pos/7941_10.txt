When I first saw this movie about 6 months ago, I considered it interesting, but little else. But you stayed with me. This interest grew and grew, and I wondered if my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual quality of VHS than with the movie itself. I bought the box box Criterion DVD, and it turns out that I was right the second time around. Alexander Nevsky is a great movie. It's exciting, and I'm sure it succeeded in its main goal: propaganda against the Germans. <br /> <br /> This is the most common criticism against this film, and against Eisenstein, who is merely a propagandist and nothing else. Is not true. He is an incredible movie artist, one of the most important who lived. So far, the world is far enough beyond Joseph Stalin to be able to watch Eisenstein's films as art.
