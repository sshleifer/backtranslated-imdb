On March 17, 1974, a man was found dead in the Penn Station bathrooms in Manhattan. Although well known, he can not be identified because he has scratched the personal information in his passport and his body remains unclaimed in the city morgue for three days. It ended up being the body of what many consider one of the greatest American architects of the twentieth century, Louis I. Kahn. He died at the age of 73, en route to India, where one of his largest projects, the Administration Institute in Ahmedabad, was nearing completion. <br /> <br /> One of the most influential post-war American architects. Louis Kahn's architectural legacy includes the House of Parliament in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth, the Yale Art Gallery, the Salk Institute in California and a kind of "musical boat", designed to give concerts in ports several cities around the world. <br /> <br /> Although celebrated as an architect, very little was known about his private life. In addition to his wife Ester and his daughter, Sue Ann, Kahn was left with two lovers, Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng, and their two children. All three families lived miles from each other in suburban Philadelphia, but their paths never crossed until the funeral. His son, Nathaniel, the director of that film, was only 11 at the time and had only a few memories of his father's weekly visits to Harriet Patterson, Nathaniel's mother in Philadelphia. Twenty-five years later, he sets off on a journey to confront his father, visiting Kahn's buildings, talking to relatives and colleagues, and visiting the places that played a part in Louis Kahn's life. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving confrontations is when Nathaniel asks his mother, a landscape architect and lover of Louis Kahn, why she kept playing the second violin for his wife and never confronted him with it. Tears shed her eyes, but she did not regret it. "Worth it." It is such an intensely sad moment. She is obviously broken, treated like a pariah at her funeral, that she has been forbidden to participate, it is almost as if she were living a surrogate life. Everything seems strangely unreal. Another interview with Edward Bacon, Kahn's architect archenemy in charge of rebuilding his native Philadelphia in the fifties and sixties, almost suffers a blow on the scene when he remembers Kahn's unpleasant ideas about architecture. His son, Nathaniel, listens uncomfortably when a very senior Bacon literally screams with rage whenever Kahn's name appears. The final scene is reserved for Kahn's greatest creation, the Capitol in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It took 23 years to complete, a vast and extraordinary building, of which the Bengal people are extremely proud. It is one of the few national symbols with stature in this impoverished nation. Some of the interviews with the locals brought tears to my eyes, especially when they discovered they were talking to - God forbid - the architect's own son! <br /> <br /> The film is as much a personal journey as it is an account of Kahn's great architectural legacy and, above all, about the enjoyment of the film itself and the production of films in general. Perhaps Louis I. Kahn has faltered as a father, but these shortcomings in his personal life create an even more interesting portrait in this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
