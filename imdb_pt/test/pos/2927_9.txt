I tell you, though it's funny how bad these words are. I'm sure the number of profanity and profanity would probably count up to about 200, because from what I last heard the most profanity in an episode of the south park is 165 counts of the word s ** t but outside that is so funny because in him there are profanities and also pedophiles throwing themselves in the head Watch this for their own survival also look for a mention of father cartmans and also the annoying voice of Chris Hanssseeeen and also kyle have to save cartman of pedophiles (the capture of a show of predator is also on the dateline) and they tracked a footprint and when they got there the footman "killed himself"
