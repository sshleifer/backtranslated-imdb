The pace of the movie is terribly slow in some parts, but if you can tune in to its languid speed and long silences, then it's a satisfying piece of courteous intrigue. The story of the first emperor of China, his love of childhood and the personal cost of power. The film is very atmospheric, the courteous and polite ceremony and ritual contrast with the brutal sudden violence. Shot in a way that evokes shadows and cool spaces. Battle scenes are rare and short, the focus is on the battle within the individual about what is right to do and whether the ends justify the means. The emperor's journey from the idealist pacifier to the ruthless tyrant aims to be subtle, but gives little or convincing persuasion on the emperor's motivation, in fact his actions and goals do not completely change, only the attitudes of Gong Li to him are changed. The most interesting performances are Gong Li and the titular Assassin, when they reevaluate when to fight, when to retreat, when to kill. The most expensive film ever made in China at the time, the Emperor and the Assassin do not depend on hysterical emotions or great battles, but on an atmosphere of threat and inevitability. Gong Li fans will not be surprised to know that she's as unbelievably beautiful as ever, giving a discreet performance.
