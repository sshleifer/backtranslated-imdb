Veterans of the Second World War return home and find it difficult to adapt to civilian life. This superb drama is expertly directed by Wyler and beautifully filmed by the celebrated director of photography Toland. Despite his nearly three-hour length, he does not drag himself for a minute. Sherwood's script features very human characters and great dialogue. Andrews may have his best role as a man struggling to survive. Also good Wright as a love-sick young man, Mayo as Andrews ragged wife and real-life veteran Russell as a man who lost both hands. However, the top honors go to March and Loy as a long married couple who face challenges while they meet again.
