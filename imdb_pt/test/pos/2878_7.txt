I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a good slasher / gore movie. Most death scenes are suitably brutal. The teenagers are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best in the group. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but does not bring much to the film beyond that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome destroyer. I saw the "twist" coming from miles away, but I still liked the movie. <br /> <br /> But what really stood out to me was the direction. Gregory Dark can actually have a career in legitimate movies before him. Besides the excessive use of the horror movie "speed cam" (you know, where, how does the face of the guy shake all the fasts?), There are good pictures here. The camera angles and environments really emphasize Kane's size, making him look even bigger than he really is. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a story or deep characters, this is not it. But that's not what slasher movies are about. If you're looking for good violence, or if you're into bloody movies, go check this out!
