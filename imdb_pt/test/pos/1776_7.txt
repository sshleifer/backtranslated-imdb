Directed by Jacques Tourneur and written by Phillip Dunne (As Green was My Valley), Anne of the Indies is a rather interesting adventure film. Her main character of Captain Anne Providence is based on a true pirate woman Anne Boney who actually lived and sailed across the Atlantic from the eighteenth century. The film begins with the battle at sea where Anne's (Jean Peters) pirate ship attacks a commercial ship that was en route to Europe from South America. As a result, a treasure trove of great value is captured along with a handsome officer Frenchman Pierre La Rochelle (Louis Jourdan), who is taken prisoner. Anne ends up falling in love with him and apparently his feelings are reciprocal, but it is only until she releases him when she discovers that he has a beautiful young wife Molly (Debra Paget), with whom he is very passionate. Anne begins to plan revenge on both, but in an unexpected turnaround of fate ends up making a great sacrifice in order to save them in their place. The cliché figure of the pirate film of `Blackbeard 'also appears here, this time played by Thomas Gomez. <br /> <br /> Although Anne of the Indies probably seems to be neither more nor less than a revisit of the movie pirate clichés, it still has its classic moments in beautiful visuals and sequences of sea battles filmed in Technicolor, as well as in some aspects of history and, above all, in personal touches in the direction of all this by Jacques Tourneur. 7/10
