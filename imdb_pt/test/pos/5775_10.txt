This movie I remember was a great movie! I watched on television when I was 11 and could not remember the title. As I recall, I believe it was a special Christmas TV movie. One of my friends at work and I had been discussing this for several years, but none of us could remember the title. But we remember almost the whole movie. No one else at work remembered seeing it! Thank goodness someone on a TV movie site replied to my post! Now I have the fun job of locating a copy of it! It's amazing what you can remember as a kid, but this movie definitely stays alive in my head ... even after 28 years. And I believe I only watched it once. Maybe it was because I'm the oldest sister in my family, or maybe because I got sick and worked in daycare, and stayed with me for a long time. Regardless of the real reason, it remained one of the movies that I have really wanted to watch lately !!! If anyone knows where to watch it online, or has a copy, please let me know. I would love to see it again !!!! Thank you! Seriously, I've tried posting this and it says my comment is not long enough. So, apparently I have to type more, did you know that Melissa Michaelsen is the sister of Peter Billingsley, who starred in A Christmas Story? I know I'm not the only fan of this movie, so if anyone has any idea where to find this I would greatly appreciate it.
