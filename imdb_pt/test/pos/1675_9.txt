Or vice versa. This is a French noir film directed by an American filmmaker (Jules Dassin) who had to leave the country for being blacklisted in Hollywood thanks to the HUAC. The premise of the story is quite familiar - a latest jewel stealing for Tony le Stephanois and his friends - and so is the end with everyone getting ... Well, there are no spoilers here, of course, since this is the kind of film in which the tension towards the end is important. <br /> <br /> Dassin filmed in realistic black and white lighting on the streets of Paris, using actors and actresses who are not glamorous. Georges Auric's attractive and intrusive soundtrack highlights the film and will remind viewers of many similar films of the forties and early fifties. Jean Servais plays the hardcore, a conspicuous leader in a fedora as far as Humphrey Bogart could have interpreted it. Tony is out of prison recently, beyond his heyday, but still hard and decisive when it has to be, his mind still sharp when focused, the kind of antihero whose eyes tear though the tears never fall. <br /> Dassin plays the Italian burglar and the pretentious ladies man who knows the rules but gets careless. <br /> <br /> In cinema noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify us with the bad guys. Often there are levels of thugs, the "good" bad guys we are identifying with and the "bad guys" who are ready to do on our good bad guys, and then maybe there is a bad one or a bad one. (Here we have Remi Grutter, played by Robert Hossein, a slightly sadistic junkie.) So there are the cops who are irrelevant or almost that. In the more modern movie, thugs are not even "good" thugs, and if they get out or something like that. In the old noir movie, which evolved from the 1930s gangster movies, the usual motto, following the old Hollywood code, was "Crime Not Paid," with every criminal having to pay for his crime before the crime. end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Probably the most impressive feature of Rififi is how the movie moves well. The plot unfolds quickly and perfectly, just as great filmmakers have always done, directors such as Stanley Kubrick, Louis Malle, and Hitchcock's best. Some actually compared this to Kubrick's The Killing (1956), and suggest that Kubrick stole it a little. Well, directors always steal if necessary, and there are perhaps some similarities, like being "a last round" for the protagonist, and making the girl mess up the works. The similarities can go deeper, because when this movie was coming to an end, I suddenly thought, oh, no! the suitcase in the back seat will get out of the convertible, hit the ground, blow up and all the money will fly into the air! Those of you who have seen The Killing can remember what happened to the money near the end of the movie! Which reminds me of another movie with something bad going on with the money: U Turn by Oliver Stone (1997), starring Sean Penn. There the money in his backpack is blown to pieces by a shotgun blast. Haha ha! Getting the dubbed version of this movie would be sacrilegious since the dialogue (when there are any: the assault itself is done entirely without dialogue, about 30 minutes in value) is concise and easy to follow, requiring only an occasional glance at the subtitles that, by the way, are quite utilitarian and guiding, rather than having each word spelled. <br /> <br /> Another thing: all brutality is made as sex used to be done in the movie, Camera. A guy's throat is cut off. We do not see it. I kind of like that approach. We do not have to see the blood. You can almost let your kids see Rififi - almost. <br /> <br /> Take this now and keep an eye on a Hollywood reprise starring Al Pacino and directed by Harold Becker next year, in which you can be sure that violent scenes will be played in the whole.
