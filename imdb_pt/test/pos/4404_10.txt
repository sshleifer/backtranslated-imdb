Thank God for the Coen brothers. His success brought bigger budgets, but it did not free them from his creativity. I had planned to see another movie, but I was exhausted, so I went to this one. When it started, I had forgotten which movie I was there to see. I was surprised in more ways than one. This movie is hilarious, but they do not make cheap jokes just to laugh. The writing is brilliant, and delivered with great skill by George Clooney (after that, no one can say he's just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. It can be enjoyed on many levels, whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I can not remember the last time I saw a movie that was so clever. I've seen others that I would describe as cute, intriguing, funny and charming, all of which also describe "Oh Brother", but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together at the end. You may feel that their journey is coming to something, but you can not say what. And the Coen brothers do not fail us, the end is certainly not disappointing. It's amazing, and it ties all loose ends, without using history.
