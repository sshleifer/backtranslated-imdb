The Sleeper Cell tries to swim on both sides of the pool (terrorism / American Muslim patriots), and this does not work very well. <br /> <br /> I postpone watching this show for a long time because I had a feeling that would be very predictable, but after a year in my netflix queue, I finally moved forward. <br /> <br /> The show is about a disguised Muslim man who works for the FBI in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the United States. The disguised agent of the show is indeed a Muslim, so we see his conflict / resolution between his Patriotism and his religious beliefs. Personally, I would rather watch a drama about an American muslin family living in the United States, but it is doubtful whether an American television channel (cable or network) ever produces something that shows Muslims a flattering light. <br /> <I am not a Muslim, but I have many American Muslim friends, and I can honestly say that none of them is a terrorist and everyone loves the United States. <br /> <br /> The Sleeper Cell comes close to breaking stereotypes of Muslims, but it also focuses on the worst Muslim stereotypes. In the first episode we see a "murder of honor", which is a very poor portrayal of Islam, but in the third episode we see a very respected moderate Muslim scholar teaching the viewer that the true Jihad is actually a personal struggle that is not to incite violence to others. <br /> <br /> If only the moderate Muslim scholar had been the main character of the program. <br /> <br /> Americans need to learn a lot more about Islam, the Sleeper Cell helps a bit, but it goes so far as to give the American public what it really needs to know. <br /> <br /> That said, the performance on this show is superb, and the drama is extremely captivating. If they had done this show about Islam in America without terrorism, it would have been first class.
