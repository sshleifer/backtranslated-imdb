It's a great movie for the whole family. I do not think many people have seen this because I ask people and they say they've never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister-in-law. My favorite scene is the whole movie, I can not even pick a favorite scene. My favorite character is Hubert, because he's a funny but clever dog. if anyone has not seen it, you are missing out on a great adventure. I only saw this because my aunt is related to Sophie and she received a copy of it. If someone is reading this I suggest buying the movie and I guarantee it will not be a bad decision. I've seen this movie about five times and every time it gives me the same message, dogs are as smart as people give them a chance.
