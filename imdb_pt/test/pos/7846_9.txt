The Beguiled is a very satisfying movie for those who stand behind the above things. For the diehard Clint Eastwood fans, it will be a disappointment. Although Eastwood does his best here in his atypical role (except for the fact that his character is a charming womanizer, which he does not know so badly), the ambiguous nature of his character, which ceases to be some kind of fallen hero. for a manipulative and insatiable woman's eater (to put it this way) will end up being too much for anyone accustomed to seeing him portraying heroes in the best western tradition, morally a little impure, but still without that dark side. I think he can take this improbable part, but those who actually steal the program are the two women rivals, the director Geraldine Page and the director of the students, played by Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> There is a potential devil in every man and a potential witch in all women, especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire. Hartman's Edwina is the sweetest and innocent girl in the world until she falls in love with John McBurney and becomes possessive with him. This is what causes the tragedy, as well as the director's secret lust, the forbidden fruit. She carries a big, ugly secret about her incestuous relationship with her brother, whom she clearly still idolizes. The fourth factor in this "profane" spiral of love is the wicked Carol, played by Jo Ann Harris, who draws John away from his passion for Edwina and her bed. <br /> <br /> The whole nature of the story gives this film a kind of gothic feel, which makes it a very rare thing in the western genre but a popular thing in the 1970s films. A unique achievement by the Siegel / Eastwood and a movie not for the most sensitive.
