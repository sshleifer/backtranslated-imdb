The king of Queens is a comic genius. Kevin James, who plays IPS delivery manager Doug Heffernan, is extremely funny, and Leah Remini, who plays Doug's wife, Carrie, is incredibly hot (# 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 list), and very funny. The real magic of the show However, it's the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they're the funniest show. Jerry, a comic book genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, who lives in the always cold basement of Doug and Carrie. I must admit I've never watched this show until this year, 2006. Whenever I flipped through it, it never seemed funny to me, but with the cancellation of Friends, Still Standing and Yes Dear, I needed a new comedy. In fact, giving the King of Queens a chance, I discovered that it was absolutely fantastic. So funny that I downloaded the first 7 seasons and watched every season in blocks of 8 hours. I strongly recommend to anyone who has not seen this treasure to check it out. You will not be disappointed.
