I have been a fan of Rik Mayall and Ade Edmednson since I remember their younger or younger children. and I have to say that I've never laughed so much in my life !!! Guest house paradiso is bloody brilliant! I know it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea (with vomit, slapstick comedy, violence and foul language), but then just do not watch it if it's not yours. it's not like nobody knows that sick and twisted things Rik and Ade make up when they're working with each other !! I think it's unfair that this movie has been so criticized by critics because, and I do not think I'm the only one to think that, this movie is 10 out of 10! :)
