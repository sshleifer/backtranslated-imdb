The process of Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This film does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges South Africa faces. I believe everyone should see this film as I think that few people outside of South Africa understand their past and what is being tried in the process of Truth and Reconciliation. Almost all countries have some part of their own history, which is still a source of continuous hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What is happening in South Africa should guide us all. I find it believable, touching and sometimes annoying. There were no performances of exceptional performance, but this added to the strength of the narrative. Once again the BBC has been instrumental in taking a complex topic and producing a first-class movie.
