I liked this movie, which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love-hate relationships, along with interspersed action scenes and a few lighthearted moments when mountain men fight the army's stern discipline. All main characters are well cast. It is true that John Wayne or Robert Mitchum probably could have played the leading role, but Victor Mature certainly appears as a kind of Tarzan who are fighting with their heads. It reminds me of his role in the cinema as Samson, another difficult man, but not impossible to tame. The men of the mountain in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism, as the era of pure mountain hunters ended 20 years earlier, with the collapse of populations of Western beavers, as well as the fashion market for beaver pelts This story supposedly occurs in Oregon just before the end of the Civil War. Judging from the volcano in the background of the opening scene (probably Mt. Lassen), the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote section of the Cascades, as we never see any other civilians. However, there is much conflicting evidence that this actually occurs in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! Red Cloud, the warlord who threatens hunters and soldiers at the fort, is the namesake of a very famous Sioux warlord who led a very successful campaign in 1865-66 to exterminate the newly built army strongholds in Wyoming and Montana. Fort Laramie (east of Wyoming) is mentioned as not being very far from the fictitious fort. The tribe of the Assiniboines plains are mentioning joining the Red Cloud. This aspect of history, then, bears a general resemblance to historical facts. <br /> <br /> It may be interesting to note certain similarities between the plot of this story and that of John Ford's "Fort Apache". In both cases, we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to his first frontier post with Native American problems. He underestimates the military courage of his opponents, considering them little more than cannon fodder to advance his career. In both films, he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy. Also in common, the green horn commander resents a subordinate who has long experience with local Native Americans and wants to tell him what it is wise to do and not do. . In both films, we have a romantic relationship between a woman very close to the heart of the commander and a subordinate, that the commander does everything to repress. Clearly, the commander must be eliminated to allow these novels to complete. <br /> <br /> I also see certain similarities with "The Misfits". Soldiers as a whole, including the commander, are mismatched (as one of them admits): most of them have "problems" or are inexperienced recruits with no experience of fighting Native Americans. The commander's wife is apparently the only woman. in or near any place near this fort, so it is inherently a mismatch, with a husband who is very uncertain of his future in the army. Hunters, in turn, are also misfits, really unwilling to accept army or civil discipline, yet they cut off from their old spiritual lives free by the recent antagonism generated by the army by the Red Cloud. <br /> <br /> Finally, we can also compare this story with Anthony Mann's later film "The Far Country," starring Jimmy Stewart. In that case, he may choose to return to being a lonely cowboy in the end, but the character of Mature does not come up with a new and appetizing way to be his own boss Red Cloud made life outside the army in this region very dangerous to contemplate, in addition In addition, he has an obsession with the Commander's wife.
