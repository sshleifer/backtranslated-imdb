Of course, Alex has become a little podgey, but they are still (to me) the biggest rock trio ever. I highly recommend this DVD to any fan. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed that they canceled their recently planned show in Munich (logistics) and regret not making an effort to see them elsewhere. The DVD is a small consolation - the biggest incentive to get a proper DVD playback setup. <br /> <br /> Naive, perhaps, but still do not understand the meaning of clothes dryers onstage; I would be grateful for any clarification. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, Iain.
