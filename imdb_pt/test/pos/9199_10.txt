This show is pure fun and does not try to be a Greek drama. It certainly contains elements of one that with all the twists, but is immensely engaging and fun. Las Vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they will certainly never lack for material to work on! Everything and everything happens there! The actors in this show are extremely kind and you really want to see what they are doing every week. The show is also very funny. Humor arises from the characters and situations. Not just played for free. It's a well-worked show about it. This certainly makes me anxious for Friday nights and I'm happy to now have the first two seasons on DVD!
