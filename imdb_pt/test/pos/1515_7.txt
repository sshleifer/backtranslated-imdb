Well, that's new ... The famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci films a movie about a famous Italian horror director named ... Lucio Fulci. After years and years witnessing horrible horror sequences, it becomes difficult for Lucio to separate reality from fiction and often hallucinates about committing violent murders. It quickly descends further into a seemingly endless spiral of unverifiable madness and venom. Even the dedicated psychiatrist seems unable to keep Fulci on track ... Now, when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value, Cat in the Brain certainly is one of Fulci's most enjoyable films. The blood is overwhelming and copious, to say the least. The amount of filthy massacres is impossible to describe, especially when you get your hands on the totally uncut version (referred to as aka: "Nightmare Concert"). Decapitations around, the victims' intestines are scattered all over the screen and the chainsaws are doing overtime! The film also becomes unintentionally funny soon (since it is so overdone) and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there is beer in the fridge. Of course, from a more professional point of view, this production can not be called a masterpiece! There is not a bit of tension or atmosphere to detect and the characters are completely empty. In order to create more space for blood, the characters are being introduced for only 5 seconds and then die horribly. Especially compared to the highlights of Fulci - like "The Beyond" or "Do not Torture a Duckling" - this movie looks like a quickly heated snack. The best way to interpret "Cat in the Brain" is as a personal statement made by Fulci and a direct attack on censorship. Maybe after seeing so many of his films? especially the past ?? being cut off by censorship committees and criticized by pseudo-artistic critics, he wanted revenge by delivering a bloody mess that simply can not be cut! If you eliminate all the explicit violence and really sickening makeup effects, you only have about 10 minutes of footage! Especially because the insane murders reappear later in the movie when Fulci hallucinates on them again. You can almost hear our director thinking things like, "Let's see how you're going to censor it now!" Even the whole development of the murder investigation takes place in the background. Are the victims lost by any of your friends or relatives? Are there any police officers looking for clues to take them to the murderer? You do not know and Lucio does not mind informing you about this, because that would lead to sequences that do not require cuts. Oh, and it's pretty damn pretentious too! The name "Mr. Fulci" or even "Lucio" is mentioned every 3 minutes (34 times throughout the film, to be exact) and our director clearly likes to be in the spotlight for a change. Hey, I certainly do not blame you ... After more than 30 years offering fun movies; he deserved to have some extra fun. You are a god, Lord Fulci!
