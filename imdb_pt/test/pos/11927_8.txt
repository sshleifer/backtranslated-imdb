That was a big surprise to me. I had never heard of this film when I first saw it, and the title really pointed to something more than a big terrorist / hostage situation in a high school. Toy Soldiers have the best of their time period of the early 90's, where the action movies were cheerful and very enjoyable. The action is good, the plot is interesting and way above the top, the villain is a one-dimensional hateful idiot (which is great), Louis Gossett Jr. is in it, it's simply a well-being film that I really enjoyed. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong with this if you like action. I give a solid rating of 8/10.
