A strange beam of light penetrates the room of Dr. Craig Burton (Arnold Vosloo) and his wife Sherry (Jillian McWhirter) as they are making love. About two hours are not counted when they seemingly open unharmed. Under hypnosis during a session with psychiatrist Dr. Susan Lamarche (Lindsay Crouse), Craig discovers that his wife was impregnated by aliens. Sherry resists this idea as absurd and is happy to tell her husband that she is indeed pregnant. In ecstasy after attempting to become pregnant for a long time, Sherry is afraid of Craig's fetus persistence in not being his ... This stems from a check of his low sperm count, with high odds that he could not have impregnated his wife . Embarrassing and disturbing experiences with the fetus inside her lead Sherry to some scary discoveries ... her doctor, David Wetherly (Wilford Brimley) finds that ultrasound gives some unusual results in the developing baby's appearance, but it is Craig who realizes that resembles an alien! Sparks light up by cutting off electrical equipment, even turning Wetherly's pacemaker off! Through hypnosis, Sherry reveals the experience of her abduction, but Lamarche believes that her problem is psychological rather than physiological. Undeterred by his wife's alien impregnation theory, Craig turns to sociologist Dr. Bert Clavell (Brad Dourif), whose work lies in the study of alien life and the abduction. But, Bert is reluctant to help Craig, who will go to the ends of the earth to save his wife's life from possible damage. The tragic results occur when Lamarche and others try to keep Craig from his "cutting the thing" goals, believing he is crazy. Craig will continue his task trying to drag Bert down this path with him. <br /> <br /> Grim, absorbing the horror tale about a man's struggle to save his wife from the damage of beings that no one believes exist. Fortunately, Dourif's character is not a crazy idiot, but an intelligent doctor who wants to learn more, but his quest for the aliens' truth is not hostile ... he really hopes to learn from Sherry, but he's not incredibly picky in that regard. goal. The story is told in a realistic way ... it is easy to understand why others may judge Craig as crazy. Vosloo does not take the character too far, but expresses the anguish of his current situation. How can he save his wife from these enemies and prove to others that he is not crazy? McWhirter deserves credit for the demands of the difficult abduction scenes, where his unfortunate character is naked at this table being plumbed and molested by these things. Crouse is well in his limited but important role as the voice of reason in a situation where his clients seem to be out of control psychologically. The monstrous effects are disgusting and effective. I think the film works very well and director Yuzna deserves credit for being at least in this movie. The final twenty minutes, while Craig tries to perform his "removal surgery" with a startled Bert observing the escalation of the crazy situation, is a bite of nails. <br /> <br /> You know, fans of "Fire in the Sky" can dig this click.
