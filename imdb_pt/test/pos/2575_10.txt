I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really do not care what people might say badly about this movie ... because they are very well played pieces by Samuel L. Jackson, and especially by Christina Ricci !! I've been a huge fan of her since I saw her in the Addams Family ... I've been trying to watch all the things she does, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she's played !! I love her looks (even if people say she's not pretty ... I think she's ... and I love her eyes) !! The movie is about a lot of things ... people say it's religious ... people say it's about racism ... people say it's about drugs ... people say it's about nymphomania ... well. .. maybe it's a bit of it !! But what I really feel is that this movie has a high level of openness to what blues is ... which means ... and mostly it comes from: life ... heart ... pain ... sadness .. and above all ... spontaneous feelings !! I hope you can see ... if you are that kind of person who likes a movie not only of the photos or the story he tells ... this is a good movie to see ... if you are not ... well ... see you anyway ... I can not hurt too much, and you get to see Christina Ricci acting so horny !! She's a fox !!
