The first fully synchronized sound design, Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse makes its debut in the animated series "Steamboat Willie." Mickey is a worker on a steamboat under the supervision of Captain Peg Leg Pete (or Pete, as it would later be called). Mickey embarks his long-time companion, Minnie Mouse, aboard the train while they play, while Mickey tries to impress Minnie. This short was a lot of fun and positively fun. Animators Ubbe Iwerks, Rudolph Ising and Hugh Harman helped Walt in creating the short "Steamboat Willie" essentially marks the beginning of the success of the Walt Disney Company.
