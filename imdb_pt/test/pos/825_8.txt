After 10 years, it's finally best to say that our Belgian action star is back. I personally found this to be even better than Wake Of Death, which makes it your best movie in ... 10 years! Okay, it's not like his prominent years as Timecop, Universal Soldier, Sudden Death or even his best effort to date: Hard Target (one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors John Woo). good, the story is exciting, the dialogue is very funny, this is better than expected. The bad guys are incredible like Hard Target, and the fight scenes are "old school". The real fans know what to expect. I must say I gave up on him, but Van Damme is finally back. More please....
