I've seen a test show from Blurred recently, and I'm surprised to say it was actually pretty good! It's a movie about different groups of kids, their country boys, their rich snobs, their typical teenage couple, plus two nerdy faces and a post-hippie baby. Together, but as separate stories, each group travels to the Gold Coast for Schoolies Week. Australia has never had trouble writing comedy and Australia is never short, or actors who can play comedy with subtlety and the right amount of strangeness. The cast is full of Australian star actors with tremendous talent and a lot of onscreen presence. Keep an eye on Craig Horner, a young graduate who is optimistic for a week-long party that gets lost in his friends, shenanigans. Travis Cotten and Mark Priestly, who successfully faced some tricky physical comedies, while two bogged the bogans and Jessica Gower as a cute, but confused teenager, distressed by love. Veronika Sywak makes her movie debut as every teenage girl of teenage boys, and remains among a number of considerably more experienced artists. Keep an eye on Matthew Newton, cleverly scaled up as a decadent limousine driver. Aussie fantastic
