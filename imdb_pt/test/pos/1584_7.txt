I first heard the Commander's Log when I was at concom for the local science fiction convention. Craig Bowlsby, Linden Banks, Sophie Banks and Brian Oberquell showed up to show the video and give some panels on how to make the TV on a tight budget. I have to say that I was very pleased when I finally got a chance to see the show. Comparisons with the Red Dwarf are inevitable, as the first Red Dwarf seasons have also been filmed on a low budget (though Commander's Log has to establish some kind of record with the least amount of money spent per minute) and therefore offset the lack of "eye drops" with good writing and acting. Linden Banks, who plays Mrs. Blather's boss, does a particularly good job of presenting a serious but clueless person. <br /> <br /> Bowlsby's original idea was for the story to be told in two-minute "interstitials," shown among other shows over the course of a night, though for some reason Space did not come up with an idea so cool, and so the interstitials were all turned into a one-hour show, which Space usually showed in two half-hour episodes. The existing DVD does not include episode 3 (which debuted at Cascadia-Con in Seattle in 2005) or episode 4 (which was shown at VCON in Vancouver in 2006), but if you are in contact with your local fan community, you can pick up news from a display somewhere near you.
