This was a movie that, in the end, I thought "Now it's been a pleasant 2 hours!" I hate spending about $ 20 (not including baby-sitting $$) for my husband and I get that feeling "It was OK". <br /> <br /> I think I like Will Smith better as a comedy actor than an action hero. He was well-grounded in that. His character was very nice, as was Kevin James. <br /> <br /> There were several laughter. It's also a romantic movie, so folks, if you want to impress the lady in your life, take her to it. Women will love it as much as any girl movie, but I would not rate it as one. There's a lot of humor for men to have fun with. I think that's one of the reasons why this movie is as perfect as a movie against. It has romance and clowning. I do not usually like clowns very much, but it was not an exaggeration and I can not think of any of those scenes that do not generate laughter. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. The first thing my husband told me after it turned out was "I want to see it again!"
