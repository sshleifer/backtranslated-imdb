An excellent film for those who simply need to turn off and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Scotland. Based on the fact, the film takes you on a journey of love amidst spectacular scenery. The cast is 'dressed' for the parts they play, so there are no glamorous costumes or hair combed in this film in which the acting is superb, courageous and realistic. Each character is believable giving a convincing picture of island life, beliefs and culture of the time Defined for those who have the tiniest drop of Scottish blood ..... how it will pull the strings of the heart and shake the soul. Something that can be shared with the family and watched over and over again .................. a true classic, which I'm sure will go alongside some of the great movies that he never die.
