Lucius Fulci was one of the most prolific Italian directors at the time of his death in 1996, but his career had already descended into a downward spiral of increasingly futile genre entries that could barely stand in the shadow of his previous work. For much of the 1970s in the mid-1980s, he created such distinctively stylistic horrors as "The City of the Living Dead," "The Beyond," and the brutal giallo "The New York Ripper," affectionately remembered by fans like myself same. And while "Cat in the Brain" coincides with the era of Fulci's decline as a filmmaker, it's a shocking and somber hilarious head-trip that, while clearly inferior work (framing, effects and acting are substandard), proves interesting meditation and open about pop psychology and the film's ability to desensitize. Make no mistake: "Cat in the Brain" is a total gorefest and as disjointed as Fulci's previous films, but deserves credit for trying to be something else. In a delightfully ironic twist, Fulci interprets himself: a director in the midst of filming another violent horror film that appears with perverse / murderous hallucinations; after visiting a psychiatrist who puts him under hypnosis, his dreams and reality begin to cross, to the point that the viewer can not discern the two. The recent Grindhouse Releasing DVD mentions "Cat" as an apparent heir to the likes of "Eraserhead," and carries an equally disturbing, strangely funny quality associated with the best surrealist art.
