Based on the memories of Gypsy Rose Lee, who painted a much more loving image of her mother than her sister, actress "Baby" June Havoc in her autobiography, "Early Havoc" in "They Shoot Horses, Do not They ". "I saw Ethyl Merman in Gypsy's original Broadway production, and she was great as" Mama Rose ", but certainly more" Merman "than Rose. I was disappointed by the portrait of Rosalind Russell in the 1962 film version , A great actress, Russell was a very wooden substitute for Merman.Better Midler, on the other hand, was better and more believable than Merman and I would recommend his performance as the definitive one.
