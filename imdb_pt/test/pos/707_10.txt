I read on the web that this movie is being turned into a theatrical resource. Finally!!!!! It was time for Hollywood to come together. The great studios always disapprove of the nervous material, with Oscar all written. Go figure! <br /> <br /> JERICHO MILE was made ahead of time. It is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Michael Mann, a true visionary, has found a way to engage a public without excesses. The performance of the Peter Strauss Emmy Award is probably the best character I've ever seen in my movie life. Any actor who plays this role will never be the same again (unless an Oscar is already in place). <br /> <br /> The brave multiethnic group, a setting for JERICHO MILE, makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world. It is about redemption without public validation and the power of the human spirit overcoming all barriers. Imagine a convicted prisoner since he was a teenager for life with no chance of parole, who does not know that he is possibly the fastest runner in the world. ... what would you do? <br /> <br /> This movie makes you leave feeling that you have not been fooled on any level. Totally exciting, engaging, emotional and a soundtrack of "Rolling Stones" that kicked the butt !!! <br /> <br /> I always thought this would be made for the big screen ... Can not wait ...! !! In the meantime, I'll have to continue reviewing my VHS real-time copy I've had for many years.
