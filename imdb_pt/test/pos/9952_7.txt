The Merchant of Venice, by William Shakespeare, depicts the Venice of the sixteenth century. Al Pacino plays Shylock, a Jewish moneylender who plans to take revenge on a Catholic who has despised him. The film is a slow-moving storyline at the beginning that builds up over the past two hours. The film gives a very good appearance and believes in its characters, especially Pacino. Upon hearing that Pacino plays a Jew, one might think that it would not work looking at the roles of Pacino's mafia type. However, it works very well, credit should be given to the costume designer and film director. The appearance of all the characters fits well with the length of time the piece goes. The costumes look like the Renaissance look you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The film portrays a very anti-Semitic vibe. From the first minute to the last, it is shown how Catholics try to take advantage of the Jews in every possible way, even to the point of keeping them locked in "ghettos" and not allowing them to work regularly. In comparison to The Passion of the Christ, another recent film that people believed to be very anti-Semitic, the Merchant of Venice makes the Passion seem like a Jewish holiday. The film shows how the Jews, or at least Shylock, wanted revenge on the ill-treatment received by the Jews. The location shots also seem very timely and the scenery is sometimes very beautiful or very ugly, depending on the scene of the movie, making it much more realistic. Showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as anti-Semitic because the ugly is usually shown around the Jews and the beauty around the Catholics. <br /> <br /> Although the film clearly tries to have a serious aura, certain parts add a bit of humor to the act. The very serious trial between Shylock and Antonio (Irons) adds a bit of humor when Portia (Collins) and Nerissa (Goldenhersh) enter the trial and decide who will be the winner and the defeated. That alone may not be funny, but seeing that they were women disguised as men, one might find it amusing. The entire transvestite scene, however compelling, could probably have been even more memorable if artists and makeup director Michael Radford noticed that the two women still resemble women and could be easily recognized. The director might also have seen the fact that women are speaking through their regular voices instead of trying to sound like men, which partly takes the scene, but does not completely kill it. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film gets 7 out of 10
