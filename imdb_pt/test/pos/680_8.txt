I can see that the ratings for this movie are not that high for this movie, so I should be in the minority because I like this movie so much. Well, I'm right and everybody's wrong (joking). I think I like it because I'm a psychology teacher and I really liked Ryan's character. Although he is truly dangerous and VERY menacing, you can not hate him exactly because he is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some form of brain trauma. And wow, Ryan did a good job portraying this man! You really feel feeling for Ida Lupino while he destroys your life. So, with such an intense and threatening performance, why is the film rated relatively low? Well, probably because it's not exactly believable ... but it's fun and creative. Try it and do not believe the score of 6.4 - it's much better than that!
