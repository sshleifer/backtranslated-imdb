The idea of ​​a young woman who becomes pregnant at age 16 is nothing new for the dramatic genre. But it's quite new if you take a look at the comedy genre. There is this basic plot of Lorelai and Rory, mother and daughter. Lorelai comes from a rich environment, got pregnant at age 16 and ran away from her parents' house at the age of seventeen. But this series does not start there, it starts when Rory is 16 and it's all about the problems of a single mom who has terrible problems with her parents and about all the problems you have when you're 16 years old. <br /> <br /> Ok, now, again, this sounds pretty normal, but there's a little thing called a joke. The Gilmore Girls speak incredibly fast and make 60 jokes a minute. Even if you do not understand all the jokes, they contain hundreds of references to movies, music, gossip, history, literature and politics. Sometimes you get confused, but this is really fun. And not only is he fast, he's smart and wonderfully sarcastic. Also, it's not just funny, it has great parts of drama and you can take some lessons from it even at home. Which is one thing that does not happen in every TV series. <br /> <br /> So, watch it! This will ease your mood and help you in difficult decisions!
