This is a good enough film and you probably will not be disappointed, but again Roy Scheider, shortly after he made "French Connection", played a policeman by the name "Buddy". They also use the same very memorable "Bullitt" wheelman. At first, you think you've seen the car chase before, if you still have his face in his memory. The pursuit of cars is great, but like in many car movie scenes, there are some technical and editing errors. Mark "Puppet on a Chain" and "French Connection II" for other good, long and intense pursuits.
