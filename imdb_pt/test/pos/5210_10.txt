People of my generation and those who are older know about World War II (or what it's called in Russia - the Great Patriotic War) not just from school books, but from witnesses and participants in the event. My grandfather was a soldier in Stalingrad and when I was a little girl I used to hear his stories of how he defeated the Germans. He also told me a few anecdotes, not everything he told me was gloomy. But it was a long time ago, and not when I have a conscious interest in what happened there at the Battle of Stalingrad, I have to turn to books and movies for information. Somehow, most of the films I saw were made in the Soviet Union, few in present-day Russia. And "Stalingrad" is an exception. In the film, war is described on the opposite side, and the fact itself is interesting. Everything that is shown in the movie is quite different from what I am used to. <br /> <br /> The film reminds me a lot of Remarque's "Zeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterben", because war is shown through a perception of the ordinary German soldier. And this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed with repeating that he is by no means a fascist. The heroes of the film, coming from pure and enthusiastic Europe of the Italian coast, arrive at the hungry Soviet Union, which is covered with snow. They are doomed to die; it's clear from the beginning. After the elite detachment took part in their first fight in Stalingrad, one of the soldiers said the phrase that reflected the whole idea for me; he said, "If you start thinking, you're going to go crazy." And for me, it's true for viewers too. On the one hand, one might think, okay, I'm going to watch this movie and it will not dissipate me, I do not need to feel sorry for the people on the screen as if they were the ones that attacked my country and not the other way around. However, sooner or later, but inevitably, you begin to sympathize with the characters. Probably when the lieutenant suppresses his tears when seeing the execution of Kolya. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is hard to watch, all these frozen legs, dirt, plays, snow, starvation, illusions destroyed. As far as I know, Lieutenant Hans von Witzland is one of the few films in which Thomas Kretschmann has played his lead roles. I watched a lot of Hollywood movies where he received unimportant bits of small fries like "Next" or "Transsiberian" (why did he do it?!). And after watching "Stalingrad," I can not distinguish European actors who want to appear in American films, even if they are classified second-rate at any cost. The fact intrigues me deeply. I believe that Thomas Kretschmann deserves better parts and much better scripts than the ones he is given in Hollywood. And from what I saw with him, "Stalingrad" is the best, no doubt. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the worst disadvantage of "Stalingrad" is the way they speak Russian in the film. I mean, of course, those who should be Russian. Tell him, the boy who spent some time with the Germans or the girl they planned to run away with. Was it really so difficult to find actors capable of uttering a few phrases without that horrible accent? Initially I signed to watch "Stalingrad" just to listen to native speakers of German, because I am studying the language. I did not expect anything extraordinary from the movie. But that impressed me, made me cry when I was not going at all. I know I'm 15 years late to watch it, but "Stalingrad" is not a mediocre movie, and after 15 years it's still watchable and shocking.
