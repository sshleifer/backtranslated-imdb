I wanted to see this movie because I'm a big fan of Abbott and Costello, and when I saw it, I liked it. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, not hysterical, but funny. I mean, I laughed at lots of funny parts and I just liked that. <br /> <br /> Although not the best of the Perfect Straight Man and the Perfect Clown, you should see this if you really love Abbott and Costello. Of all the Abbott and Costello films I've seen, I can not say I've seen one I hated. That's decent, funny, and fun. Abbott and Costello at least made some decent films in their later years. <br /> <br /> On the whole, I liked this movie, it's not one of the best of them, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
