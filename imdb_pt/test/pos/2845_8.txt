Nurse Betty has a strange, but winning, combination of a repulsive plot and inducing discomfort with extraordinary characters. Just as I hated Fargo on the first viewing, so I realized that I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I really liked Nurse Betty the day after what I saw. Difficult to understand, more difficult to explain. As others have said, it is quite forced in many ways, but this seems to be part of what makes it so remarkable. Fair employment by Greg Kinnear, great work by Morgan Freeman (though I'm worried he's being stereotyped as the principle villain). Chris Rock was good, but not a highlight. Rene Z. is so natural that it is unnerving - that is, unnerving to be "natural" to interpret someone who is not right in the head. I also liked the sort of "abrasive spark" performance of Allison Janney in a small part. <br /> <br /> Do not go expecting as much of a road movie as you can guess from some synopses. (There is "road", but it is only slightly relevant.) Rated 8/10.
