I just saw the last episode, No 32, (although the site says only 30 episodes were made) and I must comment on the fact that this series was actually very good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes crime / police stories . Supposedly all 32 were based on facts with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes, this has sometimes been a brave, well-represented, believable series and I dare say, amusing. The fact that the powers in Denmark decided to dismember the unit was almost unbelievable, as they did their job so well and in the series at least they never stopped "catching your man"! It's a definite 10/10 for me.
