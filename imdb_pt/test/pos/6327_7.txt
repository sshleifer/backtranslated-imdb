Just three and a half years after finishing a month (October 7-31, 1953) at the Broadway Coronet Theater (West 49th Street, renamed O'Neill), MGM relied on the solid London success of piece. to prodigalize a wonderful cast and - for the most part - carefully "opened" the production on a sadly trimmed script of this maliciously subversive comedy and were rewarded with modest success. <br /> <br /> Ava Gardner is the increasingly frustrated wife of Stewart Granger, an internationally successful and fully complacent "workaholic" (before the term is coined) using the perpetually frustrated David Niven to try to revive the passion in his wife. When the "second honeymoon" to cross Gardner leads Granger to let the trio (and Granger's dog) abandoned on a southern sea island (are there other survivors? This is for later developments), Granger continues to manage the world to his around - building a large cabin for him and his wife and a little for the title of Niven - or the loose male. The core of the play's real plot begins only midway through the film when Niven proposes that Granger and him alternate as tenants of the Little Hut - sharing the only woman on the island, since Granger is willing to share the single pair of shoes (his). <br /> <br /> Reason (which Granger considers its strength) kingdoms and frustrations reign supreme - for a while. <br /> <br /> David Niven and Ava Gardner are superb in their nominated roles as soft seducer and seducer, and Stuart Granger - generally called just to be handsome and virile in action roles and the strange specia miscast lty (a boy beautiful singing as Apollodorus in Shaes CESOPARA and CLEOPATRA in 1945) - gives one of the best acting performances of his film career as the husband who can really be as smart as he thinks he is. 33 years later, he would again show that suave urbanity alongside Rex Harrison in the first (and both of his) Broadway commitments in a hit revival of Somerset Maugham, THE CIRCLE, which only ended with Harrison's death. We would be much richer if Granger had used these skills more often. As promising as the menage is, after all, this is a British Boulevard Comedy and Hollywood in the 1950s, which means that (unlike the original game) very little sex actually continues . To be frank, if you do not indulge in the ideas that drive the tricks, it will be a little silly (the same basic plot is developed much more satisfactorily three years later in Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr / Robert Mitchum / Jean Simmons). (The real wife of Stewart Granger) GRACE IS GREENER, based on an even less successful game, but for some reason the upper trifle failed at the box office.) As profusely as the MGM put the play, unfortunate lapses - the nonsense that ends the stay on the island is foreshadowed by cartoons in what should have been a moment of real excitement - the wreck of the yacht that places them on the island. Ultimately, we only have about three-quarters of an hour of true Little Hut, but ninety good minutes of David Niven, Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger, all of which make the movie a fun diversion. It is not high culture, but a worthy guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> We even got a very cool embellishment on Walter Chiari (supposedly Ava's lover at the time). As one of his best speeches says: "Boola, boola!"
