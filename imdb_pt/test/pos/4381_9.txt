It started out weird, the middle was weird, and the ending was weird, but I really liked it. A modern version of Homer's Odyessy, but that's really irrelevant. Interesting story and cast. Clooney was great and I applaud him for taking such an adverse role - so unlike anything he has done or will do again. Many surprise stars - why is Holly Hunter no longer present? Do something different tonight and watch this really different and unexpected movie.
