Let me say from the beginning that I'm not a fan in particular of this type of film, but Nightbreed has a certain fascination for me with a message about perspective. <br /> <br /> Back in the old days, people who inhabited Midian would have been called zombies, the undead. And according to what Clive Barker has given us certain members of the human species, in this Craig Sheffer are born with the potential to become part of this world. <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist David Cronenberg at first seemed like a gentle and polite professional. took on a fanatical mission to rid the world of Nightbreed. He tricks the police to kill Sheffer, but Sheffer goes to a cemetery called the Midian cemetery where the Nightbreed gather and live underground. <br /> <br /> Sheffer also left a girlfriend, Anne Bobby, who still has feelings for himself after he was killed and is now one of the undead. It tries, in its own way, to be a bridge for humanity. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker's creatures are very scary and do not like humans much. But of course if the humans left them alone, Nightbreed would not bother them. <br /> <br /> His sympathies are definitely with the Nightbreed, especially after seeing a fanatic like Cronenberg and the caipira chief of police Charles Haid in Clive Barker has been a gay man for some time and some have suggested that Nightbreed is a metaphor for gay people. I can see where that would come in, especially since there are many people who do not even think of gays as something human because they are taught that way. <br /> <br /> Nightbreed is pretty bloody with a lot of free violence but it also makes you think and I like the way Clive Barker transforms traditional theology into his head and makes Craig Sheffer a kind of messiah for the creatures two Nightbreed.
