Joe is the movie about the dark side of the 1960s force in America, and Susan Sarandon had beautiful breasts. This movie scared me so much when I saw it in the movies that I never liked Peter Boyle until the young Frankenstein and I was still quite suspicious of him even after that comedy. Looking back now from today's experience, this movie looks current again being straight to the point and half of John McCain's approval of "Joe The Plumber" Typecast's electorate and his fear of electing a black man as US president in the upcoming weeks. A black Prez would be seen as a sweet revenge of the "blacks," but forced to bring fire again to many minds, if not the streets, this time by Joe's enthusiasts. So, Joe's spirit in the movie is resurrected in Joe The Plumber's campaign! Still, I love being American and being terrified of both and by the knowledge they illustrate which, ironically, Gregory Peck said that our civilized law is also: "a living reality that breathes!" God help us.
