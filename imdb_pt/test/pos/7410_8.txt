Thought provoking, humbling representation of the human tragedies of war. A small but altruistic view of a family's interactions with the enemy during the Kentucky Civil War. This film diminishes the "glamor" of war; showing that this affects not only the soldier, but the whole family unit. <br /> <br /> Many of today's films show war as an opportunity to highlight the "hero" and other fascinating features of the war, but very few attempts to show the true effect that war has on the community. This movie attempts this through a re-reading of a person's memory of those days. This film is declared as a loose translation of a real event, when in reality this film is probably a factual reality of hundreds, perhaps thousands of "real events" during the civil war. I highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie.
