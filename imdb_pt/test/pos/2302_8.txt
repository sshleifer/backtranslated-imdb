This is an Oshima movie, the director of the notorious "In The Realm Of The Senses," a film so sexually brazen and blatantly controversial that it was banned for a while. This film originally takes place in 1895 in Japan and stars the very handsome Keziko Yoshiyuki as Seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls in love with a much younger man who courtesy her in kind. That man, Toyoji, comes to her while she sleeps and seduces her, although she is soon enough to be seduced. Soon they are having an affair and conspiring to kill Seki's husband, to be together forever. They do, and knock it down a well. However, they did not count on the ghost of the dead husband haunting Seki and others in the village! This film is visually very impressive, the use of shadows highlighting this tale of murder by passion. Yoshiyuki (who is still active as an actress) is especially good in her role. It is sexual at times, but not as "In The Realm Of The Senses". Some of the consequences depend on our imagination. I found this movie to have a consistency of humor that makes it very watchable. A little scary, but that goes with the territory. I would recommend this.
