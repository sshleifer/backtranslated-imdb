If you are one of those people who think that Lucius Fulci is all about blood, guts and zombies, you have to watch this (and "The Psychic" too, for that matter). Even though the film includes rather brutal scenes of violence, and a disturbing subject, it is not the main thing here. This is a truly impressive story and a murder mystery based on characters that may well be the director's masterpiece. Here he proves that he is a true craftsman, creating a work of art that is memorable, disturbing, but surprisingly beautiful, full of frightening Catholic images and interesting social commentary. He also has a great cast including beautiful Barbara Bouchet as well as Tomas Millan (from Beatrice Cenci) and Irene Pappas in a small but important role. Still, it is the Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan (who also stared at the bizarre "Lizard in the Skin of a Woman" by Fulci) who steals the scene as Majara, giving an excellent performance of a woman maddened by her superstitions and her cruel murder . scene is particularly bleak. The second star of the film is the cinematography of Sergio D'Ofizi who, along with Riz Ortolani's melancholy soundtrack of Morricone-esquire, helps to bring to life the "isolated Italian village with an obscure secret." I have to admit I thought the doll head pounding on the stones took me away, but even so, this is a definitive Italian horror classic - a work of moving, sad and thought-provoking genius. 10/10 for me. If you liked this, I recommend watching "Alice, Sweet Alice" by Alfred Sole, because they are somewhat similar, and are underrated stones.
