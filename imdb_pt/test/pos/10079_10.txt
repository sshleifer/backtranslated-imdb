Finding that bit between an obsolete prequel and a machomovie from the 80's on a Saturday at noon program from the UPN affiliate would be misleading. He deserves better and definitely uses the best attributes of his talented talents to their maximum advantage. Bracco and Walken come together to provide a film that, while perhaps predictable to those who are familiar with the genre, do the routine of 'disturbed minds' that they are so good at portraying. For a chance to put together a psychological rollercoaster in La Fuqua's "Training Day", go back to the world of 90's TV movies to find "Scam"!
