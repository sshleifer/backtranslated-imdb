I've seen this story before, but my kids have not seen it. Boy with troubled past joins military, faces his past, falls in love and becomes a man. The mentor this time is played perfectly by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with ordinary everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives. After losing his team, he assumes a teacher position by training the next generation of heroes. The troubled young recruiter is played by Kutcher. While his scenes with local love interest are a bit harsh and do not generate enough heat to melt butter, he praises Costner well. I never really understood Sela Ward as the neglected wife and felt that she should want Costner to give up by worrying about his safety as opposed to his selfish needs. But her presence on the screen is a pleasure. The two uncredited stars of this film are the Coast Guard and the Sea. Both powerful forces should not be taken for granted in real life or in this movie. The film has some slow points and could have used the 15 minutes wasted to strengthen the relationships between the characters. But it still works. The rescue scenes are intense and well shot and edited to provide maximum impact. This movie wins public acclaim. And the applause of my two sons.
