I'm just getting a chance to dive into Austen's movies, and I picked it up because Persuasion is, has been, and always will be, my favorite work of Jane Austen, and Anne Elliot, my favorite heroine of Austen. So it was with great expectation that I put the disc in my player. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed either. I knew there would be some downsides, so I'll declare them and try not to be too thick with them. Anne Elliot is the most introverted of Austen's characters; she is the least talkative and the least witty. There are passages in the book where Ana says nothing - only her feelings are described. This works fine in printing, but how to successfully transfer this to the big screen? In addition to making thoughtful narratives (which would make it tedious for over four hours), you get a long succession of scenes in which the heroine says little or nothing, and must communicate everything through her facial expression. This may leave the feeling that the film is slow and purposeless. If you need a more open style of Austen, then surely this movie is not for you; but if subjugated is more your style, and you tend to pick up unspoken 'vibes', this will meet all expectations. <br /> <br /> Anne Firbank (as Anne Elliot), is fortunately an actress whose face can convey a lot. She looked like I always imagined Anne Elliot would be: not a knockout - Anne should not be the elegant of the family - not even in her early youth - who is also occasionally highlighted by lighting and makeup. What you see is someone who is very much like the character of Austen: someone whose appearance you can pass once; but listen to her talk, and look more closely, and she becomes more attractive, the better you know her. This is Anne Elliot, brought to life by Anne Firbank. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Captain Wentworth is expertly treated by Bryan Marshall. Bitterness is never seemingly obvious (except in the concert scene); and, yes, I found it hard to believe that he found Louisa Musgrove interesting as she was shown. But that's another point in Austen's book: he did not find it interesting, he tried to find her interesting, and ultimately failed (sigh of relief). So, that also fits the original story of Austen. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked Lady Russell's interpretation that I thought the book was not portrayed as VERY bad; this also appears in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> So, this is a movie that has followed the book closely; I could write much more about how everything was faithfully reproduced, but I would run out of space here. Charles Musgrove remained one of the liveliest characters (good fun), Mary the most annoying (I was dying to shut up - but I also felt that when I read the book), captains and the admiral whom I found to be charming. The cinematography I thought a little hard. There was little or virtually no fading from one screen to another - perhaps this is due to being a TV movie. One scene - CHOP! - the next scene, the actors enter from the right, continue to the left and - CHOP! - another scene, where the same thing happens. This was the only part of the movie that I felt fooled me a bit. A Low Budget has to show itself somewhere, I suppose. <br /> <br /> And like I said before, if you like a bit of pace with Jane Austen, do not bother with this, as you will find it very slow. I enjoyed it tremendously, though, because it brought a wealth of detail (the sets were richly elegant!) For an excellent adaptation of my favorite Austen novel. I recommend!
