Flash Gordon is undoubtedly the best of all American series. At a date as old as 1936, Universal was able to make such an entertaining story, and twenty years later, when I first watched it as a child, it involved me in a great adventure and excitement. Buster Crabbe was the hero he always wanted to be in our childhood, and Jean Rogers, the beautiful girl we always dreamed of being in love with. Dragons, octopuses, monsters, gorillas were also the attraction. Charles Middleton was a great presence like Ming the Ruthless. A true predecessor of George Lucas's Starwars.
