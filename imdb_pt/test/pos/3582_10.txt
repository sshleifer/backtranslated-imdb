The whole series, not just the Blue Planet, is nothing short of incredible. The best series of nature we have ever seen. The episode in the background is like traveling into outer space! We watched it with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us were not able to pull away. We read a negative comment about this and could not believe it. There's so much new information we've never learned in school. It is also the best view we have seen of any television or film in the delicate balance of Earth's ecosystem. The amount of time and effort to capture these photos is very apparent when you sit down and watch the series. <br /> <br /> Must do for everyone.
