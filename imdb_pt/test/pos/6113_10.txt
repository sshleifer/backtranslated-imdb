Pink Flamingos is a movie that no word can explain. It was as good as I thought. Expand movies. Starting with a "multiple" start and ending with a shocking but clever ending, Pink Flamingos is one of the best movies of the year. Do not miss this opportunity to see a great movie. Rent it on video or see it at midnight, like I did. But just watch this.
