If the ending had not been so fantastically unexpected, I do not think I could rate this movie as well. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of uncomfortable, harrowing, "crumbling marriage" interaction. This sort of thing is not my kind of drama, so the rhythm seemed to drag on me. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main characters are hard to relate to and therefore care a lot - her husband (Alan Rickman) is quite bitter and angry and his wife (Polly Walker) is indifferent and a little arrogant. The acting was very good (Norman Reedus was very seductive), but the characters themselves were perhaps a little MORE realistically flawed (for me). <br /> <br /> The scenery was pleasant and appropriately isolated and a little scary. The cinematography had something that seemed a bit old-fashioned to me somehow. <br /> <br /> But the last 5-15 minutes of this movie are so ingenious that every uncomfortable scene, clumsy talk and unexplained character behavior is absolutely worth it. I guessed every typical turn, except the one that occurred. <br /> <br /> Finishing definitely makes this movie worth watching. Intrigue and drama, not so much.
