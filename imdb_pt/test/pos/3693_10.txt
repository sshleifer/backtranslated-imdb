I found this movie extremely pleasurable. I'm prejudiced, I suppose. I happen to love Kathy Bates. I found her singing an additional pleasure. She has a really nice voice. <br /> <br /> Ms. Bates plays Grace Beasley. The movie takes you from your life from married doledrums in Chicago to England to the home of your recently murdered idol singer Victor Fox. There she finds her three surviving uppity sisters. She also discovers that Victor leaves behind a male lover, Dirk Simpson. The story takes you to some surprisingly comical and moving situations as Grace and Dirk develop a real affection for each other, after a rather rude initial rejection on their part. They return to Chicago, where they team up with Grace's damn funny daughter-in-law, Maudie, to find the serial killer who murdered Victor. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the picture did a great job. Particularly liked Julie Andrews, Lynn Redgrave and Barry. Manilow.This movie was fun. It makes you cry. The song is absolutely charming. <br /> <br /> Other posters here that have encountered problems anywhere in this movie simply do not have a clue. <br /> <br />
