Written by the brilliant writers of Monkees, Gerald Gardner and Dee Caruso, WHICH WAY TO THE FRONT was the last of Jerry Lewis's films until "Hard Working" nearly a decade later. Jerry's comedy is evidently an acquired taste, and admittedly he may occasionally be his worst enemy when he becomes producer / director - but even in the most lugubrious films, there are always moments of brilliance. <br /> <br /> Which way can be fun, fun and yes, very funny. It's a bit different from all the typical Lewis films. The pace is very optimistic and there are many excellent supporting players - a kind of JERRY DOES HOGANS HEROES. The whole thing looks like an unsold TV pilot and you're going to love it or hate it --- but I hope you enjoy it
