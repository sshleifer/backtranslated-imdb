I did not know what to expect from this very popular (and hilarious) Swedish comedy and satire team when they released their first feature film. Wider satire? Well, we have four exceptionally memorable contemporary tales of family pains, generation and parenting gaps in particular. But it's drama, thankfully, and what a drama! It is epic in scope, as each episode is of carefully chosen and geographically different parts of Sweden. But each story can take a whole movie seriously, if it is expanded separately. <br /> <br /> It's dark, distorted, harrowing, but massively fun and breathtaking. Screenplay, acting and cinematography are world-class absolute, as three hours seem to pass in the blink of an eye! They are four shades of mastery and easily one of the best films in the history of national cinema. It's Sweden's answer to "Short cuts" or "Magnolia", if you want, and instantly on par with those! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
