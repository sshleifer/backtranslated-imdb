I'm impressed that 'Hail the Woman' was made; released just a year after American women voted, this exalted drama makes a sincere appeal against the dual sexual pattern that judges women's sexual behavior harder than men's. <br /> <br /> LIGHT FRONT FOR FRONT. A prologue, set in the Plymouth colony in 1621, shows a young pilgrim condemned to the stool who crouched to flirt with a boy; the boy is not penalized. Now we come to Flint Hill, New Hampshire in the present (1921). Oliver Beresford (Theodore Roberts) is a bombastic beater of bibles: what we call in Britain and Australia as "God hater." Beresford is determined that his son David (Lloyd Hughes) becomes a preacher, regardless of how David feels about it. As for Beresford's daughter, Judith ... well, Beresford is confident that women are not important enough to be more than wives and mothers. Apparently, God told him so personally. <br /> <br /> David's evangelical career is compromised when he impregnates Nan Higgins, the stepdaughter of the man who works there. (The character of Tully Marshall is identified in credits only as "Odd Jobs Man," but a close-up of a check reveals that his name is Jake Higgins. The prejudices of 1921 require him to be merely Nan's stepfather, not his biological father.) To save his son from the scandal, Beresford buys Nan's stepfather with a check. Nan goes to the big city, to melt into oblivion as the single mother. Judith is naturally discouraged by the limitations imposed on her by her gender. (Or rather, from other people's perceptions of this.) She meets Wyndham Gray (an excellent performance by Edward Martindel), an author who encourages her to transcend sexist stereotypes. But Judith is informally involved with Joe Hurd, who does not tolerate such nonsense. Hurd is played by Vernon Dent, a burly performer now remembered only for comedic roles (as a second banana for Harry Langdon, and as a villain in Three Stooges films). He gives excellent performance here in a role out of his usual reach. Unfortunately, in real life, Dent spent his last years in poverty and total blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Judith ends up working in an orphanage. This being the year 1921, I expected the orphanage to be only for whites, so I was pleasantly surprised when it eventually included a Chinese boy. (And unpleasantly surprised when it is used as a target for a racial joke.) The movie makes a strange mistake here. In a Christmas sequence, we see the orphanage's mistress reciting "A visit from Saint Nicholas" ... but (in a dialogue title) she credits Santa with six reindeer instead of eight. This is followed by a brief animation sequence, showing Santa with six reindeer attached to his sleigh. I assume that the animators (by accident or to save money) left out two reindeer, and the title card reviewed the poem to match the error. Lloyd Hughes was usually an insipid and unimpressive actor. His most famous performance is his role in 'The Lost World', where he is easily overshadowed by a furious brontosaurus. For his climactic scene in 'Hail the Woman', Hughes makes a memorable performance when he finally rebels against his father's tyranny. In his performance as the father of the gospel, Theodore Roberts was accused of exaggerating himself to the point of making his role a caricature. I disagree: Unfortunately, decades after this movie was made, I continue to find "holy" fools exactly like this man ... willing to destroy the lives of everyone around them, and firmly convinced that they have the authority of God to do it. /> In the central role of Judith Beresford, Florence Vidor offers sensible, realistic and intelligent performance. I usually do not like Vidor, who used to have glamor papers, but was not handsome enough to justify them. Here, the physical appearance of your character is less relevant than usual. <br /> <br /> This whole film is directed impressively by John Griffith Wray, a director who deserves to be much better known. Unfortunately, Wray died early in the talkies, in his early thirties: if he had lived another ten years, he would certainly have directed several classics of the early sound. In Hail the Woman there are several extremely beautiful screen compositions: I was especially impressed by a scene in the New England forest when Vidor and Dent have a fight in front of a huge uprooted tree. (I wonder where this was actually filmed.) 'Hail the Woman' deals with unpleasant matters, but deserves to be much better known, and I will evaluate this ambitious drama in 9 of 10.
