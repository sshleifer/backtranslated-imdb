This film exemplifies a certain brand of comic horror of a strictly adult type, but quite different from the Troma movies (with which it shares certain qualities). The humor is rough and ready, but fast and furious. If the idea of ​​evil puppets with evil powers and twisted minds does not make you shrug, look for the six pack of beers and enjoy the best "Chucky" movie yet.
