Playing Bollywood's epic melodrama about a 10-year-old girl who discovers she's adopted, and is determined to find her birth mother. The biggest success of the film is the performance of P.S. Keerthana, who plays the girl. The first half of the movie is very good. There are also some really good songs, especially the number that features the protagonist. Unfortunately, the second half of the movie, which takes place in war-ravaged Sri Lanka, looks like a completely different and disappointing movie. It is large in explosions and special effects, with soldiers and rebels of Sri Lanka diverting from grenades, running from fireballs and being pulled by stunts of acrobatics. All that the film can offer as insight are cheap buzzwords like "Someday must come peace" and "Maybe children will find a way." The final sequence, where the daughter and the mother are together, is good but so exaggerated with the music and a downpour that looks like a scam. I know, I know, it's all in the style of Bollywood. But this is a story in which great moments simply undermine the simple and powerful central story. Bollywood could certainly use a bit of restraint sometimes as well.
