In fact, I switched to Lifetime by mistake, just as this movie was starting, and I ended up watching. <br /> <br /> Certainly deals with a serious issue, probably more prevalent than we imagine, in terms of this type of attack of a young woman by a colleague of ego-maniac who feels that he is above the system, unfortunately, it often is. <br /> <br /> The cast here was credible, and the performances credible. Many of these Canadian / life films are decidedly "over-the-top". However, this is one that I could label as "under-the-top". <br /> <br /> Despite enjoying the fact that it was not presented in an exaggerated way, this movie somehow looked like a disc being played at a slower than adequate speed, the 96 minutes seemed much more, and had the effect of appearing to be a shorter, over-and-over looped movie, apparently switched on and on and connected - before reaching its inevitable and predictable conclusion. However, the characters and engaging performances made it better than the film of this kind, despite these criticisms. <br /> <br /> And while these images often "milk" the climax, this one could have given a bit more detail and length.
