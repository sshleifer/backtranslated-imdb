Pickle was the most underrated film of the decade. Despite my best efforts at home, it's still seen as a bad movie. I say to hell with everyone on it. Each one does not understand that it is in part a comedy with a dramatic twist in the end. Danny Aiello plays an exhausted director with perfection and conveys a depressed and sad man. the scene in which he is trying to record a last message is very good. The interludes of the movie Stones are absolutely funny. "This is Harry Stone and today I become a man!" In all a film well and unfortunately misunderstood. Another great participation from Little Richard. Hilarious! I hope more people see this movie because 202 people are not enough for a consensus. <br /> <br /> - Silence Dogood
