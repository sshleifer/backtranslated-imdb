It's a shame that an important movie like this is virtually unknown. <br /> <br /> I do not think Alan Bates has made a better movie than that. <br /> <br /> This has never been shown on television. . The only time I remember it being on British TV was in the summer of 1998. I have it on tape but unfortunately the quality is not good due to a dubious antenna at the time ... <br /> < I remember wanting to see this movie for a while before it appeared on TV. It was shown on Channel 4 in the early hours of the morning, thus ensuring it remained invisible except for a very small audience. <br /> <br /> I lived in Bristol at the time and it was ironic that when I finally saw the movie, I realized that I had been through VERY MUCH where it was filmed several times before !! The film follows a fine line; a couple trying to let go of their tragic situation of dealing with the severely handicapped daughter laughing about it and even involving the child in their jokes. <br /> <br /> Direction and acting are so superb that the film is always compassionate and moving and never runs the risk of falling into bad taste. <br /> <br /> A few years ago I saw a clip of theatrical production filmed with Eddie Izzard in the role of Bri and Victoria Hamilton. Touching Sheila. <br /> <br /> He showed Izzard improvising and joking and Hamilton jokingly telling the public to ignore him when he is being like that. <br /> <br /> I might have taken it out of context as I only saw a short clip, but after reading the play and watching the movie, it's clearly such a delicate subject that this approach is insensitive and disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Izzard was praised for his performance, but I felt uncomfortable about it. what l saw. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps surprising that such a piece of success could not find an audience when it was finally filmed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best British films of the 70's and we hope it will be released on DVD someday.
