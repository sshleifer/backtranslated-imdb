There are times when you do not want those deep drama series. When you do not want heavy story series or an obligation to watch each episode to be able to handle it. There are times when you just want to watch a simple series with lots of action and cool characters. For those moments, you have Cleopatra 2525. I was one of those who really liked Charlie's Angels. Critics said it was shallow and silly. But the thing is, that's the point! People who can not relax and expect a serious movie to hate him. It is exactly the same with Cleopatra 2525. It is superficial. It has silly and unreal characters. And that's why I like it. It's not like any other series. <br /> <br /> The first season was not very good. The character Cleo was annoying and a little too much. The story was a bit lame and you did not know much about the characters. But, hey, they only had 20 minutes in each episode. <br /> <br /> In the last 5-6 episodes of Cleopatra 2525, they finally gave the series a total duration of 40 minutes. And that's where I started to love. The series finally began to turn into a very qualitative series. Too bad they had to cancel the series. Because the last episodes of Cleopatra 2525, in fact, were very good. I will never forget Hel, Sarge and Cleo. Unique characters that only the creators of Xena could have created!
