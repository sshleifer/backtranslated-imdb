My favorite movie this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing were smooth, visually beautiful and interesting. <br /> <br /> Situated in Barcelona, ​​the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and several others. Cultures and languages ​​collide, but hearts and lives intertwine. The lead role would never have been released in Hollywood, but he took the role perfectly. The characters were well developed and their interaction was honest and accurate. There were two particularly noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired. The film is sentimental, and the last ten minutes could have been cut, but it was wonderfully entertaining. <br /> <br /> I almost did not watch, but only saw Audrey Tautou. His role, although billed second or third, was smaller, and was surpassed by several other characters. I wish more movies like this were made. Brought to mind The Big Chill or The Breakfast Club. Do not start this movie later if you plan to go to bed half-way.
