SPOILERS AHEAD Great WrestleManias were still a few years away. But this was certainly good with many good games and a great game. <br /> <br /> The demolition has always been at its best at WrestleMania. I'm glad that the last WM hoorah (I refuse to include the other version) was a victory over the Colossal Connection. I liked Andre's joke that he never identified himself. <br /> <br /> Few fans know this is the first time someone has hit Mr. Perfect. For some reason, the talent of Brutus Beefcake has never been recognized. Or the fact that he did it very easily. <br /> <br /> The Hart Foundation's victory over the Bolsheviks was the shortest in WM history, including the second game of 24/9 between King Kong Bundy and S.D. Jones. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Jake and DiBiase have fought at WrestleMania. This made up for the fact that the dispute had to be suspended for so long. <br /> <br /> I hoped the Big Bossman-Akeem contest would heat up, but Bossman only defeated him. As good as Bossman was like a jump, he was great as a face. He was always intense and obviously loved his job. <br /> <br /> If the Warrior had a better work ethic and might try to learn how to fight, he would have been a great WWF Champion. <br /> <br /> Worth a watch, especially since the boring matches are too short to claim. And the tag team matches are all very exciting.
