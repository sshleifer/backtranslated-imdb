This is a lovely movie to say the least. The main character, Fanda, is an old man who refuses to be among the undead he is surrounded by. He and his accomplice go around making jokes and getting into trouble all over town. Meanwhile, his family is on a war footing about what to do with it. From there you see Fanda's relationship with his wife, best friend and son. It finally leads to one of the best endings of movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are rich and deep. They develop well throughout the film. The film has a variety of humor. It goes from light and funny to somber and gloomy. Any slow parts for you in this movie will be offset at the end. <br /> <br /> Autumn Spring bears a message similar to what many other European films do - they do not lose sight of the small pleasures. In life. If you liked Amelie, The Eighth Day or Life is Beautiful (all the great BTW movies), you'll probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
