The relationship between the main characters I thought was very realistic. How the two end up involved is believable. There's not that whole "oh yeah right" that most Hollywood movies have. Not too mention how they captured the sexy, beautiful and painful side of the trapeze. I'm a trapeze student and I love that they showed how hard it is on the body, hands and yes those fabric burns are brutal! Definitely a must see for the relationship as well as the art that is made in the movie. I loved! I'm happy with how the movie ended, but I definitely wanted to see more. Make sure you stay seated through the credits for a special hehe treatment. Great scene!
