I do not have a really solid thesis here, so I'll make some observations. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is absolutely beautiful. It is shot in high contrast black and white, and some of the scenes are so well composed that they almost distract. <br /> <br /> There was a following at the beginning of some intense protests, and some of the plans were incredible. - three guys throwing tear gas against demonstrators, etc. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think one of the biggest signs that this is a recent movie dating back to the 60's is that it's really about how the idealism of the revolution has turned into something different. Examining this change is really interesting - I think both the political phase of things and the more self-indulgent artistic phase have strengths and weaknesses. The film does not necessarily assume the position that things have fallen. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, I think the novel works very well. <br /> <br /> Finally, I really, really, hated the ending. . It was very melodramatic. You could even say that the ending is unworthy of the movie that preceded it.
