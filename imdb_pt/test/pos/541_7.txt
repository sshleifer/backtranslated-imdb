I was impressed by this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays a fickle, irrational and possessive mother who constantly gives her the message that they should be together. She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting career as an actor in Hollywood. The daughter is dubious, but at first she has no choice - the bond with her mother is pathologically strong. <br /> <br /> Over time, the girl sees that the mother is on flights of fantasy and does not have it. feet on the ground. She sees her mother stand upside down by a handsome, seductive guy who loves them and leaves them. She sees that the mother does not understand. So how can she look to the mother for guidance? <br /> <br /> The mother takes the girl to a drama test and sees the daughter represent the mother's part in such a way that an incredibly painful mirror is held up to the fly-by-night mother. This causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified at the impact on the mother and apologizes, but the lesson takes over. <br /> <br /> There is character growth when the mother realizes her selfish claim about her daughter. and is eventually persuaded to let the girl go. It is a touching scene and a valuable lesson, that parents, though emotionally dependent, have to let the child go and become their own separate person.
