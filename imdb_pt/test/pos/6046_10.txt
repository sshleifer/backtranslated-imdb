Hey, the army sergeant. I'm sorry, man, but being an SGT in the Army and being in the Army National Guard does not make you qualified to comment on a Navy movie. You're not a Marine and just because you wear a uniform does not mean you can relate to being a Marine. We are simply the best, we have the hardest training, yes, we have big heads about ourselves, but, hey, when you're the best, you like to show off your things. I was in the invasion of Iraq and in Fallujah. I fought alongside soldiers. You're not "qualified" to say anything about my Marine Corps. I hate being the one who starts the whole "which branch is best," but you have no right to say that you are qualified to judge a Navy film. Oh yeah ...... we are drill instructors ....... not Drill SGT. That is the biggest tip that you have no idea about what you are talking about. Yes, we do not "curse" more recruits. Tell me, what's it like to curse someone to make them a better Marine? How am I going to hit someone to make a Marine better? Yes, it's a friendlier camp than I've been through. But we are dealing with different times and people. We are training people who are smarter than our generations' recruits. We want smarter, not evil, recruits. And who signs up to be a Marine first, has a dedication to being the best that their country has to offer. We do not have to enforce this in Bootcamp. The Marines come to the Bootcamp wanting to be killers. We do not need to teach them, demoralizing them, cursing and beating them. At least that's how I feel. And yes, I am "qualified" to say that. I have been on the battlefield countless times and I have trained Marines and Recruits who eventually ended up on the battlefield. But again, what I know. I was there, I did it, I got the shirt. SGT Army ....... have a clue!
