I've always liked the music of Frank Sinatra, and recently I wrote an article about his life story. I was fascinated by the life and legend of Ol 'Blue Eyes. However, I have never seen any of his films. So I wanted to see if his acting was as good as his. Well ... it was! I was impressed by your performance in this movie! He really does a tremendous job of recovering heroin addict Frankie Machine, who is trying to get his life back and audition as a drummer for a local band. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger's direction is great too. I have not seen any of his other films. I read your bio on IMDB. He looks like one of those directors who was misunderstood, and people had conflicting thoughts about him. He seems to be the kind of person who draws worship enthusiasts the most. I have not seen enough of his movies to know for sure if he's really brilliant, but now I'm curious. I want to see more of his films, because judging from his attempt with "The Man with the Golden Arm", this guy has talent. I also loved the song for this movie. The score definitely contains the kind of music that I will remember if I happen to hear it again. That's when you know you have a great score. <br /> <br /> The supporting performances are also well, including Darren McGavin as the local drug dealer, Eleanor Parker as Frankie's wife and Kim Novak as his lover. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see how filmmakers deal with the subject of drug abuse, unlike modern attempts at such films as "Trainspotting" and "Requiem for a Dream." In 1955, just mentioning the word "drugs" caused controversy, and if you watched the movie they kept the subject on a very low level. There's only one scene where Frankie is injecting heroin into his arm, and they showed a close-up reaction to his face instead of showing the needle clipping his veins. But she delivered her message without making it look diluted. In a powerful drama like this one, with powerful performances and direction like this, you do not need graphic representations of drug abuse to keep the public intrigued. <br /> <br /> "The Man with the Golden Arm" is a dramatic gem that all movie fans should check out. It really is an amazing job! <br /> <br /> My score: 8 (of 10)
