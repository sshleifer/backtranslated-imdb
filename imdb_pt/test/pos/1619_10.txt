This is a low budget stop motion monster movie by Brett (The Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell) Piper ... and offers exactly what I would expect from such production: light-hearted (though tacky) dialogue, a few cute and lots of stop motion bugs. That's why I gave the film 10 out of 10 - because it offers what I expected it to deliver ... and a little more: Brett does not penetrate when it comes to putting his creatures on screen. He throws many insects into his cast for the end. And, anyway, I LOVE stopping moving monsters that, compared to CGI creatures in larger movies, seem to be a lot of fun to watch.
