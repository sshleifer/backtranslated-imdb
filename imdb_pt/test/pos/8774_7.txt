Overall, this is a funny and weird movie. Do not try to make sense of it. There are more holes in the story than a computer could follow, but Robert Cummings and a cast of supporting characters are mostly fun to watch in this "runaway" story. <br /> <br /> Unlike the popular TV show and then 1993 film, this fugitive is not looking for a one-armed man but a two-armed Nazi saboteur by the name of "Frank Fry ". Cummings ("Barry Kane") is guilty when a defensive factory explodes in Los Angeles and runs off looking for the man who did this (Fry) to clear his name. <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes or are very tense and interesting. Then Priscilla Lane ("Pat Martin") enters the story and begins to bog down a little with some sweet talk. Director Alfred Hitchcock used to do this to his female characters, to the point of asking me if he had any idea how the woman was talking. Lane's character here was a bit lame. <br /> <br /> In fact, the villains played by Otto Kruger ("Charles Tobin") and Norman Lloyd ("Frank Fry") were the best, in my opinion .... just fascinating. Kruger's performance and dialogue was especially good. <br /> <br /> If you have not watched this movie but have seen Hitchcock's well-known "North By Northwest", you will laugh at the end and really enjoy it. Instead of a climactic scene on Mount Rushmore, we have here a memorable last 10 minutes in the State of Liberty. As usual, the Hitchcock camera angles are great and fun to watch.
