Well, I just saw the premiere of Buster Keaton's movie in The Fatty Arbuckle Butcher, and despite the rude way, everything seems to happen for almost no logical reason, I found a lot to laugh about. Like when Buster orders Fatty Butcher's molasses, Fatty makes Buster come back to pay, Buster says he put him in the bucket that has molasses, Fatty pours the molasses into Buster's hat and gets money, Buster takes the hat back on the head trapped , Fatty tries to remove it while the molasses falls to the ground, Buster's feet are now pinned to the ground and so on. This probably did not read funny, but the screen was hilarious as well as another slapstick involving flour being thrown and a later sequence that happens at Fatty's girlfriend's high school with Fatty Trailing Dress and Buster helping Fatty's rival also on drag. As I said, many scenes do not make much sense, but the visuals, especially those involving Arbuckle and Keaton, are laughing inducers to this day. Recommended view for Keaton finalists.
