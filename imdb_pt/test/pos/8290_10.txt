THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE There are some movies that I've been watching all my life and I never tire of them, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE was a 1987 attempt to bring the old favorites back to the front of the animation, this time on the big screen. In a time when Disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation quality and box office, THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE stands out as one of the best animated films that Disney did not produce in the 1980s. is simple and elemental, with Alvin, Simon & Theodore competing in a race around the world with the Chipettes (Janette, Eleanor, & Brittany). However, as squirrels encounter exotic perils, they do not know that they are pedestrians in a major diamond robbery. <br /> <br /> THE ADVENTURE OF CHIPMUNK has never been and will never be a movie that stands out thanks to a captivating storyline. And for people who did not like it as a kid, the movie will probably never be more than a nice animated film, though forgettable. But for me, it will always be a little-known masterpiece. Something about the movie just clicks on me in a way that few movies do. <br /> <br /> Every song is fun, optimistic and harmless. Highlights include the Chipettes in a slightly risque Arabic dance to calm snakes. There is also a very sweet song in which the Chipmunks sing about traveling the world and we can see them in the main sights of the world. One thing about the Chipmunk characters is that, despite potentially irritating vocals, composers have always written songs that were catchy without ever being annoying. This movie is no exception ... it actually has one of the best soundtracks in animated movies of the '80s, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Every joke is cute, sincere and fun. The bits between the bad guys and a spoiled puppy are a lot of fun. And the shock of seeing the Chipettes almost forced to marry by a child emperor is also. The comedy can play constantly for the children so they do not miss anything, but everything remains charming to adults with nostalgia enough to keep them entertained. <br /> <br /> It's really just a fun trip that is completely humble in your ambitions. THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE is never meant to be anything more than that, harmless fun. I will be the first to admit that this is a biased criticism because I have such nostalgic affection for the CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE that I would never be able to give a bad review ... but even so, it fills me with such childish contentment while watching. Everyone has their favorite random from childhood that no one knows, and for me it's this movie. And any movie that I can watch over and over if I'm 5, 12, 23 years or older, is a great movie in my eyes. <br /> <br /> A ...
