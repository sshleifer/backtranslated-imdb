Opera of the death camp: here and now! <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, I read that a very special film had been directed at the polarization of our society. A certain Peter Watkins was the author. Your picture was represented by non-professional actors, citizens like you and me? and others. The violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic. Was it a movie, a documentary? Both in fact. <br /> <br /> Over the years, I realized how difficult it was to find him. Maybe I, by coincidence? Anyway, it's still an old story. I saw this a little while ago. Totally awesome. My favorite art peace: Punishment Park is his name. I love this "docu-fiction", that "truecastmovie", that "reality-showsfictionnal", that never. After all the shock movies I've seen, I achieve the best with this strong and intense experience of filmmaking. I found a masterpiece. There are enough on the net to know many things about the movie. It is even buy on DVD with additional material. The only words I want to add are about my own experience with this movie. I can only rely on such a sincere and engaged peace of art about people and people, those who drive, act, or watch. A cinema that is simply a real human experience within an art adventure? or the opposite. So I'm not talking about all the 'mucs' we see on TV, especially the real 'reality show', to whom the concepts of people interpreting themselves are interesting, but used a stupid and perverse way. In Punishment Park, we can see some real living individuals as they are. We just put them in a very specific context, with a few lines to follow, and we let them be what they want to be. It is a kind of therapy, a form of "individualization" for those inside the film and also for active viewers in front of the screens. So to finish, the director's touch edits a short, sweet apocalypse movie, a desperate cry, a 'Death Field Opera' where some people are fleeing after virulent trials. Punishment Park is for those who want to grow up. Watch this movie and have the opportunity to choose your own morality. Grow and harmonize with it! If you can feel it! If you can see !! In my case, Punishment Park is stuck in me forever, with all my love, conscience and will.
