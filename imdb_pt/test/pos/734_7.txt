Do not look in the basement is really a very clever and well thought out exploration film that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and poor acting. Of course, it's not a masterpiece by anyone's standards, but it's a very entertaining little B movie with a lot to offer and even many scary scenes that will stay in your head. <br /> <br /> As I said, the acting could have been a lot better, but that is the case with most of the holding, so I can not really complain. The story is clever and has some great twists that will make you guess. I thought the blood was a lot of fun too. There's just something great about older movies because they did not have CGI back then, so they had to set it all on their own. See this for a good time!
