As a word of explanation, "The Kid" from Disney has absolutely nothing in common with the classic Charlie Chaplin 1921 of the same name. What we have is a very pleasant family comedy, though unbelievable, as only Disney people can offer. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis, in a change of pace, plays a T-shirt stuffed with an "Image Consultant." He degrades not only his clients, but also those close to him. You know he's going to have to change before the final credits. <br /> <br /> In his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of Willis' character as an 8-year-old nerd played with a cute pie crush. by Spencer Breslin (Disney always finds these kids somewhere). That forces Willis to deal with his past and well ... you know the rest. Appearing as Willis' love interest is Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as his executive assistant. Both have little enough to do, since most of the film involves the interaction between the characters of Willis and Breslin. <br /> <br /> "The Kid", while not the biggest of Disney movies, is that you can sit down and watch with your family and get out of a warm feeling.
