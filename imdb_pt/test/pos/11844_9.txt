I got this movie the other night on one of the movie channels and it did not laugh that long. This movie was so funny that I went out and bought it the next day. I love this kind of comedy. It seemed so real in the way the actors react to the different situations here. I was Rollin. I had never heard of it and just started watching because of the title "See other people". The title made me give it a shot and I'm glad I did. I laughed so hard it hurt. It's now part of my collection. I would definitely recommend it to all those who enjoy comedy. I'll be watching this over and over.
