Jim Henson as Kermit, Dr. Teeth, Rowlf and Waldorf. <br /> <br /> Frank Oz as Fozzie, Piggy and Animal. <br /> <br /> Jerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper, Robin, the Frog, Lew Zealand and Crazy Harry. <br /> Richard Hunt as Janice, Statler, Beaker and Scooter. <br /> Dave Goelz as Gonzo, Dr.Hunnydew and Zoot. <br /> <br /> Charles Durning and Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> Steve Martin cameos, Carol Kane, Orson Welles, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor and others. <br /> <br /> This is Bill's first Muppets movie. others who left, and it's also the best by far! This deals with Kermit the frog going on a trip to Hollywood and meeting the other characters along the way. This movie, besides being good already, has excellent songs performed by the Muppets, including Rainbow Connection, Can You Picture That, Moving Right Along and others. This film, unlike the other Muppets movies, carries a strong sentimental value to me. It's such a good movie. It is also noticeable that it is many appearances with Steve Martin, Mel Brooks and a dozen others. <br /> <br /> My rating-A plus. 109 min. rated G.
