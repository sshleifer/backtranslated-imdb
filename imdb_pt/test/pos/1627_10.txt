I was excited at the opening to hear part of "Chevaliers De Sangreal", but wanted more, so I bought Hans Zimmer's piece. Possibly the 4 minutes of most inspiring and beautiful music ever written! This thriller movie is an exciting masterpiece thriller even without the religious considerations. You get to visit the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography. The opening at CERN, where the "particle of God" or greater quantity of antimatter is created with dazzling visuals, is an immediate clue that predicts the excellence of this film. Who does not love Hanks? The plot and twists of this film are superb and well designed until the surprisingly distorted climax. This film suggests a satisfactory compromise between Science and Religion, although many closed heads persist on both sides. "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind."
