When I first started watching "Surface," I was hooked for the first time. He had everything I wanted in a thriller show, action, mystery, great plot, and a great cast of characters. My whole family loved watching the show. It seems like when there is a great show on TV, the network usually cancels this as they seemed to do with that program. They use the Nielson rating system, which I think is stupid because there's so much junk they seem to watch, what the networks maintain. If there was a way for everyone to vote for a show, then maybe the good shows would not be canceled. When I watch TV now, I only watch good shows, so now I'm not watching much TV. I hope the network brings the show back, but when they remember that, with a stupid decision, they seem to stay loyal. I hope there are many people out there who feel the same way.
