This movie is sweet - not cloying, just warm and gentle. I found this to be just a bit funny, and the premise * is * highly unlikely, but the characters are so charming (especially Minnie Driver) that they've had my full attention since the beginning, and soon I also had my affection. <br /> <Bonnie Hunt did a great job on her directorial debut, and a good job with writing as well. I highly recommend this movie and I'll see it again, I'm sure.
