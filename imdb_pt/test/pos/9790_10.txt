Bobby and Mikey are two boys who move around the country with their divorced mother to start a new life. Soon after the family settles in, his mother marries "The King," who ends up being an abusive stepfather, especially for Bobby. So Bobby decides that he will "escape" the abuse on his birthday present. <br /> <br /> This film was difficult to watch, especially the scenes of abuse. It was hard to watch an innocent and playful boy being abused and turning into a grumpy, frightened, withdrawn young man. The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> I cried during the last half of the movie. There were some funny scenes too, like the Monster Brew and the dog finding the soda bottles. <br /> <br /> I would not suggest letting the kids watch. It was a movie that was painful to watch and yet really flew away.
