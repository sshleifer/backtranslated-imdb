George Barry is a genius. "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is a prototype for much of the "slipstream" fiction and camp surrealism that is so chic right now. Truly innovative, independent, and just brilliant. Hyper-strange acting, subtly terrifying atmosphere. I recommend reading Stephen Thrower's book, "Nightmare USA" (there is a chapter dedicated to Barry and "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats"). Available at FAB Press. On a related note, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" and "Beyond Dream's Door" make a perfect double note. Moreover, it is banal and tired - and, ultimately, stupidly ironic - to criticize a low-budget cult film for being "poorly made" or "technically inept." The aesthetic of film B is part of the charm of these films. No amount of CGI could duplicate the cumulative effect "Bed of Death: The Bed That Eats" has an advanced palate in the viewer.
