Trey's favorite since season one season 10 and also one of my favorites, Manbearpig presents Al Gore's adventure before entering global warming and before the movie was a similar adventure, Al Gore was also trying to make the world aware of something that can change Earth, something really dangerous, this time about something that is half a man half bear and half pig, Al Gore had only one thing in mind: meet everyone of Manbearpig and kill him! Al Gore here is more than hilarious, everyone who sees him feel sorry for him and yes, he may be childish, making tantrums, since no one believes him, but he is just a demented bastard. Basically, four children are trapped in a cave because of Al Gore, but surely he does not have this in mind, there is no room for any other matter, it's just Manbearpig with regard to Al Gore. These four sons are Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan, basically Stan felt sorry for AL Gore and the four boys were just playing in Al Gore's game never imagining that Gore could almost kill them while he was trying to kill Manbearpig (hilarious scene- "they're just kids, damn Manbearpig"). So in that part we have, on the one hand, all things with the rescue team who also feel sorry for Al Gore and on the other hand we have a small and extremely hilarious Cartman episode and there are no surprises of Cartman's attitude after he finds a treasure inside the cave, surely all the stuff with this treasure is fantastic and it's great because you'll see a sick Cartman in both directions, he's really sick for the boys and really sick for us. And in the end, Al Gore killed Manbearpig! This character is fantastic and I'm cereal! Great fun in this episode, a highly re-watchable. 10 out of 10
