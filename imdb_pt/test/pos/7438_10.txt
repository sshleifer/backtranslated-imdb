I play fantasy final 7, and this movie is EXCELLENT as the game, all final fantasy fans will love this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic and the story is good, but the best of this movie are the visual effects, they are incredible. The characters are equal to the game and this detail is good for the fans. <br /> <br /> You do not have to play the game to like this movie, all people can enjoy the movie, because the story is different and easy to understand. I buy the DVD because it is EXCELLENT, IT IS 100% RECOMMENDED, if you do not see this movie, what are you waiting for? Believe me, you'll fascinate me
