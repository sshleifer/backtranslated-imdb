Where do I start? I saw this movie for the first time in 1995 and had no idea what to expect, I was in the season looking for movies that Elijah Wood had starred in and this one had been highly recommended. I sat and watched the movie once and did not know what to think. I watched for the second time a few days later and the floodgates opened. Never before in my life had I really cried while watching a movie, and I was squandering, all loud and low the movie I was passing next, on an emotional roller coaster. Emotional emotion in me on many levels, the intense sadness and euphoria we see in the movie, the wonder and innocence of childhood, the longing for a time that once was, but it is not anymore. Most of all, this movie reminded me of my childhood (except for abuse) for a time in my life, when I shrugged off my childhood a few years before and did not even notice, I gave up and moved to a life entirely devoid of this. The radio pamphlet made me wake up and suddenly realize what I had given up without actually noticing. From that day on I immediately began to change my life and myself, and I did. <br /> <br /> This will seem tacky, but basically I have rediscovered my inner child, I started down a path that has been continuous. in the last 6 years and I have changed a lot, so much for the better, embracing and living this part of myself. I've found out who I really am. I do not think it was simply a case of the right movie coming at a crucial point in my life, Radio Flyer actually did something very special, and I still see it as an incredible work in every aspect, an incredible movie. <br /> <br /> To conclude, I can not fail to mention the song. I'm a big fan of Hans Zimmer and this is one of his best works. The breadth and depth of emotional expression he put into the score of this film is a big part of what makes the film what it is to me. Like subtitles for a foreign language film, its growing music is a cradle sheet for the intense emotions that this movie will take you through. Find the soundtrack at all costs, unfortunately was deleted long ago, I never expected to find it, but surprisingly, after talking to someone I met in a guestbook of Hans Zimmer. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, let yourself live the emotions, do not get bogged down in trivial nitpicking of the end, be that child again
