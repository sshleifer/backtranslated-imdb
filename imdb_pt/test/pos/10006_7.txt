I felt that this movie had many good qualities. Cinematography was certainly different, exposing the aspect of the setting and the story. The original characters as actors were certainly an achievement and I felt more touched convincingly, of course they are playing in themselves, but definitely unique. Cultural aspects may leave many disappointed, as familiarity with Chinese and Oriental culture will answer many questions regarding parent-child relations and the stigma attached to any drug use. I found the story of Jia Hongsheng interesting. On a negative note, the story is in Beijing and some of the fashion and music of the late 90's, even though this was done in 2001, so it's really extravagant at times (crap the Beatles, etc.). Anyway, not a top ten or twenty, but if it's on television, check it out.
