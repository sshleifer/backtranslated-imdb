I'm really amazed at the little fame that this movie had. I think it has to do with distribution companies and etc. <br /> <br /> Do not be stupid - if you're looking for good fun, take this movie - this is a very good movie to spend a few hours with A music is great. <br /> <br /> It's about ... well girls and boys and what's between them, with little history, but not all movies should be PULP FICTION, should they? It's cool and cute and gives a good time. The girls are also very beautiful and this makes the whole film even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Why did I give only 9? Well, the story could be a bit more convincing from the middle and from the inside. at some point you get to see events that are a little less reliable. SMALL SPOILER: The baby is crying and the father comes in and tries to relax. now I'm not talking about a little crying but - no - crying hysterically and 30 seconds after the father leaves and "baby is sleeping" - excuse me, when and how exactly did you calm down and sleep and be able to leave your room in 20-30 seconds. but ignore this kind of small selection because the movie itself is not Docudrama - it's fun and this should be ignored.
