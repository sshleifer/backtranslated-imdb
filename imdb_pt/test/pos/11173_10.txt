So far, the game is stopped, right? <br /> <br /> The jokes were made. It's all over. The creative genius who directed this game for the first two games is gone, after all. <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> The game is still intact, the jokes are here, people. Of course, they're all rehash, but so was Monkey Island 2. And 1 for that matter. <br /> <br /> The difficulty is well placed, somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously difficult 2. The ship The fighting sub-game is malicious in the tradition of sub-games. And this game has the best joke of the whole series. When prompted for your membership card to an exclusive beach, always select "You do not need to see my ID". It is worth the price of the game by itself.
