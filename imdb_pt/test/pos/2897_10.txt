This DVD will be treated indifferently by millions of classical rock devotees around the world because Rush is not cool. It's a shame that Rush has had to overcome the contemptuous contempt of most American and British journalists for their thirty-year history as it has deprived many people of the chance to join a real band. Each of the last four decades well represented here and what a catalog of songs! We have the seminal "2112," the magical "The Trees" and lyrical "Tom Sawyer" interspersed with the high-energy, gender-challenging pieces from their latest album "Steam Trails." The musicality is almost impeccable, the stage show is spectacular and Brazilian fans are simply crazy (at one point they sing along with an instrumental!) Each member of the band plays on a level that challenges the artisans who believe in art. If you doubt, try the instrumental "La Villa Strangiato" or "The Rhythm Method" for size - rather the latter is a drum solo (which must be seen to be believed). Production of sound and vision values ​​are very high, according to the experience of Rush, and you will also have a documentary set and multi-angles. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing performance and a tribute to the Canadian rockers and all the classic rock fans have a copy.
