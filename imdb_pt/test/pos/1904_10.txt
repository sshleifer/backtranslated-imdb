Citizen Kane .... The Godfather Part II .... Dolemite by D'Urville Martin. This is the largest piece of celluloid ever created and cast on mankind. Rudy Ray Moore in a role that transcends Oscar stars as Dolemite, the most evil cat in the universe. He clearly does not take any jive from any turkey (myself am unfortunately a turkey) and proves this with his powers of rap, pimping and karate chopping. This is blaxploitation at its absolute best, a brilliant example of the genre with its low budget, continuity bugs and hatred for mouse soup eating expletive honkey honkey. The true godfather of rap (not this new absurd Ali) Moore is a kind of juxtaposition of acting technique; somehow managing to be the most charismatic actor of the '70s, and that is to say something. This is a highly recommended staff, if not for the one-liners alone.
