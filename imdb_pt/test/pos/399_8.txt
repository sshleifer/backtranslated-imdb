Normally, Anthony Mann made western movies with "the big guys" - James Stewart, Gary Cooper and Henry Fonda. . . the list cowboy stars. But in this B + movie, he tackled something remarkably different and had a bit of success with what turned out to be a true western. The main character, played by Victor Mature, is a hunter / mountain man, and they are usually romanticized in movies - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson, that kind of thing, where the hero is not really a typical mountain man, but a clean cut. heroic figure who goes out with men from the royal mountain. Not here. For the first time, a true mountain man - vulgar, rude, animalistic - is the central figure, and it's something to see, giving Mature one of his best later roles. Real acting chops are provided by Robert Preston, excellent as a self-centered Custer cavalry commander, and James Whitmore, poor man Spencer Tracy, as one of those veterans who feel trapped among increasingly hostile Indians on one side. and the force that approaches the civilization of the other. Even more impressive is the very young Anne Bancroft as the officer's wife, who is initially repelled by Mature's own vision of the ghastly character, and then discovers that her own civilized appearance fades as she begins to realize, to her own shock, which is attracted. for him. Rarely, if ever, a remote frontier fort was so precisely realized on the screen, without the romantic fascination that John Ford gave such a place in his masterly Apache Fort. Battle sequences are large-scale and remarkably violent, and particularly impressive if you've seen them in widescreen format. Good show and underrated movie, all around.
