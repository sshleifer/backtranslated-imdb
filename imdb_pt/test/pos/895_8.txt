Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot. There she is greeted by a couple and other couples swaying. They are all staying at this huge and very touristy hotel with a gigantic swimming pool. One night they have a pool party complete with native dancers "live". It's very little politically correct and very kitsch. Later, Emanuelle finally got his photo shoot, which ends up being on one of those drive-through, stay-in-your-car safaris (though the picture is beautiful). Throughout the film, Emanuelle is going after all the men he meets. The photograph is very well made in this film. There are scenes with waterfalls, galloping giraffes and ancient ruins. The film is worth seeing on the soundtrack of Nico Fidenco alone.
