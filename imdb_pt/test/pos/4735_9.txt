When I started watching I thought I was watching some amateur pro-Koresh documentary. However, I had never seen 3/4 of the images they used. They interviewed people saying that the FBI / ATF instigated all these things, which sounded so unlikely, but then followed up with videos and FBI testimonials. I was amazed. The documentary followed the Senate's investigation after the fire, and after seeing the interview and video, you'll be shocked that the Senate and the Attorney General turn their backs on the Davidians, basically to cover up the FBI / ATF's assault. If you start watching, you should end it. Otherwise, you'll think it's advertising something like that.
