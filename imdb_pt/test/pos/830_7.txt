I liked. There you go, I said again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a few more times. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer movies like this to trash like Die Hard 4, which holds the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving America. Van Damme moves well for a guy his age (47 I think), delivering kicks reminiscent of one of the Kickboxer. If you like old school action and explosions, this is the movie to watch. This is one of Van Damme's best works. <br /> <br /> The films of Van Damme and Steven Seagal are released in the theaters where I live, so I never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen.
