ONE DARK NIGHT is a highly overlooked and little-known movie from the early 1980's that deserves an audience that I fear will never be, and that's a shame. I've seen this movie compared to others who have gained a bigger name over the years, most notably PHANTASM, HELL NIGHT and MAUSOLEUM. This is a very different film from those and I do not see the comparisons beyond the mausoleum, which is a bit similar to PHANTASM, but not enough to make real comparisons. I'm not sure how this went without wider acceptance. Maybe it's all in the marketing, I do not know. Maybe a remake could give him a new life, unless Raymar drained all his life. I'm not very big on all the remakes that are plentiful these days, but I think they work well with lesser-known movies (except for the horrible GHOST SHIP remake, which in addition to the opening scene and Mudvayne's raucous Not Falling, was total crap). So if a remake of ONE DARK NIGHT falls into the right hands, I think it would make a lot of people go watch the original. I know that's what I do if there's a remake of a movie I have not seen before. So anything that is not a remake, I'm afraid, would not bring that movie back to life. Unless, of course, Raymar has eyes on him. <br /> <br /> Anyway, ONE DARK NIGHT is a must see for horror fans, especially the horror fans of the '80s (because we all know the best horror movies were made). Scary setup. Good acting. Very good story. Campy What more could you want from an 80s horror movie? What is this ... nudity and gore? Well, sorry. No nudity or blood in this movie, but still great! A solid 8 out of 10. Enjoy.
