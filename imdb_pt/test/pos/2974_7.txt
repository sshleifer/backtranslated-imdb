My wife and I saw this when we were 17 years old. The only good thing my father did was get us in. This is "our movie" and the song is "our songs". Michelle's music is "our" music. Yes, nowadays, it is a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were spoiling at age 16, why not these children? The movie is a rich boy impregnating the poor girl, then the rich dad robs her at the end, after she gives birth in poverty. She is left alone with a child. It's a love story and a "growth" story. The music is fantastic, and history is one that anyone can relate to. It may be that someday this will be released on DVD.
