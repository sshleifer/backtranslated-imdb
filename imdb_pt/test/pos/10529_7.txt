This BBC version of an Agatha Christie book shows the pitfalls of following a book very closely. Christie's books tend to move at a gentle pace, sometimes even quiet, and "Evans" is what it certainly does. He also has a solid school of red herring to confuse the plot. This version is extremely faithful to the book, which results in a very slow and involved story. As a Christie fan, I gave it 7 stars, but it takes 3 hours to go through a relatively action-free story. I appreciate some of the grips that the BBC made for his later Christie productions much more. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is an unhurried pleasure, highlighted by the exhalation of wife Francesca Annis, who brings considerable charisma. for her role and plays very well James Warwick.
