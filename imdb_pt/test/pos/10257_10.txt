"Cooley High" is one of my favorite movies EVER !!! I think I saw this movie years ago on late night TV with my mom when I was little and I thought it was so funny. This film was also referred to as a "Black American Graffiti". Glynn Turman is wonderful, as Preach and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs are great as Cochise, friend of Preach. There are some other great characters too, and this movie has a lot of humor. From the beginning of the film in which Cochise goes to Preach's house to prepare for school until the sad end of Cochise's funeral, this movie is what will make you laugh all the time. There are so many scenes in this movie that I really like. The scene where Pooter (another of Preach's friends and Cochise) goes to the zoo with them and picks up the gorilla's feces on his shirt (very disgusting, but funny too), the first scene in the corner diner, the one-room party. in the house of this girl who has become a disaster due to a fight, and some others are wonderful to watch. This movie still has a wonderful soundtrack album, which comes with many wonderful Motown hits and artists from the early 60's (only 6 songs on the soundtrack were made in 75 while the rest were from the 60's). The film is mainly about two friends who dream of moving away from their impoverished and rude neighborhood after high school, but their future seems almost out of reach due to their innocent joy in a stolen car that two other hoods were responsible for, and The Relationship of Preach with his girlfriend, Brenda (played by Cynthia Davis) is almost in danger. Get out and rent or buy this movie, and be ready for a load of comedy entertainment !!! Get the soundtrack too. It's a lot of fun too !!!
