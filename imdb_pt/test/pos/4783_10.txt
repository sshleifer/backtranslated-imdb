This was the first cartoon of the released Mickey Mouse and the first cartoon with sound. It was based on a silent film called "Steamboat Bill Jr." starring Buster Keaton. Back to this brief Mickey, Mickey did not talk or have gloves on. He could only whistle and play music. The song he played was "Turkey in the Straw," using various corral animals as musical instruments. He touches cow teeth like a xylophone and plays teats on a nut like an accordion keyboard. Captain Pete, however, is very crazy and makes Mickey peel potatoes in the kitchen. Pete's parrot flies to the window and orders him to peel the potatoes. Mickey throws a potato half peeled into the parrot and laughs, thus closing the cartoon. I put this cartoon on tape and I really liked it. I think the Disney shorts are a lot better than the feature films.
