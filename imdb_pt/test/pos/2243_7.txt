Starting from where he left off, Doctor Who, Rose, his alternate father, Mickey, his alternative colleague Ricky, and Mickey's little band of rebels are at the mercy of this reality version of Cybermen, this second part of episode 2 Cybermen arc Sente- if more like an episode of Doctor Who, as opposed to the previous part, which honestly felt more like an episode of the defunct show "Sliders" that granted was a great show in its own right. The bow as a whole was fun enough, since I am one of those who subscribe to the maxim of ANYONE Who is good Who, but at the same time it is inevitable that this is compared to the episode of Dalek of the previous series. And such comparisons only make it seem like a minor job, as it is. I feel like this story could have been made in one episode. Recall that in the first part of the review I said that these types of stories dealing with alternative realities generally do not have lasting repercussions as well, it is not the case here, but what changes is the general feel and does not agree with the character . /> <br /> my class: C +
