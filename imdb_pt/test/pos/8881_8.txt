A photo starring Danny Devito and Billy Crystal. They are both famous actors, and in this lovely comedy entails them trying to assassinate one another's irritation. The implication of Billy Crystal is his ex-wife who stole his book and put his name on it, and the caress of Danny Devito is his evil mother. Billy Crystal is an author and a teacher, apparently, and Danny Devito is one of his students. This comedy classic is great fun and for all ages. <br /> <br /> Danny Devito seems to act like a kid in this movie because of his evil mother who keeps putting him down all the time. She says things like "You have no friends!" and when Billy Crystal fell, she said "Bury him before he stinks of the basement!". She put Danny also calling him "Lard Ass"! and other things just to annoy you.
