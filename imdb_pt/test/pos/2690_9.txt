I think my husband and I are a bit slow. We do not usually heat up for a series until they're almost at the end of their production lives. In this case, we did not start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how he escaped our radar for so long. In addition to the fact that we are not big fans of "naming" TV. Our schedules are such that we do not like to commit to watching shows every time they appear (and we still did not have a DVR). So I guess it was not until TBS started running reruns on their daily nightly schedule that we started to watch consistently. <br /> <br /> By the time we got addicted, there were just a few more seasons before the series was canceled. But we still watch almost every day on TBS. I almost prefer to watch shows this way because you can watch multiple episodes day after day and this helps build continuity and what's happening with the characters without having to wait a whole week. <br /> <br /> But the episodes stay alone on since the stories do not repeat from week to week. But that's okay for me, because you can watch an episode, then lose weeks - and still come back. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that writing was not always consistent. Some episodes would be scandalously hilarious, and some would be just slightly funny. So, I'm not sure I had the quality of writers that Seinfeld or Raymond had. But I loved the cast and the characters are all believable and realistic. Kevin James is just plain funny to look at! So even if the plot is not so good, James' body language and expressions make the show worthy of being seen. Leah Remini is great as the "playful" wife. I think it's harder to play the hetero character to laugh, than the comic character, and she does a great job. She has a way of sarcasm and insults like no one else. She's a hard cookie! And who can forget Arthur as the father of Carrie, who lives with them in the basement. <br /> <br /> It's a great series and I regretted it when it canceled. But a big thank you to TBS for keeping the King alive on reruns!
