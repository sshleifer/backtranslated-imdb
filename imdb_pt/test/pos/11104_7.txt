Excellent drama about two alienated and spoiled punks who disagree with the federal government, each for their own reasons. One, a drug addict, just wants to make some money for his next dose, but the other has a much more ominous agenda, fueled in part by his father's resentment. Good performances and a warm script make it a winner.
