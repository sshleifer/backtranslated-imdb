Looking back to that year 2002, when "Fury" was made, one can easily recognize the announcing signs of the New Generation today in Romania. <br /> <br /> The main qualities of "Fury" are in a very solid script, with a substantial dramatic core and a really professional development, as well as a cast of excellent actors. Dragos Bucur and Andy Vasluianu have since confirmed two of our best performers today, Dorina Chiriac follows them closely, and Adrian Tuli, a non-professional (in life real, a graveyard manager!) released as Gabonu, was a genuine revelation! <br /> <br /> In addition, Radu Muntean's direction is skillful and expressive, creating in a very attractive style the feeling of "a fateful night" and an inescapable destination. One can easily go through the few awkward moments and even failures, since time proved that they were only the uncertainties inherent in a debut, never repeated in his subsequent films: "Hârtia va fi albasträ" and "Boogie."
