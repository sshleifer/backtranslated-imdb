HOOT is about these three teenage kids trying to save a bunch of hoot owls. Now for me, I think they are right for what is right and wrong. In this movie, a boy named Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) moved from Montana to Florida. and once he gets on the bus, a bully named Dana Matherson begins to intimidate him. The next day Roy punches the bully and runs off the bus behind the mysterious boy running. after all Roy finally meets the Running boy, whose name is Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley), is actually his nickname that his half-sister Beatrice (Brie Larson) gave him because he can pick up Mullets with his bare hands. Anyway, Mullet Fingers and Roy become friends and they join Beatrice to prevent the construction of a new pancake restaurant. Mullet Fingers is the only one behind all the vandalism that happened there and also afterwards he is bitten by one of the dogs that put him to guard the construction site. so they got up to the trash that was driving the bulldozer and everyone could see the owls that turned out to be a great movie because it showed where children can make a difference in life, facing what is right and what is wrong. that's what's great about this movie. teaches everyone a lot about wildlife and how important it is.
