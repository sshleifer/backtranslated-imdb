Henry Thomas and Robin Tunny are some of the most underrated artists in the industry. It is beyond me because they have not received more recognition than they. This film is a perfect example of how unlimited your skills are. Representing the lives of people who might be considered a little strange seems to be their specialty, and if these characters are no strangers, I'm at a loss to find someone who is. <br /> <br /> The story is funny, romantic, dramatic, complicated and tragic. I hated the ending, but if I had not, I would not have loved the story as a whole. So there you go.
