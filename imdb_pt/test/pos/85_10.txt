This was a great movie. I deal with a child I'm creating who has FAE and seeing that this movie was more than the word can explain. I also bought the book and it was great. I would like to have a copy for my own use and so I can have my child's teachers watching as well. I'd like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie, let me use it for a while or point me to Someone where I could buy it. Thanks, Myra I would recommend this movie to anyone who deals with children / adults with special skills. This movie should appear again on TV. The team of doctors who accompanied my son would also like a copy. Your special Ed teacher has also asked me to try to locate a copy that he may have or borrow. Thank you
