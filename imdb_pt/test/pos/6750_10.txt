I think this movie was made as good as it could have been. With only 4 months and a budget of $ 52,000 - I'm surprised that this was not worse. If you do not mind CG or special effects, this movie is great. <br /> <br /> Ok, the movie is not so well done (I'm sure it could have been but, you try to do better in just 4 months) but the story is good and the movie is quite exciting. <br /> <br /> Do not trust me when I say this movie is good because I also think the 1933 King Kong good. <br /> <br /> I must confess that I did not watch the full movie too ... I could have sent a few minutes here and there ...
