When a saboteur explodes a controversial government research lab, two experimental animals are released in a small community in Washington state. One is a dog with unusual intelligence. The other is an "Exterior eXperimental COmbat Mammal", or "OXCOM". Because of reasons further publicized in the film, the oxcom hates the dog and is trying to kill him. Watchers refers to the accidental involvement of Travis Cornell (Corey Haim), his mother Nora (Barbara Williams) and his girlfriend Tracey (Lala Sloatman) with the dog and oxcom, as two National Security Organization agents Lem Johnson (Michael Ironside) and Cliff. <br /> <br /> Many comments are made about the Watchers being very different from Dean Koontz's book, which serves as the launching pad for the film. Bill Freed and Damian Lee, who wrote the screenplay, are as talented as Koontz is (this is not a comparison of Jon Hess's work as a filmmaker is not to follow the book slavishly as if it were a screenplay, they are adapting the book as artists to do a art It's based on the book, it's not the same. You have to loosen up your prejudices / expectations when watching the movie because you will experience a work of art that you are not yet familiar with even if you read Koontz's novel. <br /> <br /> So, Watchers is a good movie? It's very good, not great. Good enough to win a "B", or an 8. Hess starts off on the right foot with one of the most beautiful explosions I've seen in a while. Unfortunately, he stumbles a little later when we hear a very thick and jargonous display. After this scene, Watchers threatens to become a cliché movie of the 1980s when we meet with Travis and Tracey. Turning to cliché is a continuously threatened trend. But it's just a detour. Most of the time, Hess is able to transcend well-trodden territory with a series of interesting twists: Both Travis and Tracey are from single parents' homes, with their sexes reversed. Both have unique and mature relationships with their parents. Although this is a horror movie, the main focus is a cute and intelligent canine, and often looks as much like an adventure movie as a horror, a thriller or science fiction, which are all the genres he tackles. Hess introduces a large cast of characters, some not coming in until the end of the game, but the movie is never confusing and no character feels like it's left in the dust - all topics are well tied up in the end. The structure is also complex in that there are two major villains, the second becoming less obviously malicious as the film progresses, until a turnaround accompanied by brutal violence makes it a clearer antagonist. Soon after, Hess gives us a good moment of doubt with the other antagonist. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in my eyes is the most feared horror movie since at least the 1980s - the "bout." scenes are filmed very dark, very close, very out of focus, and are edited very clearly. This makes it extremely difficult to tell what is happening, which takes away most of the tension from the scenes that should be a highlight. Certainly, part of Hess's motivation for style, and that is the typical justification for this problem, was the concern that the creature was funny and / or fake rather than frightening and suspenseful. In my view, presenting the audience with a dizzying blur is not a satisfactory solution. We could only see the fantasy / make-up of the creature clearly at the end of the movie. It was well done enough that scenes from the best filmed and edited attacks had taken the film to at least 9 years. Regardless of the degree of correspondence between the novel and the film, Watchers presents an exciting story. using clever and attractive characters. It is often a toe-bite and the horror scenes are wilder than you might expect, if not bloody exactly (though there is a fair amount of blood in some scenes). Observers tend to be overlooked because of misconceptions about the role of cinema when it comes to adapting literature - do not reject it or summarily reject it based on a misconception.
