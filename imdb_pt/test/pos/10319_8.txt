For the record, I'm a Curly fan altogether. But I have to say that, in fact, the Shemp was not that bad. Yes, he might have missed the same kind of antics that Curly had, but in his own way he was hilarious. At least he was not as bad as Joe Besser. In the BOYFRIEND, Shemp plays a music teacher (Stooge? Yes, right), who recently inherited half a million dollars from a dead uncle and Moe & Larry have to prepare him for to marry a woman at six o'clock at night, or without money. <br /> <br /> This was one of the first Stooges with Shemp sketches, before they started to recycle their clothes. material. It's perhaps not surprising that Shemp was part of the Stooges before Curly stepped in, so he seemed natural about it. The jokes are hilarious, especially this scene with Moe and Shemp in a phone booth. Essential stooge short to be honest.
