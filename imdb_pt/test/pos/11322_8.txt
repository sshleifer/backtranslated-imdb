Well, this film certainly was in keeping with the current times. There are no happy endings, superheroes or miracles here. Just realistic fiction to stimulate our minds along the lines of terrorism and what-ifs. Many accolades for Percival and Mickery for an excellent screenplay and excellent direction by Percival. Films like this are needed to keep us aware of what's out there. If all peace-loving men and women on Earth reported suspicious activity, I believe that terrorism could not thrive. This film showed how difficult it is to subvert these terrorists, even with good intelligence. Even though the film is somewhat propagandistic against Islam (using a Muslim policeman as the main character), I believe it was entirely realistic. There should be a shock value in the bombing incident. As a very clever tool to convey the humility and indignity of people involved in such an attack, they showed total nudity of women being decontaminated after the attack. It did not take long to realize that this was to instill even more into the viewer he thought, that is, we are not in control of everything in a situation like this. Although this has happened in London, with her usual high-level British acting, she makes a statement to any part of the world. Great movies do not have to be very successful epic productions, and this film is very much to be seen.
