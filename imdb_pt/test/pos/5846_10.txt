Okay, so I read most of the comments about this movie as well as the comments left by visitors to this site, and the feeling I have is that most people who wrote reviews did not really like this movie. That's why I'm writing now - I represent the minority because, I did. I admit, I went to see the film because I'm very impressed with Ryan Gosling's compelling skills, and the projects he's been involved with lately have been nothing short of incredible. He's an incredible actor. That aside, I wanted to see this movie because it sounded intriguing to me ... why? Because it's a whodunit where you know `whodunit 'from the beginning, and that's kind of unusual. <br /> <br /> As the plot unfolds, two teenage boys are committed to committing the "perfect crime" because they believe in a distorted story. Philosophy that only by committing acts of crime are truly free human beings - the uninhibited ones, and we will remember, without guilt, acting of our own volition. The relationship between Richard and Justin was complex, suggested homosexuality and was brilliantly represented by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. Gosling was the manipulator, controlling the soft talk, and Pitt was the socially clumsy and extremely intelligent outcast. Enter the character of Sandra Bullock, which seems that most people did not particularly like. I think when people see that she's the executive producer, they automatically assume that whatever role the actor has in him is a thing of self-glorification. I did not see this as the case here. Without Cassie's personal story about the ex-husband who nearly killed her, who, not surprisingly, shared similar traits with Richard Hayward, she would never have pursued her instincts about Justin and Richard. The case was apparently airtight against Ray, the unsuspecting janitor of the school and friend of the boys. Even when the boys are questioned near the end of the movie, neither Bullock nor his partner has much solid evidence about them other than the fact that they lie about knowing each other, and the vomit that Justin has left in sight. Here was the genius of the film, because the philosophy the boys were trying to prove through the act of killing, the innocent acting of the will as 'true freedom', eventually worked against Justin, who ended up having a conscience at last (and eventually left part of your awareness of the body's dumping site). Without this crucial evidence, they almost had a "murder by numbers." And for the readers who were intrigued by the title as much as I, I looked at it and found that something done "by numbers" (like a painting) suggests careful and critical and rigorous planning. There's also a song by Sting called "Murder By Numbers", but that's beside the point. Many readers questioned the need for the relationship between Cassie and her partner, but I think this really wanted to show how she became skeptical and manipulative because of her story. Like it or not, her story plays a major role in this movie because without her, she would probably never have followed her instincts about Justin and Richard. Yes, it was a bit of a clich√© "scorned women, woman acting out of revenge on every facet of your life plot," but I guess without the depth of Cassie's character you have just another movie about teenage murderers, and they can only have got away with it. There is no movie there. <br /> <br /> And for the reader who commented that the teens obviously did not commit the perfect crime because the police were attached to them from the beginning, I can remember that the reason was because of the purposely placed and fully traceable shoe prints . The boys wanted to get involved - it was a game. They were so confident that they committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see firsthand the difficulty researchers would have in finding out what they thought was the truth. What they did not expect was that Cassie Mayweather had an exaggerated case of instinct working alongside her. A little unbelievable? Perhaps. But many crimes were solved by police officers who followed their instincts. However, this is a MOVIE! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in theaters about three times, and each time it revealed a little more to me, and I liked it a little more. The more I watched, the more I was captivated and startled by the psychological depth of Richard Hayward - there are people really like that. My main complaint about the film would be that they should have had Justin's and Richard's interactions a bit more central (because, let's face it, there's intrigue throughout the film) and my main props go into characterization - each character was very distinct and interesting in its own way. It was very well represented, although I have given the character of Ben Chaplin a little more depth to work (he is a good actor) and maybe reduce Bullock's character. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should keep in mind that for a Hitchcock-like thriller like this, basically telling you the "whodunit" at first, poses a very big challenge for writers to keep attention to the end. I think they did it very well, using a few minor twists and turns, slow revelation of the dynamics of the different characters, and lighting the screen with some really emotional performances by young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. I think if we remove our innate cynicism and try to see how psychologically complex the characters are and their interactions, we may be able to look beyond all apparent holes and see the real texture and quality of this film, even if only the characters who were brilliantly portrayed. Especially Richard Hayward. Not that I'm prejudiced. :)
