Nightbreed is definitely my favorite movie, I've used more than one tape. The makeup is incredible, the story is beautiful. It takes a few different twists and turns that are not as profound as the story on which it is based (Clive Barker's Cabal), but for a film adaptation, it remains very true to the source material. The only problem with this movie was vain attempts by the producer to turn it into a teen horror movie, hence the altered ending to allow sequels * eye rolls *. Apparently, one day we will receive a cut from the director who will (hopefully) clarify this nonsense. Until then, I would suggest to anyone who likes dark-type horror as opposed to Freddy / Jason / Micheal type slashers. I really do not know what would be comparable ...
