"Landscape after a battle" opens with prisoner fugitives on a snowy field full of fences - in quite funny moves accompanied by Vivaldis Four Seasons. A poignant opening. But we soon learn to know these prisoners as a mob, and when they (also treated humouristic) bury a living man, the protagonist stops for a moment, but soon is more engaged in finding books in the field of turndown than to worry about his neighbor . <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is set in an American camp from where the prisoners are not released, in some kind of semi-broadcast. A perfect ensemble for a study of war criminality, American camps, Polish nationalism, Catholicism, mourning and human misery in general. <br /> <br /> The film makes an important change. In come women, and with them the film changes light, color and temperament. At the same time, it turns out that these prisoners were slaves to the Holocaust. I think one of the main political themes underlying the film must be the treatment of humanity to the Jews and after the world war, and not just the Nazi exterminations, but humanity allowing that to happen - and even forcing them to leave Europe afterwards. of war. On an emotional level, the film deals with grief and the problem of letting mourning come, how the environment makes mourning difficult, and how difficult it can be to share mourning for people with different experiences. <br /> <br /> But the film is a carpet of underlying contradictions, humor, irony and sudden beauty. Sometimes during the film, a gypsy prisoner plays a harp, an emotional melody brutally rejected by the protagonist. This example takes an important essence of the style and theme of the film. When it comes to humor it is very comical as the protagonist constantly loses and finds his glasses back, in crowds, in piles of hay etc. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to understand Wajda's Spielberg respect when you see this movie. The great light treatment can be compared with Spielberg at its best. Grunwald's intermezzo speaks for itself. Narrativly only brings the film off the field, but filmatically brings the film Dreaming and Eternity with deep beauty. Anyway, there is also another scene that I can not pass without comment. It is the Christian Supper. Undoubtedly ironic but simultaneously deeply religious, we see the moment of transubstantiation, all falling to their knees, while the protagonist is saved from the isolation by the priest to serve as a comic choir. Their bells are mocking the scene, but it also gives emotion and love. When Nina picks up her bread, the sunlight falls on her and the bells ring, it's the peak moment of the movie. <br /> <br /> The leading actors are excellent in their roles. Olbrychski as the perfect protagonist Wajda - the reflective mind that doubts, unable to put all aspects of his mind and emotion in life. Linda Celinska has a great acting body debuting in a character unable to express all of her inner self in her proud moves. <br /> <br /> Those who try to describe everything are often unable to take anything into account. This is what Wajda manages. His films are very exciting, deep or beautifully filmed, but watch out for the particularity of life and society. A moment of joy for one is the moment of irony for a second, the moment of regret for the third, a moment of nothing in the room. <br /> <br /> There are at least two reasons to watch Wajdas Movies from this period. The first is the remarkable free expression of profound political impact. This country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. Second is the development of a language of language and narrative that Kusturica rose to greatness.
