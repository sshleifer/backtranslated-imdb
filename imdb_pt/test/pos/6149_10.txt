I do not agree with the imdb.com synopsis that this is about a bisexual guy getting ready to get married. It's more about all the crap we've been through - self-induced and because of our parents - that we have to "get over" when we grow up. As Linda McCarriston's poem says, "Childhood is the barrel they throw over the falls." This film is much more like a narrative poem. It's about the life and mistakes we've made and hurt that we have inflicted and experienced over the years, and how in the end it's all about love (I'm not trying to be hypersensitive or schmoopy) and find and be with a special person.
