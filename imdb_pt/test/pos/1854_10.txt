I just watched this movement for the 5th or 6th time and I'm still in love with it. It still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate. <br /> <br /> I almost wrote a letter to Bonnie Hunt to say how much I love. The scene of David Duchovny's mourning is so real! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite line is when Duchovny says "I miss Elizabeth, but I suffer for Grace." Oh man! I'm crying just thinking about it. ALSO ... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are sooooooooooooo the perfect pair from the Chicago area !! I know them, I swear! I'm related to them, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> This movie is in my rotation three times a year !!! I watch once a week, but I'm afraid to get used to it !!! I always want to make it a special day when I watch !!
