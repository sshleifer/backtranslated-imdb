For a feature film, the storyline closely follows the story - or at least historical gossip. But then the Chinese, who know the story very well by seeing her portrayed again and again, would never tolerate her otherwise. The attention to detail is wonderful, especially to those who read Sima Qian's account in the Historian's Records. Jing Ke, according to Sima Qian, in fact made an attempt on the life of Qin Shi Huang at the request of the crown prince of Yan before the unification. Sima Qian explicitly mentions the head of General Fan and the dagger coiled on the map, as well as the dagger being thrown on the bronze column. Although Jing Ke is described as a stranger to fencing, he is hardly the invincible warrior portrayed by Chen Kaige. Jing Ke is indeed the weakest link in this film. In fact (again, according to Sima Qian), he was a heavy drinker and postponed his visit to Qin for as long as possible, spending a lot of time with Yan's women before the crown prince finally ordered him on the way. He was, in short, a human being and was not anxious to die, although he was willing to accept it. Jing Ke, by Chen Kaige, is afraid of death, but not his own. He is the classic ruthless assassin turned disillusioned pacifist. His love (or perhaps only affection) for a woman and pity for several hundred children Zheng had buried alive (not even two thousand years of hostile Confucian historians have claimed that Qin Shi Huang did this, although there is a legend about him burying 460 Confucianists ). to the neck and then decapitating them) is enough to make this ex-killer kill again. The melodrama is not convincing and the character ends up being simply annoying. The performance here is not down, though not very interesting, given the character. As for Lady Zhou, in all the countless stories I heard about Qin Shi Huang, she never appeared. Anyway, Gong Li is famous enough for Americans to have heard of her (thanks to Zhang Yimou) and there needed to be a love interest, so here she is. It's a shame that his performance is almost as wood as the character of Jing Ke. She did much better (in Qiu Ju, for example) in being subtle; here she can barely manage the presence. But all this is trivial compared to the extraordinary action of Li Xuejian as Zheng himself. Qin Shi Huang is for the Chinese, not what Milton's Satan is to us: accepted as a villain but a nobleman. The achievements of Qin Shi Huang radiate an admiration over two thousand years in the present and Li captures his frightening will without compromising his humanity. Li's performance is sufficient, but the scope of the film is great, although the photograph is purposely monotonous. That sounds old. The punctuation is adequate, hardly moving very appropriate to the action. Although I've only seen it once, I think Chen Kaige should get more credit for his camera work than other reviewers have allowed. Opening credits are stimulating. If five stars is absolutely average, I gave three more to the performance of Li Xuejian and Chen Kaige as actor, writer and director.
