I've seen this movie and anyone who's been with the Marines or any branch of the service can appreciate the accuracy of this movie. It is a must have for any collection. Jack Webb does an excellent job as a heavy training instructor. My dad went to the Navy training camp at Camp Penelton and says that this movie is so accurate that it looks like it's back to basic training. There's a line in the movie where the character Jack Webbs gets angry with a boot for killing a sand flea. Well, let me tell you that there is nothing but sand fleas in the camp. I've been there and I can enjoy it. In fact, the exit to the camp is Las Puljas, which in English means flea city. you should watch the movie to enjoy what I'm saying. Anyone who is in World War II movies, all battles start here with Sgt. A must have for you collection
