Susan Sarandon. She made this movie for me. I've never enjoyed her acting more than I did in this movie. She really acted like she was Adele August. I can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character that is truly believable. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as her characters unfolded through the film. The movie was about them, so the other characters were peripheral. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie an eight note, but Susan received ten of me because of her performance. When it comes to relationship movies, Beaches and Terms of Endearment have had a greater impact on me than this movie, but I highly recommend it.
