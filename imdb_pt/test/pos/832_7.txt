This movie is good in its genre and this genre is of course action on a small / medium budget. It seems that Van Damme offers much better performances when he has a good director guiding him. There's your basic bar fight, alley scene and mostly a lot of armed struggle. Some basic drama, but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine directs an OK action move if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it. But the person who steals the show is: Scott Adkins. Why this guy is not a great Arnold Schwarzenegger caliber action star I do not know. Director Isaac Florentine made a film with Scott Adkins before calling Special Forces (2003), which has an unbelievable martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiasts. Another amazing feature of Scott Adkins is Undisputed 2. Check out this guy and make a noise, this guy needs to have action super star status and he needs to get him now! <br /> <br /> What else can I say about the movie? It's Van Damme stepping up some of his latest work. There are no Oscars for sure, but you already knew that. But never unless you have a nice little town and I could find worse ways to spend my time. So I'm giving a solid 7 out of 10 in its genre.
