I am a person of the next generation ... I have never seen the original doctor but I heard about the series that sparked a large fan base in the past and still leaving its mark in the 21st century; the new "Doctor Who" began in 2005, but for those who live here in the States like me, we see it as new episodes on the science fiction channel or on BBC America; From the first season, we introduced a new player, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and a very cool new doctor played by Christopher Eccelson (with the wrong surname, sorry). these two go on some incredible missions and very extremely dangerous to save the world ... from time to time they have companions of the mickey of the ex-boyfriend of Rose until the now always present Jack harkness (that now can be seen in the spin off) Torchwood. ") From season one to season two, the pace is almost right ... the stories may be from the stranger to the most action-packed, but anyway, it's a roulette ride from the beginning of the theme song, <br /> <br /> In the second season he becomes different and changes and now the new doctor (David Tennant) continues the struggle to save the world with the rose and from this point there may be some who say which part of the season was not so good but I have to disagree and it was sad to see pink and the doctor part ways, but leaves the role of opening "mate" to Martha (played by the very sexy Freema Agyeman), which helps to continue the fight to save mankind ... third season is now more on the action / adventure level and sometimes on the emotional, but not as much in the first two seasons; here the relationship between the doctor and Martha is appropriate, but the attractiveness CAN be rushed in a few moments and the truism comes on the scene, it is NOT pink Tyler being that you experienced your company in the first two seasons and not in the third season may be a little Strange was to me because you wear pink and your manners and now you see someone who sometimes does not question the doctor on an emotional level, but nonetheless makes the pace very exciting for the viewers who keeps you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> All this is an exciting ride from a television show I would give more, but there are some flaws for this show, well I can not mention it because sometimes it's hard to pick up, but only one does the who is the doctor and Martha's relationship is rushed and not level on the basis of knowing you; I've seen good shows on British TV, but this is by far one of the best science fiction adventures for the old generation and the new one, but you do not have to get my world into it ... come in the tardis and join the adventure.
