In the mid-1980s, an OAV anime for the title "Bubblegum Crisis" (which I think is a military slang for when technical equipment goes wild) made its video debut, drawing on "Blade Runner", "The Terminator "and maybe even" Robocop, "with a small hint of Batman / Bruce Wayne - Iron Man / Tony Stark and Charlie Angel's girl power played to good measure. With 8 episodes in length, the general story was that in the 21st century in Tokyo, Japan, in the year 2032-2033, live machines called Boomers were doing manual labor and sometimes they caused problems. A special group of SWAT police officers, the AD Police, was formed to deal with the boomers, but they were ineffective, leading to the millionaire Sylia Stingray, the daughter of the scientist who created the boomers, to create four combat armor facts) to be used by women to combat the boomers and fight against the evil corporation that produced the boomers, GENOM. This group became known as the Saber Rider, and in addition to the leader of the Sylia group, her group of rebellious women included Priss Asagiri, a rock and roll girl with a passion for motorcycles and a disdain for police officers, Linna Yamazaki, an aerobics instructor with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through boyfriends, and Nene Romanova, a young ADP officer and computer hacker (the first in a long line). Meanwhile, GENOM is represented by Quincy, a tall, thin guy who owns the company, his assistant Brian J. Mason (dead in episode 3) and a boring man-boomer named Largo. Other characters included Leon McNichol and Daley Wong, two AD police detectives (Leon appeared in a pre-release anime, "AD Police Files" which I heard was very somber), his boss Balding Toda, Sylia's younger brother, Mackey. and a funny little mechanic known as Dr. Raven, who apparently helps Sylia maintain the suits. In addition to the general plot of Knight Sabers and AD Police VS GENOM, there was also another plot involving a friend of Linna who was apparently a daughter in a large criminal family, the annoying Largo trying to usurp GENOM, and several Priss-wants-revenge- to a minor character story. Oh, and did I mention that there were clues that Sylia herself might have been a boomer? <br /> <br /> Well, it was a great clock, full of chaos and clutter and even some really cool pop songs, but it was not without its flaws, some of which, unfortunately, were due to the fact that the series was discontinued after episode 8, when it was originally planned for 13 episodes in total. Thus, some of the stories, such as Largo's scheme (or schemes), the family of Linna's ill-fated friend, and the origins of Sylia, were never resolved. Another problem with the series was that at the time Priss was the most popular character, so a good part of the series focused on her, and sadly, most episodes aimed at Priss basically focused on Priss self-righteously seeking justice / revenge for some minor character who had never appeared before, but who happened to be her friend, still rarely put aside the Knight Saber, who always freed her from trouble and for some reason cared much for her well-being. being (to be fair though, she went to rescue Linna in episode 7, and her boyfriend was killed by a boomer and the ADP acted wrong in the investigation). This meant that we did not really focus on Sylia's most interesting story, or even on the day-to-day pranks of Nene and Linna. Linna had two episodes oriented around her, which belonged to her friend of the mafia family, while Nene managed to grab the last episode for herself, which showed her that good eternal joy was genuinely good humor and not ditziness. Nene also had to use her skills well with the computer, or sometimes just acted like a kind of goofy, who put her screen time and character development just above poor Linna, who was pushed to the bottom only with her. greed and their tendency to consume boyfriends to get some attention. Do not get me wrong, I like and love the general concept of it all, but it annoyed me a bit. In addition, this is one of those runners-up for the "worst voice-over features in English of all time," which means it's best to stay with the Japanese. Some voices were fine (some really matched their characters' personae), but some were simply weak and unfazed or, in Priss's case, really exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Well, Tokyo 2040 comes along and practically throws it all out the window. A few years down the road, the story here is that after the earthquakes struck Tokyo, GENOM boomers rebuilt the city in a large, ancient paradise, except that boomers still tend to fly off the handle, which that AD Police be formed. the knights sabers being formed. So the overall story is the same, but the characters' stories, the look and the attitudes of the characters have changed a lot. <br /> <br /> Originally, Sylia had short black-haired, brown-eyed hair, usually dressed as an austere business woman appropriate and distant from others. 2040 Sylia has a more supermodel look, dressing more provocatively and with white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light (varies from blue to purple to silver and eyes occasionally looking purple or gray) and also 2040, Sylia is plus an emotionally unstable woman who runs away from control when not in public, and possibly holds even more secrets than before. Sylia is not as risky on the battlefield either, as she's more of a pit-in-the-mobile here, but she fights when she needs to. <br /> <br /> 2 Originally, Priss was a short woman, Afro and very grumpy, always bickering with people who offended her, always biting more than she could chew, etc. 2040 Priss, however, followed the path of Clint Eastwood's loner. - very cold, very stoic and emotionally distant (more like the original Sylia you can say), so she's not really attached to anyone. Also her hair is tougher and catlike (a big improvement) and she is dressed in Trinity leather from "The Matrix" (though much less irritating than before, unfortunately writers spoil it at the end when they reveal their reasons hating the ADP). <br /> <br /> 3) Linna originally had this great black hair for her, but now her hair is shorter, browner, and, well, more than the 1990s. 2040 Linna is also an office lady who has bad luck in being sexually harassed. As if to apologize for the way she was treated by the OAV writers, the writers of 2040 devoted the first 6 episodes to Linna, writing her as a young country girl in town, but determined to find the knights and gain a place with them, that she finally does. <br /> <br /> 4) Originally a short, red-haired girl who was often the victim of ridicule and ate very sweet, Nene is now a short blonde-haired girl who likes to tease and lead shots at the ADP Leon detective McNichol (revenge for him playing with her in the OAV?) And other characters, even his replacement Linna and Mackey, "brother" of Sylia, with whom she falls in love. Cockey and arrogant, she still eats very sweet and is a master hacker, but she is eventually emptied and grows beyond her comic relief status. <br /> <br /> 5) Nigel Kirkland is a new character, a tall, stoic, sturdy and handsome man with long black hair (looks like Adrian Paul from TV Highlander), he replaces Dr. Raven of the old series and now serves as the man who maintains the overalls of Sylia. Nigel is also Sylia's lover, but you do not know this by his behavior. He is Mackey's father / elder brother / mentor type. <br /> <br /> 6) Leon and Daley are back, but of course it's different. The original Leon was a tall, handsome boy, built like a baseball player with dark brown hair, blue eyes, a black leather jacket, tight jeans and always carrying a revolver that could magically pack more than a bunch if needed ; While he was not really a bad guy in the background, he was kind of an idiot, but he served mostly as comic relief, as he tried to pursue Priss romantically (exactly what he saw in her is a mystery), but occasionally he and Daley served as information guides for important plot points. Also the original Daley was a well-muscled red head wearing pink / purple suits, for he was an extravagantly homosexual character who was always giving Leon over when he did not give important information. In 2040, Leon is no longer a handsome kid, but rather his typical sturdy and sturdy type with spiky black hair, brown eyes, tall, sporting muscles, a brown leather jacket and blue dockers (he really looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger a little, or maybe a pumped up Colin Farrell, or Hugh Jackman), and he still carries a revolver, a big one, but it's not as powerful as before. Although 2040 Leon still has a little attitude (especially in approaching Priss), he is not as dumb as in the old series, but he has a bad temper and is easily troubled by Nene and Daley. (also drinks lots of coffee). Oh, and Leon is still after Priss, but he's a lot luckier this time around. Daley, meanwhile, is now a taller (but not as tall as Leon) taller guy with red-rimmed glasses, a white suit, green eyes and light brown hair, and he carries a large machine gun (he really looks like James Marsden from the X-Men movies); Daley is much smarter and more assertive in 2040 than the OAV, and although it is not entirely clear, his homosexual tendencies were almost totally gone except for a moment of what seems to be jealousy when he hears about Leon asking about the email of Priss. 7) Brian J. Mason (which means "J"?) Is back, just like Quincy, but Mason is much more the main villain here, with Quincy as co-villain, as he is no longer an imposing figure of terror , but a vegetable with a lot of batteries and wires attached to it. Mason now sports hairstyles behind brown hair instead of black hair as he did on OAV (he really looks like OAV Leon in a suit) and he's a lot of Alan Rickman's school of villains. <br /> <br /> 8) Although a pervert in the first installment, Mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040. Of course, there are many different things about Mackey in 2040, but they will not be revealed here. <br /> <br /> 9) Sylia now has a companion, a kind of Alfred-the-butler named Henderson, who cares about her and her gang. <br /> <br /> 10) In the original series, boomers were like the Replicators in "Blade Runner." , armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions, but by 2040, they are more of the "ass-monster-in-fury" type. Most of the time they are just big robots that do what they are programmed to do (heavy duty, combat, cleansing, etc.) and they have this "rogue" tendency, which means trying to evolve and become a monster. in the process. <br /> <br /> What remains the same is the theme of humanity VS technology (do machines have souls?). Unfortunately, this series, though well animated and well written, only runs 26 episodes, so it moves faster than one might like, especially those of us who are accustomed to more than one season of our most beloved characters, and unfortunately it still ends in a cliff hanger with unresolved plot pieces (which I will not discuss here.) What saves this spectacle and does it what it is, however, are the characters, a colorful cast of screwballs they are, ranging from solitary stoic intellectuals, old sage wise and innocent lovable, far more diversified than before and with much more to throw away, they are enough to make you wish this show had <br /> <br /> It is not very good, but it is a good clock, also the English dub (by ADV) is very good, although not without some points flat, s certainly better than the original dub.
