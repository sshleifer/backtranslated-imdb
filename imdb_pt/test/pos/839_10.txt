The third and final film Female Prisoner Scorpion, directed by Shunya Ito. The star of the series, Meiko Kaji, would complete the fourth part series, Grudge Song, directed by the capable Yasuhara Hasebe (who also directed Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The original Female Prisoner # 701: Scorpion is one of my all time favorites. The sequel, Jailhouse 41, is almost as good. It's generally considered the best of the series, and I can agree, I think, if it ever gets better on DVD (the original, by Image, it's too bad). Beast Stable, in my opinion, is almost as good as the FP701. It is much slower, much more contemplative. It has its share of violence and evil, but there is more focus on the story and the characters. Sasori (Kaji) escapes the detectives in the first scene (she is handcuffed to one of them and expels his arm, escaping with him in tow, which must be seen to be believed!) And connects with a freelance prostitute, Yuki. Yuki is being bothered by a ring of local prostitution, which includes a goofy-looking madame with a cage full of pet crows. What really surprised me is how sad the movie is. The story of Yuki, which is never resolved, is heart-breaking. The pictures are amazing and the direction of Ito is masterful. It's a shame he never went anywhere after he left the FP701 series. This is an incredible movie.
