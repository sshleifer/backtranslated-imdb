"The Beguiled" is a strange work between the work of Clint Eastwood. In 1971, he became known as the star of action films, not only the Faroestes (the genre in which he made his name), but also war films (such as "Where Eagles Dare") and police (such as "Coogan's Bluff "). ") However, although" The Beguiled "took place during the war (American Civil War), and was done by Don Siegel, who had previously directed Eastwood in" Coogan's Bluff "and later it was the same year to direct him to" In most of his previous films, Eastwood has played an active role, but here his role is largely passive - his character, Sgt. John McBurney, is a a fugitive wounded forced to rely on women's charity to survive.Even while serving with his unit, McBurney did not actively participate in the conflict, he is a Quaker whose religious principles forbid him from bearing arms and was serving with Union forces as a nurse doctor. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in Louisiana at the end of the war and begins with the bruised McBurney being discovered by a young woman named Amy and brought back to her boarding school.The school is small with only two professors ores and a handful of girls. Although some of the girls are fervent advocates of the Confederate cause and want to hand it over to the authorities, the director, Martha Farnsworth, decides to house him and care for him, fearing that his injuries will be fatal if he is sent to one of the notorious prison camps of the Confederation. <br /> <br /> Although McBurney scrupulously follows his religion's teachings regarding pacifism, he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following his teachings on the sin of fornication, and when he begins to recover he makes full use her opportunity to exercise her charms on both the team and the older girls, and he wins the affection of many of them, including Ms. Farnsworth, his assistant Edwina and Carol, one of the older girls. Even at age 12, Amy seems to have a kind of childlike passion for him. In the sexually repressed atmosphere of the school of women only, their presence gives rise to jealousy and hatred, and Ms. Farnsworth, rejected in favor of the desolate Carol, plot a terrible revenge. (Curiously, the only woman to resist McBurney's liking is Hallie, Miss Farnsworth's black slave, though he tries to convince her that she's fighting to free people like her.) "The Beguiled" was described as an anti-war film, but that seems to me to be a misnomer. The film is not really about the mistakes and correctness of the Civil War or the war in general. The only acts of violence we see are perpetrated by noncombatants, and are motivated by a desire for personal revenge, not out of zeal for the cause of the Confederates. It would be more correct to see the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that can be caused by the peculiar circumstances of the war. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the school, situated in a beautiful mansion before the war, looks like an island of peace in the middle of the war. The building is in classical style, associated with order, harmony and restraint, but the story unfolding within its walls is of disorder, passion and violence, qualities associated with the Gothic school of writing that in the 19th century was often regarded as the antithesis of classicism. The film can be seen as something that has been called the "Southern Gothic" tradition in American cinema and literature. <br /> <br /> The film was not a big hit at the box office, possibly because Eastwood was cast against the guy. It's not perhaps his best movie but it showed that he could expand his reach and interpret something beyond action heroes. (In "Play Misty for Me," his first film as a director did the following year, he went back to playing a "passive" character in danger from a vengeful woman). There are some very good performances by the female cast members, particularly Geraldine Page as Martha Farnsworth, apparently a respectable middle-aged spinster, but internally a woman of strong passions. (There are indications that she may have had an affair with a man she passed as her brother). There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Hartman as the timid and repressed Edwina, who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of ​​revenge and the young Pamelyn Ferdin as Amy. (Amy is an animal lover - a key moment in the movie happens when McBurney kills her pet tortoise - so it's interesting that Ferdin later became an animal rights activist). The only character I least liked was Carol, by Jo Ann Harris, who seemed too modern, like a seventies girl who was transported back in time to the 1860s. The film is notable for the atmosphere of emotionally intense "greenhouse" which Siegel brings to him. This will not be a movie to suit all tastes; some will find it exaggerated and melodramatic, and some find it misogynist. (Judith Crist called the movie "Hateful and Sadistic Women"). Others, however, may find psychological drama convincing. 7/10
