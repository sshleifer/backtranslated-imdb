Despite all the negative reviews I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not saying this lightly. I love movies and am quite picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, some are OK, some I do not like). And for all those with criticism: this is a comedy. I just love this movie. It is light, fun and very peaceful. I am aware of all (or most) of the shortcomings, but I love it. The comedic talents of Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro are harnessed (totally - for this type of film). Do not compare this with other films with these actors, simply enjoy. The cast is great and, I believe, the goal of this film has been fully realized. If you want a really "quiet" and very quiet night - watch this movie. DeNiro and Murphy just had fun making this movie, so we should (watch). And please do not be so negative. Do not expect performance from godfather or Meet DeNiro's parents, do not expect performance from Murphy's comedy blockbusters ... It's a completely different genre, and it made me relax after a hard day's work. Its sides can not separate from laughter, but it is still VERY funny.
