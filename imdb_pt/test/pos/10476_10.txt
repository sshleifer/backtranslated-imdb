This movie tells everything there is to say about religion - I wish it were necessary to see for all the fanatics and future clergymen. <br /> <br /> The story set in a Danish village at the turn of the century is about two very religious sisters whose late father was a hard priest who discouraged all his love dreams and explored the world and its many beauties . They are now old and their life and beauty have passed. Their new help - whom they "teach" to cook - is Babette (played by the lovely Stephane Audran who has graced so many films by her husband Claude Chabrol). Life in the village is simple and the rigid direction reflects this. <br /> <br /> When Babette wins the lottery, she asks for a chance to set up a party - a real labor of love. The course of the feast and its Principal Guest reveal messages of love and spirituality and how there are many ways to love God and life. <br /> <br /> This is a must for the devotion with which Babette prepares the party. and by the discourse that the General gives at the end. Possibly the best international film of the '80s.
