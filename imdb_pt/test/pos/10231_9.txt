I've only watched Nightbreed for the first time since I've seen it in the theater for almost 20 years, and as long as I remember liking it at the time, I do not remember being surprised at how it was today. I really can not complain about anything in this movie. Craig Scheffer is excellent as the main character of Boone. I never understood why he did not have a more successful career, because most of his early work is excellent. No matter how good Scheffer is, Cronenberg is even better. His portrayal of psychopath Dr. Decker is unforgettable and steals the show. The rest of the cast, which includes Doug Bradley, is pretty good except for the ridiculous and overblown sheriff. The visuals are good and, in some photos, great. Danny Elfman's composite score is as good as possible and is among his best work. The finale was epic, with uninterrupted action for almost twenty minutes. Overall, Nightbreed is a great achievement for Clive Barker, and is my favorite of his films, a little ahead of Hellraiser. 9/10
