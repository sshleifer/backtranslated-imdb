This is a very interesting experiment to watch. It is the first attempt, still existing, to join the vision to the sound. He presents two men dancing with a violinist (possibly William KL Dickson himself) who is standing next to a recording cylinder of Edison, who is capturing the sound. <br /> <br /> The sound and images have not been interconnected like one yet. And it was only recently that the sound and image were added technically together. It's probably the reason why people hesitate to call this movie the first sound image ever. <br /> <br /> The film is made by William K.L. Dickson, an assistant to Thomas Edison himself, who ordered him to create a way of putting together images and sounds. The answer he provided was the Kinetophone, a Kinetoscope (basically a large wooden box with a magical eye so people could see the moving pictures) with a drum phonograph inside it for the sound. This is the first, we know, surviving the experiments of films that present this technique. All subsequent films using this same technique were filmed as silent films and the sound effects were recorded later and separately. Thus, the Kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images, but more an attempt to have images accompanied by sound. In some cases, people could even choose between three sound cylinders, featuring 3 different orchestral performances to accompany the images. Only 45 Kinetophones were made, so you could hardly call the Kinephone a success. Also after this experiment, the focus was on other film techniques, especially in relation to film projectors. <br /> <br /> The experiment itself has obviously not become a hit, also since it took more than 30 years before the first films. with sound were made and released commercially. They still could not technically sync and put sound and images together right now, and even if they could and the techniques were available, it would have been a very expensive job to do that. So it really is not the most influential or historically important films in film history, but it is very interesting to see how people have constantly tried to improve the quality and techniques of film and filmmaking. <br /> <br /> 8/10
