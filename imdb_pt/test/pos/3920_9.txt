probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there were lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they do is get out of the movies) and movies that should not have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason I did not give it 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but the scene of her death compensates, believe me) .. <br /> <br /> .. so here they are ... the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> 1. My favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's! after finding her boyfriend Blake lying on the floor with a knife coming out of her neck, Paige begins to run. well, the speed of the walk is more respectable. she finds it like a garage with all those cars in it. (one of) murderers cuts her ankle underneath (she's holding a huge metal spike all the time), so she drops it and runs and hides behind this car. the killer picks it up and when she looks out the window he throws it out the window and she shoots it on her forehead. I've never been so excited or laughed so hard in my life. <br /> <br /> 2. Paige's boyfriend, Blake, grabs a knife in his neck and then the killer walks up to him (while he's on the ground) and steps on him pushing him deeper into his throat ... then he dies. <br /> <br /> 3. Elisha Cuthbert (Carly) (one of the hottest girls in the world) does not die PHEW, but she leaves her lips super glued, punches in the face, and causes part of her index finger to be cut (yes, I felt like throwing up) ) 4. The nick of Carly's twin brother also survives, but not without having his butt kicked and a stab in the leg. <br /> <br /> 5. Nick's best friend Dalton is knocked down a flight of stairs and then beheaded. your body is dragged and we see your eyes blink .. then it gets covered in wax. <br /> <br /> 6. Wade (Carly's boyfriend) gets his Achilles tendon cut by massive scissors and is attacked by the same scissors. he does not die but is covered in wax, and on two occasions his skin is accidentally removed, revealing his unpleasant bloody flesh. TASTY. <br /> <br /> .. so there it is. Definitely value your money.
