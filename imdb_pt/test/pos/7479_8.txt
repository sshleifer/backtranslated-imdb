Is Thursday an original movie? No, but it's a lot of fun! I just caught this buried in the movie channels one night and it was a nice movie. I was expecting a lot, but what I got were some interesting scenes (I really liked the first seen at the convenience store), some fun stories told by the characters and some action thrown in the mix as well. Some good performances by young actors, Paulina Porizkova was good and I was particularly impressed with Aaron Eckhart (who impressed me even more in "Yours Friends and Neighbors" and "Erin Brokovich"). So if you want 90 minutes of easy fun go ahead and check out "Thursday".
