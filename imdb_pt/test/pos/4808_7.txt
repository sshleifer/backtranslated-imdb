Running Out of Time rests somewhere in the middle of Johnny To's cannon, in the "solid good" category. As a crime thriller is not very original or overwhelming and the action scenes are not going to wipe you out, but there's something else going on. It's a Johnny To movie, after all, it's necessary. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau has 72 hours to live. He decides to play a strange game of cat and mouse with a Hong Kong police hostage negotiator, played by Lau Ching Wan. This is the plot in a nutshell. In addition, it stacks up layers of twists and turns that keep procedures interesting all around. Occasionally she becomes too complicated for her own good, but she never lets her get the better of it. However, just as Johnny To is about to deliver a well-made and well-made crime film (which, let's face it, are dozens of a dozen), he slides into pieces that bring Running Out of Time alive as a complete emotional experience, providing the soul and heart with the well-oiled skeleton. <br /> <br /> The concepts of synchronism and minimalism (basic in his work) are explored with great effect here. Always subtle, letting the images speak for themselves, giving them time to develop themselves with long, slow shots of tracking images, exemplary cut to the score, it's all here. A little love story on a bus between Andy Lau and a girl is among the highlights of the movie and part of the "heart" I'm talking about. So simple but so powerful. The same goes for the car scenes of Lau and Lau Ching Wan and for the confrontation in the bowling alley. <br /> <br /> However, something prevents me from stating that Running Out of Time is a masterpiece. To have all the skill and skill for a notch, but it can also be very workmanlike or bland at times. When he's good, he's really good. There is even an isolated moment of pure brightness that is very good for the good itself, leaving a bitter taste of the rest of the film. I'm convinced that if he puts his heart into it, he can make a great movie. As it is, this is another of his films that is flawed but enjoyable. Under the slippery style of HK, it's the dark humor and the heartfelt drama that makes this movie a compelling movie. Worth watching, definitely.
