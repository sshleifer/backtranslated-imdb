This is my favorite movie of all time. It's the best parody of a science fiction movie of all time; the fact that it was a Star Wars shooting just got better. <br /> <br /> I love clowning. Think of it as the Marx brothers or the Three Stooges find Star Wars. The writing is hilarious. The effects are a joke. The free association that happens guarantees all kinds of things coming out of the left field. (I almost wet my pants when the Wookie Monster approached the Princess.) Space Balls was a much longer movie, but it only had about 15 minutes of good stuff, and I felt kinda stolen later, like buying a burger that ended up be mainly filler. Hardware Wars, although only 15 minutes long, would be worth paying a resource price, IMO.
