Great movie, a very worthy 7/10. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was at his best ever, the congressman who drank too much and who saved Afghanistan from his communist oppressors! Based on a true story, tell us how the West throws money and weapons into a problem and expects it to disappear. Well, he left, though temporarily. See who we (the British, among others) are fighting the same people the US gave weapons, training and money in the 80s. This film would always provoke political thoughts from people who watch, but it portrays a very cool story. However, once the main goal is achieved, ie freeing the Communists from Afghanistan, it is seen how quickly people's suffering is forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie was good, it was a well deserved 7/10. He told the story of the Communist invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent secret US operation into some detail and was dramatized. Despite being a good movie, I will recommend it to people, but some people will not particularly like it is a serious movie about good (v) evil (Russia) is not your thing!
