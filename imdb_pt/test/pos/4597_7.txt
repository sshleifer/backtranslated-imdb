As a social satire, Idiocracy is as good as the Office Space, but with a broader scope. To criticize this film as very childish due to the humor of the potty type is kind of miss the mark, I think. There are certainly fart jokes, etc., but they are not meant to be funny to the public - they exist to define the state of "culture" in the 2500 AD world visited by Joe as a backdrop to the bizarre state of affairs in which he wakes up. The true mood of the film lies in the many gags and attitudes present in this future society that are only a shadow of what we find in our daily lives, and that should serve as a warning. My personal favorite is the Fox News representation. The subtle brilliance of the film lies in the fact that it also attracts "smart" people, and ordinary Joes like the characters. Watch the moments in the movie where Joe and Rita almost subconsciously settle for the idiots around them, and you realize that Idiocracy is not meant to appeal to any particular group of people, but rather the culture of idiocy in general. I do not know what to say about Fox's "made for conspiracy theory" behavior in releasing this movie, but if it's not playing in your local theater, demand it. We all need to see this movie, if not for social commentary, at least for the fart jokes ...
