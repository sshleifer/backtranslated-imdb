First of all, you should watch this only if you do not mind the lack of subtitles, pornography, bizarre sex and total depravity, horrifying and truly shocking. I mentioned bizarre sex, but calling sex in the second half of the movie "eccentric" would be a great euphemism. It is more like a punch in the face if you are not prepared for this type of illness. That said, I can revisit this morbid genre of pseudo-snuff brought to us by our Japanese colleagues. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be pretty basic, almost non-existent: a girl is hired to perform in the amateur porn movie. Do not expect too much in the first 30 to 40 minutes. There is some dialogue - if you do not speak Japanese does not mean much to you - it seems to be an occasional chat between the girl and the team and performer, so there is some porn (straight sex), and after the scene is over, the artists and the team take a break. And then ... this begins to happen. <br /> <br /> It seems that the girl is convinced to make one more scene - this time tied with the rope. The abuse begins: whipping, slapping, hot wax ... In the end, the girl collapses and cries. They untied it. <br /> <br /> So we see artists and staff sitting at the table as if nothing had happened-except the girl. She's visibly shaken and it looks like she wants out. She walks to the door, sits on the floor to put on her shoes ... and that's when hell comes loose. <br /> <br /> She is hit in the head with the baseball bat, her wound is treated, she is tied to the bed. What follows may be briefly described (I will not ruin everything for you) as rape during the break up. Think of "Flower of flesh and blood," mix with pornography and you'll get the idea. It continues for about 20 minutes. SFX are very good, makeup too. Everything is shown, without mercy to the viewer. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> I thought "Visitor Q" was a very sickly movie. After watching "Niku daruma" it seemed like a fairy tale to me. This movie is so sick, so depraved, so distorted, so disgusting that the harshest words are pale compared to the end. Too bad it's only released on VHS, so there are no subtitles available. But the movie still works without them. So, if you're into ultra-sickness, extreme sadism, and other beauties of that beloved kind, see that. I hope you do not have nightmares.
