There are many things to admire in this movie, but what interested me the most was the eccentric recluse, the kind of role Hollywood loves and romanticizes, but here it's absolutely compelling and unlike any character I've met in the movies or in life. Also a very convincing and disturbing representation of Tourete syndrome
