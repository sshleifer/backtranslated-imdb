I remember being so excited on Saturday nights when I was a child, waiting for Dr. Who. I thought it was the best show ever. So, I grew up, Dr. Who got out of the air, and no one I knew had ever heard of it. Then I discovered that there would be a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Would it have to live up to the expectations I'd had since I was little? Would they ruin everything? Would Dr. suck? Your assistant would suck? Would they create a more intimate relationship with Dr. and his assistant? Yes, no, no, no, no !!! This show is wonderful !! I love the new Dr. I love your assistant. I love the show. And I feel excited on Friday nights, waiting for the "new" episode. I'm now seeing episodes from 2005, as I live in the United States, so I'm a little behind the rest of you. I hope the next Dr. is as good as this!
