During the 13 years of school I had since kindergarten through high school, there was only one day when my class took a field trip. When I went to school, you went to school from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and the archived trips were not made. But for some reason, I could not remember that advanced age, we went to see a movie - National Velvet. I do not remember the movie, so on the eve of my 57th year, I decided to revisit it. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about a time that does not exist anymore. A time when people trusted others and did not lock their homes. A time when people were given the benefit of the doubt. It was a time when family was the most important thing. This movie shows all this and more. It shows love, trust, affection and kindness of people. <br /> <br /> It would not be a bad thing for the whole family to watch this movie from time to time and discuss their message. <br /> <br /> It was a treat to see young Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney at her best, Anne Revere's Oscar-winning performance Angela Lansbury before Murder, She Wrote and Donald Crisp, who performed for almost sixty years . /> <br /> What a movie!
