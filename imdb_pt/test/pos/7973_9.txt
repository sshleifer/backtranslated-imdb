This certainly is one of the best western films produced in the new millennium. It is a tribute to all the stars of the great western classics of TV, and is the definitive revival of the Western movie. The story of two brothers who find themselves after the war between states and end up on different sides of the law is not new but interesting, however, and the shootings and atmosphere are great. There's some graphic violence like thugs being bitten to death with an ax or women being slaughtered in cold blood, and Lee Majors does not participate in the action until the end, which is why I gave her 9 out of 10 points. But it's still one of the best new Western productions I've ever seen. I had the honor and pleasure to meet Chris McIntyre at the West Festival and have a good chat with him, and had the chance to meet Buck Taylor, who plays the city doctor. In my opinion, we should be very obliged to Chris McIntyre for his efforts to bring together so many stars from the Western TV classics and SASS around him to perform in a new western like this. Chris has an exceptional talent for picking the right actors for the main characters as well. Both are young and promising, and I think we should see more of them in future Western productions. I honestly enjoyed this western movie - it was worth every minute. I hope Chris McIntyre continues to work on other western films and presents us with more great productions like this. Great work, Chris! Jasper P. Morgan (Pete)
