OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now I love her! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section, I admit that occasionally I skip this part, just because it makes me WAAAY very hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's shopping list on your site. I love that she has regular helpers and that she has made some of her viewers become her regulars. I love how nice she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests. She seems much more genuine than so many other talk show hosts. She still gets a bit shocked occasionally and I love it. I love that she talks about her personal life and reminds people how happy she is. She even mentioned tabloids before and it's so funny! She also has the funniest stories! Anyway, I'm a fan of life. Even my 2 year old knows who Rachael Ray is and he loves her too!
