Lucius Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films as The Beyond and Zombie, was years before a master of Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Don ' t Torture A Duckling. This movie has all the elements of the Italian genre of mystery / suspense known as giallo, but it really draws viewers with each key character with a skeleton in its own closet. This makes you do as much detective work as the detectives in the movie itself. Who's killing the kids in town? The rich young woman who is so bored that she sexually insults casualties, the reporter who likes to play crime scenes to get a better picture, the lady of the city with a mentally retarded daughter, the local witch, the town idiot. ..the list goes on, and you have to keep the mental notes as a real game to play and solve. The themes of this film are very bold and made with that perfect Italian style in the early 70's. Admittedly, no American studio would have even considered making such a strong content film, and that is precisely why this is such a film. satisfactory (despite some unusual accent choices for dubbing) and will definitely have people discussing their meanings long after viewing it. As the saying goes, they do not do it any more then get a copy and enjoy an important movie like this!
