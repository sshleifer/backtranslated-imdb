Ironically, what makes John Carpenter's "The Thing" such a entertaining science fiction film is the elements of mystery, suspense, and story structure that challenge the genre. He embarrasses films like "Aliens" or "Armageddon" who are content to flood the viewer with special effects, while their plots revolve around physics laws, phrases full of testosterone, heroes equipped with enough artillery to conquer the Iraq and pathetic attempts to inject "meaning" into the dam on the screen with "emotional sequences" that only serve to further insult the public's intelligence. The ultimate tragedy, of course, is that this type of lobotomized film is also the most popular. I think there's a cause for it, although it's not very comforting. There is a growing tendency in our culture to "passively" surrender to the media - to delve into the images we see without devoting a single brain cell to the realization of the claim that the work is trying to do. This mentality is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas; even the once-embossed print medium is being diluted, thanks to the abhorrent "reader response" theory pervading our schools and the "tabloid brigade" lining our magazine shelves whose mentality seems to be seeping into the once venerable traditional press. Nowadays, just turn the switch and put our minds on "pause". "The Thing" is a "good" movie? For the rare individual who still values ​​his faculty of reason, a more appropriate term would be "amusing." His plot holds a riddle, his ending is uncompromising, and he has some redemptive affirmations about human paranoia. In subsequent visions, a noticeable lack of depth in acting begins to be noticed, but the firm plot remains convincing. Of course, "Citizen Kane" is not, but again, science fiction has never been a genre of thought ...
