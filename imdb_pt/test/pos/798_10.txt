I really like Traci Lords. She may not be the best actress in the world, but she's very good at it. She plays the scruffy and conservative reporter in a "T". It's a great suspense that makes you think for a long time. Jeff Fahey is also good as Traci's boss. I think, given a decent rest, Traci could be a successful actress. She certainly is not worse than some of today's top ladies.
