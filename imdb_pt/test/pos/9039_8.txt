As a fan of Wm. Faulkner since college, I was especially pleased to see Intruder In the Dust and for other reasons. My grandfather, also called Clarence Brown as the director, grew up in the Oxford area having been born near there in 1888. We attended a week-long family reunion in Oxford in July 1964, just 15 years after filming the film. He still seemed more like in the movie, but was going through a period of civil rights revolt then as the site of Ole Miss. My recollection is of being a nice little college town that summer, but I was just an 18 year college sophomore college. I was beginning to realize the injustice of segregation and prejudice, but I still had a long way to go. Anyway, the film is worth watching, but the filmmakers must have to walk a tightrope to do it and I would love to know more about this story. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, Oxford is a larger and more modern university town with all the ills that go with it, and I hope to see how it has changed socially in the last 40 years or more. . Juano Hernandez certainly should have been nominated for an Oscar that year, but Hollywood was still intimidated to let that happen. Other stories of Faulkner were filmed, searched out and compared. One of the best was a PBS treatment of The Barn Burner, circa 1985, starring Tommy Lee Jones. He really captured the intensity of the southern rural whites that Faulkner wrote so incisively about so many times.
