This show is great for many reasons .. Father and mother can communicate with their children in this day in age. It's so nice to see a real family instead of a stuffy family. I watched it once and got hooked. It's so good to see a black family on TV that's worth watching. This show came out too soon, but on the way out he dealt with pregnancy, sexy, drugs, bad dates, death, etc. The best thing about the show was that he handled it in a good-humored way. Great show for the family .. I can not tell you how many times I sat watching this show late at night sometimes and laughed my head. Great pg 13 rated show. I loved everybit of this show.
