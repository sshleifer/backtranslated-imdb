This is a very obscure and stupid horror movie set in the 1970s Everglades. It's really stupid and lame for the first half so it really does start to get better in the last time. There is a scene with the hero rushing to save his friends interspersed with photos of a church singing group, I do not know. It's hypnotizing. I was impressed by the night scenes because it actually looked like night, unlike most low budget horror movies where it still seems like day. I feel that the director was really talented, but was working with a tiny budget and a difficult schedule. There are some scenes at the end, the one mentioned above and also the final credits that are extremely cool. This movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its Scooby Doo conventions behind and went straight to the throat. I was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be. I could not take my eyes off her and had to ask myself "why?"
