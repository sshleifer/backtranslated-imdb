I heard they were going to redo this French classic in 2007, and I see it's in development for 2011. That will be a shame as Hollywood kicked writer / director Jules Dassin over the infamous blacklist. They should not have the right to redo any of their movies. <br /> <br /> I love "caper" and "film noir" movies, and this combines the best of both. Tony (Jean Servais) leaves after making a nickel, and after he hits his old girlfriend (Marie Sabouret), he plans a big score with his friends Mario (Robert Manuel) and Jo (Carl MÃ¶hner), which makes this a great attraction. Flick is the attention to detail in planning theft. You see this reflected in the George Clooney Vegas capers. Nothing is left to chance. <br /> <br /> The caper goes well, but Grutter (Marcel Lupovici) sends his sons, Robert Hossein and Pierre Grasset, after Tony and his gang. After exploding with Mario, they kidnap Jo's son. Many bullets fly before it's over. <br /> <br /> A great movie by a great director. The pattern by which other caper films are measured.
