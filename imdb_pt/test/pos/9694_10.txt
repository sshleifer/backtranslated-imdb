I should not like Jackass Number Two. No one should. There is and has never been anything particularly redeeming about Jackass. And yet ... it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen - and I just can not explain why. <br /> <br /> This new movie leaves the first in the dust. It's so funny, so horrible and so wrong. The whole team gives it their all - with Jackss in chief, Knoxville, leading the way. He's crazy. I love him, but he's crazy. And more power for him. With his flourishing film career, he could have sat back and simply let everyone do the dirty work, but the fact that he tossed himself, almost literally, back into the world of 'Brio' so sincerely makes me respect him strangely . More congratulations should go to Bam Margera, who previously seemed content to sit down and just make sure everyone around him did pretty much what he wanted. Here Bam is not the tormentor, but the tormented and it is even better for this. <br /> <br /> I just can not say what my favorite part is because I laughed all the time. I admit I've seen a lot of the movie in my fingers, but there was not a 'real' movie I've seen in a long time that made me feel so refreshed as that. Loving them or, most likely, hating them, the Jackass team delivered above and beyond my expectations. But I agree with Bam. There can never be a number three Jackass because someone is going to die and I want those guys to be around.
