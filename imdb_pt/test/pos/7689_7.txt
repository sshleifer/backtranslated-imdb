I recently had the privilege of seeing what is said to be the latest 35mm Steric Technicolor picture and found it much more vivid and touching than remembered. Also closer to the original material - basically every screenwriter that N. Richard Nash did was trim, change the recitative a lot for the spoken dialogue, and insert one or two transitional scenes (including a very entertaining one for Pearl Bailey). Oliver Smith's production design is stagy in the 1950's "Li'l Abner" - "Guys and Dolls" adaptation mode, but works well for the folk and unreal quality of this work. Stereotypes and racism are present, but not to a degree inducing bruises. Also, for a movie of the day, it's quite frank - adultery, violent behavior, drug use, and the self-destructive habits of Catfish Row residents are by no means minimized in the story. But there are debts, beginning with all this variation of the stage text. The loss of both compromises Gershwin's brilliance - no wonder the family does not like it. The reorchestration, especially of the Sammy Davis Jr. material, is bewilderingly modern and vulgar. George knew what he was doing, people; You do not have to mess with it too much. And while Poitier and Dandridge perform well and their singers sing well, there is a huge chasm between the voices of the singers and the voices of the characters - you are constantly aware of the artifice. What really counts here, of course, is the music, among the best ever written for the theater, anywhere. Despite all the repair, it survives, and you would have to be made of stone not to be moved by it. If treatment is not to the liking of property (and should not be), there is still no reason not to spend money to restore this ambitious footage of Gershwin's masterpiece and make the younger generations more aware of their genius.
