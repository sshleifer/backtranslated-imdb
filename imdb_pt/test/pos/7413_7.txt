It did not have much aspiration for this film, but was pleasantly surprised. A very well done film, very well cut, does not reach the level that Human Traffic did, but it's a very good effort. Well directed, and I thought the lead actor did a superb performance! In fact, the only really bad performance in the movie was Tim Curry, who is supposed to be the name. <br /> <br /> Cool Film surprised that it did not do better than it has. I had never heard of this until I saw it in a companions. <br /> <br /> I'm not a raver, but I imagine the people who really like this movie.
