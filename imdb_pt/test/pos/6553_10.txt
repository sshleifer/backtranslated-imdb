Uzumaki has a very unique history and I will never look at the spirals in the same way. Not really thorn tingling, this film has a morose, sour morose feel to it. During certain parts, was it just me or did you see vortex visuals? The camera photos are interesting and the movie lets your imagination run wild. The bizarre supernatural sensation of this movie attracts you exactly as the title suggests. Acting is well done and the city itself seems wrong. <br /> <br /> This may take some points of view for it to be absorbed. A great movie.
