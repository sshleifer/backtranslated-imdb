The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting, and I was actually sold in the mother-daughter relationship. It is a family story that is not blunted by frills and special effects; a story of how it really is. I could not help but sigh at the end of this movie because, unfortunately, it's a bittersweet tale well told about growing up and relating to family and friends. The performance was quite exquisite and I hope we will see Portman and Sarandon in family roles on the road ...
