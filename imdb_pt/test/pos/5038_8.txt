I really liked this movie for what it is: A funny little movie that does not take itself too seriously. Plot summaries are available everywhere so I will not go into detail. Michael is not about a complex plot anyway. It just builds on a great premise and takes the viewer to a wonderful trip. <br /> <br /> The performance of John Travolta as an angel who eats cigarettes, likes women, bar and pie fight is simply perfect. And who does not love Sparky? <br /> <br /> See this if you want to have some laughs and a good time. Highly recommended.
