Definitely worth renting! Good clean family entertainment. My 4 and 5 year olds (and I) loved it. He kept them on the edge of their seats. I recommend that parents sit down with their younger children to watch this, as it can be a big suspense for them. It is not very often to find movies that you can watch with your children, and this is a rare find. Some of the acting / realism are not there sometimes, or maybe it's a little tacky, but kids do not seem to notice or care, they love it. Pieces are predictable, but other parts are not - like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. The movie has nothing really scary and scary, and I doubt that it will bring nightmares to the kids. This inspires children to dream, which is something we need to encourage and encourage more in our children. Rent and be blessed!
