This wonderful film captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny, fun, memorable and fun, it's hard to decide where to start. <br /> <br /> From the opening number, "Rainbow Connection," the excellent Paul Williams. A score sung with enthusiasm by Kermit D. Frog, who gives us a prologue to what the whole adventure is, throughout history, this is a fun movie. <br /> <br /> Essentially, it's a road trip movie, where Caco travels around the country with the dream of pursuing a "rich and famous contract" to entertain. Along the way, our green hero meets a host of other aspiring actors, comedians, singers and musicians, who coincidentally are muppets like Kermit himself. Is this how the Muppets really started? "About how it happened," Caco tells us. <br /> <br /> Not since "It's a Crazy, Crazy, Crazy, Crazy World," the cameo formula has been used prolifically and successfully. The aspiring stars find many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; some flash on the screen, but others have memorable appearances. Steve Martin is fun as a rude waiter is probably the best. Jim Henson's nod to his inspiration, Edgar Bergen, is especially poignant. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has watched the Muppets TV show will be able to see all of their favorite characters, they are all here. The work of puppets is magnificent; especially look for Kermit by bike (as dat dey ???) Jokes and references to old movies are everywhere, but the best one-liners are reserved for Kermit himself. An example: When the thieves are terrifying Kermit and Piggy, she says affectionately to her boyfriend, short, green and handsome, "I would not give up on that night together for nothing, would I?" "Uhhh, make me an offer ..." I also love the shooting on the OK Corral scene: blatantly absurd nonsense. <br /> <br /> I need to get going "right now" but to summarize: good-natured film that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age or genre of film. Highly recommended.
