Ocean's 12 <br /> <br /> 'If you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you.' (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard) <br /> <br /> This saying certainly sounds true in this sequence. Terry Benedict was informed that Danny Ocean and his compadres were the ones who stole him and now he wants everything back. The ocean gang needs a lot of money and fasting, but it can not work in the states, since Benedict XVI made it impossible for them. So it is for Europe to perform death-defying acts that defy theft while trying to avoid Catherine Zeta Jones's super cop, an old passion from Rusty's (Pitt's) past. In their first robbery in Amsterdam, they found out who attacked them was the 'Night Fox', a super-smart thief with a complex of legends. He presents them with a challenge that could either nullify their debt or put them into some sort of enter-undead-like sequence of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II. Interesting? Well, yes. Slow? Kind of. Funny? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Very. <br /> <br /> Ocean and its bunch of gay men are charismatic, if nothing else and as this is a continuation and we are all old friends, we see situations and talks much more 'palms'. Many. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins ​​are fighting as we knew they would; Bernie Mac talks too much and Don Cheadle's accent is as bad as before (I really like Cheadle, but I could not accept that). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, filling each other's glasses and reading each other's minds. However, what worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development versus how "slick" the film was. And as much as these actors work well together, Zeta Jones fits into this film as a large square marker in a tight 11-sided hole. She just does not fit in and her chemistry with Pitt is non-existent. <br /> <br /> The stars in this movie for me, however, were Vincent Cassel as the choice of venues for Night Fox and Soderbergh. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if he had been born in both. His Night Fox is arrogant, "terribly arrogant with other people's lives" (Danny Ocean) and a stark contrast to the ocean gang. This is where I think the movie loses its way. Cassel and the European locations offer a realistic contrast with the American actors and the style of the first film. We want smooth, bold and insightful; not brave, considerate and intellectual. This is where the movie does not work. <br /> <br /> Admitting, you can not repeat the same formula twice to the letter, but going to the left or right usually does more harm than good in a mainstream movie like this.
