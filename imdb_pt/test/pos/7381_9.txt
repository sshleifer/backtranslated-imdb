... this noire film set suffers from obscure sound (at least, as shown on the inadequate equipment of the Seattle and Maine film festivals) and darker conspiracy, while Rickman suffers from an American accent, old sneakers and sweaty sweats. However, he has moments of stellar chewing scene, and the film offers a grim ambiguity of Norman Reedus, the beautiful Polly Walker and an amazing ending (shortened to frequent the patrons), while providing a beautiful look of the Maine and Rickman physiography. It will be released on video (after cable show) in March. Not to be missed by any Rickman fan. Ignore the amanita hooey.
