As a child I was never in a situation where I could be introduced to Dr Who and although I had heard of the passing series, I never really realized exactly what it was. It was then with some hesitation that I sat down to see the ninth Doctor and his antics saying that he was something like Arthur Dent (of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxies), but cooler. I can not believe what I was missing, seriously, why did not anyone tell me about it before? All my childhood was deprived of adventures of Doctor Who; me being a tremendous fan of most science fiction and fantasy adventures. Honestly, I really enjoyed it and look forward to any future episode. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that at the beginning I was not so sure that Billie Piper would be the best actress, but I'm happy to say that. she did very well, I thought, and added a very realistic touch to the series. I think, in fact, that was one of my favorite aspects of the series; the contrast between the large scenes of alien conflict contrasted with the irritating normality of life in the County of South London Council. I am always interested in cases where people's ideas about the world are drastically challenged and how people can take any situation and edit them in their minds so they can fit into their mundane lives. I also loved Christopher Eccleston. I have not seen many of his films and have never seen another actor like Dr Who, but I thought his interpretation of Doctor was brilliant, immensely kind and yet dark enough to make you wonder. I think many other characters with their character story type tend to be a bit two-dimensional; They have all the right emotions and actions, but they always seem a bit shallow. This doctor, on the other hand, gained my loyalty with his stratified personality. I agree with some of the other comments that a larger budget for special effects, aliens and other things could have been a little more effective. but again, this is not about special effects (though they do) than I read and heard from longtime Dr Who fans; it's the spirit of things that really count. And I do not think they did a bad job with what they had. I really liked all the aliens, but my favorite had to be the Daleks; If I ever knew anything about dr. Who before watching the series, was that there were things in him that looked like crates of trash on wheels. Before watching, I was pretty skeptical about these pepper pots threatening the existence of mankind, but some of them were pretty scary! That I loved, of course. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good show. I look forward to future episodes with pleasure. The doctor has a new fan.
