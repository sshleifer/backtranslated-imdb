First, let me review the movie. This movie scares me and I do not even believe in aliens! However, the film has its flaws. <br /> <br /> There are three acts in this movie. The first act is perfect. It sets the movie and actually builds the creep factor. I must say that the score is great! Everything is set up and configured perfectly. <br /> <br /> The second act begins when Jillian, playing Sherry Burton, goes to the psychiatrist. They hypnotize her and she remembers the kidnapping. The second act spoils the movie when the aliens appear. "Screaming Mad George" made the effects for the aliens. I must say they did a good job except with their depiction of the aliens "Gray". No offense, but the Grays looked like inflatable door prizes. <br /> <br /> On a side note, I liked how they treated hypnosis in Acts One and Two. If you paid attention, you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories. In the version of the events of the husband, the blue light hits them and his wife says: "Someone is here" or something similar. Makes sense. The husband is worried about his wife. "Someone" can hurt her. That's his problem. However, in her version of events, she says, "Help me!" She does not say "Someone is here". That also makes sense. The aliens are after her. To want the husband to help and save her is her problem. Now, back to the movie. <br /> <br /> The third act turns the film into a bloody festival. It starts with a "strange" ultrasound procedure. It's a typical festival, but it has an amazing ending. I'm not going to ruin this because it's really an interesting development. <br /> <br /> The DVD and the comments take themselves very seriously, but if you think Wilford Brimley is saying "Horsesh **" is funny, you might want to take a look at the cast interviews section. Now, my compliment to Jillian McWhirter. <br /> <br /> I could only hope that Jillian read it. I had never seen her before, but wow, what a performance! Let me tell you the rest of you. First of all, this is supposed to be a serious movie. The details I'll describe now may seem exaggerated and amusing, like "Humanoids From The Deep" (1980), but it really is not. Got that? Okay. <br /> <br /> Jillian is warm, naturally good-looking. She's naked for a lot of the movie, a good thing. Unfortunately, she is usually being attacked, terrified and raped, a very bad thing. However, she should act on much of this naked film. She earns points by overcoming this. She has to act happy, sad, horny, scared and physically hurt everything in the interval of a few moments. The twist of emotion is amazing! She has to cheer for joy when she learns she is pregnant. She has to scream in terror as the aliens pull their guts out. She has to act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby is not his. She has to act like she is in denial, saying that nothing is wrong with her baby when her husband says otherwise. A denial, I should note, is that it is actually forced upon it by the aliens who control it. I'm talking about an Oscar performance here! <br /> <br /> Then there's the rape scene. It's disturbing, but since it's just a rubber alien, it's not that bad. In this scene, the alien is not a "gray" alien, so I will describe it. The alien has tentacles and is like a table. Jillian is on the tabletop, contained by the tentacles. Through his head is the head of the alien. The alien's head is long and tilts so that his head is now above Jillian's legs. Then the alien hey-nanu-nanu leaves his forehead. It's the forehead! Sounds too exaggerated, right? Well, Jillian plays straight, and she takes it off! She has to act like an alien with her hey-nanu-nanu coming from her forehead raping her, and she pulls him out! It's a very intense scene, but that's not what it does. You see, this scene is done in a flashback. What makes the scene is Jillian's performance remembering these events. She is just lying in a hospital bed under hypnosis remembering the alien abduction, but her acting here is more intense than the actual scene of rape! How many actors can perform in a scene that describes a rape more intense than the rape scene? Not many! However, Jillian does this. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. Jillian, if you've read this, I want you to know that I (name withheld) MegamanX-1's nickname, I believe you are the best actress ever. You're the best actress ever! I could only hope you read it and take it with you always. <br /> <br /> As for everyone, "Progeny" (1999) is a Okay to Good movie. I would recommend it.
