This is one of the strangest movies I've watched in a long time. Usually, if they are so strange, I leave early and rarely regret it. Fortunately, I held this. While I can not say that this is a great movie (is not it), I can say watching is like a good acid trip - just a few really awful moments and the rest filled with "I really only see that one?" wonderful. Lots of loud laughter. A large cast of characters with Meredith Eaton highlighted as the dwarf-n√©e with an attitude. Keep an open mind.
