I was in the movie right away. I've seen the other Coen movies, with the exception of Raising Arizona, and I noticed that each of their movies has a color. Fargo is gray / white, Lebowski is bright orange, and this film is a nice yellow. <br /> <br /> The brilliant nice qualities of this movie begin immediately. Soon the visual is accompanied by great and great music. It's the old folk sound, the kind of music that was written during a time when music was appreciated as part of everyday life. Appreciated by all, gangs of gangs, choirs of churches and even fugitives from prisons. <br /> <br /> Now, about the prison fugitives. I do not know the crime that their characters could have committed, since they are a very friendly group of boys. Clooney is fantastic, completely nailing his role. <br /> <br /> Go and see this as soon as possible. I believe it can be enjoyed by anyone on some level. For some reason, the theater I was in was full of old and old ladies, and they loved it. <br /> <br /> You'll love it too, I promise. I was forced to put my hands on the soundtrack immediately.
