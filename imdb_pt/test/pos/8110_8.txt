Hynkel, dictator of Tomania, is a spoiled child who gets angry when he can not get what he really wants ... And what he simply wants is nothing less than the world ... <br /> <br /> In one of the scenes extraordinary works of Chaplin's art, Hynkel plays a ballet with the 'world' that explodes when he thinks he has in his reach ... Chaplin also has some biting words in war and war films. In a scene at the beginning of the movie, which occurs during World War I, the Tomanian messenger locks the plane and thinks ... He is about to die ... In a state of delirium, he begins to say ridiculous words ... The empty empty speech continues to rise in a brilliant takeoff in all the heroic scenes of death of the war films ... In another scene, when he becomes a fugitive in the Jewish ghetto and assumes the command of the resistance that foments rebellion among the old, he plans to kill the dictator ... One of the group must kill the merciless conqueror of Austerlich ... Who is chosen will die naturally, but his heroic death will be rewarded and his name will shine as one star in Tomanian history ... <br /> <br /> The sequence in which he and four other characters eat cream cakes containing coins to determine which sacrifices his life to assassinate the dictator is a bitter joy full of great fear .. Ape "The Great Dictator" is still a significant film for the ironic tones of the film adding something that neither Chaplin nor could have given: the irony of the story ... The need to assassinate Hynkel presages the attempt of murder against Hitler by his generals ... The strength of the original satire is only surpassed by the imitation of the history of art ... With a splendid sequence like the shooting accident of duck that leads to the dictator be confused with the humble Jewish barber and vice versa, "The Great Dictator" is the first film spoken of Chaplin. This time 'Charles' and not 'Charlie' want to say more through his film and not through a fun comedy, the last one in which he uses his celebrated 'Tramp Character'.
