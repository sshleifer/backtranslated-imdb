This film moved me to 39 years in the same way that all footage and coverage of Dogtown affected me when I was 13 years old. To all those who criticized the self-promotion of the Z boys interviewed, they laughed on their own. That was all of your business, "we're better than all of you and here's why ... (insert images of the smoothest sculpt from the pool imaginable)" This was a movie to tell their story and that was the story them whether you liked it or not. It was their opinion about their skateboard that mattered ... not yours or mine. I thought the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as I remembered it in the 1970s. The reality is that they revolutionized skateboarding, they were the impetus behind radical sports and they injected a cultural paradigm that reached every corner of America . This movie gave rebirth to Bertleman's images in a wave and Alva and Jay Adams tearing the fight that was California's dream for an entire culture of young American teenagers who just wanted to have fun and be radiant! While watching this film, I realized that it was these images that I used to live with every day until I was old enough to move and return to So Cal after my family moved to Nor Cal when I was five. Until I could go back, my friends and I built and rampped after ramp, searched for every possible empty pool and imitated everything that Stecyk covered over these guys. We are all educated and we have families and careers now, but this movie reminds me of who I was at that age and why I still surf. This is an inspired movie that anyone who has an interest in pop culture, extreme sports, the 70's or even a good documentary production will thoroughly enjoy. Whenever it comes on cable I can not change the channel. Many compliments to Stacy Peralta to make a beautiful work of art!
