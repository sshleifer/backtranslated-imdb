Wow .. I just saw this movie on the Sundance Channel, and it's really bizarre. I may not be a film expert, but it's probably the most bizarre movie I, as a regular movie fan, ever saw. <br /> <br /> Who invented this had a great imagination. I am a bit of a fan of Japanese dramas, and there are often drama actors in movies .. (Matsushima Nanako, for example, the lead in Ringu, is a big drama star.) But it seems like this is the first movie for the retractors of Kirie and Shuichi. I must say that if they are really debuting here, they do a good job. <br /> <br /> Kirie was a very nice character, I thought she was easy to relate to. She was kind and kind-hearted, perhaps not the most popular girl, but gentler than some of the other girls who sought attention. She was also handsome in a classic way. I hope she makes more movies, but a few years back, so maybe she does not have such plans. <br /> <br /> The ending was strange. I'm not going to give anything, but the rest of the bizarreness of the movie was kind of embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Very bizarre but very imaginative and unique movie. I would recommend this to the Japanese fans of terror, although I warn you, it is much more bizarre than Ringu. <br /> <br /> However, I would give a 7.5 out of 10, for originality, imagination, good characterization, above average acting and being simply intriguing.
