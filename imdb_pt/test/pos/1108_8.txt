IT'S OK. A notice to anyone who is a parent or guardian. Be careful who you watch this movie with - that is, - DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN TO SEE THIS MOVIE. I'll explain why. <br /> <br /> 1 - the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance - I suppose this was entirely intentional on behalf of the producers, but it is annoying 2 - the film itself is really very disturbing . I have a few problems - first is the fact that the film is not violent or sexual and therefore not a "horror movie". But it's a very disturbing film, and involves a child and his parents, and a small town. <br /> <br /> OK, it all boils down to that. The film is not suitable for minors because it contains sequences and images that are disturbing and would be confusing to a child. It has a bizarre quality, and it's only because it has a child that makes me feel inadequate. As a parent I feel strong enough to want to tell people because I read it just the other day that is having a release in theaters. <br /> <br /> I hope not to offend the filmmakers by saying this, but I think it's my right because it's getting a release, and has only an M. rating (because it's not violent or sexual). Just strange and disturbing, but very good in itself.
