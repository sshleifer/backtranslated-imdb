During my teenage years or should I say prime time I was "eating" all kinds of SF novels every day of the week. It was in the sixties and seventies, when TV was not as important for leisure as it is today, one night in the mid-seventies I watched the movie on TV, I think it was ARD and I was shocked. I was impressed in a way that I can almost remember every scene to this day. <br /> <br /> Nowadays I watch my kids playing SIMS or something like that and I think we're close to what the Fassbender movie said. I would also appreciate it a lot if I could buy this movie on a DVD. But in vain I tried almost everything to get a tip where. MATRIX can not touch the quality and state of the art of this film. And by the way now we have no glue if we are a superior reality or just one of the simulation models of a couple. Probably after our death we will definitely know ...
