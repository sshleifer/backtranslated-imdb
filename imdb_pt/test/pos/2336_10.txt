I've enjoyed this movie since I first saw it in the theater. Some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy, and this is one of them. The characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people, working together, building a team and reaching goals without ever preaching morality. The situations are well worked out and consistent with the premise of opening the film. The tension develops well and the mood is clean and consistent. The film can pull me straight to cheer for the characters and laugh very well all the time. This is a good movie and as good as it comes out. <br /> <br /> What strikes me is that a movie that looks so simple can be fun in the long run. Music is a perfect copy of the music in the typical serious postwar naval films, which helps to create humor and points out that greatness is in the eyes of the beholder. The credits are a great video for "In the Navy," which deserves its own special feature in full screen. The scenes and cuts are well worked out, and the cast and acting are right. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic as great as any other ever made, without pretensions. In fact, lack of pretension is what makes it very fun to watch. I love these guys and lass. <br /> <br /> The other day I thought of the movie, and I wondered if it was available on DVD. Good luck came to us, and the DVD came out in May of 2004. I went to the store and got a copy. Then my wife and I enjoyed another hilarious night in front of the big screen. I rated this movie as a 10 because it comes together on all levels, much better than many high budget movies and Oscar winners. This is entertainment. <br /> <br /> Listen to Fox's homemade video: you have a great movie in your vaults, and it's a pity to find a cheap movie DVD with poorly degraded tonality just 8 years after release. So why not restore colors and present the film as it should be seen? I would be happy to pay a few more dollars to get the right picture. I'm grateful to have my own copy. Now, give us the attention that the movie deserves, and what about re-creating the credit sequence as a special feature of full-screen video.
