Batman Returns is a really somber movie, which shows the Caped Crusader fighting the penguin and the sexy Catwoman (I'll get them later). Michael Keaton acts well as Bruce Wayne, showing that he is a good actor. Tim BUrton manages this photo well, and the movie locations are impressive. The villains: Danny deVito is menacing like the penguin. A cruel but disturbed man who had a really difficult childhood. But Michelle Pfeiffer steals the photo. She is the best catwoman of all time! She is menacing and extremely sexy. There's a scene where she kisses Batman the way it just warms up the movie. The action scenes are also good, and the ending is dramatic and tragic, probably the best ending of a Batman movie. Tim Burton shows that he can manage a Batman movie very well (he already demonstrated this with the first Batman) and also gives Batman a darker nature. Much like him.
