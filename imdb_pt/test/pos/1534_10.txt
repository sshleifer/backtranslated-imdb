Even the trailer for this movie makes me cry, like the first time I saw this movie. Not for people who are easily disturbed by heavy material!

This terrible tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture its citizens for whatever reason, whether they are anarchists or the writer of children's books will chill it to the bone. I saw it when it was released in 1991 and I remember every frame. It still scares me today. It's happening now. <br /> <br /> Apparently, IMDb requires ten lines to satisfy their criteria for a film review. IMDb may want to get a grip! Some of us are a little more succinct about writing reviews.
