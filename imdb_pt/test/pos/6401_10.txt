We all seem to agree. It was a great show and let it die before the time came. I decided that if I really like a show, it's usually the kiss of death. I love the quirky cast, show cast, and a great scenario always helps. I really expected to see many of these stars in other television productions, but apart from Mariska Hagartay, who played Fisher Stephens' crazy girlfriend, I have not seen many of them except for occasional special roles. What a pity. Key West, Northern Exposure, Gilmore Girls and Veronica Mars ... all great shows, all sadly lost before their time. <br /> <br /> Listen to us, loud and clear, we want Key West on DVD ..... please.
