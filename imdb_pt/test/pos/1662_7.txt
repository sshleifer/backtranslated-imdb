You can take the villain out of the joint, but it seems extremely difficult to take out the rogue's base. We have seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before (and since): in films like BOB LE FLAMBEUR, ELEVATOR FOR THE GALLOWS, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI, ANDERSON RIBBONS, etc. Many times to mention. What helps to make this one of the most notable is (of course) the actual assault, which develops without words in real time, and the behavior of the leader. Bogart would think twice before crossing this guy. The ironic ending is perfectly adequate for this story (almost requires it). All around, one of the best noir movies.
