This is a movie-driven and extremely entertaining movie. Nothing surprising or original within the plot, but crucially, it moves at an excellent pace and therefore keeps its attention. I did not really notice the acting that I think is a good thing. John Mills was fine, but he seemed to have everything in his rhythm, considering a bit how his life was crumbling around him. He would stick his head up, get up 20 seconds later, shake off the dust and continue as if nothing had happened. A small complaint in a movie with a strong story, authentic locations and a plot that continually makes you guess until its completion.
