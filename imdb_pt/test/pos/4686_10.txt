The highest praise for the other commentator here on IMDb, who wondered why this series did not "get stuck" in its time to last much longer as many other series in the 80's did. <br /> <br /> It's not true that the series would have gotten worse if it continued. <br /> <br /> I will at the end of this my comment post some thoughts on the achievements of the film, instead: attempts by the legend of Robin Hood. <br /> First of all, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are among all of us, you live forever. <br /> <br /> Nothing is as fun as the whole two, if anyone wants, three seasons of this absolutely unique series. And at the same time absolutely agreeing with the newest and revolutionary discoveries of Terry Jones's documentations on Egypt, Greece, Rome, Konstantinopel, the Goths and Barbarians, and the Middle Ages and the Crusades ... Yes, THE MONTY Python- Terry Jones): If you've seen those bright and funny Jones-Docs, you'll get a better, better understanding of all the background material Carpenter, Robin of Sherwood series writer be the brother of John Carpenter, who made "The Thing", his third brother makes music), intended to tell us. The writer of "Dick Turpin", "Catweazle" and the first two seasons of "Robin of Sherwood", called "Kip" Carpenter, is my suerano of the film. He is better than anyone else who criticizes his element of "sword and witchcraft" or "defect" (taken from Sherwood Webring's Robin) of this series (which I can not see) or has another unfounded criticism of which there was much in season and even now. <br /> <br /> That's why, when you first get to know this "Robin of Sherwood", you will be harsh. You will, at first, detest the third season. Not only that: I myself went through that, and on top of that, I just took the first two seasons to my heart deeper - TO DESERVE the fact that Robin's actor Praed left this series because after the series had has been offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous Canadian series called "The New Adeventures of Jules Verne" - the title already reveals the emptiness of the whole project. Praed was for money, not for fame, he did not stay with his gang and relatives, I mean: as actors. <br /> <br /> Actors who personally represent the after "really" in our current time famous and legendary faces and characters from Robin-Legend. The potential of this series could and should have been blossomed much more without any degrading contents of content and historical message and rebellious precision in relation to current political issues. Once again, it is mandatory to say: A change from The main role was forced by Praed's stupid decision to leave Robin Sherwood for a silly remake series of Verne's tales and brilliantly woven in the filming of story. Yet in some ways it is a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Anyway: If anyone is informed about this, and that Connery was perhaps actually announced by his father, but that the young Connery NOT AT ALL "pursued Praed", as I mischievously thought first , then you can absolutely enjoy the 3rd season. It's sad that the script was no longer written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we do not have that critical historical past and free thought anymore, as in "The Witch of Elsdon" or "The King's Fool," two episodes of the first series which is A) funny, B) historically educating and C) brilliantly acted. === <br /> <br /> "Do not trust the Lion!" <br /> <br /> Unlike many other characters who wished him dead because of his own power gain, Richard Lionheart, shown in RoS and as in real history, was a greater authority than John or others, but used only for his perverse idea of ​​the Crusade and the war against Normandy in France. He massacred and slaughtered far more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in the "wholy" crusades, and his soldiers even devoured the children they killed from hunger or poverty. In addition, after its capture by the Saracens (Muslims) in the crusades, Britain was expelled for its ransom, 100,000 marks (at the time, eleventh century, comparable to approximately 30 billion - 30,000,000,000,000 .- Dollars of the present value ), to retrieve him safely, and then he visited England for a month to return to Normandy (in France, where the Norman Invaders were first) by the Crusades (it is learned that in The King's Fool episode) . For this new crusade, possibly a kind of revenge for his capture, Richard Lionheart again "drains the country of money" (quoted in the mouth of Clive Mantle, when he gives Robin in to be critical even with the king). Robin criticizes Richard's anti-social decision, he addresses Richard himself, telling him, "The poor have given everything to set him free, how can you ask for more of them?" - Richard: "... Give me your courage and strength, not your words!" ... Later, in particular, Richard orders Robin's murder ... So the Crusaders were the real "barbarians." PS: Already when I watched Kostner in '91, I was annoyed because afterwards, I discovered in the history course at school that Richard was not only as good man as exhibited by Sean Connery in his appearance at the end of "Prince of the Thieves". Well, as Terry Jones would say: it's a lie, a treacherous lie! "Sean is a humorist and charismatic, and his son does a better job than expected in the third season of" Robin of Sherwood ". <br /> <Once again: Praed is, according to my information so far, Sherwood for a stupid Verne series that no one with a brain will ever remember or want to remember.
