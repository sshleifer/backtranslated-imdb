I agree with the guy above, it's so funny that I understand everything, but my friends just do not understand. Go to Japan and you will see a different movie after being there. When I met my father's girlfriends, at his house in Kanagawa. I swear I felt the same as Jack. Frightened, but at the end of the day everything was fine, so I gave this movie 10 to 10. <br /> <br /> I watched at least 30 times, taking me to watch on the plane flying to Japan next month. One thing that is really good is the ball game scene. It makes me feel like I'm there again. This is a must see if you have any interest in Japan and baseball. Too bad they do not make a sequel. Does anyone know where the temple scenes were filmed and the discussion with hirko on the catwalk with a ceiling? I need to know so I can win an argument with my ex-Japanese woman. thank you
