In desperate times they were willing to do whatever it takes to win. I loved how the futility of Maple Leaves was used as a metaphorical basis for Bobby and Tessa. The performance was far superior to hogwash consumption given by the film industry. <br /> <br /> Great Issue! At the end of the short I felt that it was a bit incomplete, but that's life and that's what life and art waltz in a work of cinematographic art. <br /> <br /> Excuse me while I rinse the whiz cheese, but I find it acceptable at certain times. <br /> <br /> Two scenes that I should highlight are: The bathtub and the sofa scene. <br /> <br /> The sofa scene for Tessa was a decisive and 360 moment of the human condition. Throughout the short I saw her as a brute, but now we see her true reality. Your mind spoke before your heart. I need to say more about the bath scene.
