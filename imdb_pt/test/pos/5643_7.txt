The title is a reference to the destruction of the remains of a harvest, such as rice husks, by farmers who burn them creating fires in the plains. This is a grim story about the destruction of the Japanese soldier. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the last days of the campaign in the Philippines as a soldier with tuberculosis who returns from a hospital because, as he can walk, they have no room for him. His top officers do not want him around, since he's too sick to work or fight. Abused by his officer, he is sent back to the hospital with orders to be admitted or killed. They still will not take him and he is soon left to wander the war-torn landscape trying to find help or a place to stay or even just food. It is a dark journey without hope in sight and only the death and inhumanity of man to man. Announced as a harrowing journey into the dark heart of man and war, this is also a very funny movie. This is not to say that it is not horrible, sometimes it is, but also darkly comic. How could it not be? Here is a movie where madness and insanity run rampant, people are constantly trying to pluck tobacco leaves to eat, trying to get a slightly better pair of shoes, trying to remain a Japanese soldier in the face of the absurd marching constantly but never staying in any place and you can not help but laugh. To be sure, things get darker as it becomes clear that cannibalism is perhaps, literally and figuratively, the only way to survive, but at the same time there is something uncomfortably funny in human comedy. <br /> <br /> Acclaimed as a great anti-war film, its austere photographic style makes clear the insanity of war, while it dazzles our eyes with its beauty. Here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the civilian. in the midst of forests of fields and trees that would otherwise be, and to some extent still, very beautiful. It's a shocking feeling. <br /> <br /> What is intriguing is that I read that this is based on a novel about the redeeming power of Christianity. The director removed all religious references to hope and salvation and instead used it to show that life smells bad, that war is even worse and that there is no hope. <br /> <br /> Intellectually, I admire the film emotionally. I do not. Part of it is a raucous and noisy score that, to me, accentuates what we are seeing on the screen. It almost gilds the lily since the image is so strong that it is not necessary for music to force you to feel one way or another. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, for you to decide. By the way, it's unlike any other bloody, horrible, and real war movie in ways that big budgeted movies claim to be, but they never are. This is not for those who are adverse to blood and blood, since here in swords. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look.
