The famous "Fata Morgana" by filmmaker Werner Herzog is unbelievably unorthodox. Although the characters appear in the movie from time to time, there is no real story. Nor is the film an educational or historical documentary. It's a movie without a follow-up script. <br /> <br /> The film consists of curious background music and a somewhat illogical narrative VO, the combination of which covers a long line of images of most, though not exclusively, the Sahara desert. . Some of the images are wonderfully strange and out of the ordinary. The camera captures ghostly images, or illusions, optical illusions that haunt and hypnotize. <br /> <br /> This general cinematographic tendency is punctuated by occasional observational observations on fortuitous topics. For example, in a sequence, a man wearing goggles gives us a mini-tutorial on lizards. And in what for me was the most captivating and bizarre sequence, a small room contains a man with dark glasses who sings with a voice totally distorted by the microphone he is using, accompanied by a lady playing loud music on a microphone. old piano Neither the man nor the old woman seems to like what they are doing. Like baroque. <br /> <br /> "Fata Morgana" has an underlying concept that unites the wide variety of strange images and eclectic sounds. But this concept is so subtle, so obscure that you will never discover without help. From this subtle theme, the movie really makes sense. Without this reference point, however, the film may seem tedious and endless, a meaningless parade of random earthly images and esoteric narrative jargons. <br /> <br /> No remorse, thematically disconcerting and cinematic heretical, "Fata Morgana". will probably make you faint with pleasure or make you vomit. You will either cling to the zen qualities of the movie or feel tempted to break the DVD into a thousand pieces. One thing most viewers will agree: "Fata Morgana" is ... different.
