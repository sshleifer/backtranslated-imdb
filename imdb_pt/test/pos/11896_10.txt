I love movies that take you to them. A movie that really leaves you feeling weak when it's over and that kind of movie is rare. <br /> <br /> Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different on-screen characters. This movie has a tip for that. A major stream launched for such a low budget. Why is it that a man with so much talent and charisma (not to mention the sex appeal of forms beyond most other actors) can do this with so little money to work ????? These actors truly believe in their script and in their talent as a director, writer and actor. I am so happy to know that such a modern genius is out there, letting the passion for art lead you and taking us as an audience with him. Damian, I've heard of you through so many different circles and do not let the envious people of this world come to you. Martin understands this, Fellini understands and you will always understand. The fire and passion in you is what we love watching on the screen. Thank you for being different and having the courage to write like you do. You are a single director, do not listen to empty vessels.
