Why do people need to follow the opinion of herds of masses and critics? RANDOM HEARTS, directed by brilliant Sydney Pollack (who also has a small role in the film) is another Harrison Ford vehicle. As such, it is very good and fun. Certainly, anyone who is going to see this has this in mind, or reads the book that is not better. Even Kristin Scott Thomas fans, including me, knew it would be a variation of her again to interpret her older uncle's love interest. Even so, the film is satisfactory. What's so bad about this movie that's a lot better on the other (much better-rated) Harrison Ford vehicles? This movie is not a masterpiece, but it's not as bad as the masses would have the potential viewer believed.
