*** Spoilers ahead *** My childhood ending had two cinematic icons: Star Wars and this film by the Czech genius Karel Zeman. An encyclopedia of Jules Verne where nineteenth-century illustrations come to life in exquisite black and white photography, combined with stop motion and conventional animation. Verne's spirit of adventure is fully present throughout the film, as well as a very modern questioning about the moral limits of power and advanced technology. In fact, it brings atomic energy into Verne's universe in a very elliptical and elegant way. Also elliptical and elegant is the end of the villain, with an explosion (probably nuclear) sending his hat flying over the sea. The resolution of the film is symbolic and very satisfying, something very rare nowadays, when many films do not seem to know how to finish. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to get this jewel in reruns. Local TV in the late 70's: it increased my pleasure for Verne's fiction and cinema. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for Karel Zeman, underestimated master of the imagination.
