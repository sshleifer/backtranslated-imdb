There I was on vacation when my host suggested that we attend this B movie festival in Breda. I was tough because I had not been traveling to a movie theater, but I have to admit that I do not regret it for a second (especially with the contribution of Stephen Malkmus). It probably helped that I had no idea what to expect. <br /> <br /> The SEA OF DUST begins as a typical fantasy drama. We have a young medical student going to help a doctor whose city is being destroyed by a crazy plague (which in a way involves blowing heads). On the way, he stops to visit his fianc√© and is expelled from the estate by his father. Traveling, he finds a girl lying on the road, another plague victim, and takes her to the doctor. Yawning, I thought. Everything seemed very predictable. <br /> <br /> And then it all went crazy and suddenly it turned into a completely different movie. Tom Savini appears similar to Dracula, the characters begin to travel to the "other side" of reality, and the dialogue becomes increasingly fun. <br /> <br /> And when I thought I'd fit into a rhythm, the image changed. again, making it really dark and bizarre. I will not ruin this for the first time viewers, but there is an incredible sequence about empty people, a lot of talk about the abuse of religion by society and some overdone effects. And did I mention Stephen Malkmus? This is not a perfect movie (in case you have not realized this since your appearance at a B-Movie festival), but it's worth the time for adventurous viewers. Great visuals, cool soundtrack, lots of cool ideas. The acting is a bit crazy at times, but I think that's the point. <br /> <br /> Funny I had to go to Breda to see an American photo that looked like a British horror movie. You discover this ...
