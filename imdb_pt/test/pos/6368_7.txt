It surprises me that this comedy well above the average of the 80's is only 5.2 of all the electors of IMDB. Dan Ackroyd makes his usual satirical move as a cheater who takes a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prison doctor. He retires to California to begin his work by giving advice on a radio show pretending to be the infamous Dr. Lawrence Baird. The only person who knows that he is an impostor is the drunk priest (Walter Matthau) who appears to be spoiled by the new wealth found by Ackroyd, who blakmailed him. Charles Grodin also has a good supporting performance. By its genre, I think this film deserves the same credibility as "Ferris Bueller" or "Trading Places". 7.5 / 10
