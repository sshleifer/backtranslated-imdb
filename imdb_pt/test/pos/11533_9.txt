The plot of this film is not complicated. A very attractive young woman goes to Europe in search of the reasons for the suicide of her older sister ten years earlier. There she meets up with her sister's ex-boyfriend and together they travel to all the places her sister has attended, and gradually the reasons become clear. <br /> <br /> But what makes this movie so special and soars above the limited plot is the beautiful portraits of the characters. Although the older sister's boyfriend is an abandoned hippie, he has noble ideals, moral standards, and incredible forces. And although the older sister, which we see in flashbacks, shares these ideals, she does not have a sense of limitation or balance, of how much is too much. And although the younger girl is fiercely loyal to her sister's memory, she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was just a normal girl, after all. <br /> <br /> The most special moment of the film is when the young woman and her sister's boyfriend finally stop fighting against the attraction they feel for each other. I do not remember seeing more romantic tenderness, touching and beautiful in the act of making love in a movie! <br /> <br /> In all these ways, this is a really beautiful film, a film that must be enjoyed and can be seen again and again. 9 out of 10.
