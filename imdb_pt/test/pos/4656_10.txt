What can I say about this movie that has not been said hundreds of times before? It's an American classic. He has generated dozens of imitators. Or none at all. Midnight Madness is a type. From the ridiculous opening / music set to Bonaventure HOtel, I was hooked. Leon made us feel so young and carefree. One question, though, how did he have these two prostitutes with him all the time? And how was the time / money to organize such an event? The cast is top notch. David Naughton is at his best here. His tight yellow shirt is disturbing. His younger brother, Michael J Fox (in his first leading role), is a real brat. There is also the love interest of Naughton and an idiot and the obligatory black guy in a fisherman's hat on the yellow team. Michael J Fox does bad things, like trying to steal beer glasses at the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery and escape to the Flounder van. Flounder's team gives us more comedy. What exactly is the agreement with the blonde on this team? Is she dating Flounder? Or Melio? Or Blade? Yes, the name of the Mexican gentleman is a blade. The other guy on the Flounder team has the best lines in the movie, I will not pomp them here. The Meat Machine team is a bunch of drunks. My personal favorite is the armpit. But the silent negro is also great. The other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians (two of whom are 450 pound twin). <br /> <br /> You know the end from the beginning. But it does not matter. This is the 80's genre at its best. Do not rent this, buy it. Buy now.
