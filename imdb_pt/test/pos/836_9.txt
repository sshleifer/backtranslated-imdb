Since the last couple of days I've been really addicted to the "Female Scorpion" series and I keep hitting my head because I've waited until now ?? What is a long time? before buying the whole box set. "Beast Stable" is the third consecutive brilliant effort, and the undeniably main asset of this series is how writers have always created something entirely new and different for each plot. Never before, or after, have there been a number of explorations that offered so much variety when it comes to stories, settings, themes and footage styles. The original more or less qualified as a so-called "Women-in-Prison" movie (but already an atypical), but you can not categorize parts 2 and 3 as such, since they hardly present any image inside the prison walls. . And the overall tone and atmosphere keeps changing with each new episode as well. The first film was hard and dark, while the second was psychedelic and part three is almost mostly melodramatic. Do not let this last description discourage you, however, as "Beast Stable" still presents more than enough exploratory themes and disturbing images despite the dramatic environment. The opening sequence, for example, is absolutely fantastic. Sasori, still a fugitive from the law, literally opens the way to freedom on the subway when there is no other way but to cut off the arm of the persistent police officer who handcuffed her. Her run around town with her severed arm hanging on hers as the credits appear onscreen, accompanied by familiar theme music, is pure and genuine gold exploration! The story goes on convincingly with our heroine trying desperately to lead an anonymous life in the big city, but the poor girl simply can not escape her past or even new kinds of agony. Sasori befriends a prostitute, although without exchanging dialogues, and takes a job in a sewing studio. Her own retarded brother (!) Engravida the prostitute, while Sasori gets into trouble with the local network of pimps and clandestine crimes. She cleverly prevents a bad guy from taking advantage of his body, finds a former prison enemy, and furiously avenges one of the prostitutes when she undergoes a barbaric abortion. Meanwhile, the one-armed policeman continues to obsessively prowl the streets in search of retribution against Sasori. Our multi-talented director, Shunya Ito, formidably crosses all these story lines to a powerful and healthy and never misses the visual aspects or ingenious style of filming. "Beast Stable" features some of the most impressive and ingenious camera angles you can think of, the editing is flawless and the outside locations are indeed depressing. Those who know the character of Sasori a little are aware that the film really lacks memorable dialogues, but this is always amply compensated by the wonderful charisma of Meiko Kaji and menacing faces. There is very little sleaze in addition to the incestuous subplano mentioned above, but the brief flashes of extreme violence are great and the distorted end is almost too bright for words. Actually, I think part three might be the biggest (or at least my favorite) series so far. My only point of criticism, small and totally irrelevant, is with regard to the ridiculous sounds that one of the birds produces when Sasori is locked in a cage. That bird looks like a ventriloquist mannequin with stomach cramps.
