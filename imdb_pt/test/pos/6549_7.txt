I watched Uzumaki last night and soon we remember the first two films by Peter Weir from Australia, The Last Wave and Picnic At Hanging Rock. They were movies loaded with atmosphere, but with little horror. Uzumaki, to me, seems clearly influenced by these films. There are a number of rather mundane scenes that become more important the deeper you get sucked into the movie. It also has more scenes of absolute horror and although I do not think the movie really compares to these two films, it's worth the time of the more attentive fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 seems fair but I must say that years after seeing The Last Wave the movie still remains with me, and it is precisely the unfinished end of Picnic At Hanging Rock that makes it so scary. p.s. All people criticizing acting ... pullleasse ... in this genre?
