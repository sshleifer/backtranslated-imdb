It was weird and I liked it, I laughed a lot, so the important thing is that I recommend the movie. However, I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say. The plot is a very simple.Betty (Renee Zellweger), a hard-living house wife sees her husband being murdered and forgetting everything she has seen, she follows her "true love" for a soap series character, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough, but not enough to make a movie of 95 minutes. And here comes the big question. What is the film about? The reference to "The Wizard of Oz" is obvious.Betty and Dorothy are both from Kansas however, while Dorothy arrives at the end of the film to the conclusion that "there is no place like home," Betty comes to no conclusion. and at the end of the movie we wondered what she learned from her experience and the answer is simply nothing. It does not seem to affect her at all. <br /> <br /> What is the movie about the difference between reality and fantasy? it could be but the scenes that are dealing with this subject are short and serve no more than a joke and not as a serious plot that can take the movie to other places. (and by the way "The Truman Show" dealt with that subject in a much better way). <br /> <br /> The movie could be about obsession. Betty is obsessed with the soap series and Charlie (Morgan Freeman) is obsessed with Betty.LaBute show two sides of the obsession and he seems to forget that obsession under any is dangerous and must be condemned. He seems to have sympathy for Betty's obsession because he sees her as harmless. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie we have scenes that in itself could have been a subject for a whole movie, but we have to think about it without them having an impact on the characters. <br /> <br /> The ending is simply a makeup that has nothing to do. do with what we've seen before. It's a shame because the film could have been sharper if it had focused on one or two subjects. When it is, it's about a lot, but actually I do not say anything. <br /> <br /> What we have left is the feeling that we saw a small, funny and weird movie that could have been so much more.
