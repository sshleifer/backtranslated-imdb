I thought this movie was perfect for little girls. It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do whatever they wanted to do as much as they wanted. Most girls would like this story, even if there is the thought of death in it. Although no one dies, the king almost does, but the little girls do not understand him, so this contributes to a perfect story. All events add up, creating a great plot that can have meaning if you go deep enough. This story is perfect for girls, and since it's a Barbie movie, kids can have more fun with it, especially if they have their own barbies. Anyone can have fun with this because it is so beautiful and understandable. Overall, I think this movie is a good movie for everyone, especially for little girls, and will give a smile to anyone at least once during the movie.
