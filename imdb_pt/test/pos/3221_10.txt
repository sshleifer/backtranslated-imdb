I did not get Gilmore Girls when he left so I'm still trying to catch up on the first season. I read most of the comments from users and for the negatives, I have to ask, the show you are watching ?? <br /> <br /> This show is a classic, great lines, characters and good acting. And best of all, NOT its standard formula always shows with an occasional twist to the story. There are probably more women who are reflected in Lorelai / Emily's relationship in the Lorelai / Rory relationship. The people and the plots are not PC, but they are real !! <br /> <br /> If you find the dialogue annoying, I suggest you record the show, so you can see the parts again do not understand.
