"The Gay Desperado" is wonderful everywhere. The joke between Leo Carrillo and Harold Huber is as funny as anything you'd hear in a movie today. Better line? "That would be my third choice!" "Diego" is obviously the archetype of "Smith's Silent Bob". The black and white cinematography of Lucien N. Andoit (particularly with the shadows of the bandits) was remarkable. All I can say about Ida Lupino is: "Thank God for DVD!" You can go straight to the scene where she is experiencing sombreros and serapes and see her standing in front of the mirror over and over again. <br /> <br /> So I do not forget, that Nino Martini guy sings well, too.
