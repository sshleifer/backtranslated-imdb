Camry's lyrical Bobbycrush boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is teenager desire with a lush presentation (beautifully photographed by Aaron Platt) that is more fluttering than narrative. Trapped somewhere between the documentary and the dream, Bobbycrush recalls the inventiveness of the first Todd Haynes and the vivid hyper-realism of Gus van Sant. With courage, glamor and broken heart, it's like the movie equivalent to Sonic Youth playing bubblegum pop.
