For me this is a good series. I'm a bit disappointed that Ana Lucia and Libby died, but more upset because Micheal lied to everyone about who killed them. And if anyone can answer that, what was it that the staff names that was supposedly "Henry Gale" he was like the leader of the others (or was it Miss Clue ??) anyway, if you know his legal name. Well, trying to think of what might happen after they finally did not push the button. This spoils the entire DARMA project and I personally thought it was cool how they had this fundamental thing underground that Desmond used to turn off the magnet thing, yeah and what was the purpose of it? I'm glad they did not finally push the button, but what about the people in the hatch? Like Mr. Echo, John, Charlie and Desmond well, they probably died, but what about the others? I think they survived, I forgot? Well, this is just my little thing about what I thought about this end of the season!
