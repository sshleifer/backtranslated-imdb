I LOVE THIS MOVIE !!! <br /> <br /> This lovely and lovely love story immediately attracted me with its adorable characters and moving poignant romance. I was so attached to the characters throughout the film that I felt like I knew them in person. The plot is very charming, and it brought me to tears in several exciting moments. Duchovny and Driver have a very sweet and homely relationship with which you can not get involved. This is one thing worth watching more than once and show to all your friends. I'm just curious, why was not this a big hit? <br /> <br /> I give this 10 out of 10! Spectacular movie! (And this comes from a guy who thinks 9 of 10 movies are not even worth watching.)
