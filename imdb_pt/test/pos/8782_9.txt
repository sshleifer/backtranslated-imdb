Ah, Hitchcock! It's hard to find a bad Hitchcock movie until he lost it after THE BIRDS (1963) and SABOTEUR prove the point. Having admired most of this director's work for many years, I managed to skip this one, perhaps for lack of interest in Priscilla Lane and Robert Cummings as leading actors. I was naturally familiar with the climax of the Statue of Liberty for having seen it repeatedly in film retrospectives, but I mistakenly assumed that the story leading to it might not be of interest to me. I was wrong! The suspense storyline begins to cook right through the face of a casual encounter between Bad Guy's Saboteur and Good Guy protagonist Wrongly Accused and continues to zoom through a series of additional encounters and narrow escapes. All the familiar Hitchcockian elements are there: the innocent person wrongly accused of a crime; people not being what they seem to be; or suspenseful scenes that intensify the suspense scene that takes place inside them (an airplane hangar, a ranch, a bridge from which the handcuffed hero hurls himself to escape the police, a sumptuous charity ball in a palatial mansion, a top floor of skyscraper, and finally the torch of the Statue of Liberty). <br /> <br /> Humor is provided by supportive players, generous dolls from the beginning of World War II social commentary, moments of human warmth where the suffering people find within themselves to lend a helping hand human, not getting anything in return? In short, there was always a basic humanity at the core of Hitchcock, nevertheless terrible traps - a sensational cast of supporting players, notably Otto Kruger as the smoothest villain on this side of George Sanders (his Broadway credits include the male lead in Noel Coward PRIVATE LIVES ?? and that says it all) and Wernell Norman Lloyd as the titular saboteur, not to mention Alma Kruger? no relationship with Otto? as a widow of prominent society involved in the intrigue of the fifth column (her character prefigures that of Claude Rains' mother in NOTORIOUS). Priscilla Lane does a good job with a difficult role. For most of her early scenes, we can not tell whether she believes the hero is innocent or guilty, and she seems to constantly change her mind, not moving to his side until the end of the process. It can not be determined whether her acting is wrong or whether we should remain in a state of uncertainty, but the plot's evolution is so quick, fun, and intelligent that we do not really care what she thinks. <br /> <br /> Then there are the quirky touches of Hitchcock that have nothing to do with the plot. The character Twice the Lane takes a break to get change for a quarter ?? once to reimburse their hijackers for an ice cream soda and again to make a call from a telephone booth. Why were these scenes inserted, no one knows, perhaps to make the film look more realistic and thus increase credibility and suspense? Or maybe to give the audience a moment to catch their breath? Some of the characters are over ?? the blabbering truck driver, the incredibly kind and trusting blind man who lived alone in an immaculately maintained forest hut, the "human skeleton" of political philosophy and other members of the circus caravan who hid the protagonists of their pursuers.
