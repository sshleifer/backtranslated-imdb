This is a great show, despite many negative reviews. The purpose of this show is to entertain you, making you laugh. Two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. Simple. The fun in this show is seeing the two males trying to accomplish their goal. <br /> <br /> Some seem to hate the show for several reasons, but I think they misunderstood this as an "educational" program about picking up girls. Well, it's not, it's a comedy show, and the goal is to make you laugh, not teach you anything. If you do not like the show because it does not teach you anything, do not watch it. If you do not like the whole ballad, do not watch. If you do not like socializing, do not watch. This show is a comedy show. If you come down watching other people pick up girls, well, that does not make you laugh, so do not watch. If you are so disappointed in yourself after watching this program and realize that you do not have the ability to "catch" girls, there is no reason to hate the program, just do not watch it!
