The lament and almost unbearable melancholy of the music of Amalia Rodriques goes to a place in the soul that only the music can shake. In his voice and magic presence, there is the exquisite agony of Fado, an art form that I did not know until I saw this film. <br /> <br /> For me, the success of this beautifully and lovingly crafted documentary is that the filmmaker resists the temptation to editialize and simply allows us to share the magnetism and elegant passion of this icon. There seems to be an inevitable correlation between Portuguese fado and American blues. <br /> <br /> The documentary, at its best, transports us to a hitherto unknown reality. and having this glimpse, we are transformed. <br /> <br /> Sheltered, Mr. de Almeida
