The show was amazing and very professional. Madonna is a non-stop, dancing and singing for 2 hours. The opening was very good when she left the disco ball and also jumping was a great performance. The whole show was full of energy, so it's kind of hard to tell which were the highlights, because each song had something special and unique. I saw live pairing from their previous excursions (Drowned world and reinvention tour) were good but you can not compare with this. The dancers were fantastic, the lights and the whole show were just perfect. Madonna still looks very good. If you have not seen it yet, I recommend you to see it. You'll enjoy the show from start to finish. Madonna is still the dance queen.
