I just watched it again on BBC Channel 4. It's not Jane Austen's best novel, but the film is a reasonable interpretation. I suspect that the halls of the Assembly at Bath would have been fuller than the one shown; maybe they could not afford the extras. Also, why do all shut up so the dancing couple can have an audible conversation? I've never heard anything that anyone ever told me when I was dancing and I suspect it would have been the same in the 18th / 19th century in Bath. <br /> <br /> I can not believe the US / Canada Reviews; they completely miss the ironic element that is in the movie. "Gothic" scenes are presented intelligently, but you need to read them correctly. I'm sure Jane A would be slightly amused by these comments. A no-brainer, does anyone else think Peter Firth may look more like Colin Baker (a former Doctor Who) or vice versa, how old are they?
