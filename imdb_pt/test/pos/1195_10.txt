Milos Forman's original hair was the perfect movie that really revealed how life was changing in those years, not only in the US, but especially in this country. One of the film's plots was to be used in other films that would come after Hair, for example, in American Graffitti, etc. It was an original story with a touch of generational sadness. The characters in the movie were like solitary "cells" in a "body" that was changing everywhere. Overall a very good movie, maybe a little underrated though. The role of Annie Golden was smaller, but she acted very well. It was the film that practically launched John Savage as an actor. One of Chicago's members played his role well, though it was a minor role.
