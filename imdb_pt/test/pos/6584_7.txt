I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and director Aku Louhimies presented his film and was available for questions and answers. For some reason, this movie is titled Frozen Land in English, so I do not know how the distributors were frozen with Paha. This is a very good movie. For me, it is not enough to have enough to reach the excellent category, but I talked to some viewers who thought it was a great movie. Louhimies said that in Finland people loved this movie or hated it and said that many people in theaters abandoned it. I'm sure some have opposed some of the violence, swearing, drug and alcohol abuse, and explicit sex scenes. It's a very clever story of how these different lives are intertwined because of a trickle down effect. This movie has very interesting and strong characters. I would rate a 7.0 out of a possible 10 and would see it again and recommend it with caution.
