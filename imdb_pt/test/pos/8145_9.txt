I loved this movie !!! It was so easy to be part of the characters' lives and really feel the excitement they were going through. <br /> <br /> A movie full of laughter, sarcasm, shocks and upset just a fantastic romantic drama really! /> <br /> The only part that I did not like was the special features. The backstage comment was a bit out of place. Because I had seen the movie before the extras I prefer to think of the actors as the characters (silly I know) but the personality actors are very different from the characters they play. But even so is a fantastic movie, spectacular and brilliant, I recommend that anyone who has looked at this movie and thought hmmmmmmm I should buy it? The answer must be a definite yes!
