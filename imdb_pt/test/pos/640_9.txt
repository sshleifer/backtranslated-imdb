Billy Hughes is a dumb girl who works for makeup on a cheap horror photo that is filmed in Moscow by an American director. One night, Billy is locked in the movie studio. Later that night, she hears that someone may be in the building and will take a look. It's when she comes across a woman being brutally murdered while filming. After escaping from the clutches of the killers, Billy informs the authorities, only to look red when the men show it was an act. Billy knows what she saw and soon her life is in turmoil again from clandestine figures who believe she has something of importance. <br /> <br /> I do not know how this breathtaking sleeper passed me, but I thought it was a much older film. There is one thing though, it has to be one of the most shocking and intense thrillers I have seen in a long time. It's just a great suspense builder and almost everything fits! The first half of the movie is surprisingly thrilling, with tense sequences that leave your heart in your throat and fog us up with an atmospheric environment of alienation. Underlying, this is a humorously evil black line. The flaws emerge in the story, as she loses her furious hold on her early-fool humor (or rather comic relief) between the characters of Fay Ripley and Evan Richard, who is a success and a failure for being too strong. In the long run it probably could have gone without. Despite some difficult moments, this aspect did not stop my pleasure. For me, the soft ending that they decided to go with just did not seem right. <br /> <br /> The mysteriously interesting premise was sinister to the bone and packed with some disturbing products. So multifaceted was the context and his emotions, there was something new in how it all unfolded and the nervous jolts and unbearable tension turned into a series of sudden twists and turns. Indeed, they made superb use of the original idea of ​​this deficiency and to spoil the situation by staging it in a foreign place where not many spoke English and so we are stuck in the mess as well. The delicate Marina Zudina makes a distressing portrait of the American dumb girl Billy. The way she managed to display the erratic emotions through her eyes and actions gave her some rudeness and credibility. Director Anthony Waller photographs the film in a very stylish, timely and skillful manner, without losing that dirty look that results from its stiff environment and a powerful and airy soundtrack that bores you persistently. The only real name to make an appearance was small, given by Alec Guinness. The performances of the cast were great, especially the laps of Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov as the Russian assassins. <br /> <br /> This fascinating feature, which is mainly composed of unknowns, is much better than a normal dark. thriller Highly recommended.
