I had never heard of this movie when a good friend recommended it. I trust the taste of this friend, so I bought the DVD. My wife and I sat down to watch without knowing what it was about. I thought it was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time, mainly because I saw the truth in satire. I strongly recommend this movie to all my friends. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. Some people will see the crude humor and the aura of stupidity, and they will find Idiocracy one of the most idiotic movies they have ever seen. What these people do not seem to understand is that coarse humor is there, not to amuse the audience but to show what appeals to the idiots in the future. <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson is well scaled up as an "average Joe." He is mainly there to be an enemy of the scathing commentary on the society that is scattered throughout this film. Many of the funniest bits are in the background, so it's worth seeing several times. What makes the film even funnier and more frightening is that I see elements of it in everyday life, in the people I know, or in the media. Then I go back to watching Idiocracy and realize how good it is. <br /> <br /> The few people who saw and liked this movie can be part of an elite club. I'm going to see an ad for some product with some innovative new ingredient, and I go back to my wife and say, "There are electrolytes!" She knows exactly what I'm saying.
