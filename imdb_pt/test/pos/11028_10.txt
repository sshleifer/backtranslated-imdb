Another must-have movie. Henry Brandon is a favorite! I was so surprised when I learned years ago that he was from Germany because he sounds and looks so typically American! And he was not great at "The Searchers" as Chief Scar ?? Another of my favorites, I have this and watch it again and again. Now, if I could add this to my collection, it would make my day! This is a great wildlife and movie story for all ages. The scenery is so beautiful and the snow leopard situation threatened with extinction is told with so much emotion that it will spark interest in endangered species in anyone, especially children. If I could, I would give a copy to all my grands and great-grandchildren!
