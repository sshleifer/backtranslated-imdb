I only gave seven because the performance is good. Of course by that I mean Wilkinson. The other two directors were "decent". But the characters themselves ... what the heck was so bad about the character that Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I did not see him behaving like the sailor Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an unbearable idiot with whom I prayed for an extremely brutal and prolonged end. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson is not Paul Bettany after all. So what in EARTH the character of Emily Watson (Anne) saw in it ???? She herself admitted that he was practically a piece of mink in her treatment of her. Why would she want to be in the same city as him, not to mention the same "room." <br /> <br /> I noticed some other criticism, one person said he "cried" at the end, to witness the tragedy of James. ??? What a tragedy? What, I mean, losing a moron who finds someone like Bill Bule? Give us some time.
