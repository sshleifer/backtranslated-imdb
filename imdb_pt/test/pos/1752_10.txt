"Mr. Bug Goes To Town" was the last great achievement that the Fleischer studios produced. The quality of the Superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics of Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael (with the help of veteran Sammy Timberg Flieshcer are very good but not as much as the image score of Leigh Harline who also scored Snow White to Disney. Harline's "atmospheric music" is superb, and a delight to the ears. The layout and staging of the image was years ahead of its time, and once again the Fleischer's background artists have surpassed themselves. The technified beauty of the film can not be denied, and while Hoppity the locust is the star, the characters of Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito steal the picture. is priceless, Kenny Gardner (brother-in-law) of Guy Lombardo ... and a featured vocalist in his band ... does his usual job as Dick Dickinsen. all the wrong reasons ons. Fleischer Studios were experts in animation par excellence and this shows a lot clearly on the finished product. The film is melodious, the story is great for all ages, and the final scenes of the insects fighting for their lives in a rising skyscraper are some of the best scenarios and animations of any animated film of the past and the present. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this wonderfully hand-drawn movie. Also be sure to appreciate the title sequence with the most elaborate example of Max Fleischer's remarkable 3-D aesthetic process, which took four months to build and used 16,000 tiny glass panels in Manhattan's "electrified" buildings. <br /> <br /> Do not miss Mr. Bug Goes To Town ... aka Hoppity Goes To Town. I bet you'll keep an eye on the results!
