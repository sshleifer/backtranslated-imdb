Let me start by saying that I was very surprised at the production value of this film. I managed to catch an early screening and I have to say that this is the best (if not only) Christian movie to get to theaters since the passion. <br /> <br /> Do not let the PG-13 rating scare you, rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are addressed in this movie (divorce, teenage pregnancy, drug use and suicide), but nothing in the movie is free. This is definitely a movie that a group of young Junior High can see without disturbing (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. The best part is that this is not a movie FOR THE CHRISTIANS, it's a Family movie without Heaven's seventh heavenly feeling. <br /> <br /> Laughter is there, and several times in the theater everyone was laughing, the bits of humor was natural and did not seem scripted or forced, and this contributed to a good pace in such a serious film. Teenagers and young adults, whether religious or not, can identify with many, if not all, characters in the film, and I was surprised to see these issues dealt with in this type of film. The plot is by no means predictable, and in the end hits closer to home than many will admit. Christians, fortunately, are not shown as all powerful know everything from the "Word", but instead people just trying to understand life. Humans make mistakes and no one is perfect, not even in this movie ... not even for a long shot. <br /> <br /> The acting is top notch, the place of writing, and you are not hit head with all the preacher Christian rhetoric. This is a great movie that will get you and your kids to think, talk and maybe question your own morality (or lack thereof). If you want to see a quality family movie in January, check out your local listings for this movie, and you can learn something about yourself. <br /> <br /> And I'm a 25-year-old man who just wanted to see a free movie.
