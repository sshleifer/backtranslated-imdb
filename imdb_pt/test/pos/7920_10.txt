This is being commented on only because Serge Prokofiev (1891-1953) may not be known at first how powerful the soundtrack is and how truly majestic these letters are. If you can read the lyrics by Alexander Nevsky op. 78 there is nothing here is less than a witness through music to one of the most beautiful and moving scores of all musical literature. This movie with the accompanying score has a special place in the world and this can be as true on the internet as anywhere else. The very site of composers who is subscribed for their property provides extra care given such punctuation as this score really deserves. It is to me as deep as it is ample with such daring that you wish to be the one, what they called Great Novgorod This is a song about Alexander Nevsky. Yes, it happened on the river Neva - on the river Neva, in the wide waters. There we killed our enemy of men of combat - there we chose fighters, the army of Swedes. Oh, how we fought, how we defeated them! Ah! s of war to kindling! In the fight our blood was poured freely into our great land, our native Russian land.Hey! Where the broadaxe rocked was like an open street, through their ranks a lane where spears ran! We harvest the invading Swedes like feather grass grown in desert soil. We must never produce native Russian land. Those marching over Russia will be killed! Stand up against the enemy, Russian land, get up, get up for the guns, great Novgorod! the arms continue) Stand up for the arms, Russian people, in battle only, in the fight to the death, stand up, free and brave people, defend our beautiful homeland! The high esteem of the living warriors, immortal fame to the dead warriors! For the Russian soil People will rise, Russian people In our great native Russia, no enemy will live Stand up to arms, stand up, native mother of Russia! No enemy will march through the Russian land, no foreign troops will invade Russia, invisible will be the routes to Russia. No enemy should devastate the Russian fields (here dear reader, we are invited to live forever with the following verse e) entitled "The field of the dead. "" I will cross the snow-covered field, I will fly above the death camp. I will search for brave warriors, my fianc√©, my robust youth. Here lies a man killed by a wild saber, one is impaled by an arrow. From his wounds the blood fell like rain on our native soil in our Russian fields. Who fell to Russia in noble death will be blessed by my kiss in his dead eyes, and for him, brave boy, who remained alive I'll be a true wife and a loving friend. I will not be married to a handsome man, the charm and beauty of earth will quickly disappear and die. I will be married to the man who is brave, Dar ye yeed to it, brave warriors! (now its conclusion with Nevskys entry into Pskov) In a great campaign Russia went to war.Russia overthrew the hostile troops.In our homeland, no enemy should live.Faces that come must be placed Celebrate and sing, native mother from Russia! In our homeland, the enemies will not live. The faithful will never see Russian cities and fields; dead! In our great Russia, in our native Russia, no enemy will live! Celebrate and sing, Native Mother Russia! All of Russia came in triumph for the celebration. Celebrate and rejoice, Russian homeland! - It should be noted that Prokofiev was under a great deal of pressure from Stalin, if you will, do good. This musical track was actually very well approved by Stalin. For me, there is an unmistakable beauty in how we love this world and Nevsky speaks of a hero whose attributes God like for all participation in this love. A truly beautiful and stealthy story of Alexander Nevsky's story.
