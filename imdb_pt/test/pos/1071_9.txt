First I loved the documentary. It represents a new school history / theory where a subject can reflect a wide range of social and historical issues. <br /> <br /> I'll take the camera and the dogs out of the way first. I hate the quality of the Blair Witch camera, but I also understand the advantage of such a casual approach. In fact, I agree with the other reviewer who gives us unprecedented access. <br /> <br /> Dogs: Attention, I have a doctorate in literature that I DO NOT use as a profession, so some of my training may infiltrate: Dogs are a beautiful metaphor for the complex relationship of the great efforts of being human need and our need to find work to achieve them. Dogs may reflect their owners, as one reviewer suggested. But they also serve as a substitute for the workers we see in the film. While this might suggest the Marxist problem raised by a critic, I think it also shows how difficult it is to globalize labor issues. No Mondovi in ​​Italy may not translate elsewhere. (Yikes! I'm a Marxist at heart and hate to hear my cynical resignation!) It's a remarkable bait and switch. Dogs are family, workers are family. But in the end, the dogs are the workers (the last scene with the poor farmer). Although you may disagree with politics, the art of analogy, along with the film's more open politics, is wonderful. <br /> <br /> There was only Faulkner (I'm from Alabama) who had the power of the movie beyond the Hollywood market, which interesting tales would have been told.
