Unlike Bond and other detective films, Alfred Hitchcock's hero used to be an ordinary man who would get into trouble, and then, with his insight and courage (and luck), he would get out of it. Jewel Thief is based on the same principle and so, in a way, it is the tribute of Vijay Anand to the master of suspense. The tribute as it may be, but it is its own foundation and establishes Vijay Anand as a great director himself. <br /> <br /> It is the story of an ordinary Vinay man who one day realizes that he has a double called Amar who is in fact a jewel thief. Suddenly, Vinay finds himself in the middle of an incubation scheme and, in order to save himself, goes in search of a wild goose to find this Amar standing one step ahead of him. The suspense is almost over in the whole movie, and as the plot unfolds, you are struck by the brilliance of the scheme. Like Hitchcock's films, Jewel Thief can boast of a great climax inside the grand palace of Sikkim. <br /> <br /> Everyone and I are all; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Vajyanti Mala, Tanuja, SD Burman, Kishore Kumar, Majrooh Sultanpuri, etc. etc. are in their best forms. This is one of the best thrillers ever made in India.
