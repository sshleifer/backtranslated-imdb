being a high school student, I have to take a health class. this year, the theme is drugs. we learn about the harm they can do to a person. From what we've said, I still believe and I know that drugs can really mess up a person. Anyway, my teacher wanted us to watch. of course, we moaned and started to sleep, but like the rest of my class, I really enjoyed this movie. was totally real, and not coated with sugar. the characters were incredible and believable. even the plot was remarkably realistic and believable. What I liked about this movie was mainly how it got to the point the drug's effect can take on an aggressor, and the consequences that the person has to deal with. all make sure that nothing bad will happen to them. Well, let's get serious. everything can happen in a small town, even for your best friend, like Sam and Chris. this movie shows this. a person can actually learn a lot by watching it. was quite effective.
