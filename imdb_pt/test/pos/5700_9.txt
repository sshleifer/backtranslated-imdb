What a wonderful documentary - I sat thinking that this would be a repeat of the evil stories told in Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, but it's actually a glorious, clear-eyed celebration of a strange and distorted era that has produced great movies. What struck me was the lack of apparent bitterness in the director's interviews, since the film industry is now a drug - instead, people like Friedkin and Coppola's eyes seem to shine positively by recalling their days of glory. The filming of an audience that came out of a daytime performance of the Exorcist was priceless. "It was - traumatic," says one guy. An excellent epitaph for the late Ted Demme, an exciting film, I just wanted it to be longer - I could have gone through a three-hour cut.
