This movie is great! Fear of watching documentary films? Cancel your psychiatrist and watch the story of little Dieter. You will not believe how captivating this beautiful movie is until you have experienced it. I'm anxious to say that even almost every Vietnam war movie, including Apocalypse Now. It's a real story, it's a personal story, a story about love to fly, the dream of being a pilot and the nightmare of being shot down over enemy territory. Everything is filmed in a "return to ..." style - on the spot, Herzog asking the questions, Dieter answering them in a memorable German-English accent, and with good memory pointing out what happened where about 25 years earlier. There is this part that I have told friends over and over: rescued from his US Navy plane, Dieter becomes a prisoner of war for the Viet Cong. Blindfolded most days, he is being dragged through the Southeast Asian jungle for miles and miles - barefoot. Tortured, insulted, disoriented, hungry and covered with infectious wounds, they arrive at a small and friendly village to spend the night. The next morning, after walking for several hours, Dieter discovers that someone stole his wedding ring from his finger. It is. He can not take it anymore. He begins to cry as a result of complete exhaustion. The Vietnamese men react in surprise. Dieter can explain what happened. Immediately, the group returns to the village and begins to look for the person who stole the ring. They find the man, immediately cut off his finger and return the ring to Dieter. - The movie is full of these surprising and surprising situations. The immense cultural differences, the shock of the East and the West, the fear of the unknown (that is, everything that represents America, on the one hand, the Asian jungle and its secrets, on the other) can be perceived throughout the film. Back problems? That's because you sat on the edge of the seat for two hours and did not notice.
