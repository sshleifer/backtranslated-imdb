I did not know anything about this movie before I watched it. It seems to be a lesser-known teenage horror from the 1980s. What struck me was the ways it differed from so many other films of that era. <br /> <br /> The first thing I noticed was the slowness of this movie. It does not do the typical setup of displaying characters being killed one by one. It takes time to build the background story, leaving a bit of mystery about what can happen. I was almost starting to think that no one would get hurt in this movie. But it all leads to the climatic sequel for the last 15 minutes, and then it gets pretty graphic (this was a bad time to snack on - I could barely finish my pizza after it started). <br /> <The characters also look a bit more three-dimensional than many teenage fright movies. The conversations were refreshingly largely lucid, unlike the expected exaggerated stereotypes. For example, the girl who is the popular, snobbish and queen of the clique is not constantly making insults at all, but is capable of having doubts and showing some consideration for others. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize, I felt that this movie was a bit original compared to what I expected, and a little better done as well. It attracted me, kept me interested, and then let me have it. Like I said, it's pretty bloody during the end, but almost familiar the rest of the time. I do not need to own it, but I'm glad I figured it out.
