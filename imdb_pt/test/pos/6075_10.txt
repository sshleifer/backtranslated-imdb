Even after all these years, this remains a "perfect movie" for me. I still remember sitting in the theater for a long time after it was over, stunned by experience, overwhelmed with emotion. I own the DVD (of course!) It's to see at least once a year. It is incomparable and I can not add much to what has already been written about its excellence and beauty. So happy that others love as much as I do! One note: the author of the book on which it is based - Michael Ondatje - was delighted with the film and is quoted as saying that he would have thought of some of the lovely scenes written just for the movie ... the way Kip "invites "Hana by his side with a trail of small candles and the way he arranges Hana to see the frescoes in the ruined medieval church.
