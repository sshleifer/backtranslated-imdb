Chris Penn is hilarious as Jeff Spicoli's all-time stoner brother. This movie is great because it was so much more real and funnier than the fast times at ridgemont high. Casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks from almost every Eddie van halen, which went on to become songs on ou812 and illegal carnal knowledge. This movie is one of the great heroes of stoner cinema with cheech and chong. Fast times were more depressing than funny. Abortions, friends cheating with friends, masturbating in bathrooms, bad jobs and failing in school. One must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than wildlife. The film had great appearances as the maker of the city limits that Michelle made at the liquor store or Ben Stein in her first role in the leftover store.
