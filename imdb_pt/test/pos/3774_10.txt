I loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More classic science fiction and horror films should be redone for this level of comedy, which is at the top of the line in my opinion. A movie without a drink, you laugh so hard you're going to spill it all yourself. Can we expect more? Let us wait. I would like to suggest many movies for this kind of remake. Mel Brookes did some remakes of classic movies. He made some very strong contributions. A photo of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion. I hope some producer or director can come up with the idea and bring us new comedies for our screens. We are in need of a good comedy insurgency to keep our level of laughter bigger than ever. A good Comedy FIX.
