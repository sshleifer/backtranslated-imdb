Grabbing 2.6 million viewers, you have to ask yourself what everyone's views on the plot / plot are. <br /> <br /> Reading the fall in life, I was led to believe that this would be an advantage. thriller from her seat on a single mother being chased and finally confronting the stalker. Unfortunately I was wrong. While the main plot is interesting enough - single mother get away from the road one night, then is chased by the same guy, the reasoning behind the chase left nothing but a very bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> Laura Leighton plays the victim, and she does well. Whether it was all those years at Melrose Place or not, she does well in this movie, playing a mother who would do anything to protect her child from danger, and she is very beautiful these days too. <br /> <br /> Leighton is really the only good thing about this movie. I think many people will identify with the main character, after discovering why the stalker is chasing, it will be a kind of movie that can only be seen once.
