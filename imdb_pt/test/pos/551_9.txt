Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play as a symphony in this mature story about a young girl who is condemned to life as the daughter of one of the craziest women you will ever meet. Sarandon has that ability, call her talent if you want, to play some of the more eccentric characters and bring her humanity to the forefront of any film she makes. As the mother of this obviously bright and muture beyond her young years, Sarandon alternates between being the mother and being the child with the ease of a ballerina. More importantly, she does this with strength and shine without stepping through the entire Portman representation of her daughter. The question is always asked when we deconstruct the plot of the film, who changes? This movie is certainly about the daughter, but if you look closely at the dreams and sacrifices that mom makes you come to understand that she changes step with her daughter. I'm willing to bet that it makes all of us in the audience change as well. The mark of the drama as well
