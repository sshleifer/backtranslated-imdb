This movie is what most industry forgot how to do: FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT, which means something that is enjoyable for people of all ages. This Wallace & Gromit in particular can be enjoyed by everyone from children who love coloring and cute bunnies to their grandparents who understand adult references. <br /> <br /> This movie has a direction as good as any I've ever seen, and I mean it literally. It's also packed with little bits of humor, and every scene has so much humorous detail in the background that I'll have to buy it even if it's just to read all the signs and brochures in the world of W & G. <br /> I plan to see this movie at least two more times in theaters, then buy it on DVD. You should see that too.
