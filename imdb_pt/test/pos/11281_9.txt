God cuts himself with a razor, then gives birth to the earth mother, who then gives birth through the gods the semen, son of the earth. <br /> <br /> This is an hour-and-a-half movie that describes a grim version of how God created the world. It is surreal, dark and poetic. The most important aspect of the film for me is the visual. His shot on a very grainy black and white film, using slow motion and normal shooting. Sometimes even fast movie and stop-motion. The scenes are long and drawn, which leaves a very strange mood. No sound was recorded during filming (I think), sound effects were added later, such as criccets, water and other ambient sounds, repeated several times. As you can understand, this film certainly is not for the impatient person ... <br /> <br /> I always felt it was similar to David Lynch's Eraserhead, except that it is even harder to understand, and even more dragged, but that's okay for me, I like that sort of thing. Its certainly not entertainment (at least not the Hollywood type) so if your going to check out, I recommend you set yourself up for this. Keep an open mind, and except something like the end of 2001: an odyssey in space.
