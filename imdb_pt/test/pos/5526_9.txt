The trick, so to speak, of this Paramount comedy of 1934 is the six comic actors, paired with three teams of men and women, all of whom appear together. W. C. Fields and his frequent partner, Alsion Skipworth, appear in the second half of the film and shine in their sheriff and innkeeper roles. Fields seems to have received the latitude of injecting enough of his own brand of surreal and misanthropic comedy on his part, and works wonderfully, especially where he can make his famous pool routine, tour that is totally welcome since it is hilarious. <br /> <br /> At first I thought it might seem like a mismatch to conceive a film to be performed by the subtle domestic comedy of Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland next to the film. Vaudeville, great and playful of the great comedy of husband and wife of George Burns and Gracie Allen, but here works perfectly because of the parts that George and Gracie receive in the script. There are independent kids taking a ride to California on Ruggles and Boland's honeymoon trip and they always find ways to annoy them every step of the way, even brilliantly, while they're each holding onto the side of a cliff for their life. <br /> <br /> Making Burns and Allen comic hassles to two friendly characters turns out to be a perfect way to fit your successful comedy characters into a real world - the comedy of people reacting to them in a believable way end up being as much a gold mine like Gracie's famous naive delivery. <br /> <br /> Charlie Ruggles deserves special mention for his performance as the banker "Pinky" Whinney. He is wonderfully subtle and underestimated, and he laughs at lines that, in the hands of another actor, might not even have been heard. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully witty, and most of the way is a perfectly extended comedy. frustration in which our sympathies are with the poor Whinneys, who can not get a moment alone, and the extra bonus is that what frustrates them is just more of Burns and Allen's first-class comedy material. For pre-code watchers, there's some pretty suggestive material in some of the funniest scenes, as Whinney tries to pass on George just because he and his wife want to be alone. There are some signs of a rushed production here - the occasional jumping cut, one of the most obvious fall games you've ever seen in a movie (upstairs with WC Field himself). short "The Golf Specialist"), and the knot in Field's draw is constantly changing shape. That does not bother me, though, and they should not bother anyone who is enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> "Six of a Kind" is a true little-known gem and one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. If you are thinking of watching it, the answer should be yes.
