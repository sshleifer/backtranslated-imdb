I really liked this movie and even today, this year, it's one of my favorites. The story was great, although the turnabout at the end was too predictable and I knew what would happen too soon. Normally, when that happens, the movie is spoiled for me (like "The Others"), but even knowing the outcome, I still enjoyed it to the end. Looking through the comments of others many people were impressed by the performance of Kelly Overton (Eve), I'm afraid I was not. His performance seemed to be the weak part of the film for me, in contrast to the incredible performance (or characterization) of James Haven (Don Wake) ... I hope to see more of him. What a great movie, highly recommended to everyone!
