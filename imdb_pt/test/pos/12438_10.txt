After a long period in the West End, this delightful movie transforms Margaret Rutherford as the director of Ms. Whitchurch in this financially successful adaptation made in the 1950s. All internal scenes took place at the Riverside studios in Hammersmith. London. Outside scenes were filmed on location at a public girls' school near Liss in Hampshire. During the 12-week filming, Margaret Rutherford and Joyce Grenfell were staying at a nearby hotel and used to attend school at night, where they enjoyed the company of true school lovers. <br /> <br /> The movie script contains only two original lines from the original part. The supporting characters and actors are in good shape and you can only feel sympathy with their situation, especially in the final scenes.
