This film went into production before the start of World War II, but was not released until it was in progress. With significant fascist sympathy in the US, and Chaplin himself suspected of being a communist sympathizer, The Great Dictator was a very courageous effort. Such risks in the production of films - veiled political statements - would be almost inconceivable nowadays. Imagine the consequences if someone today makes an equally satirical film that criticizes United States foreign policy? <br /> <br /> This movie is hilarious, poignant and tragic. The tragedy is that Chaplin makes an appeal for the madness to end, but it's too late - for him and for us. A must see if you have any interest in history, cinema, politics or satire as an art form.
