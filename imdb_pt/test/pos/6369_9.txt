As a fan of Dan Aykroyd, I watched this movie when it was recently shown in the middle of the night on TV. I was not expecting much, so it was a big surprise that I loved it so much. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that Dan Aykroyd seems to enjoy doing. A chance for him to "swallow" and not take things too seriously. If you loved him in The Blues Brothers or Ghostbusters you'll know what I mean, and you'd be wise to check out The Couch Trip. <br /> <br /> Avid Aykroyd fans will also have fun sighting all the tiny links to their other movies in the script! <br /> <br /> I can not describe this movie without spoiling it for you, so all I can do is tell you to take a look. I can not praise this movie highly enough, and it must certainly be time for a DVD release!
