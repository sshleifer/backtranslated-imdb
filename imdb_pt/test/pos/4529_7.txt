This is the thirteenth Falcon movie. Tom Conway has not lost anything of his humor and style, and is showing no signs of getting tired. The film has a very satisfying story, with many red herrings, suspects and ladies. Madge Meredith is the good girl in the story, she plays it properly, but it does not leave the screen on fire. Myrna Dell is a bad girl, and she puts on an excellent face of stone with agate eyes, and you're just waiting for her to kill as many people as possible to cheer up. Edward Brophy is back as Goldie's partner, but surprise surprised, his over-acting craze has stopped, and he's really under control. This is a handsome tribute to the driving skills of William A. Berke, who had made so many western movies that he probably was not prepared to accept any nonsense from a Brooklyn mannequin. The result is that, for the first time, possibly in his career, Brophy was attenuated enough to add something to a movie, rather than tempt the spectator's patience with the annoying behavior of a retarded, but undisciplined, six-year-old boy. Everything goes very well and it's a lot of fun.
