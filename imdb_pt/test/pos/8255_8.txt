I recently bought this DVD movie at a discount store for $ 5. Although it's a no frills DVD on the Geneon label (just the movie that starts playing immediately - no menu, no special features), image quality and the sound was EXCELLENT. The film is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in history. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan, who I must admit to not having heard, plays the leading role - Pinky Green. A charming young man who spent many years in prison and now wanted to go straight but is not allowed to do it! He portrays an American in England. David Niven plays the bad guy, also with the great charm for which he is famous. Bad, but with scruples like when he refuses to deny Pinky his "blow" for work. Whack, in England, apparently is the fair part of the take and not a bullet in the head like the American gangster movies! The entire support cast does a great job producing a very compelling movie. <br /> <br /> What is perhaps best for me is that the whole movie is quite nice and understandable (I often find myself lost in plot messes and various characters) without any special effects. No blood. No violence. Not even a single car chase! Just a well-written, well-represented, well-directed and well-photographed story! If I had any complaints about the movie, I would question the song. What does bluegrass music do in a bank robbery story that happens in England?
