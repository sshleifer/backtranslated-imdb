I still lived with my parents when they broadcast it on Dutch TV. Normally I was the only one watching movies with the other not caring. But somehow we all sit down and watch this movie. This kind of movie used to be aired on Wednesday night. It is the story of a woman who is going to die soon. But before she dies, she wants to be sure that her (many) children will have the best possible foster parents. So we were watching this and my father (the most emotional of the four of us) started to cry. I followed almost immediately, and soon my sister and mother were swamping. There we were, totally moved by this simple but moving story. If you want a good cry, this is the one for you!
