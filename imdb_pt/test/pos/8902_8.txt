Having been a loyal fan of Asterix throughout my life, I must say that "Asterix and the Vikings" is probably the most well done of all Asterix films. It has some very funny jokes and the animation is superb. As many people have pointed out, it does not really follow the comic book storyline ("Asterix and the Normans"), but in many ways that's good because this book stands out in my mind as one that nudged a lot of fun into the culture of the sixties, and much of it is very old-fashioned today. <br /> <br /> What really stumped me the wrong way, though, is how they incorporated a Disney style plot into the movie that drew much of the focus from Asterix and Obelix. We have a misunderstood boy who does not fit, Justforkix. We have a kid girl that does not fit because she wants to be treated like men, Abba. They meet and fall in love, but their love is threatened because the boy is ashamed to be totally honest with the girl, but in the end their love wins. This has been the plot of so many Disney movies (and, to be fair, other studios as well) which is not funny and the plot was old twenty years ago. I mean, they even gave Justforkix a capricious animal helper. <br /> <br /> I did not just find this derivative and clich√©, but it really hurt the story and left me dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> I think this talks a lot about how superb the rest of the movie was that I still think about it a lot despite the way the plot was kidnapped.
