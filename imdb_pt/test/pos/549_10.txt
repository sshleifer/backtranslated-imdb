I could see "Anywhere But Here" last night as a free preview. I absolutely loved the movie! I was drawn to it because of the realistic portrait of a mother / daughter relationship ... there was definitely a connection between Adele and Ann. I think this speaks volumes about the excellent performance of Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Sarandon was the right actress to portray Adele and after leaving the theater I could not think of another actress in the role. Portman was also excellent as Ann. It brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that I do not think any other teenage actress could. I think the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should give credit where it is due and nominate Sarandon and Portman for Awards in the categories "Actress" and "Supporting Actress." It would be a shame if they were neglected.
