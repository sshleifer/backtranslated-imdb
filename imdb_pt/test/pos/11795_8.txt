Working the night shift at a decaying police station, stumbling into life in an alcoholic mist, it can hardly be said that Detective Mickey Hayden has a firm grasp of reality, but when a bump on the head releases terrifying psychic visions, things get truly strange. Soon he is on the trail of a serial killer and unraveling the mystery of his beautiful first victim, the indescribable Alice. <br /> <br /> The role of a bitter burn-out seems tailor made for Keifer Sutherland and he does the bulk. The typical serial killer material of the plot, but has quirks, twists and genuine surprises to raise it above the usual gender range and even make up for a painfully low budget. (Someone imagines what this movie might have been if there were money for a few more rewrites and a few more takes.) All in all, 'After Alice' is a nice fun for anyone but for fans of Lewis Carroll's "Alice" books, is a real treat. From the perverse reality in which things are rarely what they seem, for obvious references - a killer named 'The Jabberwocky', who leaves letters on the bodies of his victims - there is an 'Alice' reference on each turn. Below is a list of the ones I discovered. Since finding them is half the fun, I identified them as spoilers. <br /> <br /> Mickey - In a way, it's Alice himself wandering through strange landscapes, encountering strange characters, but Harvey, recognizing his true nature, identifies him as the unhappy and awkward White Knight. <br /> <br /> John Hatter (boss of Mickey) - Is he really "crazy"? You're the judge <br /> <br /> Claudette - An African-American transvestite. Obviously, the Black Queen Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen, but her brutal nature suggests, more specifically, the Queen of Hearts. Gideon Wood - Suspected of being the murderer of Jabberwocky, his ambiguous role is more suggestive of a snark (or perhaps a boojum). <br /> <br /> Harvey - His role as unofficial guide to wonderland and his name, evocative of another famous film rabbit, makes me think he must be the white rabbit <br /> <br /> Dr Vera Swann - Your last name and relationship with Mickey suggests the White Queen. <br /> <br /> Other connections <br /> <br /> Mickey's adventures start when he chases a man in white and falls into a (rabbit) hole. <br /> <br /> Mickey says drunk for his cat to stop smiling at him (Cheshire Cat) <br /> <br /> The killer is revealed "through the looking glass." <br /> <br /> The climactic clash ends in a whirlwind of playing cards, just as Alice's adventure did in the book. <br /> <br /> The statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces.
