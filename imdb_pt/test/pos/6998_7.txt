This movie had a bad start. An incredibly tacky monologue is immediately followed by a brilliantly made, truly incredible spaceship accident. Then things fall apart again, when you realize that the survivors are all a) bad actors (besides the docking pilot and the psychopath) and b) almost all of them fit very well in the role of foraging monsters. Hell, half of them do not even speak English, preventing the public from knowing the characters. You feel like you're watching "Deep Blue Sea" meets "Silence of the Lambs", minus the good bits. And unfortunately, the whole thing tries hard to be "Crashed on a Desert Planet with Hannibal Lecter" during the daylight scenes. Vin Diesel is a great actor - but he's not Anthony Hopkins, and he downright abhors the clever hyper-cool psycho. There is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor-but otherwise you could have cut off the first thirty minutes or more ... <br /> <br /> But then things turn around. I can not exactly point the moment, but soon the movie gets a lot better. It also seems less choppy - the scenes really begin to follow with a consistent narrative, and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is a show thief. By the time the first monsters appear, the movie is actually a lot of fun. When night falls, it's fine. Exciting, creepy and exciting. And even the character development of most of the main characters is well done. If you can just sit through the poor bits at the beginning you are in for some great entertainment. <br /> <br /> In addition, the visuals are visually appealing, and I honestly admit: I love the color and tone of this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10 (could have been 9/10, if only ....)
