The film is based on a Jules Verne book that I actually read once, about ten years ago. I remember I really enjoyed the book and this movie does a good job of telling the story. The most important thing in this movie is not the story but the highly original visual look it has. <br /> <br /> The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, and seemingly achieved by a clever combination of cartoons. combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and scenarios that are painted so that they look a lot like an animated movie. Combined with Jules Verne's own original versions of airplanes and submarines and Karel Zeman's good direction results in a very well-made and convincing visual style that can effectively hold attention until the end of the film. Some problems too, one of the underwater scenes at the end takes maybe a long time, for example, as the story in the first part of the movie is quickly rushed. None of this matters much, since the film is always very enjoyable. A gem that deserves to be better known to today's audiences as well. A movie recommended for the whole family.
