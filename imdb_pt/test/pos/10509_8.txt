I do not see why everyone is bombarding this so much. I thought it was a very fun time that unfortunately was not popular enough to be so famous. Believe me I've seen much much worse than that. If you want a bad movie, see a bloodshed or a dead alien or something. So what this is normal slasher fare but better than most. And it's watchable. This movie also has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. Some of the songs are very full of suspense. And the death scenes are cool, too. We see a very bloody body in a bathtub with the words SOLD written in blood on the mirror, and we also get a double beating by a plunger! with razors attached to it! This was a good fun slasher of the 80's that definitely worth your time despite what others say about it.
