I just had to add my comment to increase the average on this. Paul Giamatti puts everything aside and it's a joke. He would probably say it was easy, but he really does a great job and should have earned something for it. We've had the DVD for several years and my kids (boy now four and a half and girl nine) will watch this movie several times, and the mood is adult enough so I do not mind hearing it second flat (and I run to the TV for the really funny parts). Simple moral message, lots of decent acting and clowning, "bad" adults who act silly to take advantage, minimal bad language and minimal jokes in the potty make life difficult for a family pattern.
