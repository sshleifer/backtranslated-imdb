"Snow Queen" is based, of course, on the fairy tale of the same name, assembled in (at least) Andersen's Fairy Tales - and, unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales, this keeps the spirit of Faerie, a realization not easy and not well understood by many, especially among Americans. Talking animals, arbitrary prohibitions, apparitions of goblins, dragons and demons, should not be questioned in a fairy tale; they are as natural an element of Faerie as, say, gravity is in the scientific world, and the reason or explanation for them is completely beyond the point of history. The story is also not limited by the modern rules of Hollywood composition: direct, often to the point of being grotesquely linear in minor works, and obvious (in retrospect, at least). <br /> <br /> With this defense against the common criticism of those who do not understand fairy tales, "Snow Queen" is a delightful film with wonderful visual effects, skillful acting and great feeling. The only flaw in the film was, I think, not that it was too fantastic, but that certain parts of the dialogue were too modern in slang and expressions, a sea about its timeless nature.
