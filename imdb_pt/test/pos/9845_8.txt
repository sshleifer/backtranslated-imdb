This is a typically fast-paced entertainment movie from the early 1930s. When you have James Cagney in the lead, these "pre-Code" movies are even better: just fun things to watch. Usually, when movies are "dated", it is negative, but it is not the case of films from 1930 to 1934. Yes, with slang and attitudes, dress, hairstyles, etc., they are dated, but that's a big part of the fun. These movies have an edge to them that are almost always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> They also have a lightness that is attractive and fascinating. You see people - like the juvenile delinquents portrayed in this movie and their silly parents - that you simply do not see in any period except this (early thirties). At the beginning of this movie, the kids go to the judge and you sit down and just laugh at these crazy characters who appear in court on behalf of their children one after another. Yes, we have the stereotypical Italian emotional father; the Jewish father; the Anglo-Saxon mother and some other mothers who, dramatically, claim to be "a good boy." Even if things are predictable in some cases, you do not care, because everyone here is a lot of fun to see. <br /> <br /> It also teaches that children were punks 75 years ago, robbing, stealing, mugging, lying - hey, that's the human condition. This film unmasks the theory that "people were cooler in the old days." No, people have always been rotten or good. The degree was aided by their environment, parents, financial situation and other things. Here, we have a bunch of "Dead End" kids that end up at Reform School. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous and stupidly liberal plot has children acting immediately like the angels when they run the program at the reform school; not punished at all for causing a man to fall to his death and set fire to the institution (the explanation: he was a wicked one and deserved it. and "Patsy" firing on a guy never having to be questioned by the police because he's the cool guy! Notice the subtle anti-religious dig in which the only man seen praying is the "director" of evil. This is no coincidence, not by chance. That sort of negative association has happened since the Hays Code was canned in the late 1960s and was seen, as you see, in the Pre-Code of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Dudley Diggers, by the way, is excellent in his role of "thug" "Mr. Thomson". I especially his voice was very effective and could imagine him interpreting one of those ill-like papers like head of an institution in an adaptation of Charles Dickens. Cagney played her normal role, the tough guy who catches the cute girl, "Dorothy Griffith," played by Madge Blake. Frankie Darro was also effective as the leader of the boys, "Jimmy Smith." Only the looks on Darro's face made his character believe. Something that he was the true star of the movie, but I still go with Cagney. The rest of the reform school kids were not very believable and were actually ethnic stereotypes, but they were all fun to watch. <br /> <br /> I found the most interesting part of the movie was the first 20 minutes when we saw how bad these kids were and we witnessed good and bad and stereotyped parents in the courtroom after the kids were arrested. These scenes are a thing of the 1930's Dead End Kids. They always showed that kids were bad news at the beginning of the movie, but by the time the story was over, everyone seemed to behave more like Wally and Beaver Cleaver - rude "criminals" . It's very unlikely, but it works, in terms of entertainment. Overall, a ridiculous but very entertaining movie, typical of the Cagney and early 30's films. Almost all of them rate at least eight stars for their entertainment value.
