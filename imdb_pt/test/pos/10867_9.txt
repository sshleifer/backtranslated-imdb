This film gives Daniel Wu the chance to make a great action movie, but I really think Emil Chow's character is really great, brave, but determined to fix his mistakes. Moreover, the main terrorist makes me think of his revolution, makes me wonder if he is doing it for good or ill. <br /> <br /> A movie that tells us about Todd, an amnesiac terrorist being fooled as an infiltrator until he learns who he really is. The consequences he makes of his terrorist family gives him the choice of redemption. <br /> <br /> Purple Storm was one of the best I've seen this year. The film really stands out when it is filled with action scenes tremendously created by Stephen Tung Wai, who won the best action sequences at the Hong Kong Awards. (9/10)
