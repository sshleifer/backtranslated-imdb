I've seen this movie twice, both times on Cinemax. The first time in its unrated version, which is soft-core porn, is the best and the second time in a reduced version (cuts all sex and most nudity) that was fun in a typical kind of beach movie. of way. The unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with Nikki Fritz, a guy and a bottle of oil that is out of this world (no pun intended). Unfortunately, in the trimmed version, the scene is almost completely cut, as are all other sex scenes. Rated or unclassified, it's still fun to watch all the big-star brothers (Stallone, Sheen, Travolta, etc.) trying to act. We also have appearances of B-queen Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward (Robin from the old Batman series).
