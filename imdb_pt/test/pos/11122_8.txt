Fame is one of the best movies I've ever seen about The Performing Arts. The music and acting are excellent. The script and Set Design are also excellent. My favorite part is when all the students start dancing and making music in the canteen. I can see this movie several times and never get bored. I give 8 1/2 out of 10.
