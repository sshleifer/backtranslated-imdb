Too bad the poor reviewer did not like / did not understand this wonderful movie. What a sad life he must lead! <br /> <br /> This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most of what I've seen, but it's not bleak or obscure like the kind of "ordinary people" movie. It's mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy. <br /> <br /> The whole thing looks a bit like a fantasy, maybe Shakespear's "Midsummer Night's Dream". Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting script that does not lose its rhythm. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing you every time this movie runs again on cable. It's like rereading a favorite and valuable book.
