We appreciate this movie that deals entirely with a middle-aged family, so it seems. Ben Travis, (Jeff Daniels) plays the role of a father who is only interested in a son who is excellent at swimming and wins many trophies, however, he hates a lot and even his father. Ben has very little to say to his other son, Tim, (Emile Hirsh) and even his daughter, Penny (Michelle Williams), who is fortunate enough to be in college. The mother, Sandy, (Sigourney Weaver) tries to keep the family together and even she is completely ignored by her husband too. A very tragic event happens in the family that changes the personality of everyone, young and old begin to use drugs, smoke marijuana and drink all the time at parties. There is even a homosexual scene and at the same time there is room for comedy and of course there is a very obscure secret that Sandy Travis finally tells her son Tim.
