This movie will not be considered for an Academy Award, but if you like a movie that you do not take seriously and just want the viewer to enjoy for ninety minutes, it's not a disappointment. You'll enjoy a shipment from Darth Vader to the villain (the vent), a female Batman for heroin (but much cuter with much less fancy), and a joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain who is very funny. It is by no means a great cinematographic achievement. But if you like campy fun it was worth a viewing. God help me, I liked it.
