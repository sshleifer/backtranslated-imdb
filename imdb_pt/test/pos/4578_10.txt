I like money! I stumbled upon this brilliant movie at a local video store last week. I was not sure what to expect. I brought it home, set the player up and then my journey to stupidity began. The first time I watched, I laughed a lot, without laughing too loudly. It was not until the second screening that the movie really began to hold me and the humor was a lot funnier. It reminded me of Austin Powers, first seeing that everything was fine, so the real fun started telling people about it, just talking about each scene and setting. I'm making all my friends watch this movie, everyone I know. This movie may very well be one of the most accurate "Future" films ever made. This movie is more than just 84 minutes of entertainment, it is a warning for the future of our civilization. Mike Judge, the fantastic mind that brought us Office Space brought us a vision of life in the automated future. Luke Wilson's mood as "Average" Joe greatly improved the film. Watch this movie once it's ready, READ MORE! Write More! Think more! For the future, if not for your own!
