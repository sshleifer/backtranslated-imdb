Here's a much lesser known sci-fi from the 50's with a different twist. A son of atomic researchers is kidnapped and maintained by a rescue of the Father's atomic secrets. This is a science fiction thriller tied tightly with great production values ​​and above average performance, even of the child . The Atomic City really does have a movie unlike many other 50's sci-fi films that came out more like an episode of a TV show. <br /> <br /> The Atomic City was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay - how many other 50's sci-fi can promote an Oscar nomination? <br /> <br /> Great pace, tight steering and some superb locations in the 'real' Atomic City of Los Alamos, New Mexico makes this a worth hunt. The collectors print in circulation is an above average transfer and makes a great double feature with the Atomic Man !! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
