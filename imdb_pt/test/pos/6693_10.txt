Life is made up of infinite possibilities; some known, others a mystery and destined to remain so. And what about the vast unknown, the domains beyond which knowledge has no boundaries or established parameters? Who says what exists or what is possible? Valid questions, all raised and explored in the story of an individual's personal journey, a strange and dramatic odyssey that defies facts and logic, in "K-PAX", directed by Iain Softley and starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. . Following an incident at New York's Central Station, a man named Prot (Spacey) is transported to a psychiatric hospital in Manhattan, where he is taken care of by Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges), who tries to discover the truth about his patient , who claims to be from the distant planet K-PAX. It quickly becomes a challenge for Dr. Powell because Prot, with his calm and direct manner and a propensity to produce (he eats bananas and everything, and Red Delicious Apples are his favorite) is quite convincing. But it is Powell's job, as well as his nature, to be skeptical. Prot's claims, however, remain intact and stand up even under the most intense examination and watchful eye of Dr. Powell, who finds himself in a kind of dilemma - Prot tells him the exact date and time when he will depart for K-PAX, a scheduled return trip that allows Powell, but little time to sort it all out. And Powell just can not understand the idea that he's dealing with a real alien being; and it is something he will have to solve quickly, if he will know the truth. And he has to know. Truth, after all, is the only thing that will set you free in your own mind. <br /> <br /> Softley has created and produced a sensitive and thought-provoking film that challenges the viewer by sustaining the mystery. encircling Prot while forcing you to reflect on your own concepts of what is, indeed, possible. And as you never know for sure about Prot until the end, you are able to identify with Powell, seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the riddle along with it. Softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that Prot can only be what he claims to be. And in the context of the reality for which the film is set, it is a fascinating subject to try to envelop your mind. How do you react when all the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we set for ourselves? While at the heart of the film there is a resounding depth of humanity that is evident not only in Prot but also in Dr. Powell. All of this contributes to an extremely engaging and engaging drama. <br /> <br /> As we hope, Kevin Spacey does a brilliant performance as Prot, presenting his character from the inside out, emotionally deep and physically convincing. at the same time. This is a unique individual, and Spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing, which increases the character's credibility and the credibility of the story itself. For this movie to work, it is essential that we believe in who and what Prot is; we do and it happens. Spacey simply pulls it magnificently. It's a memorable performance, from which a character evolves that will stay with you for a long, long time. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges, however, emerges on an equal footing with Spacey, deftly making a very real person from Dr Powell. It's a fairly straightforward role, and the challenge for Bridges was to take this ordinary, ordinary character and make him unique in himself, which, contrary to Prot's character, was no small task. And again, for this movie to work, it was necessary for Bridges to perform. And with exceptional skill and being the consummate professional he is, he succeeds. Bridges infuses Powell with an underlying complexity, and is giving so much in his performance, which makes the interaction between Powell and Prot vibrant and sometimes intense. It is a demonstration of two of the best actors in the company doing what they do best, creating a lively and inspiring dynamic. It's a great job for Bridges, who never tries to steal the spotlight on Prot, which serves to raise the film level to an even higher level. <br /> <br /> The support cast includes Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfie Woodard (Dr. Villers), Ajay Naidu (Dr. Naidiu), Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). An entertaining and emotionally engaging film, "K-PAX" is a dissertation on possibilities, as well as an examination of the ever-evolving complexities of the human condition. It is a film that requires an open mind and rewards those who are able to approach it on their own terms and embrace it. In the end, it makes you realize how K-PAX is real; and makes you enjoy Prot's journey, and how much we all share and have in common with those around us, humans or aliens. And that can make you reflect on your own journey - where you've been and where you're going. And this is the magic of cinema. I rate this a 10/10. <br /> <br />
