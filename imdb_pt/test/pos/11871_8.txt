This movie will never be on a list of the 50 films of all time, but if you're compiling a list of "fun movies," this is not a bad place to start. Liv Tyler is amazing, captivating and delicious, and everyone is right by their parts. It's a 21st-century counterpart to "Tom Jones" - in other words; just good, bawdy fun. I think this may be Tyler's revolutionary film on the way to great stardom. Without nudity, she transmits sex in this movie. No wonder all the boys give him toys. How could they help but do this for a helpless and innocent like Liv's Jewel?
