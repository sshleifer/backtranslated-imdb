It's been a few years since I've seen this movie, so forget most of the details. However, I loved it at the time and found the plot intensely exciting, the heart of the climax stopping. I remember being literally on the verge of my place in the movies in 1979. Jane Fonda plays a Los Angeles reporter, Kimberley, who is facing an accident at a local nuclear power plant. She wants to go public with the story, aided by her hippie cameraman (Michael Douglas) who photographed the event, but a sinister conspiracy tries to cover it all. Jack Lemmon is absolutely wonderful in the role of the conflicting nuclear plant manager, torn between loyalty to his company and "doing the right thing" in reporting the dangerous situation. Your facial expressions talk a lot about it. <br /> <br /> In addition to the captivating plot and tension, this film is about Jack Lemmon, his character and his excellent acting as an actor. As for Jane Fonda (I was a big fan of her at the time), I suspect she's just moved from her anti-war protests to the nuclear industry. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a tactic of nuclear intimidation. Notwithstanding Chernobyl and Three Mile Island (are different types of reactors), our Canadian reactor CANDU is safe and well respected throughout the world. I would not hesitate to reside near the nuclear power plant about an hour's drive away, where my friend works as a competent engineer. Apparently they closed for every little problem, regardless of financial loss. I honestly doubt there are conspiracies out there. You can hardly imagine any highly trained managers or operators willing to risk any kind of collapse or whatever ... it's absolute nonsense. Of course, the moral here is to spare no expense or effort in constructing the facility or in ensuring its continued safety. <br /> <br /> If we want our Western way of life, we have to have our energy somewhere. For those who claim that nuclear power can never be completely safe (it's true, of course), maybe they should volunteer as coal miners or return to horseback and buggy days before electricity. <br /> <br /> Please enjoy this fun and highly suspenseful movie, which is apparently based (freely? embellished?) on a true story. It's a real cooler, a suspense and maybe (?) Even a killer, but please do not have your attitudes about the operation and safety of nuclear power plants from it.
