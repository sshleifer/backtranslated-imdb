With unlimited brute energy and uncompromising vision, Talk Radio brilliantly explores the public's taste for reducing the private problems of strangers to entertainment over the radio. <br /> <br /> Eric Bogosian is sensational as Barry Champlaine, a coarse his talk radio host. It's natural for this kind of role, and it tunes one of the most impressive and interesting radio personalities I've ever seen on screen. The timing and delivery of his insults to his various interlocutors are traits of genius. <br /> Alec Baldwin also shines as Barry's boss. He demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that Glengarry Glen Ross would later exhibit in 1992. But the supporting role that really stands out is the stunned teenager, apparently brain dead, played by Michael Wincott. You have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson do a great job with photography, which is almost entirely confined to a single broadcast room. The claustrophobic feel of the film perfectly reflects his tone. After all, one of the main points of the film is to explore the private moments of people to attract audiences. Stone demonstrates that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is a movie with a strong emotional and cerebral impact - things that are seldom seen today.
