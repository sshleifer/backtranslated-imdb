I've never posted anything here before, but after watching Noroi I felt I had to write my thoughts about it. <br /> <br /> First of all, do not compare this with Blair Witch, this movie deserves much more than that! Put simply, Noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot!). <br /> <br /> I really liked how the film presents itself not as a standard horror movie. , but as a documentary filmed by a reporter (I think?) called Kobayashi and his cameraman. Without worrying too much about the plot, I can say that it starts with Kobayashi doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events, which ends up being linked to something much more gloomy and sinister. <br /> <br /> The story may not be so original in itself, what really tainted me in Noroi was the incredibly sinister atmosphere. If you're looking for cheap scare and seat jumping scenes, this movie may not be for you. This movie is all about the mood it presents, with haunted images and a general sense of suspense omen. The style of documentary footage only makes it more believable. <br /> <br /> This is also greatly aided by acting, which is superb, although not perfect for the general part of the movie! Much better than most other movies in this kind of genre. <br /> <br /> Well, I recommend Noroi to everyone, it's suspenseful, scary, well-represented and the first movie that scared me. in times.
