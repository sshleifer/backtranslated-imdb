Watching Foreigner More than the director of Fiction, Marc Forster, The Kite Runner is the cinematic equivalent of eating your vegetables, because this epic of art rated PG-13 is good for your movie diet. No, this is not the kind of movie I like to put on the couch and the eye at the end of a difficult day. The Kite Runner is not your typical conventional movie designed to entertain you and make you forget your troubles. First, no celebrity star appears on it. Second, nothing is cut and dry, black or white, or so strange that you do not believe in an image you see. Third, The Kite Runner enters captions when characters occasionally speak in their native language. Fourth, Forster's movie is not a romantic tidbit about boy-girl-girl, girl-boy-girl, and then boy-girl-girl-back. Fifth, this foreign language film can make you feel uncomfortable and challenge your assumptions about life, friendship, and survival. The main themes here are cowardice and redemption. The protagonist commits a cowardly offense in the first half of the action he must atone at the cost of his own safety and personal integrity. Right, The Kite Hunt is about redeeming yourself for the sins of the past. We're talking about personal responsibility, so do not rent or buy this wonderful movie for a nightly party of guys or something to take away the bad taste of your system day. Based on Khaled Hosseini's best-selling novel, this culturally enlightened melodrama about right and down initially looks like one of those laid-back friendship films about teenagers in the vein of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Sandlot. About half an hour in its 127 minutes, this escapade of two young people who fly parrots in Afghanistan becomes somber and unpleasant. However, if you can deal with the remaining hour of the plot, you will leave satisfied, relieved, and perhaps even entertained. The Kite Runner opens in San Francisco in 2000 as our protagonist, Afghan emigre Amir Jan (Khalid Abdalla of United 93) and his wife Soraya (Atossa Leoni of Florist) receive two boxes of publications copies of Amir's first novel. As soon as Amir has had the chance to enjoy his triumph of a life as a storyteller, the phone awakens him from his reverie and is drawn reluctantly into a past that is best left forgotten by him. Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub of The Nativity Story) calls Amir from Pakistan to make a request. Rahim was a servant at Amir's house in the 1970s, when Amir lived with his wealthy commercial father Pashtun Baba (Homayoun Ershadi from A Cherry Taste) in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion. "You have one more chance to be good," Rahim informs Amir without sucking his request. Basically, Rahim wants Amir to fly to Pakistan and enter Afghanistan and rescue Rahim's grandson, Sohrab (Ali Dane Bakhty Ari), who is being held as a sexual prisoner against his will as a sex slave to Assef (newcomer Abdul Salam Yusoufzai). ruthless chief of the Taliban and Amir's feared adversary. <br /> <br /> The Kite Runner moved from San Francisco in 2000 to an extensive flashback in Kabul in 1978, when life was idyllic. Twelve-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) and the son of his father's servant Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada) love watching movies like John Sturges' magnificent Magnificent Seven when they are not pitching kites. By the way, this is flying kite like you've never seen paper kite. Not only do children fly, but they also compete with other children to see who can cut the ropes of another child's kite. The flying kite fight scenes generate the same kind of excitement that dog fighting scenes had in Tony Scott's Top Gun. Hassan is Amir's best friend, but unlike Amir, Hassan belongs to the Hazara minority. Earlier, young Amir and Hassan had a confrontation with young Assef (Elham Ehsas) and his two footmen. Assef was about to beat them, but Hassan pulled his sling and threatened to use it on Assef. Assef had no choice but to retreat. Meanwhile, Amir was prepared to suffer the fate of the hand that had dealt with him. Amir's father, Baba, regrets his son's lack of spine and fears that he will grow half a man because he is a coward, unlike the brave little Hassan who takes Amir out of impatience. Anyway, Amir and Hassan emerge from the confrontation with Assef without a scratch. Later, after Amir set a new record with his flying and flying skills, Hassan chases after a kite to claim it. Hassan is the eponymous character mentioned in the title. Hassan claims the fallen kite, but he is at the mercy of Assef and his two minions. Assef lets Hassan stay with the kite, but his minions trap Hassan, belly down in an alley while Assef sodomizes the youth. Worse, a traumatized Amir watches the nearby attack, but does not have the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend, who would have intervened for him. <br /> <br /> In addition to the extraordinary aerial scenes with kites, The Kite Runner is simple and straightforward. When Amir returns to Afghanistan to rescue Sohrab, he disguises himself as a Taliban fighter but does not carry a gun. The ransom scene at The Kite Runner is like the escape scene from The Midnight Express. While Forster does not explore local politics or immerses us in the ethnic and cultural issues at play here. In fact, Troy's apprentice David Benioff has had to eliminate some parts of the book and racial and ethnic prejudices are not clearly delineated, so you have to accept some things in faith. Forster filmed the film almost all over China to give it an authentic look. Forster deserves credit for making this two-hour epic more fascinating. The performances, especially for children, stand out for their credibility. Kite Runner is a movie that you will not easily forget.
