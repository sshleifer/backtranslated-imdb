Yes, it's not a great cinematic achievement, but Toy Soldiers is a fun and entertaining movie. The young cast does a great job with dramatic and comic aspects of the story, and I particularly liked Shawn Phelan as Derek / "Yogurt". I've seen this several times over the years, and you'll probably see several more. Just do not think too much and you'll love it - have fun!
