This film focused on a young woman who prays to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life. This made me think of other films as "Song of Bernadette" and "Francis of Assisi" and has a very strong influence of the Catholic faith in the film. Ann Blyth is very charming first of all, the student of the Catholic school and then as a young woman who buys a statue of St. Anne (which is the name of the street where I live, by the way) and makes many prayers for the saints. intercession whenever problems arise in your life. Frances Bavier (Aunt Bea from Andy Griffith's show) and Edmund Gwenn (from Miracle on 34th Street) play her relatives. A local priest of mine used to say that my sister looked like Ann Blyth and they both had the same names in the first and middle. A good family movie that came from a time when life was a little simpler.
