I am making a thesis about blurring the boundaries: the female cross dresser and I am using Tipping the Velvet the book as my main text, any comments on gender and gender identity, gender and sexual confusion, gender as performance, gender as fiction, gender, cross-dressing as an erotic fantasy and as revolution, the effect of male costume etc etc would be greatly appreciated! But a little out of the way did anyone see the 1987 film by Sergio Toledo, Vera? It's about a young transsexual lesbian, possibly transsexual ... I'm dying to see her because I think it would be really useful ... Anyone know where I can get a copy of her? I tried amazon and some other sites, but no luck ...
