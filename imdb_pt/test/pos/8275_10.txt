WOLF IN A FEW WORDS: Dave Seville, father and manager of the Chipmunk brothers Alvin, Simon & Theodore, went to Europe on a business trip, leaving the boys at home with Ms. Miller as an observer, to Alvin's disgust. , who wanted to go to Europe. While playing against her female counterpart, Brittany, Chipettes' leader, made up of her younger sisters Jeanette (Simon's female counterpart) and Eleanor (the female counterpart of Theodore) in a fierce arcade game from Around the World in 30 days, They catch the attention of two evil brothers abroad who need to smuggle money and diamonds around the world, but they need a way to do it that does not attract the attention of their archenemy, Jamal. The two evil brothers, Claudia and Klaus, listen to the pranks between Alvin and Brittany and decide to use them as delivery boys and girls for their looting (more Claudia's idea than Klaus's, the first initially thinking it's too dangerous for children). The two brothers make an offer for the boys and girls - they travel via balloons up to 12 points to leave dolls (which resemble children) that contain diamonds and / or money to indicate their arrival, with the promise that whoever wins the race will have an obscene amount of money. But as the two different groups of talkative animals make their rounds, they are pursued by Jamal's henchmen - but who is Jamal? Is he friend or foe? <br /> <br /> GENERAL: Fun and cheerful farce based on the 1980 version of Alvin & the Chipmunks TV series. Beautiful animation is a standout, does not have the rude humor that keeps creeping in today's family movies and in the surrounding songs (Boys & Girls of Rock & Roll being a highlight). Eagle fans will probably realize that Brittany's character design has been modified from the animated series, giving her a less rounded face while adding a seemingly permanent blush to the cheeks (which Jeanette and Eleanor also exhibit). <br /> <br /> One ear out for Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson.
