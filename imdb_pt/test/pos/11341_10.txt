Beautiful, emotional and subtle. I see this movie in an art center with a smaller screen in a movie theater with 95% of seniors. I wish that bigger movie theater like Lowes around here would show that. Great cinematography by Wong and Christopher Doyle. Since I understand Cantonese, it is much easier for me to understand the film. No matter how simple the story is, many English-speaking viewers do not understand the whole story. Three ladies next to me continue barking and have no clues about the movie. <br /> <br /> Spoiler; They were surprised when I mentioned that Mr. Chow slept with Mrs. Chen and they have a child. She went to Singapore trying to tell him, but she did not. <br /> <br /> The Mandarin translation of the movie title actually means flowery as a moment or memory. The phrase usually used to describe the beautiful and wonderful memory that was inpermanance and short. The whole movie fits the title. Not to mention the flowery "Cheung Sam". <br /> <br /> My favorite scene was definitely the corner of the street in the alley. It looks so beautiful, the sun shining on the faded old wall, at night in the dark, in the rain, truly a poetic moment. I felt a strong sense of intimacy with their relationship, seeing them standing against the wall and talking in a low voice. I felt terrible pain when Mr. Chow was rehearsing his moment of departure, and Mrs. Chen wept on her shoulder .... Bravo Wong Kar-Wai! <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoy this, Chungking Express still top my favorite. However, I'll give this a 10 as well. As a point of reference, the CTHD only has 7. <br /> <br /> If you like art, you will love this movie. Do not miss it.
