This is my favorite movie of all time. And I always think of it as John Huston's requiem. <br /> <br /> I must have seen at least 20 times and never get bored of it. The weather, the script, the singing, the dinner, is like being invited to someone's house and watching the events and not being able to participate even if you want ... It's a rare treasure, this movie and I can not write enough praise him. <br /> <br /> He's incredibly well, with a few faces from the Abbey Theater and also the wonderful tenor voice of Frank Patterson. Lady Gregory's poem recited in the film is one of the most moving poems ever written. The scene of Anjelica coming down the stairs while listening to the music is one of the best performances that one sees in the cinema. I cry every time I see this ... for all the right reasons. <br /> <br /> We've all had lost love at an early age and we've cried for our hopeful young people. <br /> <br /> Donald McCann has acted in very few movies to my liking, he simply loved the stage work and clung to it, and it is our loss that we no longer have his performances in the movies, since he does so much with this delicate role by expression and The portrait of a deep love for his wife that will never be reciprocated and he transmits such inner sorrow to know it. <br /> <br /> If you want your movie action and packed plot to avoid this, there really is no beginning, middle or end just with a lens on the characters at a dinner in Dublin 80 years ago and all the little nuances and nuances of the personalities portrayed so beautifully. <br /> Bravo to everyone who was involved in this production. 10 out of 10.
