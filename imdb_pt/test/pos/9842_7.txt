This is one of those social dramas that WB knew how to set up and which guaranteed blockbusters in the thirties. These first "dead boys" are sent to a reform school where they are mistreated. Cagney, a gangster as part of an agreement is appointed as the school commissioner. He does not take it seriously at first, but he changes and makes the changes necessary to improve the boys' lives. The idea is to let the boys rule and run their community. If this is a good social reform it is beyond my belief, but it is a movie. It's a lot like Boys Town with a slightly darker tone. A useless happy ending eliminates the impact of the scene before, but it's still good. WB later would do those same films with Bogart in the role of Cagney / father.
