This was the only film to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played this movie as an extra on the wedding scene of Justin and Madeline, and my uncle was an extra on horseback. The script was genuine and accurate. The costumes were done with good taste, the sequence was in order and even the accents were good. I really love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American history, and I love movies about it. I've seen many, and this movie and its sequential North and South Book 2 took the cake. If you have not yet, rent it. As early as possible. It's quite an education.
