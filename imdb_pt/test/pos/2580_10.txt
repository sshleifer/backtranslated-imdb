If ever a potential movie must have sounded as if it did not work based on reading the script on paper, it would be this. Here we have what looks like a sneaky, sarcastic movie with the huge movie poster, showing a Christina Ricci almost nude chained to none other than Mr. Bad Ass MF himself, Samuel Jackson. But let me tell you, if a movie comes to life in great celluloid moment with soul power to spare, it's Craig Brewer's redeeming follow-up to Hustle & Flow, Black Snake Moan. Without shame. the top of the scene, this movie sucks you through the opening scenes and continues to dig deeper and deeper with each subsequent frame. It is the basic story of two deeply destroyed characters who find in each other the strength and courage to move forward in a more positive way with their lives. It's been done before, of course, in this story, but, as I've always said, it's the way a story is told that gives it heart, depth, meaning and power. <br /> <br /> Ricci is spoiled Rae and Jackson's wild child, Lazarus's equally muscular character, meets each other in desperate circumstances, and Laz takes the initiative to try to help Rae. This in itself is relatively unique: the idea of ​​a man genuinely trying to help a woman who is suffering rather than trying to take more advantage of her, and we know from the beginning that Laz's heart, and the heart of the film, is in the right place. The film at its core is about the healing and redemptive power of love (with music as a very close second), and the film resonates deeply with this truth - soulfully, artistically and brilliantly. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons the film is so successful because of the fierce and compromised performances of Ricci and Jackson. Scenes that would be ridiculous and pathetic in the hands of smaller artists are, on the contrary, powerful as all outputs. In particular, the film's arc scene in which Jackson sings and plays the title song alone at his house with Ricci in the midst of a serious storm and the predatory demons of Rae's past going mad inside his head, to crawl to Lazarus and cling to his leg, is not ridiculous as it should be technically, but rather as cathartic. <br /> <br /> All supporting performances are fantastic here as well. Justin Timberlake is completely believable as Rae's anxious boyfriend Ronnie and the always wonderful S. Epatha Merkerson is also perfectly chosen as a character who obviously has feelings for Lazarus. John Cothran Jr. is also excellent, as the Reverend friend of Laz, R.L. (a nod to blues musician R. L. Burnside, no doubt). Everything works on this movie, let's face it, including the music / soundtrack, which features Burnside, Scott Bomar, Bobby Rush, Son House and, most importantly, Jackson himself, whose fantastic version of Stackolee I'm listening to while writing this review . . There is also a very pretty and moving version of "This Little Light of Mine", presented in the film, sung in a tempting and gentle way by Ricci. <br /> <br /> Samuel Jackson said in recent interviews that he believes his performance in this movie is the best of his career so far; I could not agree more with him. This is a work from which he can be proud, along with all involved in this audacious, supremely wise and deeply sincere mother of a project.
