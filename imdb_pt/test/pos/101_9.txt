This is a very, very weird movie ... one that is so weird that you'd better see for yourself. The film begins with a weary teacher discussing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as unbelievably brilliant as him! You can quickly say that this man is a total cynic - finding value in practically nothing but clinging to your own inner sense of personal importance. In addition, he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life. <br /> <br /> Later in the movie, he goes into a bank robbery and manages to so irritate the thieves that one of them shoots him in the head. Strangely, this is only half way through the movie and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life. It's when the movie becomes exciting because the style of narration is like one of this literature teacher's novels - one that is cleverly written and says things the way we wish we could say them. <br /> <br /> Watch this weird movie - it's unbelievably attractive and unlike anything I've ever seen before.
