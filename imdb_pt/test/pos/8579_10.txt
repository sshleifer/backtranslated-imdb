This is a great movie. When two people of different backgrounds and social status think they have nothing to offer each other and in the end, what each one needs is a testimony of what the heart knows. Sometimes we wonder why a man is with a woman or vice versa and external appearances say one thing in our eyes, but what they offer each other from within that we can not see is incredible and inexplicable. When Nimi thought that Matthew had nothing to offer her and when Matthew was only looking for a case (because he had an open marriage with his wife Jenny), in the end they realized that they could not and did not want to exist without others. It was worth it for them to resist what family and friends thought and what society said was right to be with each other. This movie kind of restores my faith in love.
