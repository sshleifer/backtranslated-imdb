I do not think I've ever seen a better movie spoof. Mel Brooks is insane. Every time I watch, I find something new and this makes it even funnier than the previous time. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. There's a great, unexpected ending that drives you crazy. Each character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way and I never tire of it. Watch it! <br /> <br /> If you liked Cary Elwes in this movie, you should definitely see The Princess Bride.
