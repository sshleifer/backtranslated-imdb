I saw Riverdance - The New Show and I loved it from the first moment! It's an energetic tribute to Irish dance, filled with dance, music and brilliant choreography! The protagonists, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne, captivated me with their exquisite dance! May they always keep on shining and keep on dancing. Their chemistry on stage was incredible, and the union between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favorite, and probably always will be. Long live the Riverdance!
