This movie is a coveted member of my movie library. Although not a mainstream movie, it is, in my opinion, a highly effective noir film in which Eric Roberts is totally underestimated as an actor. (I qualify him as a far better actor than his sister, Julia, who is overrated, but that's another comment ...) Roberts plays the former reporter with the perfect blend of narrative accuracy and tired idealism: two ingredients that make part of any effective noir film. Roberts' first-person narration enhances the quality of the film, and makes us guess the true motive behind the crime. <br /> <br /> In Palm Springs, everything about the setting of the movie moves slowly like a movie. metaphor for the theme of oppression: Asch (Roberts) is overwhelmed by his past; the police are oppressed by the wealthy Palm Springs residents who treat them as servants; the rich, meanwhile, are overwhelmed by boredom (see Johnny Depp's classic performance as the rich insightful kid who just wants to be loved ...); the isolation of each character is ubiquitous and is further enhanced by the heat and seclusion of the desert. <br /> <br /> There is an audience for this movie if they are looking for a more contemporary version of film noir. While there are elements of the film that might have been more accurate, I recommend that you copy the movie and place it between Big Sleep and Chinatown in your movie library. (The movie is based on the book by Arthur Lyons, CASTLES BURNING, and if you like Roberts acting in this, you may want to have a copy of The Ambulance, in which he shows his funniest and lightest side.) FILM: "Watch out? I should have asked.All fools ignore the strange warnings of the ladies in the trailers. "
