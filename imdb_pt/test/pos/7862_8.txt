It took me years to finally get this gem and it was worth the wait. In almost all his films, Clint always plays the hero. Be a hero, anti-hero or avenging hero. In this movie he is a villain and plays well. As a wounded unionized soldier, he is taken to a confederate girls' school by students and teachers to heal. Soon after he begins to seduce women, no matter how old they are, and some are quite young. He also plays with his jealousy and puts them against each other. In the end, you're never so happy to see Clint die a terrible death. <br /> <br /> That's what makes this movie a jewel. Clint never did any other movie like this and after watching this movie, you wish he had. He plays the role of the villain so well that it will make you wonder why he has never made movies like that. It also explains why the film is not seen very often. Most people do not want to see Clint as the villain and with Dirty Harry being released shortly after this movie, it has become a hidden gem. If you are a fan of Clint Eastwood, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. You may not like what you see, but soon you will not forget it.
