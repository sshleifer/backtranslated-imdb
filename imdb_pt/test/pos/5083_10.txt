I saw the movie yesterday and was shocked by it, but even more shocked by some of the reviews I read here. One person wrote that it was ambiguous if the victim of the torture was guilty or not - so ... One person wrote that since he was not an American citizen, so ... Some people comment that people in the Middle East hate us and us they want dead, so ... So we're saying then that it's right to torture someone who's guilty of a crime? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who is not an American citizen? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who can hate us and wants us dead? We are saying that, as written in the Geneva Convention, the Declaration of Human Rights and the Constitution of the United States, "torture is wrong, but some torture is less wrong than others?" When does it become "right" to torture? That's why this movie is powerful - it's ambiguous, but not about torture. Torture is always wrong, and if we are willing to do so, even in the name of justice and "National Security" or "freedom and democracy," we will be wrong and we will be evil; we are doing exactly what we are accusing our enemies of doing (and we are calling them "wrong" at the same time). My favorite line in the movie was "if you do not want to commit to Amnesty International." In front.
