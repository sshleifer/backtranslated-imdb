I really refused to see this movie. I refused to go to school and I refused to go with my parents. Just looking at the trailer seemed stupid to me anyway. One of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me two options, "The Dukes of Hazzard" or "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Rabbit." It took me 17 minutes to decide. Time was running out. I had to choose. It appeared on the "Few" screen as in some other tickets. By the time we had to line up and get our ticket, only one of us could get in. I desperately wanted Nicholas to come in to see him. But he forced me. I crossed my arms and I was very grumpy and disappointed to see that childishness. I walked in, sat in the only seat that was available and prepared for the movie! I must say I was very surprised that I sat through that WORK HAND! It was fantastic. I do not know what I was complaining about. Clay Animation was by far the best I've ever seen in my life. The story was brilliant. About a rabbit interrupting and breaking a carnival planned more than 500 years ago. Basically, the Anti-Pest Control is protecting the people who are competing in the Plant Competition. Anti Pesto known as Wallace and Gromit (who are in charge of this business) try to keep all the rabbits away from the vegetable carnival. I will not say more. It's too good to say. I admit that the whole idea of ​​a Rabbit-Were is unbelievable and childish, but Nick Park adds substance to it, which makes everyone love it. I mean, there's not going to be a 10-foot rabbit on the loose and there definitely will not be 8-foot werewolves as told in "Dog Soldiers." Then again, Were-Rabbits and WereWolves are not real creatures. But anyway, it worked very well. <br /> <br /> The jokes were also bigger. Kids will not get some of the jokes. It goes well above their heads. There were a lot of British jokes there. If you love British humor, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> I also loved the cast and the voices. Everything about the movie is incredibly well done. The direction and pace was absolutely ... FANTASTIC! I recommend this to fans of old shorts Wallace And Gromit (And no, I have not seen them yet), and I recommend to fans who liked "Shrek" and "Shrek 2 and most importantly, I recommend to people who love Clay Animation, a good movie!
