Maybe I was just in a good mood when I watched this movie. but for whatever reason, I really enjoyed this movie. Was it terribly original? No. Was it a little predictable? Yes. And then what? It was still a really cool movie. I always liked Bruce Willis (well, almost always, there was Hudson Hawk and The Fifth Element, after all), and he portrayed a perfectly selfish and sarcastic fool. Maybe this movie is not Academy material, but it sure is good stuff. Go and rent it.
