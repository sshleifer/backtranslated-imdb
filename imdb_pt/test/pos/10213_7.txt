I've seen it years ago, and it's fun, but not deep. The basic story is of a young man who dreams of Midian, though he is not sure where he is or even really exists. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Follow: He finally visits her, is turned into a Nightbreed creature by being bitten by another. So he has to help the other Nightbreed members because they are being attacked by Canadians. (Keep for the accent, they all act like Good Ol 'Boys.) Not much in tune with the Canadian psyche, huh?) Someone noted for "monsters" or "Nightbreed", to replace "Jews", and for Canadians / humans, substitute, "Nazis," and you should have a vision of the monsters' fight against humans. Well, maybe. One major objection I had was that although the underground city was interesting, it was quite disorganized and, frankly, dirty. This should be a convention for films with clandestine settlements. One might think that if monsters were the good guys, some would have at least a little sense of decoration. <br /> <br /> The plot is a little thin, but this is to introduce characters. But it's fun enough for a repeat view.
