When I bought this movie for the first time, I had my doubts about it, although the cast was quite impressive. But after seeing this, I do not really regret spending the money. In fact, I'd love to spend it over and over again and again in movies like this ... An absurd combination of humor, drama, emotion, and the big issues. That's exactly what makes it a great movie. Ok, some may not like what they see, and some may even turn it off after a while. your lost. It has a wonderful way of dealing with the problems that we all go through in one form or another, and the characters that you think will not like the company throughout the movie, end up being the ones that you really know love after a short time . For anyone with an open mind and a sense of humor and life - watch this movie, I promise you will not be disappointed!
