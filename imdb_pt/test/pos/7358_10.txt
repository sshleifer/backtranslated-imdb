It may not have had the big budgets, celebrities or endorsements of Scream, Urban Legend or I Know What You Did last summer, but Campfire Tales had one thing missing from those three films: the real horror. <br /> <br /> This film approached the theme of urban legends a year before the appropriately titled and less captivating Urban Legend did. It was intriguing, masterfully scripted and logical in a way that I know what you did last summer could only dream. Finally, she kept her focus and ended with a flurry, while Scream failed and died. <br /> <br /> What is most exciting about the film is the variety of horror that writers and directors have achieved. The general story of teenagers around a campfire was a classic fear of the unknown (but certainly expected) fate awaiting them in the woods, but the tales themselves are where the film really shone. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is pure and fast urban myth. It's based on a popular legend, and the director talks about it with the style and pace of the action, making it more captivating because we know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> The first tale of the bonfire is a direct movie. thriller forward. Based on another popular myth, we do not realize this until the end, both because it blends as well into the story as because the action holds our attention. Being the thriller of the trilogy, it throws away our fear of the unknown and includes several well-made "jump" sequences that do not look as cheap or contrite as movies like Scream or Urban Legend. <br /> <br /> The second tale is more suspenseful. This time, though the characters still do not know what's going on, we do, and that provides the horror. No need for cheap thrills here. <br /> <br /> The final tale contains elements of the supernatural and uses a chilling / trippy atmosphere to scare the viewer. Because we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation, our fear comes from their intensity and from what they can not explain. This is the true ghost story of the trio. <br /> <br /> I did not expect to enjoy Campfire Tales when I rented it. I figured, if I did not like their most acclaimed counterparts, with larger budgets, how could I like it? <br /> <br /> The truth is, however, this movie is successful where others have fallen far short of the mark. .
