I was not sure what to expect from CAIXA. I'm a big fan of Darko, but I also saw the mess that became Southland Tales, whether or not it was a studio failure, who knows. With the box I was pleasantly surprised. It was a throwback to the classic science fiction paranoia films that suggest much more tortuous events, but centered on a base of intimate characters. <br /> <br /> Slow construction and creepy tension were very effective for tone and theme. of the entire film. Any change in this rhythm would lead to the typical Hollywood style or "MTV," which simply would not have served the purpose of the story correctly. Everything from the odd visual and acting accessories scattered all the way down to the low-cost soundtrack to the slightest explanation of exactly what was happening added a whole thread of underlying dread and the feeling of hope shrunk to our greedy, though well. meaning, main characters. This was something well thought out and put into action by Richard Kelly from the first act to the end. The tale of Richard Matheson on which this was based, not the Twilight Zone episode, which was another version of the story, was of morality and greed, which were still the core elements of CAIXA. Being only about 8 pgs in length, expanding it into a feature with substance would not have been easy task, but it was done with style, originality and leaves the viewer with lingering thoughts about the movie. Many have and will compare this to DARKO for being so profound or not, but I thought it was a completely different movie, both thematically and emotionally. Your tone is completely different, as are the messages and intentions of this film. Where Darko has left us with internal questions, THE BOX leaves the viewer with more external questions, involving the world around us. Just as, knowing human nature, would the BOX test come to an end? Decent acting, great chilling looks and impending atmosphere all contribute to the slow shiver. It is not for everyone, but for those who come from where it comes, it is a delight.
