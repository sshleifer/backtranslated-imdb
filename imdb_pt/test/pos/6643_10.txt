Shame is quite unique as a war movie (or rather, the anti-war film), in that it focuses not only on the soldiers or the politics involved (there is politics, but not how you would think it would be shown). , he deals with his two main themes as the only two beings with whom one can possibly care for in this brutal and decadent society they inhabit. Ingmar Bergman, in the middle of his prime, and following two other highly psychological films, Persona and Lobo Hour, is much more interested in seeing the effect of the war on the generally civilized beings, which brings the worst of them and also in a way cathartic is a reminder of what is really crucial in life. His two main actors are frequent collaborators and friends Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman (as the Rosenberg, curiously), who are musicians living on a farm on an island (not unlike Wolf when one thinks about it). <br /> They watch the tanks pass, and a couple of old friends are already wearing out, but they try not to take it too seriously; there's a sweet scene where the couple just talks frankly but with their hearts (everything that is repeated throughout the film is perhaps creating a sense of being provoked) ... Then comes the problem, including a fake propaganda film and the terror involved with a "friend" in the army (one of Gunnar Bjornstrand's more subtle works with Bergman). Needless to say, this is not one of the easiest films to pass in terms of Bergman's filmography, however, for some, it may be one of his most accessible jobs. His religious themes this time are kept very discreet even when the idea of ​​maintaining a kind of faith pervades the atmosphere of the film. When there is a war action, it is filmed in unconventional and fast ways (via great friend Sven Nykvist). <br /> <br /> And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eve is successfully matched against the backdrop of a chaotic type of war. -ground where the lines are never very drawn. In a way, this film, filmed at the height of the worst moments in Vietnam, is even more relevant today; I could not help but see chilling, uncompromising coincidences between Iraq and elsewhere with some of Jan and Eva's scenes with the fighters or the "perpetrators." The last scene, by the way, is one of the best of Bergman, everywhere (acting, direction, lighting). It's not the kind of wartime picture (or, again, anti-war, I find little of John Wayne's spirit in this production of Svensk) that I would soon recommend to my friends all in Saving Private Ryan - he has a little more in kinship with Paths of Glory, looking at the effects of the hypocrisy of war. But in fact, like any of Bergman's genre films, he is the only one, however, that makes a bang for the art house audience.
