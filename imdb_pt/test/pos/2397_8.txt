I was very impressed with what Eddie Monroe was able to accomplish in regards to its overall effect on me. I say this because I know this independent film had limited budget / resources, but despite that, it's a compelling and well-crafted work. <br /> <br /> Nice from beginning to end, with several relatively unknown. actors that I can not help but believe will make a big fuss in the industry for years to come, Eddie Monroe did not fail to keep my interest involved and my emotional meter dancing. It's a well scripted story with an amazing ending, despite my effort not to be caught off guard. <br /> <br /> Many of the cast names listed for this movie are names to watch in the future. Someone told me that Paul Regina recently passed, and if that's true, it's a real tragedy, since his Stoic performance in Eddie Monroe is remarkable. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Fred Carpenter who actually got a winner with that!
