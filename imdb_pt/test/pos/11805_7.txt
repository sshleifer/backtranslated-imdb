A tale of a young boy, Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) with AIDS who befriends a rough boy (played by Brad Renfro) his exact opposite, The Cure is sad, if a little too soapy, pulls his film "message" from emotions with the heart in the right place. Just for that fact, it is a recommended view. The highlight may be just watching them find friendship and going out with each other when no one else accepts them. <br /> <br /> However, since the real story focuses on the boy's AIDS - things happen when one day at the local grocery store, Dexter's eye picks up a tabloid magazine that states that a New Orleans doctor discovered the cure. Both, obviously a little naive, make a plan to leave for New Orleans in any possible way. Which half pulled me in two ways. It's a warm warming heart and I hate choosing nit, but I found the plot wanders in a melodramatic and predictable sense and the process has a layer of brightness on them, as only movies can do. I could not escape the notion that I was watching a movie about self-discovery, disease, and growth. For example, I know they are young, but I find it a real task to believe in the things these kids do. Like boiling tree leaves and drinking the hot "tea" or eating an experimental diet of chocolate bars because they believe it will combat the devastating disease. To say nothing of them making a trip across the country as they do without legal repercussions or downright scary. Still suspicious aside, the film conventions you expect, is a story worth seeing particularly with the family.
