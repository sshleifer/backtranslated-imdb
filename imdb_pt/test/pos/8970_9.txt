Here is a movie that almost does everything right, with good performances by all, and three strong performances by Hanks, Seymour Hoffman, and a good appearance by Julia Roberts that has charmed me since the first seconds, are performances that raise production to the stars and keeps it there all the time. <br /> <br /> In addition to one or two very small factual problems with the script, the only thing that leaves this film aside is the technical direction, there are many bad cuts (fake continuity) and several camera "cheats" which simply do not work. This is surprising for a film of this stature, and is a bit annoying to watch, but it does not destroy an otherwise beautifully crafted film.
