FIVE STAR FINAL was one of the best films of the early 1930s. It was starring Edward G. Robinson and it was a very brave story about a dirty newspaper and its willingness to do anything ... ANYTHING to sell newspapers. In particular, an old story of an innocent woman is stamped on the pages and helps destroy her now happy life - many years after she was inadvertently involved in a scandal. The reason I loved both the film was that it was adamant and did not punch - showing how low the editors can be to sell papers. <br /> <br /> Here in TWO AGAINST THE WORLD, it's a remake. of FIVE STAR FINAL - with some changes. Instead of Robinson, this movie stars Humphrey Bogart and he is the head of programming on a radio station, not in a newspaper. Otherwise, the story is essentially the same - except it is a little less daring and lacks some of the original's courage and sensationalism. This is not to say that the film is bad - it just does not have as good an impact as the first movie. In other words, if you need to see one of these movies, see the first one - although this movie is quite powerful and enjoyable as well. As for me, I loved the story so much, I saw the two films and enjoyed both. <br /> <br /> TWO AGAINST THE WORLD begins with the UBC radio owner complaining to his programming chief (Bogart) that the whole "high forehead" shows that he is put on a low audience. The owner requires a lot of dirt to get more listeners. One way they are arguing is to do a multi-part dramatization of a famous murder that occurred two decades ago - even though the killer was acquitted and she killed only in self-defense. However, they decide to interpret the story as if she was guilty and they even send a writer to the lady's house pretending to be a minister (!) As well as convey their current name and whereabouts. Needless to say, this ruins the woman and leads to a horrible tragedy. Then and only then, Bogart feels some real remorse for producing such garbage - leading to an elegant ending about journalistic integrity and decency. Well represented, a great story and a message that is as important today as it was in the 1930s, this is a story that you have to see. In particular, notice the wonderful and very emotional confrontation scene in which the daughter attacks the owner and Bogart - is a great example of acting and writing.
