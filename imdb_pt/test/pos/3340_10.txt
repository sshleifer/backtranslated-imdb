I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before I saw this movie. I had just seen the MOOG documentary, which was right, the only problem was that Moog had a very happy life, and the doc was well ... content. Haack's story is filled with all the commercial tragedy people buy today, but it carries a lot with it. Although the film is not so tragic, one can see that Bruce accepted the price of making music the way he did. There are so many elements that make up your IE legacy. invention of the Peopleodian, where Bruce could actually play music by playing people. It must have been a challenge to document Haack's production, which practically fell into every conceivable category (even in rap music), but the director cut the piece very coherently and managed to capture the spirit. And the cast ... with which a group of Bruce characters surrounded themselves, but what do you expect from a telepath guru, stumbling over children, struggling against the music industry. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in the history of music, it is so mainstream, but so important.
