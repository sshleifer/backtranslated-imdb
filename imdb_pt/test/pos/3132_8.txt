Travis and Sandy (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.) are dealers of coerced horses selling their animals to a Mormon group and guiding them across the border to a settlement. What they do not expect is to find the notorious Clegg assassins, with their wounded leader Uncle Shiloh (Charles Kemper). Ward Bond portrays Elder Wiggs, the lead voice of the Mormon group that changes the wagon to the Lord's fate. Along the way, they also meet "Doctor" A Locksley Hall and their "Hoochey Koochey Wagon" and help them. <br /> <br /> Lovingly run by Ford who pays close attention to detail with realistic problems that any group would encounter during a rugged wagon trail. The film has a wonderful cast consisting of character actors with only a true star in the film which is truly a boon to see, were it not for a change of pace. Young Johnson and Carey Jr. do very well, but this is Bond's movie to shine as he has the best lines. Johnson is one who seems to understand thugs and brutes like Shiloh and will certainly come in handy when a certain conflict develops when Clegg's boys ride alongside them. <br /> <br /> I would have to say that. is one of their best and least appreciated westerns and seems to flow very well.
