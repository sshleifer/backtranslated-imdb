This is probably the biggest war movie and certainly one of the biggest movies. There is no sentimentality, no patriotic agenda, not even a hopeful message of universal fraternity in this gloomy glimpse of what we can only call hell. It is this strict rigor and lack of manipulation that gives the film an impressive power. There is no attempt to make a hero of the protagonist of Ichikawa, Tamura. He is just a poor doomed sinner trying to stay alive in a world of horror that waits but is unsure, he can cling to his humanity in the process. Ichikawa's fierce lack of illusion and illusion makes Fires on the Plain alone. Ichikawa died in February 2008.
