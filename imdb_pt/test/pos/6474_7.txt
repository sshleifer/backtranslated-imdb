He recently traveled to Norway from Bergen, Norway and stopped in the small town of Voss, Norway and there was a monument named after Knute Rockne, who was born in Voss years ago. Everybody knows Knute to this day and the tour guides take pride in stopping at their monument. This film is a great story of this great man and his great love for Notre Dame Never realized that Knute has great talents in chemistry and laboratory science and also taught chemistry for years and at the same time trained the football team. Ronald Reagan played the role of George Gipp (The Gipper), who was an excellent football player; Reagan had a short role, but gave a great supporting role in this film. Donald Crisp (Fr. John Callahan) stood out as a priest who has always had great faith in Knute throughout his life in Notre Dame. This is a great classic movie and will be seen for many generations to come. Appreciate.
