Yes. Bam cried a few times and so did Englund. And most likely you too. The whole cast is back in action and Knoxville has stepped up to become the true leader of this gang of confused delays (I mean this in the best way possible). First I thought, maybe Bam or Steve-O were the main guys ... no, the main man is Johnny now. Do not get me wrong, everyone, and I mean everyone is great in this movie! From the beginning you're laughing, and believe me, do not plan to rest your smile. I personally think the movie definitely has better moments than the first. You know when you enter a theater, and you do not want to have high expectations for it ... well, this movie does away with all expectations. If you love Jackass, you can enter into it with gigantic expectations. No matter what you will laugh. If you are not laughing, the reason it is most likely for someone to have a gun in your face telling you if you laugh or die, or maybe you are embarrassed at the sound of your laughter or the more likely you are eating Jack Sh ! for breakfast and Jack left town. All I have to say is, get ready to have a sore face after the movie. :)
