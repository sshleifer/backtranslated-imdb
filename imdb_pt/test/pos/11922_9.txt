This is worth seeing, although it is sometimes cheesy, it's great to see a young Sean Astin, and it turns out to be a fun and humorous action film. I watched it many times when I was young, and now I still like it when I put the old vhs in the machine (by chance I own a copy). So, sit down with this movie, let reality happen for a while, and you will be able to have some good laughs and a fun hour and a half.
