I must say. This is easily one of my favorite movies to watch on Halloween. The Halloween party, the horrible performance, the dressed up guy and the extra Miami Vice. GREAT GREAT GREAT !!! <br /> <br /> ********************* SPOILERS ************** ****** ******* <br /> <br /> I have a huge place in my heart for random horror movies from the 80's and this one reached out and pulled the strings from my heart. I always move this movie to Blockbuster and I always laugh at the cover of the box. Now every weekend I got a random movie that I had never seen before ... a weekend was Angelas's turn. She seemed to be insulting me for months. So I took it home and put most of the film under the blanket. <br /> <br /> For me, it was scary and rude. And not just acting! Some of the things they invented for this movie were AWESOME. I can honestly say that the best part for me was to see Suzanne (played by a fellow iowan) stick a tube of lipstick on her nipple. It was random and I loved it. Watching the scary Angela float down the corridors and hear her sinister demon voice was enough to keep me awake EVERY NIGHT! <br /> <br /> It's not one of the smarter or better represented horror films. But its 80's cheese and has all the elements you need. Gothic Boy Spooky, Virgo, Whore, Naked Girls, Scary House, Bad Action, oh and did I mention Naked Girls? All the elements were there and were put together in such a way that made one of my favorite movies. Lots of praise for the filmmakers.
