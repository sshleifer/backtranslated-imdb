If you like shoot em up westerns this is a keeper. I thought the movie was fun to watch and see people I had not seen in a while. I'm not an expert, but I enjoyed acting. The town and props etc seemed to fit the period and type of town you would discover on the border. This is not a Western, there are not enough people and budget. The costumes and firearms were correct for the time! I hope to see the young actors in the movie again in the future. Rachel, Chance, Rebekah and Kirby were great. The SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) members who contributed to this effort were very good. I hope to see more.
