THE RED CIRCLE (Jean-Pierre Melville - France / Italy, 1970). <br /> <br /> This may be the coolest movie of all time, in the most literal sense of the term. The men here never lose control and never - not once - show their emotions. No dramatic bursts in this movie. Everyone is cool all the time. It is an abstract dream world, where men live from their own code, a gangster code with the values ​​of the outside world conspicuously absent. In this masterfully filmed saga, Melville addresses the American police thriller in its distinctively dark and desolate style, but done in style with a hefty budget of ten million dollars and four of the greatest French stars of the time. Alain Delon as the main thief, Yves Montand as a former alcoholic cop, Italian star Gian-Maria Volonté as a fugitive criminal and André Bourvil in an atypical role as the cynical chief of police. Melville described LE CERCLE ROUGE as his penultimate film and is in fact a masterfully stylized police officer. He also claimed he wanted to film a noir color film and in many ways succeeded. The two main influences for this film were John Huston's 1950 film, THE JUNGLE ASPHALT and RIFIFI, by Jules Dassin (1955). But unlike those films, where we learn a lot about the background of individual gang members, with all their small needs and concerns that motivate them, making it clear that these are not just relentless types of underworld, but ordinary people involved in one world of daily worries and human endeavor, Melville, however, tells us almost nothing about his criminals. Why was Corey (Alain Delon) arrested? Why was his partner, Vogel (Jean-Marie Volonté) arrested in the first place? Or why the former police shooter Jansen (Yves Montand) left the force, was his alcoholism? We never learn the motivations behind their actions and never find out what motivates these men. Women are even more absent than in their previous films, with "emotional" ties exclusively among men. They do not even seem to have personal lives. A sort of emotional twilight zone, and although the setting is not as abstract as in his previous LE SAMOURAI (1967), Melville still outlines a very strange world. Melville's favorite actor, Alain Delon, is perfect and almost surpasses himself in the cold, if you can imagine. <br /> <br /> Deliberately paced and over 140 minutes, Melville takes the time to tell the story, but its slow pace and duration seems a perfect way to show the desolate world in which these men live. Nothing is always out of place in the Melville movies and here it is no different, every little detail seems to be of fundamental importance to the story. Although LE SAMOURAI continues to be my favorite movie of Melville, even with the greatest films of all time, this also belongs to the best. Camera Obscura --- 10/10
