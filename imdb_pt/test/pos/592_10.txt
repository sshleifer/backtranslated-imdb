I'm 17, and I'm a Muppet fan, and while I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper, Muppet Movie deserves to be there with the best of them. It's extremely entertaining, thanks to Jerry Juhl's grumpy script, and the film looks lovely, with some beautifully staged musical numbers. Speaking of the songs, I really liked them, for sure they are not the best score of the Muppet franchise, but they were very good to hear, especially Never Before. Never before is it now one of my favorite Muppet songs along with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate. The Muppets, as usual, were fantastic, particularly the always delicious Miss Piggy, and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie was great. And what a brilliant human cast - from Bob Hope to Madeleine Kahn's Orson Welles (the same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like What's Up Doc, Blazing Saddles and Clue) to Cloris Leachman, from Steve Martin to Richard Pryor, all of whom made memorable guest appearances, being careful not to overshadow the Muppets in a fantastic movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox
