<br /> <br /> Although this film has been a little slow at times, the brilliant scenery, richness of characters and powerful themes make Death to Venezia a rewarding experience. I have not read Thomas Mann's book, but I am sure that Visconti's visual splendor, musical score, and powerful evocation of conflict and desire should do him justice. <br /> <br /> Gustav von Aschenbach's study alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behavior and passion. This tendency is demonstrated in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes music as being mathematical - that is, quantifiable - and emotional. This conflict arises again in the scene where young Tadzio is alone playing 'Fuer Elise' in the lobby of the Hotel and Gustav remembers his visit to a brothel, where he is attracted by a prostitute that plays the same music. In his flashback, after paying the prostitute, Gustav is clearly physically apprehended by the consequences of his actions. This reaction acts as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that Tadzio represents. <br /> <br /> In the final analysis, Gustav is forced to make his biggest decision: to stay in Venice and resign himself to his lust and temptations? Or escape from Venice to save your own life? His initial attempt to flee Venice from the train station resulted in futility and foreshadowing the result of prolonging his stay. Complementing the captivating interaction of characters, Tadzio's powerful scenery of Visconti (especially Venice's Dawn and the final scene) walking on the water and pointing to the horizon) makes this film a true masterpiece .
