It has aged very well - still thrilling and suspenseful today. Certainly one of Hitch's best films. Beautifully shot, with a great premise of suspense, sex appeal provided by the beautiful Ruth Roman. Because of the big premise, you feel you need to watch to the end. If you are losing faith in Hitch and doubting his title as the Master of Suspense, I recommend this little film as an antidote. 5 out of 5
