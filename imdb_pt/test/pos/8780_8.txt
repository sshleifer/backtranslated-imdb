There are many familiar elements of Hitchcock (from earlier and later films), and this time they blend into a cheerful, but not exciting piece of entertainment. You can tell that Dorothy Parker had a hand in the script, the most memorable scenes are the dialogues of the hero Cummings with the blind man and his encounter with a rather bizarre group of circus people. The famous climax of the Statue of Liberty seems a bit heavy - judged by today's standards, but also compared to other endings of the Hitch monument (eg Blackmail, North by Northwest).
