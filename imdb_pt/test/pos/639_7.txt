I entered this movie expecting a slasher, and while Mute Witness takes influence from the said style of making movies, this is much more than just a simple slash. There are a number of thrillers who focus on a certain disability - Blindness is more common (Blind Terror, Waiting Until Dark, Cat O'Nine Tails to name a handful), but the implications of having a leadership shift in a thriller like this are well portrayed and actually are an integral part of the plot, since the fact that the main character can not speak is often the reason why she finds herself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else to abandon. Our silent witness is Billy Hughes, a makeup artist working on a horror film production at a studio in Moscow. She finds herself locked up after a few hours of the night, and after trying to call her sister's help, she comes across what at first seems to be the making of an illicit sex movie, but soon turns out to be a snuff film! She tries to convince the authorities of what she has seen, but thinks no one believes her story ... <br /> <br /> Recently, the Hostel appeared in the headlines for showing movies made in a foreign country, but this movie did it . first and really does a better job. Maybe it's not as nasty as Eli Roth's work, but gore is more effective, and since director Anthony Waller (who went on to direct one of my favorite modern thrillers with 'The Guilty') implements a good sense of humor in process. Mute Witness is both bloody and fun to watch. The director certainly has a talent for creating thrills, since this never stands still. The plot is put into action quickly, and Waller constantly introduces twists that give a great help to the overall entertainment value of the film. The performance is not bad for a B movie, with young artists Marina Zudina, Fay Ripley and Evan Richards performing well. The atmosphere is somber, and the Russian locals are adequately hostile, which helps the film maintain an atmosphere of bad omen. Overall, Mute Witness is a much better movie than you might expect it to be. The plot flows well and the atmosphere and tension are in place.
