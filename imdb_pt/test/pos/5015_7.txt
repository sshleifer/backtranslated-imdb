This film was well represented and kept my interest in the main character of the entire film. Stu Unger lived an extraordinary life. Imagine if Stu was alive today! This film shows an image of what Un Unger's life might have looked like. It was interesting to see how connected it was growing. I wish I had seen more details about Stu's party, his game, and his relationship with Bob Stupak. But after all, this movie was well done, well represented and the story touched on many facets of a life that was full of many events that were larger than life. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth renting.
