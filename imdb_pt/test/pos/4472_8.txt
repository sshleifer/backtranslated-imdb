I love this movie, although I do not like how they imagine the Egyptians being myself an Egyptian citizen! that's why he gets eight out of 10. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course, because of the loneliness and living in that cave for so long, he develops a kind of insanity . and passion for this leopard. <br /> <br /> A very touching scene when the leopard dies, see Augustin's reaction. <br /> <br /> In short, I find it enjoyable, and I'm anxious. to read the story of Balzac.
