Vanaja (2006), written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from South India. Mamatha Bhukya plays Vanaja, 15, who lives in a rural area with her loving father but an alcoholic. If she is going to succeed in life, she will have to overcome the responsibilities of low caste and poverty. <br /> <br /> I went to the movie waiting for the representation of a miserable girl who is crushed by society. This is not what "Vanaja" shows us. The young woman is attractive, intelligent and ambitious. She does not accept her fate with tears or mere resignation. She wants to be successful, and it is never clear she will not succeed despite the odds. <br /> <br /> Mr. Domalpalli's performance of his cast of amateurs is miraculous. Mamatha Bhukya is excellent in the title role, and Urmila Dammannagari does an outstanding job as Mrs. Rama Devi, the wealthy landowner who is a former classical dancer. <br /> <br /> In the film, Vanaja learns classical dance from South India. like she did in real life. I did not know how Vanaja's dance was good by Indian standards, but the many dance scenes were fascinating. (Do not think about Bollywood - this is classical dance.) It is also very different from ballet, because in ballet the dancer takes the heels off the floor. This is a movie that is not to be missed. It will work on DVD, but it will be better on a theater screen because the dance will be shown to better advantage. However, if the DVD is your only option, then look at it that way. Just be sure to see this.
