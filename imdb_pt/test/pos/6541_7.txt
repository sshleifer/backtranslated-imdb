I suppose we all, no matter if we're car fans, love the sound of a Dodge Challenger as it snores along the road, the noise a Chevy makes when it screams in ecstasy when it writhes in a corner and, Above all, the explosion of sound like a classic vehicle explodes in flames. I'm not the biggest car enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination, but any of the above really does make my engine! There is no denying the importance of transportation in the cinema. It has been said that the invention of the train was one of the greatest influences in primitive cinema (looking out of a window almost like a moving image and the idea of ​​being transported to a different time / space). But the car remains the most popular and most lucid, it even has its own genre: the carsploitation genre. A genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars. In fact, it's just pornography! Car Porno! And I'm not talking about that nasty documentary on Channel 4, in which men actually had sex with cars. Whatever floats your ... car, I guess. Continuing ... while RUNNING ON EMPTY is not as pornographic as VANISHING POINT (Richard C. Sarafian, 1971), for example, with its car close-ups in motion, it's all bumps and bends (!), This does not means that the car is not the main focus of this movie. In fact, cars become characters (more on that later). They are objectified and fetishized as much as women, in fact, perhaps even more. And holy, these cars are something! Are all the cars in this movie (besides those in the background) simply beautiful? works of art, there is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> As I was saying, these incredible cars are, to some extent, given the characters themselves. You really start to sympathize with the car! SPOILER ?? Most notably during the scene where the car is being destroyed and burned SPOILER OVER. This has become almost a convention of the carsploitation genre; the evil 1978 Plymouth Fury of CHRISTINE (John Carpenter, 1983), the custom of Satan Lincoln Mark III in THE CAR (Elliot Silverstein, 1977), the little Mini Coopers of THE ITALIAN JOB (Peter Collinson, 1969) to the friendly Volkswagen Beetle in THE LOVE BUG (Robert Stevenson, 1968) and of course each DEATH RACE 2000 car (Paul Bartel, 1975) and even WACKY RACES (1968-1970), all with their own character. Ironically, however, this emphasis on the car often ends (!) The human characters! And this is certainly the case of RUNNING ON EMPTY, in which only a human character (the blind character who drives his car with his hearing, not the vision) has some kind of dimension, the rest are very common characters. These are all his stereotyped teenagers of the 1980s in Australia; big hair, annoying accents and none of which would seem out of place in NEIGHBORS, especially the Kylie Minouge alike. But who cares? It's all about the cars running and crashing! That's it! If you do not like it, you're really watching the wrong genre. <br /> <br /> The scenes of cars are certainly the selling point of this movie, and the best thing he did was for him. They are fast; very fast! And we're not talking about the annoying technique that some movies seem to use, where they record the car 'accelerating' at about 40 mph, and then accelerate. Oooh no! Not with this movie you do not. Are these cars boosting the maximum speeds in real time? no fancy editing tricks here. So we have speed. Checks. What about failures? Check it, check it out, check it out! While there are no cars beating EVERYWHERE, like the incredibly BLUES BROTHERS (John Landis, 1980), when cars collide with this movie, they certainly break! It seems they use gunpowder or something similar to build the cars as a small success and KABOOM they are on fire. It reminded me of THRILLER: THE CRUEL PICTURE (Bo Arne Vibenius, 1974) in that sense. <br /> <br /> Among these simply stunning scenes (especially the beginning and the end) there are some scenes that delay everything and, in my opinion, do not add much to the film. Note: more explosive cars are needed! However, are there any exceptions here that are great scenes? SPOILER especially the attempted rape scene. <br /> <br /> So, after all, this is a man's movie! A boy movie! Full of vroom vrooming cars around the outback and a couple of tits played to good extent as well. I recommend this little movie to anyone, even if they are interested cyclists (!) ?? It's a great movie that you can just turn off your brain, sit in your leather chair and put the whole volume down! Will I give 3.5 luvs of 5 luvs ?? Bruuuuum! P.S ?? Amazon is selling it for just over £ 2? It's a real bargain, though the DVD does not have any special features.
