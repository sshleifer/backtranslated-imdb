Okay ... time for a little bit of excitement I guess. It's been 2 years since I submitted my original comments praising this top-scale comedy ..... and the damn thing has not yet hit the video or DVD (or even the subject that was repeated on television!) !! !!! <br /> <br /> Does anyone know why not? Was there an error in the BBC style where the original copy was deleted / lost / deleted? <br /> <br /> Listen to you very much in charge of ITV - beat this on DVD now !!! Do you realize how funny this show was? That makes "Mike Bassett" look as bad as the current Spurs team of pants. <br /> <br /> Sorry. For the moment.
