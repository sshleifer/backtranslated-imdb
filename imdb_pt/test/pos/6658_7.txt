Well, I expected, for all the hype and Oscar nominations, an epic civil war drama (& something with the "magnitude" of the "English Patient" given by the same director). This movie is not of epic stature, but I happen to be relieved not to be. It is a love story amidst the horrors of war, where young men are sent to fight, deserters are tracked and killed, and women and children at home are left alone as long as the men are gone. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought Nicole Kidman and Rene Zelleweger were pretty decent and did not know much about Jude Law, he was fine, too. It seems that Rene Z. had the funniest part of the 3 protagonists and was able to intelligently interpret an energetic and resolute woman with great aplomb. Also to me it was good to see the actress, Kathy Baker ... someone whose talent is the most recognized / recognized. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing this - I can not say why really, but maybe because it's a slice of Americana. <br /> <br />
