All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman, the Viking guardian, had some memorable phrases and the master of the skull, the villain, always promised to kill Max with an insane laughter. Writing is the best. I stuck to the set when this would happen when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they did, I'd be forced to buy it. This and a cartoon of Conan, the barbarian, are the ones I miss the most since childhood. I think these drawings are the most despised of all the great cartoons. I used to watch those drawings on Channel 13 in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> I remember that the owl was always afraid, telling Max that he was in trouble and that he was the chosen one. Max did not believe he was the chosen one and always gave the owl problem. Norman was less talkative, but his simplicity was funny. He said things like "I eat monsters for breakfast" when he was fighting them. And then, when he was fighting zombies, he would say "I eat zombies for ... never mind." Classic comedy and cartoon action. <br /> <br /> I vote they re-air Mighty Max.
