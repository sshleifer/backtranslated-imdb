The Man Who Knew Too Much {1956} is a remake of a movie that Alfred Hitchcock made in England in 1934 with the same name. In my opinion, your subsequent effort is far superior. Many critics and fans of Alfred Hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and does not have the creepy suspense of the original with Peter Lorre. In both films, the plot is essentially the same, except the original is set in Switzerland and the remake in Marrakech. It tells the story of a couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) vacationing with their son and finding a suspicious man who is very curious about his past. It turns out that he is an agent who is looking for a couple involved in a conspiracy to murder a world leader. Then he gets stabbed in a Marrakeck market by discovering that he is a spy and starts falling into Stewart's arms. Dying, he tells the whole story of the murder plan. Stepwart and Day discover that another couple they met was the couple the agent sought and kidnapped their son. The film contains excellent performances by Stewart and Day. Straight dramatic role as worried and frightened parents. This film proved that Doris Day could act in suspenseful dramas as well as carefree musicals. The direction of Alfred Hitchcock is top-notch. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat every minute. The scene in Albert Hall is a classic. The original is so slow and monotonous. I do not know how people can compare the two. Just watch the remake and you will have fun. I give the film to 9 of 10
