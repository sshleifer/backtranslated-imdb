This is a rather clever and well-represented version of the "modern" woman's fairytale novel from the 30s. In this case, it helps the man she loves to become the head of the company while serving as her secretary and eventually , wins his love of an intriguing social butterfly. Interestingly, her sense of business is shown as subtly parallel to her domestic prowess, and the ladies of the office are described as the "powers behind the throne." Raised above average by Mrs. Astor's intelligent performance.
