I saw this movie for the first time as a teenager (now I'm in my 40s), and I have long considered it to be my favorite movie. The story is very exciting without being sentimental. The performance, especially by March and Loy, is deadly. And the fact that Dana Andrews is too old for her role does not detract from the credibility of her romance with Theresa Wright (which I believe to be the only major character in the movie still alive). This could have been another post-war melodrama, but the script and cast are too good for that to happen.
