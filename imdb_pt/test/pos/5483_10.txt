"In the line of fire" is one of the best thrillers I've seen, builds and builds to a great climax. This movie really draws you into your heart is beating and you are breathless from the action. The cast turns into strong parts, particularly Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich. This film is cleverly directed by master of suspense Wolfgang Petersen. Thrillers do not get much better, do not miss it.
