In real life, husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation, which chronicles the lifetime of Charles Darwin before the publication of "On the Origin of Species" in 1859, his infamous book on evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research created a huge divide, a schism between the believers of his day and the scientists. He was told at the time to go to war against God, and even to have "killed God." <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the life of Darwin with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as her extremely devoted and loving wife. A revealing scene at the beginning, when she leads the dinner table in prayer and Charles can not say "Amen" is an anticipation of what will follow and the stark differences between the two. She is convinced that he will be eternally condemned and bring unhappiness to his family, rejecting God. <br /> <br /> Darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife, his faith and his reason even stronger. There are beautiful moments in which he observes animals, dissects their behaviors and the sequences that make up their lives, explaining phenomena of selection for their children, the first born, Annie, having a very morbid curiosity. We see him interacting with the first orangutan in England, Jenny, playing with him as if he were a child, deciphering all his looks and actions. <br /> <br /> Annie, the eldest child, dies later and Charles is haunted by her death, having been the closest to her. In my opinion, this part was very long, bizarre and prolonged. I did not like the trippy scenes where he seems to be losing his mind and is chased by his daughter's ghost, screaming and complaining. Although Charles thinks his wife blames him for his fatal illness, she poetically says, "The truth is, if I knew what I knew now, I would marry you tomorrow." His bond is solid and unbreakable, despite tremendous differences of belief. <br /> <br /> When Charles finishes his manuscript, he hands the wife the final copy, saying that she can burn him if she does not agree. She keeps reading the nights and finally presents a package, the book ready to be sent to the publisher. In the end, reason and perhaps love also triumph, while he makes an accomplice of his most fierce adversary. <br /> <br /> It is fascinating that Darwin received a full Christian burial at Westminster Abbey, proof that his ground irrefutable ideas were seen as controversial, of course, but were already recognized as vital knowledge for the advancement of the human race. <br /> <br /> The film definitely relies heavily on Darwin's family life, his joys and his problems. I happened to like that aspect, but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary about Hitler's passion for ping-pong. This is true in some ways and I can not disagree with his desire to have learned more about Charles Darwin's theories from this film than we do. There remains, however, a well-executed and impeccable period drama. My rating: 7 Fabio's: 7 Total score: 14
