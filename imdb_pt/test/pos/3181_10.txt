This was an excellent show. He arrived on PBS in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teenage old daughter. The series dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. It was about a middle-class black family who had a teenage daughter and a teenage son who moved into an Oakland middle-class neighborhood or somewhere (I do not remember). I remember several episodes, but what I remember most was when her cousin menstruated for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched and I was able to follow the program. This was a great show. I can not remember the name of the guy who played the son in the show, but I always confused him with Kevin Hooks.
