** SPOILERS ** Shocking still true story of the horror that struck the border town of Phenix, Alabama / Georgia, when it was taken over by a gang of organized thugs who turned it into the City of Southern Sin. crime shooting and no one to ask for help from a group of concerned citizens, Phenix lawyer Albert Patterson, John McIntire, is well respected to run for the State Prosecutor's Office. With Phenix's criminal element doing everything from intimidation to murder, to keep the voters receiving Patterson's appointment, he still wins with the other 86 counties in the state, not including Phenix County in Russell, giving him little agreement more than 1,000. wishes. Terrified at what Patterson would do when he took over Phenix Mob Rett Tanner, Edward Andrews, has a hit on him. Patterson is shot while driving to his office, but his killers are seen by Ellie Rhodes, Kathryn Grant, who soon becomes, through an informant in Patterson's office, Tanner's next person in line to be targeted for murder. What Tanner & Co. did not expect was for the son of the late Albert Patterson, John, Richard Kiley, to hear from Ellie about his father's murder before his children could shut her up! This great miscalculation on Tanner's part will put an end to both his criminal organization and his freedom! <br /> <br /> Powerful documentary-style crime film with the people involved in the events, given about 15 minutes at the beginning of the film to tell their stories. This despite the fact that they were still in danger of being murdered by Tanner Mob, who was still on the loose at the time his interviews were filmed! Finishing up what his brave father began, John Patterson brought the only Phenix City story on the front pages of state and national newspapers, giving Tanner the very negative publicity he so much tried to avoid. With the now Alabama National Guard flooding Phenix City with thirst for blood and no jealousy, not wanting to resist people with guns in their hands, Tanner Mob evaporated out of sight like a morning mist after sunlight hits her! And with John Patterson now taking the place of his murdered father as the new attorney general for the state of Alabama, you can be sure that Patterson Mob has seen his last days pushing people around and killing them. The only thing they will see now in the future are the gray walls of the prison and the bars that will be their sweet home home for the rest of their rotten and miserable lives! Most likely the most graphically violent movie to leave Hollywood until that moment "The Phenix City Story" has not punched in to show how a group of lawless and powerful criminals can turn an American city into a hell for all. No one was attacked by these ruthless gangsters who did not even think twice about murdering women and children, even if that was enough to keep them in power! As for the Phenix City Police Department, it was best that they comply with the law they swore and would defend. They were having coffee and donuts while the town was being burned to the ground by thugs like Tanner, who had them in their pockets!
