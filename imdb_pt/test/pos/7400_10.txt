This is better than the first. The movie opens with Sheriff Sam. Then Sam and Anne pack their bags and head to the Tropicana as Jack goes along. <br /> <br /> People are shot, they get glass in their necks, they are crushed by anvils, stabbed with frostbite, eyes plucked, head blasts, drownings, hangings, crawfish stuck in faces, gargling, frozen to death , snow-blasted, ripped arms, melted by antifreeze, ice pendants on the neck pots and pans, fingers being bitten, ice pendants through the mouth, bites on the neck, people exploding, snowballs toasted and shoveled into blenders. <br /> <br /> The snowballs are hilarious, put in the blender and turn it on then it says "it was fun" they put on a waffle thing and it is burnt. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie. So they start thinking of other ways to kill him, and the snowball responds, 'This is not cool.' <br /> <br /> It was worth ten dollars to buy this. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars.
