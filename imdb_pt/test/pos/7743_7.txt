For many years, I thought I was the only person on the planet who had seen TEMPEST, and I am so happy to know that I am not the only person who has discovered this sleeper somewhere in their shooting difficulties. Vaguely based on Shakespeare's play, TEMPEST follows an architect (the late John Cassavettes in one of his best performances), bored with his work and his crumbling marriage (with his spouse Gene Rowlads), who decides to throw everything, let's say hell with the rat race and go live on an island with her daughter (Molly Ringwald, in her film debut), and new girlfriend Aretha (a bright Susan Sarandon). Although Paul Mazursky is credited as a director, Cassavettes' hand is throughout this film ... the long uncut scenes filmed, the improvisational feeling of dialogue ... the self-indulgent style of storytelling, this is definitely his show from the start. to finish, and if you are not a fan of his work, the film will seem laboriously long and monotonous, but if you are a fan then there are rewards to be gained. Cassavettes is surrounded by a first-rate cast ... his scenes with Rowlands crackle with intensity and his astounding chemistry with Sarandon is a stark contrast to his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines in his film debut and there is a scene-stealing performance by the late Raul Julia as Kalibanos, the servant of Cassavettes on the island. Julia stops the show in a scene dancing with a flock of sheep accompanied by Liza Minnelli singing "New York, New York". This movie is sad and tragic and fun and intense. Yes it is a bit long and disjointed and works a little too much to be different (there is even a curtain call at the end of the movie) but never fails to hold the attention of anyone who likes something a little different filmgoing.
