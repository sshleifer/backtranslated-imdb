Andaz Apna Apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, first being Namak Halal (even though this was technically a drama). The story is nothing new, but the complications that are added to it make it incredible. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon. Just watch your expressions in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He's incredibly good at comedy, I never knew. Salman Khan was also good as the little obscure of the two characters. The noises he makes are almost as funny as Aamir's faces. Raveena and karisma serve their purpose, but they are not at all surprising. The actual choice of the lot is Paresh Rawal as usual. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless children of poor parents. They do not believe in hard work and just want to enrich themselves in an easy way. So both of their brains come across an idea to lure the daughter of a wealthy man (Paresh Rawal) (Raveena Tandon) who comes to India to look for a husband. So Amar and Prem meet on the road and team up to drive out the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. When they do, they now need to get rid of each other. Somehow, the two enter Raveena's house, Amar as a bruised face and Prem as his doctor. From now on they try to drive each other out. But things are complicated when Raveena's friend Karisma Kapoor falls in love with Prem and pursues him. And the evil twin brother of the rich man (Rawal too) tries to get rid of the heiress and his father so he inherits the money and sends his two more reliable but awkward fools to do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you can not miss. Watch it! It will be worth it. I even own the DVD, it feels so good. And if you like this movie, I also recommend Gol Maal if you have not watched it yet. Other good comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).
