This is a very strange little short that initially did not impress me. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the animation here is certainly not beautiful - although after a while you realize that the simple and silly drawings have a certain strange charm. This is probably because with the script as crazy as this, the animation works. <br /> <br /> The movie shows an older couple sitting at the table playing Scrabble. At the same time, they are fixated on this game or other bizarre activities (like the husband's compulsion to see things - even the chair and the table)! And all this occurs when television warns of pending atomic annihilation - Armageddon is definitely here! Of course, the neighbors are screaming and running loose - during which the couple remains unconscious with this idiotic game. Heck, even your cat knows that the end is coming as the couple begins to quarrel over who they may or may not have cheated on - leading to a very surreal ending indeed! The film deserves praise for being unique and very funny. Although not winning the Oscar, was nominated for Best Animated Short - which deservedly rich.
