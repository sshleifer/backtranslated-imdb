So many old British sound films that I've seen on video suffer from low-quality print transfer or bad sound or both. Fortunately, I was able to get a copy of that movie in a high quality video, allowing me to focus on the story itself. <br /> <br /> And, a great story that was. At first glance, the passengers on the unfortunate bus seemed very upset (except for the always lovely Jessie Matthews). But when the film came back to show the story of each passenger the day before the accident, I discovered that the cast, unlike its initial appearance, was a talented group of artists, cleverly driven to bring a real individuality to their distinctive characterizations . Viewers may have different preferences as to which two passengers will face a tragic end and which ones will survive. But, the film holds your interest as it keeps you guessing. This film deserves a much wider audience - a true gem of early British cinema.
