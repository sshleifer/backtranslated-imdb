"Walking with Dinosaurs" is absolutely brilliant in every way. Kenneth Branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to hear. The documentary script really sounds as if the researchers and writers did their homework, it's so insightful and you get hooked and never let go. The music is also brilliant, very dramatic when it needs to be. But visual effects and scenery are what make this documentary work so well. The scenery is breathtaking, and the dinosaurs look so real, thanks to the simply amazing effects. This is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not just adults, but kids as well. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is a must watch. Not only do I love it, but this is possibly the best documentary I've ever seen. If anything, could have done with being longer, other than this is perfect. 10/10 Bethany Cox
