Whoever released this movie was a genius, all the characters in it are perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was like before and during the civil war, the difference between the rich, the average white and the black. The story gives you some insights into the real issues of the time and the difficulties inherent in everyday life in those days. The plot is attractive, and the drama keeps its attention throughout the film. There are characters you will fall in love with, there are characters you will hate and you will find yourself emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Both my wife and I love it, and let's watch it again in a few. years, I'm sure.
