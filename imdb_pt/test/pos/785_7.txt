Well, I'm a huge fan of Italian horror and I love movies from directors like Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, just to name the most famous. "Villa delle anime maledette" is one of the most unknown films of the genre, filmed when this type of cinema began its crisis that continues today, and director Carlo Ausino sounds totally new to my ears (although he has directed six films ... this is the price that the Italian directors pay not to work in Rome ...). But the movie is not that bad. And it is not absolutely correct to talk about "junk". OK, the plot is not so original; this reminds me of things like the Amytville series (the year is the same as Amityville Possession by Damiano Damiani) or "Shock," the latest work by Mario Bava. But you have to think that this is the movie of a director of photography (like the films of Mario Bava); then the most important is the atmosphere, not the story or the characters; atmosphere created by the use of light and camera movement. The rest remains in the background. I think the movie works; not so good, but it works; is certainly better than a lot of Hollywood production like "The Haunting," which has a bigger budget but not bigger ideas ...
