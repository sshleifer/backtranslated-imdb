This was a very faithful presentation of Lewis's life in the mid-1950s. The dialog on theology and play with his fellow students was exceptionally good. Michael White's book, "C.S. Lewis: Creator of Narnia" deals with this period of time in a very parallel way. Joss Ackland's performance was excellent at catching Lewis without emotion. The film made a great effort to be presented in a precise English environment. The development of a strong bond between "Jack" (his name preferred) Lewis and Douglas Gresham, Joy's son from his previous marriage, was pleasant to watch. The film avoided the unpleasant element of the drinking problem of "Warnie" Lewis (Jack's older brother), but it would not have moved the story, so it's best left out.
