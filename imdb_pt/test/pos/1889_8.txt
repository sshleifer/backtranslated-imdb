These are the types of movies that I loved and still love to grow. Unlike big budget films that create big holes and never recognize them. This movie takes everything straight forward and just does something that you can sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br /> There was some previous film student who complained that it was not a list material. But this is not the point. The purpose of this film is that not everyone likes movies full of CGI Cliche. There are many people who like movies that only serve to entertain you, and not get as much money as they can. <br /> <br /> Besides, it's also good to know that good old Bruce is not dead yet.
