I was fortunate to watch a midnight session of the movie tonight. I must say I was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre storyline. I was completely mistaken. This movie was not only incredibly fun, but everything that I simply loved. Bruce Campbell was as incredible as ever. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi, you know, Sam's younger brother. He touched the crazy doctor's henchman to the greatest extent. Somewhere between physical comedy and intelligent dialogue, he did nothing but shine. But I really can not ignore the magic that is Bruce Campbell. Although I thought Ted Raimi stole the show, Bruce did what he does best on the big screen. Somewhere among the unpleasant and tragic American businessman, he showed the same energy that he has always shown to be incredibly appealing to the public. The film itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers. The crowd was definitely excited with every little turn the movie made. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be Oscar material, but my God, it was incredible. I recommend this to any Bruce Campbell fan. Also, anyone who likes science fiction movies, do yourself a favor and watch it. I can not wait for this to hit the DVD. <br /> <br /> Accept this as you wish .... <br /> <br /> - fed
