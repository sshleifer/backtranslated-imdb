I was shocked to learn that Jimmy Caan left this show, does anyone know why? I consider James as one of the greats of all time and I was not surprised that it turned out on TV, which may be better than the crap you see on the big screen. The stories are smooth and the camera is faster than a bullet! Can not forget the rest of the cast: James, Vanessa (yum!) Nikki, Molly, Josh, Mitch .. Also, someone can tell me why there is a bad theme song on DVD players, but the Elvis remix for JXL A little less conversation is used in the initial NBC broadcasts? Does not it make sense to use a song that you would associate with America's game mecca for DVD releases?
