I feel very happy to have the chance not only to watch this movie but also learn more about this fascinating person and time. Lumumba is a featured portrait, giving a complete notion of the story without falling into the usual Hollywood decorations - yes, he is shown with his wife and children, but the essence of the story is his politics and those of the independent Congo still emerging. . The movie is done brilliantly, moving in a rhythm that is consistently engaging. I look forward to seeing other Raoul Peck films as well as more from Eric Ebouaney!
