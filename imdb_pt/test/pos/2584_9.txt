I watched this movie in the first presentation available in my area, and it was very clear that most people did not watch the movie. Even if you do not do it, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It's a completely human story about some very imperfect people in a southern backwoods town, and it really talks about the root of the blues. If you do not know what "Black Snake Moan" is when you leave the theater, you do not understand. And no, it's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a great job and is completely convincing in her role as well as Samuel L Jackson. I think this is your best performance since your role in Pulp Fiction, and probably your best, including this because of the scope of your character in BSM. The rest of the cast is solid, with some brilliant performances here and there, particularly John Cothran Jr as the Reverend RL. I am a very selective movie watcher, and this film is honestly among my favorites because of its candid look at racing, sex, religion and neurosis in a rural southern town, along with his cinematographic genius, in my opinion.
