Chaplin plays in a double role as a Jewish barber who, with amnesia, is mistaken for the dictator Adenoid Hynkel (Hitler). A film made in 1940, when the war was in its dark days and was not won by the allies. was banned in Germany by Hitler and was a risk to Chaplin, because if the war were to be lost, he would surely be sent away to be "reeducated". <br /> <br /> A funky satire with the classic Hitler scene playing to the around a giant balloon in the world..good fun, but with a message..a little trading floor at the end. This was the last film with Chaplin's trademark little mustache. on a scale of one to ten.
