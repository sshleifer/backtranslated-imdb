"Talk Radio" is my favorite movie by Oliver Stone, despite having done many greats including "Salvador", "JFK", "Natural Born Killers" and "Platoon". But I like the intimacy of "Talk Radio," a cinematic expansion of Eric Bogosian's theatrical scene that was based on a real-life account of a Dallas talk show host. Working with ace cinematographer Robert Richardson, Stone transforms what could have been a very defined exercise into a visually interesting ideological battle that features a radio station as a war arena. Bogasian is devastating as tortured in the air spouter of abuse Barry Champlain and conveys the conflicting, destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-loathing. Alec Baldwin, as his alpha male boss, is a perfect man, crazy about a guy whose monstrosity he helped cultivate. Ellen Greene is fantastic as Barry's sweet ex-wife who ends up becoming more of a target for her vicious personal flirtation. Stone and Bogosian fill each frame with interest and every line of dialogue with sweet poison and cut of ambiguity. John C. McGinley, as Barry's testator and producing technician, Stu, presents a sharp and hilarious performance, as does the great Michael Wincott. The film is an impeccable and underrated masterpiece of excellent writing, incredible acting and brutal and uncompromising direction. Stewart Copeland's score is brilliant too.
