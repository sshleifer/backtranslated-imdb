Along with Cops, The Goat is one of Keaton's two funniest shorts. Which makes it one of the best shorts of all time. This has a decent "plot" for a short, and forms a perfect line in which to hang some great jokes. Keaton is mistaken for a convict who escaped (as the error happens is a classic) and then must deceive the authorities. Best gags - the bread line and the "elevator".
