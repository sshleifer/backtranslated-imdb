I watch this movie almost every night it's on HBO. It is my opinion that it could have been successful in theater, since the announcement that preceded the scale was superior. I was totally impressed by the actress who played Nanny. She is an exceptional actress. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. He is a very discreet actor and deserves far more credit than he received. Ebony magazine did a good article on it, giving it some of its purposes. Lakawanna Blue, gave me an understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us. They were from a similar city "Philadelphia, PA" where they had to have fun at the junctions and such. I also like to say that Mos Def is an incredible actor. He found his calling. I've seen him in several movies, where he has played a variety of roles, from bandit to doctor and he has things! Overall, please put Lakawanna Blues on video for rental.
