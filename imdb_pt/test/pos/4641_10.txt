Midnight Madness is a film that unfortunately is highly underrated and unappreciated. With a flurry of classic teen / college films, that was forgotten. As a kid, I watched this movie over and over, fortunately I had it on video. This movie shows a meeker but more exciting side of the eighties. In the cynical society we live in today, with drug abuse being the coolest thing, it's good to see, from time to time, an innocent and entertaining movie that is Midnight Madness ... that is, if you can find it, it.
