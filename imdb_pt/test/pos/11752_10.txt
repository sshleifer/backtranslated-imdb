I saw this movie for the first time in the mid-60s when I was a teenager, and it thrilled me a lot, actually the final scene where Han Suyin hears Mark's death, and then runs up the hill, not believing, where you hear the Mark's voice saying "Give Me Your Hand," and then his image disappears, the butterfly with its superstitious meaning, the music, the shattered emotions of Love of Han Suyin, only left me sobbing. I was crying bitterly, my mother and sister looked up and were shocked by my reaction. I just left the room to be alone. Luckily I do not react like this anymore, but I always cry in the end. I love everything about the movie, the music mainly, the costumes of Han Suyin and location. The beauty of Jennifer Jones and the beautiful William Holden, both were at their best. I have the VHS and DVD of this wonderful movie. I also have two versions of Music & Lyrics by Arthur Newman and Sammy Fain. I also have Han Suyin's book A Many Splendored Thing. I recommend this movie 100%
