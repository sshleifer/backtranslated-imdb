I'm surprised there's confusion about the title of this movie. Obviously, it is an investigation into the nature of modern love. He is suggesting that love is love while things go well, but in which people reserve the right to put themselves first, and if things get difficult, they go out and enter into something else. <br /> <br /> This observation has generational implications, since it comes from Generation X, makes comments about Generation X, and in the end it is geared towards Generation X. It expresses disappointment that love has transformed from that that the Baby Boomers, parents of Generation X, had engendered in their marriages and family lives, and that Generation X gave the innocent and generous childhood they enjoyed in the final analysis. Generation X's attitude towards love is of course irreverent, but as decisions are made and compromises are broken, the biggest victims are the children of Generation X. This becomes clear at the end of the film, and it was so poignant that I took a week to recover from the shock I got from that epiphany.
