Overall, the Dad's Army movie is very funny, although the humor is not as catchy and brilliant as in the TV and radio series. So, where does this leave us, the viewers? If you've never seen Daddy's Army, then the movie is a good way to upgrade and get involved with the crazy world of Walmington / S. The downside is that you may not "understand" because, as I said, the The film's humor is a bit impassive. <br /> <br /> For fans of Dad's Army, the film has nothing new like history. is more or less a cut of the TV series, but it's a unique chance to see your favorites in "high definition" compared to the shitty quality of the BBC video recordings. <br /> <br /> The film also presents what should be the worst sequel to kidnapping in the history of the universe. I can not decide if this is positive or negative, however.
