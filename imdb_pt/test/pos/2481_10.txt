Nestled in a California detention camp in an indistinct future, an English film crew captures young students and political dissidents who are brought to trial under an "insurrection" act that allows the United States government to suspend civil liberties for its own citizens. without the right of guarantee or the need for evidence. In such cases, the government is authorized to apprehend and detain any person who believes that it may engage in future sabotage activities. The group on trial includes a feminist, a black panther and a folk singer. <br /> <br /> Those convicted by the Conservative court have the option of a long prison sentence or three days in Punishment Park where they can reach their freedom by reaching an American flag in the desert. They should accomplish this without food or water. They should also be pursued by armed national guards and police officers who can return them to the camp if caught to face the criminal sentence assigned to each convicted person. The reality is different; those who choose Punishment Park are hunted down and killed or brutalized without hope of gaining their freedom after a police officer is found dead in the park. The park appears to be a training ground for police and guards who must master these acts of repression so they can be used in open American society. <br /> <br /> Filmed in 16mm and documentary style developed by Watkins, in his celebrated Culloden and controversial The War Game for the BBC; he interacts with the prisoners and guards and observes the unconstitutional judgment, interspersing between them to create a totally convincing political film that still remains vital and relevant. Using his background knowledge, Watkins produced a relentless and ultimately frightening film portraying an entirely fictitious political detention camp that he would not be able to convince were it not for his flawless construction. Many of the actors are amateurs improvising with ample characters. Sparks fly in the judgment scenes in which each case is heard, in part, by the fact that Watkins has kept people on trial away from the jury until the filming of those scenes. Watkins also claims that actors often express their own opinions, which certainly explains the ferocity and credibility of their performances. <br /> <br /> The film has been heavily criticized for polarizing the views of those who see it. It is said that the film is reactionary and unequivocally represents that conservatism and war are at the root of America's social problems. While these criticisms may be valid, it is important to consider that the film is working on a fictional and metaphorical level, and perhaps it is the realism that the film constructs so cleverly that it encourages such heated opinion about its content. In fact, the most important theme of films is the problem of polarization itself. The "conservative" judges and the brutal law-enforcement agents are on one side and the condemned "liberals" are clearly on the other, with no concessions made on either side. This seems to be what the movie is really about. The new law and the park itself are the result of a situation in which mediation between the two political positions was lost. <br /> <br /> Made during and in protest against the Vietnam War and the treatment of those who opposed the war in the United States, the main themes of government persecution of its own citizens and the conservatism that affects civil liberties still reach the same level in the patriotic era and in the identity card. It also comes in a disturbing tone with the Guantanamo Bay news stories and the treatment of Iraqi prisoners in the hands of allied forces. <br /> <br /> The threat of internal "terrorism" is such a volatile issue that the film can not fail. to connect with current attitudes to the subject. Not surprisingly, the film had a history of checkered distribution, being marginalized to the extreme due to its content, but the disturbing fact that this movie is still so relevant today suggests that waiting was not for nothing. Punishment Park is a film that had to fight to be seen anywhere and demands your attention.
