I saw the 2 hour version of Choker Bali. I can not say it's over. The film has a certain natural rhythm and does not seem to be left behind at any time. The costumes and scenery remind us of what we would see in old movies. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai did a good job of acting. In fact, it's a mature role, with enough space to act within history. The script also bears the story very well. Aishwarys acts like the unfortunate widow whose husband dies in the first year of the marriage. The film is about the passions and desires of such a character and the conflict she faces with the oppressed condition of the widows in those times. <br /> <br /> Your best friend in this film is played by Raima Sen has also been well manipulated. His innocence and admiration for Aishwarya's ability to speak English and act politely were well done. These are indeed some of the prevailing mentalities of those times. We can see how far we have come from such an era! <br /> <br /> The film speaks of the liberation of women as a subtle line of history. I found the development of the story very similar to Ghare Bahire also written by Tagore. It acts to some extent in the struggle for independence and contrasts India's struggle for independence against the silent struggle for women's rights. <br /> <br /> A well made movie that definitely deserves to be seen. Aishwarya performance: par excellence. Rituparna dealt with the story very carefully. Another classic by Rabindranath Tagore.
