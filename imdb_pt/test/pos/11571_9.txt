It is now 2005 and 15+ years since this cartoon first aired. I have not watched it seriously or up close in about 10 years. Now that I'm an adult in my 30's I can look back with a serious look as I watch the episodes again. <br /> <br /> In concept, the drawing is partly a tribute to the classic Looney Tunes, but also own original show. There are a few episodes that are structured like the old cartoons. For example, there's a singer who attacks Buster and so he takes revenge on that singer's show - just like the Bugs Bunny cartoon. The cartoon that follows is similar to Looney Tunes, just in a different era. If you look at the old Looney Tunes, they did a lot of things exactly like the Tiny Toons did. The old Looney Tunes did a lot of social commentary and parody. There were imitations of celebrities. There were lots of jokes, slang, and period dialogues. The comedy was surreal and crazy. You can say this exactly to Tiny Toons as well. The comedy style is "spiritually" the same. Most definitely, a throwback to the classics that had not been well done (if they did) in cartoons in the decades preceding this program. We recognize the cultural references in Tiny Toons and we can roll our eyes when something we do not like appears. But the reason we do not think Looney Tunes is tacky is because we were not alive in the 1940s. In addition, Looney Tunes was original at the time, but today the cartoons are repeated over and over again. So it's easy to see Tiny Toons in an unfair light because of our exposure to current events and our over-exposure to cartoons in general. <br /> <br /> Certainly there are differences in many ways - the timing, the delivery and obviously the duration of the shows. They are two different styles from two different periods being made in two very different circumstances - Looney Tunes being made for adults in theaters and Tiny Toons being made for kids watching TV. Even so, they did a good job doing an original show with original gags and still paying homage and standards after the comedy styles of old Looney Tunes. <br /> <br /> Since Tiny Toons had much more time to play with them, they had some genuine moments of great animated inspiration. You only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, the Plucky baby bathroom episode .. there are many more. For example, one of the best animated comedy dialogues ever to come is in Thirteen Something, when Babs and Buster are on the phone in a split screen, hoping that each one will lose the other. The lack of communication is spectacular. Notably, the development of the character in this episode and in several others (usually those written by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is quite good. The female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, which is unusual, considering the contrary, is generally true for the drawings of this period. <br /> <br /> This was the first modern drawing that had a lot of referential pop culture and self-sufficiency. referential humor. That was far ahead of his time. Tiny Toons has really opened a door for writers to take on the comic freedoms that are so common in cartoons today, instead of doing the boring crap we face as children of the 1980s. Yes, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons turned away from all this. It was a breath of fresh air. Bakshi's New Mighty Mouse Adventures may have been a forerunner, but Tiny Toons made this surreal style of comic book comic writing a real success. <br /> <br /> As a kid, I totally neglected some jokes. For example, one episode is a tribute to the Marx Brothers whom I completely ignored as a teenager. Now I have a new respect for it. There are so many inspired jokes I have never noticed that they are genuinely brilliant. It's this kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I've never noticed this kind of comedy as a kid. I've been thinking this for most of the episodes I've watched recently. <br /> <br /> You would notice this kind of thing if you actually watched the program. Unlike some other critics here that I know they are judging unfairly, I have seen all the episodes and thought about them completely, exposed both as a child and as an adult. <br /> <br /> You can say that there was a lot of care with the dubbing too. I'm not just talking about the main characters, but the secondary characters have also done very well and creatively. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. Tress MacNeille had, in my opinion, her best performances in this cartoon. She has not been the same since. Rob Paulsen also did some amazing things here too. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the show has not had some bad episodes. Had a lot. It also had many mediocre ones. But by far, it certainly had many genuinely funny episodes. Especially when it was aired for the first time was really funny to watch. <br /> <br /> Out of 10 I give the show an 8.5 - and compliments to push the envelope and break the doors that lead to a new era of cartoons.
