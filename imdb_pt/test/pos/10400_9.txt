Like many horror fans out there who sought out the next big scare, we looted the Asian terror market for anything we could get our hands on, leaving no dark haired ghost lady aside. We had good reasons to do so, the Asian market had generated such wondrous wonders as Ringu, Dark Waters, Juon - the Grudge, and a Tale of Two Sisters. By the time Takashi Miike started pulling out the One Missed Call in 2003, the market seemed to be drying up, leaving it open for scorn and scorn, despite the continuing Hollywood Remake Machine at full throttle. Now, do not misunderstand me, there are still many good Asian horrors being made, such as Marebito and Shutter, to mention just two, who will be minor classics some day. But the straight-haired ghost lady had definitely fed her at the party, and it was time to take that drunken bum home to bed! Then comes a movie like Noroi - The Curse. A movie that is clever enough to pay a subtle tribute to its roots, but throws the rulebook out the window as it does. What I am about to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new here. The film is a documentary about one of Japan's leading paranormal investigators, as they receive stories and hints about ghostly events. He begins investigating the claims of a woman that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door, but there is no baby there, plus a middle-aged woman and her child. These two disappear sharp when the reporter puts his nose around, but strange other coincidences begin to emerge. A young psychic, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a very young actress who had a strange vision, many dead pigeons and a very sinister demon named Kagutaba, leading to a truly terrifying confrontation in a small historical city. <br /> <br /> Saying more about the plot can ruin the fun a bit. The film is filmed in the form of 'fake documentary' and incorporates footage from TV shows and reports, and labels via subtitles allow you to know where you stand in terms of the timeline. The film attracted more than a few comparisons to the Blair Witch Project, but beyond the film format and the chilling late-night road trip, the comparison actually ends there. <br /> <br /> What is refreshing about Noroi is how this does not favor the modern horror public. If you're expecting croaky ghosts ladies to come out of the attic, look elsewhere. The strength of the film lies in its slow and gradual accumulation of terror, a terror so deep it will stay with you for days after watching it. The climax is pretty damn weird, but when you think the movie is over, you're treated to the 'real' ending when the credits start rolling, and sweet and sweet, it's a killer. In terms of acting, it is mostly convincing. You get some "comedy" relief from the crazy clairvoyant, covered in tin sheets, but it soon dries in the middle of the movie. The film also has a slightly more 'nasty' feel than a lot of Asian ghosts, as there are a lot of violence in some of the events. <br /> <br /> In general, Noroi is one of those who watch by their own, late at night. Since my first appearance of Ringu, ten years ago, I was so deliciously scared watching a horror movie. It's the one that will itch on you until it's too late, so it's under your skin. Just let yourself go to this completely. And not a ghost lady with her hair wide open? No wonder it was released outside of Japan, let alone have an American remake lined up yet. Check out this, if you can, essential preview in my books!
