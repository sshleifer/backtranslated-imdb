Despite the fact that there were aspects of this film that I thought were not developed enough, I liked it and would recommend it to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are great in their lead roles. The basic premise of the film is that they were both in the wake of broken marriages when they meet. Both, too, are seeking healing. Unexpectedly, they discover they can help heal one another. There were aspects of the film that I wish I had seen more - where simple flashes only suggested themes that my mind had to fill in the blanks, such as apologizing to the bereaved widower, and how Adrienne no longer feels guilty for sleeping with Paul to feel good about it soon after. An opportunity for a tremendous love scene was lost when it was simply suggested that they would make love with the arrival of the hurricane. But in the end, the film made me deeply apprehensive about the relationship that my wife and I shared. And there were moments that brought me to the edge of tears. So I have to say it's worth seeing.
