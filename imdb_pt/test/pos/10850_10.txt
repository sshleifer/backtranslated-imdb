I love this movie. I watched it several times when I rented on Netflix. He had a lot of substance and meaning to me. I think a lot of people will like this. I have read and seen many lesbian stories over the years and I am happy to say that they are getting better at how they are presented. They tend to have a more positive lifestyle impression. and feeling gay women. It's nice to see two women meet and be as happy as the others in this society. I think it's clear that more and more films with this theme will grace our theaters and TV screens. Many producers and directors are realizing that lesbians live a full and healthy life and that we have wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals and families without hesitation.
