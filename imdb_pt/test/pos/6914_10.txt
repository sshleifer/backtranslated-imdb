This is speculation. This movie could inspire Paramount Pictures to film the movie The Core. Both films have something in common nature. The only improvement for Hell is a better cast. The cast of Hell is still good. Excellent 8 out of 10 movie. Worth seeing. This movie has truth for it the heat waves are real. Another part of the truth is lack of energy related to heat. Where I live I actually heard the transformers blow. The flurry of heat is possible because people who want to freshen up can get rowdy. There is a considerable amount of teamwork in this film. Again, this movie is worth watching. The film has a good cast. The movie does not have slow points.
