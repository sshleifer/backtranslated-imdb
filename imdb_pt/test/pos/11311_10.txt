Julie Brown hilariously destroys Madonna's attempt at a documentary with raucous humor and truly original and captivating songs that rival Madonna's. Cinematography and sets are top notch. <br /> <br /> Kathy Griffin and Chris Elliott offer their own comedic injections that enhance and complement this movie. The appearances of Bobcat Goldthwait and Wink Martindale, as themselves, are an added bonus. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say whether Brown's performance is insulting or ridiculing Madonna, though I hardly think Material Girl would find humor. <br /> <br /> My favorite phrase: "Why do not you come here (to the Philippines), all they eat is dogs and I'm a vegetarian."
