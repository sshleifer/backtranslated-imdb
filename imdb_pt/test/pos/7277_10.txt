This psychological mystery / suspense is one of the best I have ever seen. All the actors make a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous star at the beginning through the strange events of which she is part. You learn a lot about the real inner emotions of the people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself. The film in film situations at the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" is fascinating. Also Mark Snow's music is possibly the best score I've ever heard. You will not forget this movie!
