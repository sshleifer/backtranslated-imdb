This pleasant French film tells of a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an African island near Madagascar named Louis (Jean Paul Belmondo). He is a single man looking for wife, so he announces a bride and receives a beautiful woman named Julia (Catherine Deneuve). When it appears spontaneously, it is much more attractive than expected. He marries Julia, but she suddenly disappears. A private Frenchman with eyes (Michael Bouquet) is hired by Julia's sister and soon he is in the wake of his previous wife. Later, Louis finds her in a dance hall under another name. Despite the romantic illusion and everything, Louis fell in love with his enigmatic wife. <br /> <br /> This movie is a splendid drama, filled with treason, deception, murder, theft and hitchcockian suspense. Good performances by Jean Paul Belmondo as a young owner of a cigarette company who seems determined to fall under the spell of a femme fatale and a wonderful Catherine Deneuve as a suspected heroine. The film received several references to American cinema, but Truffaut (400 strokes) was a fervent spectator such as: Johnny Guitar, Colorado Jim, Bogart and Hitchcock. The American version has been cut in several minutes and deserves an urgent restoration and remastering. Vaguely based on the novel entitled 'Waltz in darkness' by Cornell Woolrich (Rear Window and Alfred Hitchcock's hour writer) which was also adapted into 'Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black'. Denys Clerval (stolen kisses) colorful cinematography and atmospheric soundtrack by Antoine Duhamel, habitual musician of Truffaut. This is one of the best of her suspense movies along with ¨Fenheim 451 and Shoot the piano player¨. Remade for a lower version of Michael Christofer (2001) with Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie and Jack Thompson, full of erotic and lustful scenes.
