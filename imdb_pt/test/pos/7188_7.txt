The above line sums it up nicely. The best features of comics are visual jokes and word jokes (the latter are almost impossible to translate, which is why comics are at their best in their original language). <br /> <br /> It's very hard to capture in the movie, and that's why they will never be as good as the comics. Movies are simply a different medium than comics. With that in mind, this movie does surprisingly well in capturing the comic book fun. <br /> <br /> The word gags is bearable and sometimes even funny (Debouze makes a reference to Amelie!). I have to mention that I watched the French version. If you do not watch the French version or your lack of understanding of the French language limit you to subtitles, the word jokes will probably be bad. <br /> <br /> The comedy is fine too; It's a very simple way of humor, and it's not very funny when you're over twelve, but it captures the spirit of comics. The other visual jokes are the saving grace of the film for the older audience, as they are often quite funny. <br /> <br /> The acting is totally exaggerated, but again, this is not annoying, as it captures the spirit of the comics. Only Depardieu and Clavier really do not exaggerate, which may be the reason some people think they did not like their roles (I did not notice anything). On the other hand, Jamel Debouze and especially Claude Rich transform the exaggerated into an art form. It's really fun to watch. Again, I'm afraid it's not so funny when the voices are dubbed. <br /> <br /> Overall it's not a bad movie, much better than the previous one. It's not a classic and does not dethrone The Twelve Tasks of Asterix as my favorite Asterix movie, but it's still worth seeing. The French version, that is. 7/10
