Hello, Rainbow Brite .. the name is just hard to take seriously, as if she could be the cousin of Strawberry Shortcake .. but when you are a kid, this is definitely something serious. <br /> <br /> So there's this vile, sulky and spoiled girl and she wants the Rainbow Brites belt, among other things, that is, the light of the whole universe, and Rainbow Brite and her friend Cris are determined to stop it. As far as I can remember, Murky and Lurky played a minor role in this production. Maybe they wanted lots of money? <br /> <br /> So, anyway, the evil and evil girl has a powerful jewel and she channels her power to get the Rainbow belt ... imagine? But somehow, Rainbow takes her belt back and re-energizes with "star spray" and kicks the bad girls ass with the help of Cris and her prism bracelet, and they also save the whole universe in the process. So good triumphs over evil, kindness triumphs over rudeness, and Rainbow Brite and the Color Kids are once again sure to spread color and joy to all mankind.
