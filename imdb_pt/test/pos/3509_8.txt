The VHS cover says it all: "Undoubtedly, the most powerful film of its kind since the Saw Massacre." I'm a big fan of 70 and 80 slashers and I have to say, I agree 100%. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the ranger). There is the distorted atmosphere that only TCM has, an impressive soundtrack to reflect the thrills and the shooting sites that are the most beautiful in the history of terror. This has to be one of the most beautifully shot horror movies ever! Jeff Lieberman as the director of this 1981 low-budget film and great work and with his other works (Blue Sunshine, Wrong Turn), he must be one of the most underrated directors in the film industry today.
