I just went to see this movie because I always liked Kevin Costner. I felt that Ashton did a great job on the Butterfly Effect. Unfortunately, even if these two actors were / are capable of good moments, if not great moments of acting, some of them were missing here. Some of the scenes were simply not believable and did not have enough support in the story. Although the film claims Hurricane Katrina's influence, there was very little (none) of that effect in the film. Overall, I liked the fact that the film brought forward a little of what it means to save lives from a water perspective. <br /> <br /> The special effects were very good and more than intimidating. I'm not sure if I'm going to fish on the bottom of the sea again ... <br /> <br /> I expected a little more excitement in the movie than what was presented. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie that could 'I've been seen on DVD.
