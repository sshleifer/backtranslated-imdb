When THE CHINA SYNDROME was released, many pro-nuke right-wing critics and supporters criticized this film, especially since its three main stars were known for their liberal politics and open distrust of nuclear power. But it took only two weeks and an almost catastrophic accident on Three Mile Island to silence the critics. <br /> <br /> Fonda and Douglas are the LA news crew who witness a potentially nasty accident at the Ventana nuclear power plant. . Douglas films the event through the soundproof glass of the factory; but the TV station does not air the footage, fearing a massive action. It is therefore up to Fonda and Douglas to discover the truth, despite a massive attempt by factory owners to cover up the accident. <br /> <br /> But a conscientious shift supervisor (Jack Lemmon) has discovered certain flaws in the plant's pump support structure. He believes that these defects were the cause of the accident and that although it is extremely expensive and time consuming, if repairs are not made, the next accident may be apocalyptic. But he can not convince anyone who works with him to believe his story. The result is a nightmarish climax that unites several histories of political, technological and human interest in a disturbing package. While obviously politically liberal in nature, THE CHINA SYNDROME, well directed and co-written by James Bridges (THE CHASE PAPER), is also fundamentally a message film about the inherent dangers of joining technology and energy nuclear. Fundamentally, nuclear energy can NEVER be safe because people can NEVER be perfect. That's what the movie is saying; and in a very entertaining and suspenseful way, says it brilliantly.
