Ahhh ... the 1980s. 1982 reminds me of the really crazy time we were experiencing in America. Fresh off the "do what's good" 70's, "The Last American Virgin" comes as a wolf in sheep's clothing as another "teenage sex comedy" of glory days. Oh sure, there's sex, but, I can not think of another movie - OK, this and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" - it really was not killing time between topless teenage scenes - there were some pretty good things in here between the cleavage. <br /> <br /> The film follows three hormonal friends. Gary (wanting to lose his virginity), Rick (red carnation) and David (overweight but not inexperienced) as they desperately try to make sure Gary joins the world of masculinity. But, a funny thing happens on the way to the kegger - Gary falls in love with Karen (beautiful brunette who loves bad boys), and can not continue any sexual achievements that David and Rick can provide. The only problem is that Rick and Karen get hot and heavy and Karen skips a period. It's Gary who's at her side while she's going to do the abortion, and it's Gary who really cares. But who is Karen dancing at the end of the movie ... Rick. Subtract the "R" and add a "D" where you need it. <br /> <br /> What separates this movie from the other 80s we think of is, by God, they try some real drama here, not "my parents just pulled the variety out of the garage." And you know what? I bought. <br /> <br /> He was not sloppy. It was not an exaggeration. And when Gary sees Rick dancing with Karen at the house party at the end of the movie, I really felt sorry for the guy. Our teenager Romeo really believed in unrequited love - and when his heart broke in the end, everything touched me. <br /> <br /> So, with all the T & A apart, there is a really compelling and engaging story. On here. Oscar worthy? Not for a mile, but, I do not know if I would put it in the "let's get it" category, too. Like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," they were really trying to make a real movie here, letting the bad luck get in between the places where it might be.
