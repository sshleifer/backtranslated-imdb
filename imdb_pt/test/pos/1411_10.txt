The theme song often goes through my head after all these years. I've never been much of a TV observer, probably because I was entering my teens when my family bought our first set in 1948 and it never became part of my life. But since the first episode of Lawman I've been hooked, and it's the only TV show I've ever scored in my week. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, credible, well-written and well-represented, and John Russell is still to me the most handsome man I have ever seen. (Peter Brown was no dog, or: o) <br /> <br /> I agree that it is one of the most underrated TV series of all time. I hope to find some episodes for my grandchildren to watch.
