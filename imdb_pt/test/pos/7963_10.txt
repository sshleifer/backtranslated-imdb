How many times do we live our romantic life as on the big screen, with torrid affairs and passionate encounters? Almost never, if what I see as normal life around me is something to judge. Novels, as said before, are hardly matters that make you stand on top of the world or hurt and bruised. <br /> <br /> The novel, in its everyday form, has lived millions of times around the world. world is a slow, subtle and silent subject. Something that grows in you, very slowly, probably without you noticing it slowly taking over your being. No one can tell me when I'm in love. For if anyone did, I would not believe him anyway, for no one but me would know. And yet it is just a feeling, a certain knowledge that you are feeling this exhilarating emotion. That you do not want anything beyond the best for someone, that you would never want to see them suffer a moment of sadness. That you are willing to have a great deal of pain for them. I would not go so far as to say that I am willing to die for your beloved, for we are all human, and we do not know what we are capable of before death until that moment is upon us. <br /> <br /> Is the love between the main characters of the film, ever so subtle and discreet, no less noble than between Romeo and Juliet? Undeclared emotions, unsaid feelings, convey much more than any repeated cries of "I love you." The restraint shown by the lead actor, so poignantly displayed in the scene in which he observes his love interest through the window of the cafe, but never moved to make himself known to her, was simply distressing to watch. Would most of us be altruistic enough to remain hidden, knowing that their emotions and feelings could not be reciprocated? <br /> <br /> On another note, how am I going to deal with my own death? Although I may claim that I am seriously ill, I can not say in all honesty that I have ever near death. Will I be so calm, putting all my affairs in order and leaving instructions for others to accept what I leave behind? I suspect that I will be calm, because I will have little choice in the matter. Can I be so selfless? Again, the answer will have to be negative. I can empathize with anguish, knowing that your life is lost, that fate has struck you a fatal blow, and that future events, no matter what remains of them, are no longer under your control. <br /> <br /> Life is nothing more than a series of small events whose culmination may seem great to some in retrospect. But only very rarely.
