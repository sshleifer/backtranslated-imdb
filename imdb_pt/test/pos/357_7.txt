I would have to strongly disagree with the previous review. I watched this not expecting much of it. The fact is that the cast was superb, especially the protagonist Teen Female. The dark sides of them all came, all were confused in an unobvious way. There was an underlying current that ran through the film of teenage anguish and sexuality. The role of the serial killer was played well too as you could feel that he had gone through what they had as children. What this movie is, it's a strong drama / suspense. Yes, I would agree that they do not make the obvious, but you could relate to confusing teenage heads that they did what they did and it is believable. Also a decent dark end, instead of it could have been so easily a happy opt out. The attention to detail in the movie was also fantastic. I'm pretty good, solid 7 out of 10. A bit slow at times, but it lets a thinking person see where the characters are coming from.
