Now here's a movie that does something that has not been done in a long time. It takes ten or more different elements with which we are already familiar (Vampires, martial arts, a techno beat, top-o-the-line special effects, etc.), and turn it into something that looks brand new. In what could simply be a combination of "Mortal Kombat" and "Buffy: The Vampire Slayer," Wesley Snipes (who has not been my favorite ever since and mostly because of "Passenger 57") gives a great twist as the human milieu / half leech. He recognizes internal conflict, but does not take more than necessary. He makes Blade as deep a character as Michael Keaton did Batman. <br /> <br /> I will say that the only part of the movie that left me a little annoyed was the ever present clich√© of that person's horror movie that the hero comes to know who knows exactly how to stop the villain. On the other hand, you kind of have to have this in a movie like this, so it's easily excusable. <br /> <br /> Well, Snipes is good. And Steven Dorff, thrilled with the previews, makes a bad bad more than enough for Snipes' hero. He has class, presence and enough control in his little finger to teach Al Pacino to tone down a bit. Who would have thought a comic book movie would be a launch pad for an actor? I sincerely hope it is. And whoa! where the hell did Kris Kristofferson gain acting talent? Do not get me wrong, but the prolific actor has not made anything memorable since "Millennium," and how many of us watch this just because of the legal video box? Well, here he is, folks, in a very obi-wanish turn, as mentor and Blade's father figure. And good work too. <br /> <br /> The quality of performance is matched by the quality of choreography and special effects. Accompanied by a pulsating techno beat, the fight scenes bring back and quickly banish the memories of Mortal Kombat. Hey! I also had a script! I was wondering what had happened to all the good writers out there. <br /> <br /> The two main indications to me that I saw a quality film were these; I did not feel remorse for paying the full price to enter, either Schumacher "Batman", "The Avengers", "MK: Annihilation", "Godzilla" or "Armageddon". (wow, how many of those came out this year? Ugh) Also, I'm looking forward to the inevitable sequel to the end of the movie. Let's just hope they do a job as good as the first. <br /> <br />
