Walter Matthau is best remembered for his long comedy series with his comedy partner Jack Lemmon from THE FORTUNE COOKIE for ODD COUPLE II. But people tend to forget that in the late 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films - a partner. This was Glenda Jackson, the Oscar-winning duo, who demonstrated her comedic abilities against Matthau's first in HOUSE CALLS and then HOPSCOTCH. Matthau's role was a bit bigger in both films because his characters were more central to the plot, but the chemistry between them was very good. If you want to see two professionals demonstrating how sex can be madly funny, watch Walter and Glenda as Dr. Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson experimenting to see if two people could have sex in a bed under the old two- parties. each with one leg on the floor! Never was sex seen from a clinical and mechanical point of view. <br /> <br /> Charlie de Matthau has just been widowed before the movie starts. He only had one woman in his life - his wife. So now he's the eligible bachelor. He is also the chief surgeon in the hospital where he works, but the chief surgeon is Dr. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney). Carney is apparently senile (there are moments later in the movie that shows that he turns on and off his senility - see the scene in which he beats Richard Benjamin's car). Amos is ready for re-election (Charlie is his closest competitor to the post - if he wants to). However, Amos manages to persuade Charlie to let him keep his job for reasons of self-esteem. <br /> <br /> One day Charlie notices Ann in the hospital. She suffered a minor accident and is resting on the bed, but Amos placed her on a cage-like device (which Charlie notes has not been used since 1920). He takes her off the phone and is soon dating her. She joins the hospital staff, but is critical of Charlie's willingness to meet Amos, and is critical of certain selfish tendencies he sees among hospital doctors. <br /> <br /> Death of a wealthy hospital patron (Lloyd Gough), who owned a baseball team (his biggest innovation being separate admission costs for double headers). Amos tries to calm the young widow of the owner of the team, delivering the compliment to the funeral service (the line in the above summary is the line of peroration of the praise). However, she is still determined to sue (her attorney Thayer David says the hospital is the most incompetent she has ever seen). So Amos suggests that Charlie novel the widow to satisfy her from this expensive process. But how will Ann respond to this? The film is a lot of fun, and was so successful that in addition to causing a sequel to Jackson and Matthau, led to a television series as well.
