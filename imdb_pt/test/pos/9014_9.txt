Although I have understood that this show is very strange to please everyone, I do not understand where all these bad reviews come from, and I am more surprised by the bad reviews that were obtained from movie fans. I liked it and got addicted to it from the first episode I watched. It's a bit confusing, though, that Kuzco was put in school. And it seems to be high school instead of college. But I think he's only eighteen, right, so it's not like he's too old to be polite? And has royalty never had to get the best education available to them? So the thing "Kuzco has to graduate, or he will not become emperor" does not seem too strange to me. And I think his education was neglected before, so that's why he has to be educated now.
