I totally disagree with the person who first commented on this movie. To me, this plot is about a man with growth hormone disorder trying his best to look for the love he is yearning for. Trying his best to fit into society he did not seem to accept it. <br /> <br /> He then met someone who treats him with the love of best friend and was shown the way to receive the love that he always wanted to have. the man who created all that happiness returned received something important from the giant, which is the love of the family and the spouse. <br /> <br /> And comedy is just part of making the audience feel some laughing bugs in a certain part of the world. the shows. <br /> <br /> And I must admit, it made me rip a little.
