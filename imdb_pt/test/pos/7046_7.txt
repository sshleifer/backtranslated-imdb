I rarely bother watching comedy or television movies these days. They are insipid, vulgar, and, most importantly, not funny. This could be seen as a refreshing blast from the past. It's worth watching, and I do not think it's dated in any meaningful way. Classic humor is classic humor, and good writing is good writing, regardless of the time when you created it. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this movie again; came to mind after having seen the "Summer School" a bit similar on television recently. Like that slightly younger movie, "Meatballs" is funny without being cruel, overly sexual or indulging in the mood of the bathroom. The key, of course, is how the adult character makes such a difference in the teenage character's life - maybe even a life-saving change - and how they both grow in the space of a summer.
