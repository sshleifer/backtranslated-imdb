She is the man was all I wanted it to be and maybe even a little more. I love the teen type "chick flick" movies and I knew this would be great! In the same line of 10 things I hate about you (one of my favorites) She's Man is a single, well written, very well executed comedy with some of the funniest lines and physical comedy I've seen in a long time. It's probably the funniest film I've seen this year (with the exception of the hilarious Pink Panther). But She's The Man is actually more intellectual and most of the humor is based on the witty script of "Three's Company." wrong identities, confusing messages, and cast. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is a star !! Even from the days of the horribly extravagant (yet strangely entertaining "The Amanda Show"), she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy.It is probably one of the most talented comedies out there.His style of physical comedy, her debut on the big screen (where she was the star) was rather hilarious and well done "What a girl wants." If this was not her vehicle leave than she is the man takes care of that hands down. Sorry she does not do more work on the big screen because she could be the next girl "She" She is All American, cute, with her feet on the floor, bubbly teenager (although she is 20 now) and if she will be able to her talent and style to be an adult actor, will still be seen, but for the purpose of this film she is perfect !! She actually legitimately gets the rather strange storyline of her imitating her twin and makes it believable. but it is quite believable. Most of the script is based on the comedy of its mistakes trying to be a guy, but it's just hilarious, non-stop laughs. Channing Tatum redeems himself from his deplorable 2005 "Havoc" performance by Duke. He is the athlete, the captain of the football team and eventually the object of affection of Bynes, unfortunately he is also Sebastian's roommate (who is Bynes). He is a good leader, and the chemistry is perfect between them. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who happens to be attracted to Sebastian (who is also Bynes). She also does well, although her part is small and she does not affect the rest of the cast in one form or another. James Kirk is great in his small role as the real Sebastian. Their resemblance to Amanda Bynes is amazing ... they are absolutely believable as twins and even more, by far, you could understand someone believing that Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the cast fits somewhere and their roles range from brief to more supportive, but essentially they are all supporting the story between Bynes and Tatum, but everyone is more or less supporting Bynes' great performance. She easily carries the film without hesitation and makes it worthwhile. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that shows so much in the trailer and is still not one of those movies that when that part shows up is no longer funny. The parts of the trailer that make you laugh are even more hilarious in the movie. Newcomer director Andy Fickman does an incredible job in this film. It interweaves a potentially complicated plot and causes it to flow naturally and make everything fall together. The story is loosely based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, but it's remarkable how much they managed to translate for this modern movie. It's apparently completely off the wall, but more accurate for the classic comedy than you think. There is not much to say about a downside except that the last half hour crawls a bit and also becomes a predictable possibility, but that does not change the hilarity of the first half of the movie. However, you will laugh at tears and it is one of the funniest movies in the theater right now! 9/10
