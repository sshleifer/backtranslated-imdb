Jackass Number Two is easily the most hilarious movie of 2006, beating the also hilarious Clerks II. It is one of the best recent memory sequences, beating Jackass The Movie in every way. Now, this movie may be the funniest, but it's also the most offensive, scary, and utterly disgusting. You will feel sick several times during the movie. I'm dead serious when I tell you not to eat anything before watching or during this movie, because it's likely that he literally comes back to haunt you. Keep the drink to a minimum as well. You have been warned, because, just as the slogan says, it will make you beg for mercy. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two follows the crazy Jackass series, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan. Dunn, Steve-O, Chris 'Party Boy' Pontius, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey, Dave England, Brandon DiCamillo and Jason 'Wee Man' Acuna (Chris 'Raab Himself' Raab is missing) as they perform the most outrageous life, - threatening and revolting acrobatics imaginable. I will not tell you what the acrobatics are, but I will warn you that any scene with an animal will be disgusting or psychologically scary, and that a cast member (again, not saying) will flirt with death several times at What makes it the Jackass Number Two so fun are not the stunts themselves, but how the cast reacts to them and do them. For simplicity, if they loved doing it and had fun, so would you (99% of stunts). All acrobatics are very original and 90% of them are never seen before. You will witness some recycled but they are excited. You would not think of actually targeting factors in a movie like this, but it does; The direction of Jeff Tremaine makes the film a lot funnier because he provides guidance to the gang in his comic timing, which is simply brilliant from him. He could have just sat and slept during filming (actually you'll see in the movie that he slept during some filming), but he went there and helped these crazy guys make the stunts as funny as possible. I give Mr. Tremaine a couple of thumbs for that. Another great thing about Jackass is his abundance of celebrity appearances, and this time include BMX legend Mat Hoffman, skate god Tony Hawk, director / actor Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers & Beerfest), actor Luke Wilson, star of the Miami Dolphins, Jason Taylor director / actor Mike Judge (Office Space). The scenes with Hoffman, Taylor and Chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film, as it is even funnier to see these men as part of the film. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two is one of the most politically incorrect. Morally degrading and simply wrong films of all time, if not the most. Nevertheless, it is so original and so hilarious that you will not mind. You'll be gasping for air, laughing so hard you'll cry and jump out of the chair laughing all through the movie. Due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film, anyone under the age of 18 should watch this movie. You have been warned. I hope you enjoy Jackass Number Two as much as I liked it. <br /> <br /> 10/10 --spy
