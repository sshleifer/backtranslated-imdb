I've always liked this movie, I've seen it so many times but I've always liked it :) The story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I do not think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what it was: P They do not look that way in Romania ... Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played a lot good. well, but as someone said before me, your English needs to improve. <br /> <br /> And there were some funny moments and some tragic / sad parts too. Worth seeing, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love. I recommended it to all of you. Not the best movie ever, but it was cool!
