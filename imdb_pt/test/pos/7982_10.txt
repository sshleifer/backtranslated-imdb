Any fan of Batman will know how good the movies are, they have been a great success. Batman Returns, however, is by far the best film in the series. A combination of excellent steering, brilliant acting and settings makes this a worthy watch in one night. Tim Burton, who directed this film, specifically made sure that this film provided a realistic atmosphere and that it was ready. a great job. Danny Devito (penguin man) is a man who inherited penguin characteristics as a baby, and grew to become a horrible and ugly thing! Michelle Pfiffer plays the elegant and seductive "Catwoman" after the cats gave her genes to be bitten. The result in both character changes is excellent and both the Catwoman and Penguin man play a very important role in this great film. The mysterious Catwoman is very entertaining to watch - her classic sayings and a funny part in which jumps with her whip in a jewelry store adds so much fun to the movie. Danny Devito also does well, his ability to represent a strange creature was vital, and it adds a great atmosphere to the movie that takes us back to the boring sewers where he lives. <br /> <br /> You can not forget Batman though. Micheal Keaton once again pulls in a comfortable performance, and shows us a different side of Batman. His affection is released when he confronts Catwoman at the end of the movie, and his encounters with her when she is a normal person, Selina Kyle, result in him being seduced badly in his own home. There's a smart part after that when they leave, and the movie is full of great scenes. It is worth noting that Batman's Bruce Wayne phone is not used as much as in other Batman movies, as close combat scenes and stories that make up this film. <br /> <br /> The winter scenery is created perfectly in Gotham City with most scenes going on at night and the city is full of snow. So if you watch this movie over the summer as I have it, it does not look the same. Better watch during the winter. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's an amazing movie. All the credit goes to Tom Burton and the cast, they did an incredible job.
