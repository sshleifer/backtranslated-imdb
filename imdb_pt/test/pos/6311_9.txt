Okay, I'm Italian, but there are not as many Italian films as this. I think the plot is pretty good for 3/4 of the movie, but the ending is very simple, too predictable. But that's the only small mistake. The Consequences of Love, in my opinion, have great sequences in particular in the beginning and a great soundtrack. I would very much like the lighting work. The best thing is an excellent actor. You know, if your name were Al Pacino now everyone would still be talking about this performance. But it's just a great Italian theater actor named Toni Servillo. Yes, someone tells me this movie and this kind of performance is very slow, it's so annoying, so many silences, but I think this component is fantastic, it's the right way to describe the love story between a very talented girl, the granddaughter of the Italian actress Anna Magnani, Olivia and of the old and mysterious man Toni. One of my favorite Italian films.
