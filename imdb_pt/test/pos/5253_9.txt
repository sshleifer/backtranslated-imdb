I had my son for the weekend and my parents called me and said they wanted us both to meet them at the movies. When I got there, my mom said that she really wanted to see "The Women" and asked if my son and I cared about him being labeled as a girl movie. I reluctantly woke up thinking this would be another "First Wives Club" movie. I have to say that I was very surprised to see myself enjoying the film a lot from the opening scene to the credits. It was a great production and the cast was perfect in their roles. My son and I found ourselves laughing all through the movie and we're glad we saw it. He made a great movie on Saturday afternoon and I recommend it to anyone, man or woman.
