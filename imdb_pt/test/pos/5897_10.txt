Very happy to see that this great movie gets such high ratings from IMDB users. The best years of their lives remain the best cinematic statement about the veterans who returned from the war I encountered. Easily the best performance by the often overlooked Frederick March. In fact, the entire cast shines, including the legend of music Hoagy Carmichael, who treats us with a subtle version of his classic Lazy River. I would recommend this great movie to anyone who loves movies.
