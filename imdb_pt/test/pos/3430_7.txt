This solid black-and-white slapstick comedy with a gloomy (but impossibly-planned) plot is a real treat for everyone that will make you howl with laughter (as well as roll your eyes in disbelief). <br /> <br /> It's the old psycho in a train history, but that's not of major importance, as the suspense part of the film almost seems to be just a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian Robert Gustafsson. His unfortunate, almost incurable, optimist soldier invokes compassion and schadenfreude in a way that almost rivals Chevy Chase. The thing about the movie that attracted me the most, however, is that between the improbable and the hilarious are the daily joys and annoyances of the train portrayed accurately. They add a very welcome feeling of realism and recognition. <br /> <br /> This police comedy admitted to borrowing most of its "suspense" from Hitchcock and should, in my opinion, only be noted for its comedy value (which is actually high). In addition to Gustafsson, Lars Amble's solid performance as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission alone. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend it.
