This film tells about the real life story of Ramon Sampedro, who lived for 27 years lying in bed after having broken his neck, and fights a battle to get legal permission for someone who can help with his death. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem is one of the best actors of his generation. Consider this: he has to carry this movie with only his face! It is unbelievable that he has not even been nominated for an Oscar. Now we can all see that the Academy is a joke! The support cast was great! The optimistic Rosa, her lawyer Julia, the rest of the family ... Everyone has their opinion about the fact that Ramon wants to die. <br /> <br /> If you are against or in favor of euthanasia, your opinions aside because this movie deserves to be seen by people from all over the world! In the middle of the movie I started to cry and did not stop until the credits rolled. This movie is so painful but also wonderful to watch and I can not wait to see it again. I give 9/10 and, in my opinion, it's by far the Best Movie of the Year so far.
