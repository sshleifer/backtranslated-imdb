A sort of guilty indulgence nowadays, this used to be necessary to watch when I was in high school. It's really great lighting of the growing punk scene in Los Angeles in 1980. As bands play, Spheeris prints the lyrics in captions, which is obviously necessary if someone really wants to know what the guy is yelling at the microphone. But it also transforms the camera POV into a tourist, passing through this alien world. The band's interviews reveal an honest approach to music that really does not exist anymore. So again, it's not so easy to find ex-church cabinets for $ 16 / month like Chavez of Black Flag. How many unknown bands do you know that are not trying like the dickens to get a recording contract? These guys just did not care. And who can not love the commentary of the little French guy who used to be the "singer" of the Catholic Discipline (of which Phranc was a member). His brave voice presents one of the best soliloquies ever captured in the film: "I have great news for the world ... there is no New Wave." Ufa! What a relief!
