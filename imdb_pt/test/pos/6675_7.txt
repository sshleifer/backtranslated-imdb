Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a mental hospital patient who claims to be a native of a distant planet called K-PAX. His psychiatrist Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) tries to help him while trying to understand Prot and find out if he's really K-PAX. <br /> <br /> This movie does not really fall into any particular genre. A big part of K-PAX is drama / science fiction, another fantasy part, plus adding a dash of comedy and you get to understand what K-PAX is. The story (as you see above) is not too complicated or deep, but still offers some good plot twists that may still surprise you like they did to me. No special effect or graphics accompany this movie, and there is no need to have them, the music in the movie is great. A techno soundtrack along with a fantastic piano piece makes K-PAX sound science fiction and makes certain intriguing scenes. Kevin Spacey is the heart of the film and plays a very convincing alien (Prot) from the K-PAX Planet, emotional with great facial expressions, Spacey does a great job in the lead role. Jeff Bridges is Dr. Powell, who helps and tries to understand Prot. Bridges is also excellent on your part. Bridges and Spacey fit very well and they should, after all, both had a lot of experience. Dr. Powell's wife is Rachel Powell, played by Mary McCormack. McCormack plays her role well, showing the frustration of having her husband gone and so devoted to her patient. Alfe Woodard plays Dr. Powell's co-worker, Claudia Villars, we do not really see Claudia too much, but overall she performs well. K-PAX is classified as PG-13 by "a string of violent images, and brief language and sensuality", and that covers it. As far as "violent images" are concerned, we do not see much. Some people have a little blood in them, but that's all. The language is as follows: 1 "f" word (wow, only one!), 11 "s" words and some uses of the Lord's name in vain. It's not too bad really. The "sensuality" part is only when Prot explains to Dr. Powell how the reproduction works on K-PAX, nothing terrible, just something about it seems to "have your nuts in an addiction." Not too bad on the content level for a PG-13 movie, it could have been a lot worse. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, K-PAX is not a bad movie. It will not surprise you, but it's fun and fun to watch. It has some funny parts, sad parts, really sad parts and, well, you know what I mean. It's a story of a mental hospital patient, what do you expect? In short, a good rental for those looking for a good drama that you can relax and unwind, the K-PAX is a well made movie. <br /> <br /> Bonus! If you have seen this movie, liked it and are thinking of buying the DVD, I recommend it. It has a lot of extras to look at, and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes. 8/10
