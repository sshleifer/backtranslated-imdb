like this. I was completely in love with this movie. gaga for it, even with all its twists ... but the only thing I found really disturbing was the connection between the two best friends in Tim and Kyle. While the writer of the film has given us such a moving moment between the two, and his sexual experimentation / confusion, does he then give us a twist in the story that makes them half-brothers?!?! (Although the subject is not mentioned in the film ... and left unexplained and unexplained), I just thought it was in bad taste, and the fact that it was not discussed is even worse. (Oops, we've created a taboo ... now we're not going to address the situation, because that would not really be the PC). Otherwise, a spectacular movie
