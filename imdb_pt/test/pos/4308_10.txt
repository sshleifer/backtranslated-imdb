"Müllers Büro" is a film that many watch and enjoy until the end, while others will stop watching it in five minutes. It's a parody of detective movies with every twist and turn; the action happens only at night in the dark corners of a city reminiscent of Batman's Gotham City (watch carefully the streets, buildings, police car chasing criminals, etc.). It's also a parody of musicals with their really funny characters, such as Müller's secretary and Vitasek's lover (the actor who plays Müller's assistant) who do their best to sing, though not very successfully. The spaces occupied by the characters have their own presence in the film, such as the decadent Blue Box (there is a real club with that name in Vienna), where you can see a sailor hitting a girl in the background , Müller's apartment with stained black paint walls and dirty kitchen, Müller's bureau with the sweet image of his assistant, etc. <br /> <br /> The humorous moments of the film are many and include the kind of "flat-face" humor, like Müller's. the face of his assistant, the prostitute charging Müller more for orgasm, the ridiculous clothes of the female bandits of Montana, etc. <br /> <br /> A legendary film from the 80's especially for those interested in Austrian or German-speaking cinema.
