My interpretation is that the term "distant" is used in the opposite sense of "hot"; people who are not warm to others. The film reminds me of the Dalai Lama's teachings in "The Art of Happiness," where his main point is that the key to happiness is connecting with others. Not only are the characters in the movie insular, but they are also humorless, charmless, timid, silent and hostile. These characteristics seem to prevent them, among other things, from forming and enjoying relationships and being able to talk and deal with their problems. And as a result, they are terribly unhappy. I see this as a strong defense of the teaching of the Dalai Lama (I am not a Buddhist, by the way). If you are one of the people who thinks your behavior is a natural response to living in a big city, then I think you may be right, but I highly recommend the Dalai Lama's book. Life in the city does not have to be this way. <br /> <br /> I can see why some people find it annoying - it creeps a little in some places and the characters are not particularly nice. And that contrasts with Lost In Translation, where the island characters are much nicer and connect with each other, even though they do not connect with people in general.
