Bluff has been showing for a few months in Bogota's cinemas, and today I finally got to see him. I really did not know what to expect, but I was very happy surprise. It's a crime comedy of the same line as Snatch etc, and manages to balance suspense elements well with comedy. The style of the film is established early with cheerful music and the Argentine narrator who makes direct asides to the camera - strange the first time, but then fitting in naturally. <br /> <br /> With my Spanish less than perfect, I still find the plot and dialogue easy to follow, and much of the comedy is situational. My Colombian girlfriend was laughing a lot with the various portraits of people from different regions and social classes who passed me a little, but for example a well-made portrait of a pompous idiot in a position of power is funny in any language. <br /> <br /> I think it's to the credit of the movie that it has something of a global flavor: often I did not remember it was the Colombia I was watching. However, it is important to note that many wealthy Bogotans live like some of the characters in this film, and it is not a portrait of Bogota or Colombian society in any way, just a * selective * portrait - as is any film supposedly portraying a situation / culture 'real'. <br /> <br /> I do not know how much of the comedy would be lost in subtitles, but if it's for your country, definitely take a look: it's a very smooth and nice film with great dark humor elements. And all in a 90 minute package.
