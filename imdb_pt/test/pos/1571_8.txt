Having worked professionally with young girls on the run, I found this film surprisingly authentic. I would never have discovered that a friend had not loaned his videotape. There are classic themes here: Reaching the Age of the Sons, Strangeness between Mother and Daughter, The Limited Choices of the Underprivileged, Who is the Good Samaritan, Tragedy is in All Life and the many layers or relationships. Flashbacks are significant (when Alice gets a gun, we know she has some familiarity with how to use it) and does not end in clich√©. The cast really "sells" their roles. It's adult material and the audio is a bit too grainy. Wait 15 minutes to attract him.
